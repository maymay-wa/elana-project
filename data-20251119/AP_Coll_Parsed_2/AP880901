in the year since he lost his legs trying 
to block a trainload of munitions s brian willson has become a 
symbol of inspiration in the movement for peace in central america 
hundreds have been stirred to maintain roundtheclock protests 
at the concord naval weapons station since last sept 1 the day 
the slowmoving navy train under orders not to stop rolled over 
willson as he sat on the tracks the demonstrators surrounded by 
picket signs sleeping bags and american flags stand by as trains 
and trucks carry weapons across port chicago highway which cuts 
through the base 
because of what i chose to do and what the navy chose to do 
im a symbol and that can be used for good i think willson 47 
said this week in an interview at the san franciscobased institute 
for the practice of nonviolence which he founded with his wife 
holly rauen 
the softspoken willson a vietnam veteran born on the fourth of 
july and raised in a conservative politically inactive family in 
ashville ny said hes more convinced than ever of the need to 
campaign for peace and a halt to weapons shipments to central 
american nations 
i dont think it was a mistake and i dont regret what i did 
im sorry the train ran over me and that i lost my legs its a 
drag he said i feel more liberated than ever to speak the 
truth so i dont have any desire or wish to back off he said 
in the past year willson has spoken across the country at the 
scene of the accident 40 miles east of san francisco 
demonstrations prayers rallies and civil disobedience still 
elicit headlines thanks to highprofile protesters such as the 
rev jesse jackson joan baez martin sheen author alice walker 
and peace activist daniel ellsberg 
an ecumenical service will be held at the weapons station 
thursday to mark the anniversary of willsons maiming 
it will be the first time since june 10 that willson has visited 
the spot where he inspires protesters but riles many of the 450 
people in the adjacent town of clyde who have grown weary of the 
sight and sound of demonstrators on their doorstep 
when demonstrators posted a handmade sign reading brian 
made to look like the town sign of clyde across the road from 
the base gates residents were outraged the sign came down after a 
session with a county mediator 
don elam is typical of most townspeople today he complains the 
protest site is an eyesore and demonstrators are leftwing 
radicals who sympathize with communist governments 
the protesters meet with a wide range of responses earlier this 
week 19yearold spaulding brook of vermont was leaning on the 
base fence near a sign reading wage peace when a man drove 
past blared boo through a megaphone and gestured obscenely a 
carload of men yelled go home others driving by flash peace 
signs 
the county has spent about 335000 for patrols of contra costa 
sheriffs deputies who have arrested some 325 people since last 
sept 1 according to sgt doug sizemore 
tired of the marathon protest and concerned about safe 
transportation of explosives across a 200foot intersection the 
navy wants to build a 10 million overpass to takes vehicles over 
the highway said base spokesman dan tikalsky 
while the navy seeks funding from the defense department others 
have turned to the courts 
county prosecutors have failed to convict any protesters 
willson has sued the navy and the crew of the train that refused to 
stop and the crew has countersued 
the northern california chapter of the american civil liberties 
union sued to stop use of a painful choke hold on protesters being 
arrested a federal court rejected a county request for permission 
to remove protesters tables chairs and picket signs from the edge 
of the highway 
so the demonstrators remain suffering occasional attacks with 
eggs bottles and obscenities 
chuck goodmacher of the mount diablo peace center in nearby 
walnut creek which helps coordinate the protests says the local 
antagonism is ironic because in 1986 voters only narrowly 
rejected a measure urging the government to halt arms shipments 
through the county until there was a regional peace settlement in 
central america 
sandy hillard is one of the few locals who have joined the 
protests her car has been painted with swastikas pelted with eggs 
and had its tires flattened 
i wish they protest opponents could get to know us better 
before making a judgment hillard said its unfortunate to 
live in a community with fears of getting your house burned down

she was a waiflike but winsome coquette whose 
delicious romantic romps added a touch of whimsy to the 1950s and 
early 60s today leslie caron the gigi of yesteryear is a 
grandmother whos about to portray the matriarch of fashion coco 
chanel in a tv movie 
shes also written a book of short stories called vengeance 
and a screenplay she describes as a parable of war 
i suppose i have two sides to my nature caron said in an 
interview but im not cute whatever i am cute is not the 
word 
caron retains a place in film history a time when the musical 
embodied the spirit and romance of an era beginning in 1951 with 
gene kelly in an american in paris through daddy longlegs 
with fred astaire in 1955 to 1958s academy awardwinning gigi 
she won the hearts of audiences around the world 
but now more than three decades later at the age of 57 she is 
remembered mainly as americas french gamineinresidence 
while still a teenager caron was plucked from a paris ballet 
by kelly who took her to hollywood where she went under contract 
for mgm 
i was stereotyped after an american in paris she said 
and i think americans a long long time ago decided that i was 
cute a gamine and all those things actually im a very serious 
person 
caron credits much of her artistic bent to the legacy left by 
her americanborn mother a dancer whose own dreams went 
unfulfilled my mother protected me and helped me fulfill my 
wishes but i think they were the expression of her wishes 
her mothers suicide in 1967 stoked her determination and left 
a feeling of unfinished business as she approached 40 she 
took up writing and refuge in paris her hometown 
a word processer sits on a table i her living room caron had 
just returned from the printer with the script of the film she 
wrote and plans to direct 
its a moral tale its about the incapacity of people to get 
along in other words its a parable of war on a family scale 
she said 
the screenplay whose title she refuses to divulge is to be a 
family affair she hopes her children christopher and 
actressdaughter jennifer who has given her a grandchild will 
participate in the project both are the children of her second 
marriage to peter hall director of britains national theater 
caron has been married three times 
she has written what she calls a good part for herself 
meaning neither cute nor guileless i might have been innocent 
and guileless when i was 18 she said but my god the years 
have passed and ive lived quite a lot of drama and the public 
keeps seeing the same films on the television 
in 1984 doubleday and co published a collection of her short 
stories vengeance 
they are sort of brutal she said no cruel is the better 
word i do have a sharp eye and a wicked sense of humor 
as a onetime star still at work caron is finally able to 
stretch herself as an actress in a variety of roles 
for the last 10 years the spectrum of parts im offered just 
swings widely she said 
most recently she portrays chanel in a syndicated tv miniseries 
for the fall season the man who lived at the ritz based on 
the bestselling novel by ae hotchner it is the story of an 
american artist played by perry king caught in wartime paris 
between the resistance and the nazis 
last year caron played the submissive wife of lenin portrayed 
by ben kingsley in the movie the train which recounted the 
exiled lenins journey home to start the russian revolution she 
also appeared in an episode last year on tvs falcon crest 
caron thinks of herself as a survivor 
i remember a rather cruel producer cruel and rude who said 
as she hired me that she so admired brigitte bardot for retiring 
when she was losing her looks caron recalled i think its so 
against everything i believe because so long as there is life 
theres a contribution you can make i think one must not just 
be banking on ones looks

speculation about a coup has 
abounded in recent weeks but interviews with government and 
military officials diplomats and civilian sectors linked to a may 
coup bid suggested president vinicio cerezos administration is 
secure 
the coup talk was exemplified by an aug 17 article on the 
cerezo administrations economic austerity measures in the 
countrys most widely read newspaper prensa libre 
the article headlined cerezos cynical ploy quoted three 
of five congressmen as using the word coup hinting one was 
around the corner 
in our country we suffer from the continuous coup syndrome 
said foreign minister alfonso cabrera referring to the succession 
of military dictatorships that has dominated guatemala during its 
modern history 
cerezo a 46yearold lawyer and christian democrat took office 
in january 1986 heading the first elected civilian administration 
in 16 years 
people here dont yet know how to live in democracy some 
believe that if they dont like a certain measure the government 
should be overthrown some small sectors still think like that 
cabrera said 
on may 11 two columns of troops left their bases and marched 
toward the capital in an effort to seize power but the attempt was 
quashed without a shot six officers were arrested and four more 
disciplined 
cabrera said a few retired military officers and the national 
liberation movement a small rightist party were among 
destablizing elements but he dismissed the threat they might pose 
there is no possibility of a coup he said 
defense minister gen hector gramajo agreed he said rightist 
elements in the agricultural and business sector mounted a 
largescale psychological procoup campaign after tax reform in 
1987 
all they could come up with was may 11 it was a good deal for 
us we weeded out 10 lessthanbrilliant officers we discovered 
and corrected vulnerabilities and were left with a greater capacity 
to confront such eventualities he said 
the army is doing everything possible so that the era of coups 
pertains to the past nonetheless the traditional forces are doing 
everything possible so that it does not 
as of now im winning he said 
guatemalas traditional forces are those that control land 
and business those sectors enjoyed a strong link with the armed 
forces during the decades of military rule 
gramajo said the may coup bid was sponsored by a fascist 
agricultural sector of feudal characteristics 
the national agricultural union groups the nations principal 
landowners edgar alvarado its secretaryeneral denied any 
connection with the may rebellion 
he said the government has had an incoherent economic policy 
since the tax reform which was intended to increase government 
revenues by making evasion more difficult 
the overhaul irked privatesector rightists many of whom 
consider taxation a form of socialism 
private enterprise always tries to pay as little as possible 
the state always tries to take as much as it can said alvarado 
we produce the hard currency others spend it he said 
agricultural exports including coffee cotton bananas and cardamom 
account for about 85 percent of guatemalas approximately 1 
billion in 1987 hard currency earnings 
cerezo recently lifted price controls on basic foodstuffs and 
raised prices of fuel public transport and utilitilities faced 
with growing discontent over the effect on working peoples 
purchasing power he slightly rolled back the fuel price increase 
and decreed a 5centperhour wage raise for the private sector 
private sector employees earn an average of about 50 cents an 
hour 
alvarado said the president is pulling rabbits out of hats 
he has lost credibility he tells each sector something 
different 
the private sector recognizes cerezos achievments during the 
first 18 months of his term inflation which had been running at 
about 35 percent was brought down to about 10 percent the gross 
national product which decreased by 6 percent in 1985 is expected 
to grow by 3 percent to 4 percent this year 
edgar heinemann head of the chamber of commerce and the 
business federation casif said the government is going in ten 
directions at the same time the finance ministry does one thing 
the economy ministry another and the central bank another 
he said that during the first six months of 1987 about 240 
million in private guatemalan capital returned to the country to 
spur development but the trend ended with tax reform he said 
this year theres capital flight he said 
but he said differences over economic policy wont prompt local 
capital to foster or fund a coup 
for us the institutions are very important a mistaken policy 
decision is something temporal the country is forever he said

the byproduct of the elephants featured in 
the greatest show on earth is as one might expect mammoth 
ringling bros and barnum amp bailey circus officials were willing 
to give away manure from king tusk and his pachyderm pals during 
the shows twoday stay here 
however few showed up to take advantage of the superrich 
fertilizer the circus claims the manure is high in nitrates and 
calcium making it perfect for the backyard or window box gardener 
theres one catch circus manure must dry for at least 90 days 
before being spread or it will burn up the plants and soil 
that didnt deter painter john ellick who scooped up 2 
20gallon trash bags of elephant dung from a garbage bin full of 
manure 
ellick said he cant wait to see what crops will pop up next 
year from his 50by150foot garden in douglas about 50 miles 
southeast of lincoln 
i might grow humongous tomatoes he said i could have 
eggplants the size of footballs cucumbers the size of tusks i can 
only imagine what next years garden will be like

sixtyfive years after a killer earthquake and 
ensuing firestorms ravaged a crowded tokyo officials are alerting 
people of the possibility of another massive one 
they say it could come anytime between now and the next 20 years 
and is expected to pack enough power to split the ground 
the authorities are using the sept 1 anniversary of the 1923 
great kanto earthquake to organize information fairs and earthquake 
drills and keep up vigilance among residents accustomed to 
frequent mostly harmless earthly shudders 
were constantly doing pr public relations said takeshi 
yanagida of the tokyo city governments disaster countermeasure 
bureau most people know enough to turn off the gas and keep 
emergency supplies of food water money underwear 
in the event of a second great kanto earthquake what 
authorities can do is limited we need help from the people 
much of japan lies along a major fault at the juncture of 
mammoth tectonic plates shifting slowly across the earths surface 
small earthquakes shake the country every day most of them 
unnoticed by humans but to scientists maintaining a 24hour watch 
they are signs of building pressure that must eventually culminate 
in a powerful release 
the resulting quake they say will likely register an 8 on the 
openended richter scale the mexico city quake of 1985 measured 
81 and will strike under or near the kanto plain surrounding the 
capital or along the crowded 170mile tokai belt linking tokyo and 
the western city of nagoya 
in the worstcase scenario the quake will come on a winter 
evening when people are cooking their dinners a day with a dry 
northeasterly wind of about 22 kilometers per hour 14 mph 
yanagida said 
powerful enough to buckle walls and knock people off their feet 
it could set off fires from gas ranges and heaters that would burn 
half a million homes destroy onethird of tokyos living and 
office space kill 37000 people and injure 78000 more scientists 
say a quake along the tokai belt could kill up to 100000 
the tolls while disastrous would still be only a fraction of 
the human cost of the 1923 disaster 
two minutes before noon on sept 1 1923 the earth rose in a 
violent upheaval experts say that if the richter scale had been 
developed at the time it would have registered 78 the earthquake 
toppled houses and scattered embers from cooking fires sparking 
deadly firestorms that swept the capital regions rickety densely 
packed neighborhoods when the embers had cooled as many as 
140000 people had perished mostly in the fires and billions of 
dollars worth of property lay in ruins or badly damaged 
masatoshi rachi then a 13yearold farmers son in eastern 
tokyo recalled watching the firestorms approach after his familys 
house had withstood the tremor 
all around sparks were falling like rain people were 
climbing onto their roofs and wetting them down he said 
those who had lost their homes were setting up barracks 
finding space with relatives our house which fortunately didnt 
burn was so full there was only room enough for people to sit 70 
or 80 in all relatives and strangers 
rachi is now 78 tougher building standards fire and changes of 
business have forced him to rebuild his home five times each time 
though he has taken care to reinforce beams and to prepare a 
parcel with stores of water food a flashlight medicine 
rachi was not alone in learning lessons from the 1923 disaster 
the government restricted use of building bricks stiffened 
regulations on securing window glass and encouraged pioneering 
architecture and engineering that allow skyscrapers to roll and 
sway instead of buckling during tremors 
it sent teams to study the devastation after the 1971 los 
angeles quake when highways collapsed and the one that shook 
mexicos capital three years ago bringing on massive confusion 
among families searching for their missing 
tokyo now has sturdier supports for its elevated highways and is 
experimenting with a wireless system for emergency communications 
recent experience has taught the japanese they are likely to be 
safer indoors during a quake 
but despite the funds the government has poured into earthquake 
prediction the truth is were not 100 percent sure we can 
predict the big one said hirofumi yokoyama of the meteorological 
agencys earthquake prediction division we can be maybe 80 
percent certain 
the system is such that we should be able to predict a large 
kanto quake two or three days in advance he said we cant 
tell exactly when but we can say about where 
with luck the information will be enough to prevent a 
fullscale repetition of the catastrophe 65 years ago under an 
advanced disastercontrol program trains will stop when a 
tremendous quake occurs public address systems will be triggered 
automatically people will congregate with their emergency kits at 
governmentdesignated sites and roadways will be cleared for 
emergency vehicles 
but the unknown element looms 
im terrified of quakes said the tokyo governments 
yanagida theyre not like typhoons which you can at least see 
earthquakes can intensify after they start 
the thing is you just never know

first it was the volkswagen beetle then the hardy 
citroen deux chevaux 
now the famed solex motorbike dear to millions in 40 countries 
and for many a symbol of youthful independence is puttering into 
the junkyard of transportation history 
the last solex a fattired bicycle with a tiny motor perched 
atop its front wheel will roll off the assembly line in northern 
city of st quentin at the end of the year victim of poor 
economics and japanese enterprise 
the solex was invented in 1942 and more than 6 million have 
been sold since they run practically forever on just a suspicion 
of gasoline but need a good pedaling to get them rolling up 
anything but the most modest incline 
michele cotta news director for frances tf1 television 
network perhaps summed it up best tears of nostalgia come to my 
eyes not only because like many of us this mode of locomotion 
evokes happy times but with the solex junked its a bit of our 
youth they are destroying 
ungainly poorly balanced and far from elegant the solex 
nonetheless became popular in the 1960s with a top speed of 23 
mph it was a symbol of youth and economy 
motobecane the company that produced bicycles and solexes went 
bust in 1983 resurfacing as mbk industrie with several investers 
including japans yamaha in 1986 yamaha increased its stake in 
the company to 80 percent 
takashi ueoka marketing director for mbk said in an interview 
wednesday the company regretted killing solex but it had to be 
done 
its like the volkswagen beetle said ueoka its the same 
story many people have expressed their regret but we had to make 
a decision of course when i explain the situation they understand 
the solex product is 45 years old he said it has been 
very useful and well used it sold in 40 countries particularly 
africa and nearly all of europe the best year was 1964 when 
380000 were sold in france 
only 2700 found buyers last year even at the price of about 
470 
to better utilize the st quentin plant which also makes 
motobecane bicycles and mopeds the company is investing 28 
million to modernize the equipment and introduce yamaha models to 
the production 
ueoka says economics win out over sentiment every time 
it was my first motor as a teenager when i was 14 said 
parisian christophe cachera i had the impression of speed it 
was also a passage from childhood to adolescence too bad its 
going to disappear if everybody in paris had one life would be a 
lot easier 
alas its only another sign of the times ms cotta wrote in 
the popular daily le parisien 
for how many did the solex mark the first independence the 
first open spaces the first conquests but its condemned to 
death this first bike because the youth of today go faster are 
more in a hurry to achieve maturity

a federal judges order to protect a 
littleknown species of woodpecker is at the heart of a tugofwar 
between environmentalists and loggers over clearcutting in the 
national forests of texas 
naturalists estimate there are only about 180 to 190 
redcockaded woodpecker colonies left in texas with about two 
birds to a colony compared to the 500 or so needed to maintain a 
viable population 
at issue is us district judge robert m parkers ruling that 
seeks to protect the endangered bird by barring us forest service 
contractors from cutting down entire stands of trees within 
threefourths of a mile of a woodpecker colony restricting the 
harvest of trees near nests and limiting the use of roads near 
where the woodpeckers live or forage 
politicians have been quick to denounce the decision saying the 
restrictions could eliminate hundreds of jobs for truckers 
sawmillers and lumberjacks 
rep jim chapman dtexas says he doesnt care if the 
woodpecker becomes extinct humankind and the biological order 
can get along just fine without this bird he says 
environmentalists say the selective harvesting they advocate 
would require more not fewer loggers than clearcutting which 
is heavily mechanized 
but chapman says he is concerned that the forest service will 
overreact and fail to harvest as much as it still can in the 
sabine davy crockett angelina and sam houston national forests 
forest service spokesman carl gidlund said the judges ruling 
covers 473 miles of roads almost a fourth of the 2000 total 
miles of roads in the four east texas forests 
im encouraging them to cut in as close as they can because 
were talking about jobs says chapman by taking the 
conservative approach theyre not selling the timber under the 
court order i suspect they could sell 
environmentalists contend that clearcutting caused a 
precipitous 10 percent drop in the birds population over the past 
five years and said such timbering practices were violating the 
endangered species act 
parker in his june 17 ruling agreed and told the forest service 
to alter its harvesting practices to unevenage or selection 
management 
parker ordered the agency to file a plan to comply with his 
order but the forest service has responded by proposing a 
compromise between clearcutting and selection management that 
environmentalists oppose a sept 28 hearing is scheduled 
ned fritz of the texas committee for natural resources accuses 
the forest service of intransigence they are sullenly refusing 
to abide by the order of the court he said 
in selection management only certain trees are removed at a 
time so a perpetual forest is maintained fritz said creating the 
best habitat for the bird while also reducing the chances of insect 
infestations additional jobs would be created because more 
foresters are needed to keep track of what trees can be harvested 
he said 
that argument fails to sway chapman 
the real argument is not over the woodpecker but is basically 
environmentalists disagreeing with clearcutting were talking 
about 500 woodpeckers theyre ugly they dont have a particularly 
melodious song and they perform no useful service to either nature 
or man he said 
adds a spokesman for sen phil gramm rtexas clearly one 
side is winning and it seems to be the woodpecker 
gramm chapman and other opponents of the judges order also say 
it will cost local counties money a dozen counties in texas 
receive a fourth of the gross sales from timber harvested in 
federal forests with a total of 37 million last year going into 
local school districts and county road and bridge funds according 
to gramms office 
but fritz an attorney with the environmental group said claims 
that revenues will drop are smoke screens 
the misrepresentations have gone wild he said selection 
management is more costeffective and produces just as much if not 
more timber and leaves the forest everbetter

the boeing 727 is the backbone of many 
airlines in the united states and abroad and draws little but 
accolades from aviation experts despite the crash of one of the 
airliners at dallasforth worth international airport 
there is no more reliable plane in the world says gary 
reich aerospace analyst for shearson lehman hutton the new york 
investment firm it has flown through storms and turbulence and 
its performed beautifully and reliably 
theyve been a highly reliable aircraft says roger fleming 
technical chief for the air transport association the trade group 
for the airline industry 
the boeing co manufactured 1831 of the jets between 1962 and 
1984 of which 1770 are still in use worldwide boeing spokesman 
jack gamble said wednesday at company headquarters in renton wash 
boeing estimates that 727s have flown 276 billion miles and 
carried 31 billion passengers 
it is the most commonly used plane in the us commercial fleet 
according to airline consultant george james of 3476 passenger 
and cargo aircraft used by american carriers 1148 are 727s the 
second most commonly used craft is the boeing 737 with 634 in use 
the delta air lines 727200 that crashed wednesday at 
dallasfort worth airport had made 38629 takeoffs and landings 
boeing spokesman david jimenez said gamble said the planes 44000 
hours of flight time were average for its age it was built in 1973 
gamble said that since the first 727 went into service in 1964 
53 have been lost after accidents that includes wednesdays crash 
and four other 727s that have been destroyed in attacks by 
terrorists or shot down 
the aircrafts early years however revealed some problems that 
had to be dealt with 
reich said that in the early years of the 727 when the 
nations airline fleets were just entering the jet age several of 
the planes crashed because pilots were unaccustomed to the rapidity 
with which the aircraft descended during landings 
pilots had to be retrained to cope with the socalled high sink 
rate 
in the course of those accidents another problem came to light 
reich said in the early models lines brought fuel along the top 
of the fuselage from the wings to the three engines at the rear 
which meant that in accidents coach passenges would be doused with 
burning fuel within a few years the lines were repositioned to 
the bottom portion of the fuselage 
they had some difficulties in the early years but those go 
back to the mid to late 60s said fleming of the air transport 
association 
over the years the federal aviation administration has issued 
122 air worthiness directives ordering the owners of 727s to 
make specific adjustments to the planes said faa spokesman mitch 
barker in seattle he said that represents a normal number for an 
aircraft that old 
of those however only 12 applied to the model 200 the longer 
modernized version of the plane that boeing began delivering to its 
customers in december 1967 in all 1260 of the 727s manufactured 
were model 200s including the jet that crashed wednesday the 
earlier versions were model 100s 
one recurring problem was with the aircrafts landing gear 
which barker said were complex and had been kind of a headache 
he said he did not have details on what the problem was 
regarding the plane that crashed wednesday faa records show a 
wing flap control mechanism was replaced in july 1987 after an 
aileron flap jammed on the right wing and inspectors in august 
1983 found two small cracks in the fuselage skin measuring 
onehalf inch and threequarters inch 
faa spokeswoman bobbie mardis described the problems as very 
minor 
gamble said the first crash involving a 727 occurred in august 
1965 when a united airlines 727 plummeted into lake michigan the 
next involving a 727 was an american airlines flight that crashed 
in cincinnati in november 1965 followed three days later by 
another united accident at salt lake city the cincinnati and salt 
lake city incidents were caused by the pilots unfamiliarity with 
aircrafts rapid rate of descent he said 
among the crafts more recent accidents a pan american 727 
crashed after takeoff in kenner la on july 9 1982 and 153 
people were killed 
the 727 is being phased out in favor of more economical planes 
that use just two engines and require only two pilots

when president reagan hit los 
angeles last week he turned into something of a party animal 
he and his wife nancy more than ever before during their 
traditional august visits to california were out on the town 
they attended private dinner parties nearly every night whisked 
by motorcade through dozens of traffic lights and their friends 
exclusive neighborhoods 
in the shadow of hollywood the effort of moving the 
presidential party safely about town was a production any film 
director would envy 
weather permitting reagan usually takes helicopters in and out 
of the city and his retreat at the century plaza hotel but for 
short distances he is moved by motorcade in armored limousines 
flown in from washington just for his use 
arranging reagans motorcade calls for a cast of hundreds 
organizing to the minute the diverse movements of los angeles 
police the california highway patrol secret service agents 
medical personnel military aides white house staff reporters 
television crews drivers and even helicopter pilots flying 
overhead 
for security purposes the presidents plans are never announced 
in advance nor is his route publicized 
but when a string of nearly twodozen vehicles whizzes by 
including police cars with flashing red lights limousines flying 
the american flag secret service vans filled with flakvested 
agents communications vehicles bristling with antennae press vans 
chock full of cameras and journalists and staff cars staff cars 
and more staff cars its easy to deduce that someone other than a 
rock star is visiting town 
one evening residents of a swank belair street took a look at 
their closedoff avenues and interpreted it as an open invitation 
to start a block party 
their neighborhood had been swathed in enough yellow police tape 
to wrap the national christmas tree and waves of agents in suits 
and dark sunglasses had descended upon their walkways 
so the locals broke out the perrier and other stronger 
substances to toast the president as his blockslong motorcade sped 
by 
entire families moved their patio and poolside furniture to 
their front driveways hobnobbing with reporters waving a tiny 
flag or two and sipping their drinks while waiting for a glance of 
the president and first lady as they sped by 
but even los angelinos can be blase about a president when a 
real celebrity happens by at one point basketball star magic 
johnson of the los angeles lakers was allowed to drive his black 
rollsroyce convertible through the barricades as local residents 
who identify themselves are allowed to do 
to the delight of more than one police officer and reporter 
johnson paused to chat and sign a few autographs 
but not all such innocent passersby can be accorded similar 
treatment given the everpresent security concerns that bedevil 
the organizers and protectors of the president 
as reagans lengthy motorcade roared away from his hotel that 
same evening it appeared that one of the side streets had not been 
blocked off by the motorcycle patrolmen 
one motorist turned from the side street and started to drive 
parallel to the end cars in the motorcade 
as reporters in one of the last few vehicles spotted him he 
appeared blissfully unaware that he was accompanying the motorcade 
and that reagans limousine was up ahead an easy mistake given 
that reagans vehicle was more than a dozen cars ahead and nearly 
out of sight 
within seconds agents in the motorcade became aware of the 
outsider one of the drivers in the staff cars swerved in front of 
the interloper attempting to cut the car off and keep it from 
driving closer to the presidents vehicle 
up ahead one of the special secret service vans moved into the 
same lane as the intruder the tailgate officer could be seen 
taking aim with an automatic weapon 
but by that time motorcycle officers had sped up to the hapless 
driver shouting at him to stop which he did apparently still 
unaware hed caused any disturbance 
and the motorcade glided on

farmers have aged so much in the tough times 
of the 1980s that a former agriculture department economist says 
retirements could force another round of farm consolidations by the 
turn of the century 
matthew g smith now with the minnesota department of revenue 
says the graying of american farmers was a prominent issue in the 
1950s and 1960s but a boom in exports and farm incomes attracted 
more young people in the middle and late 1970s and for a while the 
face of agriculture got a bit younger 
now however nearly half of all farm assets are owned by 
farmers who will probably retire within 10 years yet fewer than 
one in three younger operators is in a strong position to purchase 
those assets smith said 
with the number of new farmers again declining with many 
middleaged farmers in financial difficulty and with a steady rate 
of retirement of older farmers the total number of us farms may 
drop rapidly between now and the year 2000 
smith reported his analysis in rdp or rural development 
perspectives a magazine published by the departments economic 
research service where he formerly worked 
if these trends continued unchecked the share of farmland 
owned by absentee landlords may rise growth in farm efficiency may 
slow and businesses serving the farm sector will find themselves 
competing for slices of a shrinking pie he said 
the net number of new farmers younger than 35 in 1974 averaged 
almost 29000 a year from 1974 to 1978 he said from 1978 to 1982 
those who were under 35 in 1978 dropped by nearly 40 percent to 
fewer than 18000 a year 
a middle group 35 to 54 years which grew from 1974 to 1978 
shrank in 197882 thus in this age group which normally includes 
farmers both entering and leaving farming more were leaving than 
entering by the early 1980s 
meanwhile rates of net departures among older operators 55 
and older were relatively stable reflecting the fairly 
predictable process of retirement smith said 
looking at the changes in the number of commercialsize 
farms defined in the study as one with annual sales of 20000 at 
1982 prices smith said that these units increased from 865000 in 
1974 to about 942000 in 1978 then declined to about 884000 in 
1982 
smith said that if the entry and exit rates remain at the 
197882 levels the number of commercialsize farms would decline 
18 percent to about 727000 units by 1998 
but he said the rates wont be known for certain until next year 
when the 1987 census of agriculture becomes available 
prospects appear dim that a sufficient number of young people 
will begin farming to reverse the trend toward fewer 
commercialsize farms smith said with the farm baby boom 
approaching 30 the numbers of farmborn youths at the prime entry 
ages will now begin to decline 
consequently he said the number of new farmers will continue 
to drop unless more farm children choose to remain on the land or 
more people from nonfarm backgrounds take up farming

the agriculture department says drought 
continues to put the bite on consumer food dollars including 
higher prices for fresh vegetables this summer and signs that 
processed items also will be more costly next year 
prices paid to growers for fresh vegetables jumped more than 21 
percent from july to august officials said and this summers 
prices overall could be up 10 percent from the third quarter of 
1987 a period when fresh vegetable prices usually decline 
however this years extremely dry weather coupled with 
minimum irrigation in the north central states reduced supplies 
and put upward pressure on prices in midsummer the department 
economic research service said wednesday as local supplies 
tighten consumers likely will be more dependent than usual on 
vegetables shipped from more distant areas 
the governments consumer price index or cpi for fresh 
vegetables including potatoes rose 4 percent from june to july 
and was up 5 percent from july 1987 potatoes lettuce and tomatoes 
are the most important in the fresh vegetable index 
retail potato prices were up seasonally in july and were also 
boosted slightly by the droughts impact on the summer crop 
lettuce prices tend to be seasonally low in july and were 
slightly lower this july due to large california supplies the 
report said tomato prices tend to be down in july as tomatoes 
are the most commonly grown vegetable in home gardens which 
reduces summer demand however the drought boosted this julys 
prices 
the cpi for processing vegetables is generally flat in the 
summer but it rose 1 percent in july the report said prices are 
expected to continue rising through 1989 as higher wholesale costs 
work through the marketing pipeline

saudi arabia has decided to cut spending on 
domestic production subsidies for the 1989 wheat crop in an effort 
to reduce the need for export subsidies says an agriculture 
department report 
however at this point the subsidy reduction will affect only 
large farms which account for about 10 percent of total saudi 
wheat production the departments foreign agricultural service 
reported wednesday 
the government of saudi arabia has been subsidizing exports of 
domestic wheat surpluses since 198586 as a result saudi wheat 
has competed against us wheat in china indonesia and south 
korea the report said 
in addition to the wheat subsidy reduction the saudi government 
will attempt to reduce the countrys reliance on barley imports by 
requiring largescale wheat producers to plant as much barley as 
they do wheat

new measurements have confirmed rapid growth 
in the atmosphere of manmade bromine compounds from fire 
extinguishers that scientists believe help destroy the earths 
protective ozone layer 
bromine has received much less attention than the 
chlorofluorocarbon or cfc compounds in discussions of how to save 
the stratospheric chemical layer that blocks the suns 
cancercausing ultraviolet rays 
but bromine was covered by last years treaty calling for a 
halving of cfc production by 1998 production of the firefighting 
bromine compounds called halons is to be frozen at 1986 levels in 
1992 
a chemical cousin of chlorine bromine by itself can destroy 
little ozone but many chemists believe it amplifies the 
ozonedestroying ability of chlorine liberated from both halons and 
the cfc compounds used as refrigeration fluids solvents foam 
blowing agents and outside the united states as aerosol 
propellants 
other compounds some arising naturally from the ocean are 
important sources of atmospheric bromine there is no consensus on 
the importance of each source and industry appears divided on the 
importance of the new findings 
the firefighting compounds are valuable because they snuff out 
flames while leaving no residue that would disable valuable 
equipment like computers only about 5 percent of emissions is 
believed to come from actual firefighting with most emissions 
coming from equipment testing 
professional groups already have revised codes to eliminate 
requirements that halons be used to test equipment 
the latest halon measurements were made by a team of west german 
and indian scientists based at germanys max planck institute 
in the aug 18 issue of nature the british scientific weekly 
the team reported atmospheric concentrations of the two main halons 
seem to be growing at 12 percent per year and 5 percent per year 
the fastergrowing compound is halon 12 used in portable 
extinguishers whose concentration was measured in balloon flights 
over france and india at 19 parts per trillion at 33000 and 
37000 feet the slower growth is for halon 13 used in 
roomflooding installations whose concentration was about 13 
parts per trillion 
the major cfcs are present at a few hundred parts per trillion 
but the two bromine compounds are far more powerful three and 11 
times as destructive of ozone than the most important cfc compound 
the halon 12 concentrations when compared with measurements 
made in 1982 1983 and 1984 yield growth rates of 12 percent to 20 
percent per year the researchers said 12 percent seems to be the 
more realistic there have been no previous growth rates reported 
for halon 13 
the measurements are in the range we have been considering in 
our models said ross salawitch a postdoctoral researcher in the 
harvard university group headed by michael mcelroy studying bromine 
reactions in the atmosphere 
the mcelroy group believes bromine is responsible for about 20 
percent of the annual loss of ozone over antarctica that produces 
the wellknown september hole which last year saw ozone 
concentrations fall to 50 percent of normal 
some studies also show a small ozone loss over the arctic 
if there is any chemically driven ozone loss over the arctic 
it is more likely to be driven by the chlorinebromine reactions 
salawitch said 
three companies make halon compounds in the united states du 
pont co ici americas and great lakes chemical corp 
at great lakes in west lafayette ind dave bouchard a 
chemical engineer who is director of investor relations said the 
company was not confident at all that bromine enhances the 
ability of chlorine to destroy ozone and was sponsoring and 
conducting research to try to prove or disprove it 
at du pont spokeswoman cathy forte said the nature article was 
generally consistent with our understanding of the effects of 
bromine in the atmosphere and would not affect the companys 
plans to end production of all its ozonedepleting products before 
the turn of the century including halon compounds 
the company has ended equipment testing with halons she said 
dan dudek an atmospheric scientist with the environmental 
defense fund said he believed halon production should be reduced 
just like cfc production

the detroit free press and the detroit news 
are urging a federal judge to ignore alice in wonderland 
arguments and lift a court order blocking partial merger of the two 
moneylosing newspapers 
a brief filed by the free press on wednesday said opponents of 
the joint operating agreement had mischaracterized the record in a 
lastditch attempt to forestall the partial merger 
the brief was supported by the news and two unions the 
newspaper guild and graphic communications international union 
the newspapers rank in circulation among the 10 largest in the 
nation 
on aug 8 thenattorney general edwin meese iii approved the 
combination of the newspapers business and production operations 
the free press owned by knightridder inc and the news owned by 
gannett co inc would retain separate news and editorial 
departments 
meese approved the exemption to federal antitrust laws under the 
newspaper preservation act which allows such exemptions when one 
of the competing newspapers is in danger of failing 
in winning a courtordered delay in the merger opponents argued 
that the evidence showed the free press far from failing was a 
healthy newspaper with some competitive advantages over the news 
attorneys for the free press however said this alice in 
wonderland assertion ignores over 80 million in operating losses 
by the free press and 176 million in subsidies by its parent 
knightridder 
in the final analysis plaintiffs argument is that the owners 
of the free press poured 176 million into the paper from 1977 
through 1986 in an effort to generate artificial losses in the hope 
that a joa might some day be successfully negotiated the brief 
said this proposition on its face is preposterous and 
selfdefeating 
us district judge joyce hens green at the request of a group 
of detroit advertisers and newspaper readers issued an emergency 
order aug 17 delaying the partial merger for a month the order 
came the day before the agreement was due to go into effect 
the free press urged the court to deny the opponents request 
that the partial merger be blocked permanently and to force them to 
pay court costs 
the brief argued that the attorney general was correct in 
overruling an administrative law judges recommendation the 
agreement be denied 
the attorney general is the federal officer charged by 
congress with responsibility for applying and construing the 
newspaper preservation act the brief said it is the findings 
and legal conclusions of the attorney general not the 
recommendations of the administrative law judge or the antitrust 
division to which the courts therefore defer 
the long and fierce circulation battle between the free press 
and the news has kept advertising rates and newsstand prices lower 
than in many large cities the news has a newsstand price on 
weekdays and saturdays of 15 cents a copy in the detroit area the 
free press sells for 20 cents 
after the first five years of the 100year agreement the 
newspapers would share profits or losses equally 
the joint operating agreement would cause the loss of about 500 
jobs the newspapers have said should the agreement be blocked 
knightridder has said the free press will be closed with a loss 
of 1500 jobs

unions are getting a wider door from the 
national labor relations board to recruit millions of health care 
workers in a move that hospitals contend can only increase medical 
costs further 
the nlrb told hospitals in a 153page set of proposed 
regulations published today they no long can try to lump nurses 
with physicians or therapists and lab technicians with bookkeepers 
or janitors as a tactic to keep unions from getting a foot in their 
doors 
instead the board said it will recognize eight broad categories 
of hospital employees if a union can win an election among workers 
in any one category the hospital will have to recognize it as the 
collective bargaining agent for that specific group 
nlrb officials said they hope to issue the regulations in their 
final form before the end of this year after a wait of 45 days to 
allow public comment on them 
the boards past practice has been to rule case by case on what 
is an appropriate bargaining unit each time a hospital and union 
disagreed 
labor leaders contended and nlrb officials agreed that lengthy 
hearings and appeals before the agency on each case hampered 
unions abilities to organize hospital workers 
the practical effect was that if a union tried to organize 
less than wall to wall the employer would object and tie it up in 
the nlrb said david silberman associate general counsel for the 
aflcio the larger the group the harder it is to organize 
particularly when you have to cross different groups that have few 
common concerns 
the regulations effectively reverse a 1984 board ruling allowing 
for only three or four bargaining units at a hospital unless unions 
could prove that the interests of different groups of workers were 
so distinct as to justify more 
at the same time the board said it wanted to avoid a 
congressionally prohibited proliferation of separate unions at 
each hospital similar to the pattern of 10 to 15 different unions 
faced by individual employers in the construction and newspaper 
industries 
if the unit is too large it may be difficult to organize and 
when organized will contain too diversified a constituency which 
may generate conflicts of interest and dissatisfaction among fringe 
groups making it difficult for the union to represent the board 
said 
on the other hand if the unit is too small it may be costly 
for the employer to deal with because of repetitious bargaining 
frequent strikes jurisdictional disputes and wage whipsawing it 
said 
since the 1984 ruling the proportion of hospital workers 
nationwide who belong to unions has dropped from 23 percent to 19 
percent according to the service employees international union 
which represents some 300000 health care workers 
john sweeney the unions president attributed a large part of 
the decrease to delays caused by fighting over bargaining units 
im hopeful well see some significant gains sweeney said 
workers with a common interest now have an opportunity to decide 
whether they want to organize or not 
the proposed regulations come at a time when the labor 
department predicts that health care will be among the biggest 
sources of new jobs in the 1990s as the nation grapples with an 
aging population 
shortages of nurses already are plaguing many areas and 
physicians in the past three years have increasingly moved toward 
forming unions of their own in response to corporate restructuring 
of the industry 
this is going to be expensive disruptive and ultimately it is 
going to increase the costs of health care said michael anthony 
executive vice president of the american hospital association 
anthony said having to deal with as many as eight different 
unions will reduce hospitals ability to use team approaches and 
flexibility to keep costs down 
the eight categories that the board listed as specific 
bargaining units in hospitals are 
registered nurses physicians professionals except for nurses 
and physicians technical employees such as lab technicians 
skilled maintenance employees such as plumbers electricians and 
heating and air conditioning specialists business office clerical 
employees guards other nonprofessional employees 
we feel this rule will finally stabilize this area of the 
law said nlrb chairman james m stephens we have attempted to 
streamline the process by eliminating delays and protracted 
hearings 
excluded from coverage are nursing homes psychiatric hospitals 
health maintenance organizations and other health care facilities 
other than surgical and medical hospitals 
stephens was joined in approving the regulations by nlrb member 
mary miller cracraft dissenting was board member wilford w 
johansen who said he still favors a casebycase approach in 
deciding the appropriate bargaining units

questions about possible traffic jams 
air pollution and damage to sensitive plants are delaying approval 
of plans for a library to house president reagans white house 
papers 
the ventura county environmental report review commission 
recessed a hearing on the project wednesday without taking action 
after concerns were raised by the california department of fish and 
game the sierra club the city of thousand oaks and others 
the commission will meet again next week and could approve 
construction of the library or order preparation of an 
environmental impact report that could take a year or more 
the ronald reagan presidential foundation which has been 
raising money for the library hopes to break ground this fall and 
complete construction in 1991 
the facility like the eight existing presidential libraries 
would be operated by the national archives in addition to housing 
the reagan papers for scholarly study it would contain museum 
exhibits about the president and his administration 
chuck thomas who represents ventura countys air pollution 
control agency on the sevenmember technical commission requested 
the weeks delay in order to get more information 
if he had to vote on it without delay he said i think i 
would have to come down against it thomas said the air pollution 
control district had found that the project would violate county 
air quality standards because of the amount of automobile traffic 
it would generate 
carroll mcdonald chairman of the reagan presidential library 
committee of the venturabased organization environmental 
coalition told county officials that more than 425000 people 
annually are expected to visit the library located northwest of 
los angeles 
given the popularity of president reagan and the controversy 
concerning portions of his presidency it would seem reasonable to 
assume that this will be a popular attraction for tourists as well 
as a research library for historians added russ baggerly 
representing a group called citizen interest in ventura county 
the library site in a hilly area near the communities of 
thousand oaks simi valley and moorpark is served by a dusty road 
used by jeeps and horses to reach this road however traffic 
would travel over a public road serving the three communities 
philip e gatch director of planning and community development 
for thousand oaks said a portion of this road approaching the 
adjoining city limits of thousand oaks and simi valley remains a 
twolane roadway operating at a level of service beyond its current 
capacity 
however frank w brutt the planning and community development 
director for simi valley said the simi valley staff can make the 
findings that the additional traffic that would be generated by the 
library project would not have a significant impact on nearby 
intersections under projected cumulative traffic conditions 
fred worthley regional manager of the california fish and game 
department said an undetermined number of three sensitive 
plants would be uprooted or damaged by construction in a letter 
to county officials may 12 worthley asked that the project be 
redesigned to avoid the areas where the plants grow after a 
detailed survey was made at the appropriate time of year when 
these plants can be readily identified 
cynthia leake conservation chairman of the sierra club chapter 
in nearby camarillo asked that an environmental impact study be 
made of both the effects on plant life and air quality 
the size of the structure the hours of operation the 
expected number of visitors per day all indicate serious 
degradation of the air quality in the area she said 
the 153000 squarefoot library would operate from 9 am to 
445 pm seven days a week and foundation officials say it is 
expected to receive an average of 1238 visitors per day

vice president george bush touched off a quick 
chorus of challenges and criticism from environmentalists and 
elected officials with his claim to be a lifelong environmentalist 
democrat michael dukakis dismissed bushs assertion on wednesday 
as an electionyear conversion 
sen george mitchell a maine democrat who has pushed acid rain 
legislation asked where bush was for the past seven years when the 
reagan administration slashed funding for water pollution and tried 
to block renewal of the clean air act 
blake early a lobbyist for the sierra club said that if bush 
is an environmentalist it comes as a revelation to us 
and rep john d dingell dmich chairman of the house energy 
and commerce committee questioned the depth of bushs sudden 
commitment to the environment saying hes still like the piano 
player in the bordello who doesnt know whats going on upstairs 
dingell for his part has been a leading opponent of 
environmental legislation perceived as costly to the auto industry 
in his home state he has also fought acid rain legislation in 
alliance with senate majority leader robert byrd of west virginia 
a coal state 
bush who planned to push the environmental theme again today by 
taking a boat cruise of boston harbor stood on the shore of lake 
erie in michigan on wednesday and promised to take swift action on 
acid rain if elected 
the republican presidential nominee also said he would convene a 
global conference during his first year in the white house to 
address the greenhouse effect he called for wetlands 
protection and pledged a policy of zero tolerance for toxic 
polluters 
but bush who aides said was trying to distinguish himself from 
reagan administration policies may have touched off a backlash 
that his campaign did not intend 
in boston the dukakis campaign moved quickly to help coordinate 
a protest that would greet bush on land on the harbor and in the 
air with demonstrations boats and an airborne banner 
before leaving massachusetts on wednesday for a western campaign 
swing dukakis defended his own record on boston harbor as governor 
and criticized the reagan administration for trying to eliminate 
federal funding for sewage treatment plants 
its been polluted for hundreds of years and im very proud 
to be the governors whos cleaning it up dukakis said and we 
are doing it no thanks to vice president bush and the 
administration he is part of 
earlier this summer dukakis broke ground for a cleanup project 
for the harbor but his critics complained he should have dealt 
with the problem years ago 
dukakis was joined at a statehouse press conference by mitchell 
who was asked about bushs promise to work with congress on a set 
timetable for reducing acid rain 
my question is where has the vice president been for the past 
seven years mitchell asked faulting the reagan administration 
for its outright opposition to his acid rain legislation 
dingell an influential house democrat said bushs stance was 
a welcome novelty coming from this administration that followed 
eight years of tranquil repose by mr bush in the office of vice 
president 
on bushs acid rain commitment early said talk is cheap 
he questioned what role bush took in the early 1980s when the white 
house blocked its own environmental protection agency head from 
seeking a 4 million ton reduction in pollutants blamed for acid 
rain 
in boston state sen william golden a dukakis supporter who 
has been prominent in the boston harbor cleanup effort said he was 
helping to coordinate the antibush protest with local groups 
including the audubon society greenpeace clean water action the 
national toxics campaign and others 
the first step was a press conference where mitchell faulted 
the reaganbush administration for trying to eliminate the federal 
water pollution control program twice vetoing the clean water act 
trying to delay lead reduction in gasoline and favoring studies 
over action on acid rain 
for george bush to come here and present himself as an 
environmentalist its like bonnie and clyde coming out for gun 
control former us sen paul tsongas told the press conference

sen dan quayle insists he can handle a 
fair play political contest and says the democratic strategy of 
portraying him as a liability for the republicans means their 
campaign is crumbling 
the republican vice presidential nominee kicked off a deep south 
swing wednesday and for the first time in his 2weekold campaign 
found himself unhampered by reporters questions about the national 
guard his academic record or personal life 
the new tone on the quayle trail even led the nominee who has 
been demonstrably wary of the press since he became george bushs 
running mate for the first time to walk back on his campaign plane 
to meet the reporters covering him 
quayle travels today to little rock ark where he is scheduled 
to tour a timex plant and a childrens hospital and to the 
jackson miss area for a high school football practice and 
fundraiser 
at stops wednesday in baton rouge and shreveport quayle blasted 
dukakis as a defeatist liberal who lacks the faith and 
imagination to deal with unemployment and poverty in depressed 
areas of the country 
you know what the problem is with the man from massachusetts 
its that his ideas are as old as that 25yearold snow blower he 
keeps in his garage quayle told 4000 students at louisiana 
state university 
quayle noted that unemployment was particularly high in 
louisiana because of the decline in the oil industry 
were not going to change that overnight but for starters 
george bush and i vigorously disagree with the man from 
massachusetts when he suggests that we cease offshore oil 
exploration quayle said 
the dukakis campaign quickly reacted with spokesman leslie dach 
saying quayle misstated the massachusetts governors position on 
offshore drilling 
mike dukakis supports offshore drilling when its 
environmentally sound and makes economic sense he said 
offshore oil drilling makes sense in some parts of the country 
but it should never happen in others 
dach said he did not know what specific environmentally 
sensitive areas dukakis would consider off limits for drilling 
as he toured an exxon refinery quayle was asked about dukakis 
campaign manager susan estrichs comment wednesday that bushs 
selection of quayle will be a liability for republicans that 
the democrats will exploit 
this is the first real sign that you are seeing a crumbling 
campaign quayle said ive been in politics a long time fair 
play fair enough i can stand the heat and ill stay in the 
kitchen 
the lsu appearance was the nominees first before a large 
university crowd a segment of the population republicans are 
hoping will provide a substantial bloc of votes this fall 
quayle said his main message for college students will be the 
ideology of the campaign and the difference between a defeatist 
liberal and an enlightened cando conservative 
on his second campaign swing since being named bushs running 
mate quayle ran into no questions from the news media over whether 
he pulled strings to get into the national guard during the vietnam 
war and into law school after a mediocre college performance 
coverage of quayle since his selection was the subject of a 
study by the washingtonbased center for media and public affairs 
which concluded he has been the subject of more negative reporting 
than any other national candidate except gary hart 
evaluations of quayle by reporters and nonpartisan analysts 
were positive only 33 percent of the time according to the study 
of the period from aug 1628 the nonpartisan researchers called 
that ratio worse than any candidate received during the primaries 
aside from gary harts 21 percent positive rating

a delta air lines 727 jetliner burst 
into flames as it crashed on takeoff wednesday killing 13 people 
but 94 survived as passengers some cradling infants scrambled out 
of the shattered fuselage through a pit of fire 
by midnight 15 hours after the crash in hazy sunshine at 
dallasfort worth international airport some uncertainty remained 
about the number of victims 
although delta officials released names of 94 survivors 
hospitals who treated victims counted at least 96 people five of 
the names on the hospital lists were different from those released 
by delta and delta officials offered no explanation for the 
discrepancy delta also had three names of survivors who were not 
included in lists from hospitals 
delta spokesman bill berry in atlanta said 13 fatalities were 
confirmed including an infant all were from texas delta said 
the count of victims was complicated by the difficulty in 
determining how many babies were aboard berry said 
thirtyfour survivors were hospitalized berry said survivors 
included the captain and two other pilots one of whom was working 
as a flight engineer he said 
we were just terrified said passenger mona thomason we 
jumped on the wing but it looked like we were jumping into a pit 
of fire she reported seeing a woman with two children she 
got one of them out but im afraid the other one was caught in the 
fire 
investigators had no immediate indication of the cause of the 
crash said michael benson a spokesman for the national 
transportation safety board in washington 
apparently the pilot made an attempt to abort there 
apparently was an engine problem fred h rollins deltas 
district manager for marketing in salt lake city where the plane 
was headed 
later wednesday other delta spokesmen refused to discuss 
potential causes of the crash deferring all questions to federal 
investigators who had not held any briefings by midnight 
a 16member ntsb panel arrived late wednesday from washington to 
bolster a threeperson team from fort worth member lee dickinson 
would not speculate on a cause but said the team would remain at 
the scene at least five to seven days 
ntsb investigator warren wandel said the aircraft flight data 
recorder and cockpit voice recorder the socalled black boxes 
were found in good shape 
the recorders were being taken to washington for examination in 
an ntsb laboratory dickinson said at a briefing wednesday night 
spokesmen for boeing and for pratt amp whitney the manufacturer 
of the planes three engines said they would also send 
investigators 
fire and rescue crews quickly reached the wreckage in a level 
field about 1000 feet beyond the end of the runway it was at the 
opposite end of the airport from the site of the crash of a delta 
lockheed l1011 on aug 2 1985 in which 137 people died 
we didnt make it 50 feet in the air we skidded and then the 
engine exploded said passenger jim hammock of garland there 
was pandemonium people were jumping on the planes wing and 
burning themselves on it because it was so red hot we got out of 
the way fast because we thought it was going to explode 
you could see the fuel running down the window and down the 
wing and i wasnt going to get burned said hammock whose right 
sleeve was streaked with jet fuel 
penn waugh a dallas attorney who was on the flight told 
reporters the plane never got in the air 
you heard the thing crumple so you knew you were going to 
crash the whole time said waugh who was uninjured you were 
just looking for a way to get out of the plane youre hoping you 
werent going to die 
most of those hospitalized suffered burns cuts or broken bones 
bill whitman a spokesman for harris methodistheb hospital in 
bedford said 64 survivors were brought to the hospital of whom 19 
were admitted 
all those admitted were in satisfactory to stable condition and 
the most serious cases involved smoke inhalation whitman said 
flight 1141 originated in jackson miss and was taking off for 
salt lake city when it went down at 903 am 
it carried a crew of seven including two flight attendants who 
were among those killed delta said spokesman henry conley said a 
total of 23 delta employees were on board and 10 flight attendants 
were traveling as passengers five of those heading for a training 
session 
asked if the presence of so many flight attendants could have 
contributed to the high number of survivors he said its a very 
good possibility but im not sure at this time 
faa spokeswoman bobbie mardis in oklahoma city said details of 
crew experience were not immediately available but none of the 
three pilots had had an accident incident or violation in their 
records 
the burnedout hull missing much of its roof and broken open 
just ahead of the tail smoldered among sunflowers prairie grass 
and scattered pieces of luggage one of the planes three engines 
stood upright about 60 yards from the main wreckage and the acrid 
smell of jet fuel and burned plastic lingered long after the fire 
was out 
david aguilar the us border patrol agent in charge at dallas 
used a drug and bodysniffing dog named bruno to probe the 
wreckage for bodies bruno was used in brownsville to hunt for 
victims after a department store roof collapsed july 7 killing 14 
people 
boeing spokesman david jimenez said the 727200 had made 38629 
takeoffs and landings boeing spokesman jack gamble said the 
planes 44000 hours of flight time was average for its age 
maintenance records indicated the plane built in 1973 had only 
very minor problems in the last five years ms mardis said 
delta following industry practice will suspend its advertising 
for a few days berry said 
ron anderson director of parkland memorial hospital where at 
least a halfdozen people were treated said the captain larry 
davis of greenville was able to talk but in shock 
davis had been pinned in the wreckage anderson said 
he had a series of traumatic injuries anderson said we 
do not know yet how much of that is internal 
passenger dan walker 40 a dallas veterinarian credited the 
pilot with a remarkable feat getting the plane down 
we got airborne about 300 feet and then we got in trouble and 
the pilot did an excellent job of getting us flat he said all 
he did was save a few hundred lives 
we veered to the right as we were taking off said peter 
wright a passenger from dallas i heard a banging noise under 
the carriage and then someone said were not going to make it 
said wright who slightly injured his wrist 
we didnt get 10 feet off the ground when we seemed to lose 
power said geoff parkes wrights traveling companion i saw 
the right wing tip hit the ground and flames shot toward my 
window 
gene metzig of wichita falls saw the accident from an asa 
commuter flight that had just arrived from wichita falls and was 
sitting on a connecting runway 
his right wing was coming straight at us it was probably no 
more than a foot or 18 inches off the ground as he pulled it back 
to the left i dont know how the hell he missed us but he missed 
us metzig said 
metzig said the asa passengers were cheering this guy to get 
that plane off the ground we were rooting for that pilot to 
get that plane up but there was just no way

federal regulators are continuing a rapid pace 
of savings and loan rescues by pledging 19 billion to restore 14 
failing institutions in oklahoma to solvency 
federal home loan bank board chairman m danny wall said 
wednesday his agency would merge the 14 sampls into six larger 
institutions and begin efforts to sell them to private buyers with 
a meeting today with oklahoma investors 
through the sales the agency hopes to get back some of its 
assistance which includes 12 billion in 10year promissory notes 
and 700 million in guarantees against future losses 
in just two weeks the agency has pledged nearly 10 billion to 
rescue in addition to the oklahoma institutions 21 in texas five 
in minnesota and one each in iowa idaho california and tennessee 
wall indicated the fast pace will continue over the next month 
we will be very active he said 
he declined to provide details but the agencys spokesman karl 
hoyle said pending transactions in texas and other states would 
involve billions of dollars more the problem is greatest in the 
southwest which has been hard hit by problems in the oil industry 
in part the agency which got a new board and an infusion of 
cash last summer is merely hitting its stride wall said but 
he acknowledged that the board felt pressured to act quickly by a 
pending change in the way the federal budget deficit is calculated 
although the bank board receives its money through an assessment 
on the industry and not from the taxpayers its spending counts 
toward the deficit 
effective at the start of the 1989 fiscal year on oct 1 
government accountants will count the bank boards promissory notes 
as immediate spending thus any notes issued before oct 1 greatly 
ease the administrations budgetbalancing burden 
the bank board was facing a deadline today to wrap up 
negotiations with the robert m bass group of fort worth texas 
which is seeking federal assistance to acquire american savings and 
loan association of stockton calif one of the nations largest 
sampls 
the board began negotiating with the bass group exclusively on 
april 21 and twice has extended the deadline wall promised an 
announcement on american today but would not say whether the board 
had struck a deal or was planning to continue negotiations 
industry sources have said between 15 billion and 2 billion 
in federal money likely will be required for that rescue which 
would make it the largest bailout of a single sampl 
including the oklahoma package regulators have closed or merged 
94 sampls so far this year compared with 48 for all of last year 
wall said he planned to resolve the cases of 259 institutions this 
year and next 
wall said three of oklahomas 48 sampls are attempting to 
restructure themselves with private capital rather than government 
help but if those efforts fail they will be added to the 
consolidation plan the states remaining 31 institutions are 
healthy he said 
politicians and industry officials in oklahoma are complaining 
that the consolidation will make it difficult to keep the 
institutions in the hands of state residents 
if they lump them all into several huge packages its likely 
theyll be sold to outofstate investors because were a 
capitalpoor state said michael l toalson president of the 
oklahoma league of savings institutions 
oklahoma congressional offices made telephone calls wednesday 
morning in an attempt to persuade the bank board to delay its 
announcement until after congress returns from its labor day recess 
joe taylor an aide to rep jim inhofe rokla said inhofe and 
other oklahoma members of congress wanted a greater say in shaping 
the plan 
were concerned very concerned about the timing of this 
thing he said 
the chairman rejected that criticism saying every day we 
wait the problem gets bigger our intention is to move as 
expeditiously as possible

peaceful solution to the conflict in southwestern africa state 
department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said wednesday

the washington post meanwhile reported today that cuba held 
secret talks last weekend with the usbacked unita rebels in 
angola 
us officials whom the post did not identify said they did not 
know whether the talks were an indication that cuban president 
fidel castro was seeking a reconciliation agreement between the 
cubanbacked angolan government and unita 
it was not immediately known whether angolan officials were 
aware of the talks which the post said took place in the ivory 
coast capital of abidjan between unita and a cuban delegation 
headed by cubas ambassador to the united nations oscar oramas 
the usmediated talks between south africa angola and cuba 
which were suspended last week for consultations by the parties

president reagan says hell go 
along with congress and grant most federal workers a 41 percent 
pay increase next year more than double the amount he had sought 
reagan in a letter to congressional leaders wednesday said 
improving economic conditions made possible the 41 percent 
increase although it earlier had appeared the government would be 
able to afford only 2 percent 
the raise contained in a bill already passed by congress but 
which has not yet reached reagans desk will go to federal workers 
now earning between 10000 and 75500 per year and will take 
effect in their first pay period of the new calendar year 
reagan expressed regret that a housesenate conference committee 
on appropriations did not extend the pay raises to higherpaid 
federal employees since they are the ones who lag most seriously 
behind privatesector pay 
he said he would recommend increases for them in the final 
budget message that he will send to congress before leaving office 
on jan 20 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater with the vacationing 
president in california said he did not know how much the pay 
increases would cost or how many employees would be covered 
reagan noted the advisory committee on federal pay had told him 
that increases in pay averaging 2628 percent effective in 
october would be necessary to make federal pay comparable with 
that in private employment 
fitzwater said this calculation did not take account of employee 
benefits which often are higher for government workers than for 
those in private industry 
we had earlier assumed for budget plannning purposes that 
economic conditions would only permit a 2 percent pay increase this 
year reagan wrote leaders of the house and senate 
however as the revitalization of the nations economy has 
continued on the course this administratiofn has set we have seen 
unemployment drop and free market forces have resulted in rising 
pay rates for american workers particularly in shortage 
occupations the federal government as an employer must compete 
like any other employer in the labor market for the skilled workers 
it needs 
the president said it was clear that economic conditions would 
not permit a pay increase of 2628 percent but would permit the 
smaller increase to ensure the continued quality of our nations 
civil service 
the president is required to make the pay determination annually 
under a federal law passed in 1970

floralas 85yearold mayor was hurt very 
much by a jurys swift decision to remove him from office for 
pardoning drunken drivers and embarrassing the town with voodoo 
pranks his lawyer says 
former mayor ht mathis ran out of the covington county 
courthouse without commenting on the jurys impeachment verdict 
wednesday reached after one hour of deliberations following a 
threeday trial 
city councilman jack inabinett immediately assumed mayoral 
duties and said he was conferring with the state attorney 
generals office about selecting mathis permanent successor 
mathis a firstterm mayor got national publicity for 
sprinkling voodoo powder around city hall and later holding a 
midnight news conference to proclaim national voodoo week 
he was accused of turning florala into a national laughingstock 
because of the voodoo pranks and undermining the towns legal 
process by pardoning convicted drunken drivers many of them more 
than once 
james prestwood mathis attorney said he would seek a new 
trial for the mayor who testified in circuit court that he 
pardoned dozens of convicted offenders because hes soft 
hearted 
he was hurt very much by the verdict prestwood said 
but city clerk betty hooten who testified for the prosecution 
said the town of 5000 near the florida border was now ready to 
pull together and get the bad publicity behind them 
the jury ruled that mathis should be removed from office on 
grounds of incompetence and neglect of duty circuit judge william 
baldwin said mathis was immediately ousted from office with the 
verdict 
mathis was elected in 1984 to a term that expires oct 3 
however municipal elections in florala have been postponed by a 
federal court because of a votingrights lawsuit and mathis might 
have remained in office indefinitely had he not been impeached 
alabama has no recall provision so an impeachment trial is the 
only way to remove a public official they are civil proceedings 
conducted in state courts but the defendant can request a jury 
officials who are found guilty of impeachment are only removed from 
office not fined or sent to jail

lines are legendary in moscow so its no 
surprise that the lunchtime queue snakes for 90 minutes most days 
at cafe kropotkinskya no 36 
whats unusual is that this restaurant does not belong to the 
state but to a cooperative founded by andrei fyodorov who has 
come here to whet the appetites of us businessmen for the soviet 
unions experiments in private enterprise 
he is the guest of joseph e seagram amp sons inc and is 
promoting his country as open as the wild west once was 
today the russian market should be of great interest to 
americans fyodorov who also is general secretary of the 
committee for cooperative business in moscow said recently through 
a translator the ussr now has limitless opportunities 
seagrams invited fyodorov and his wife helen because the 
soviet union is a good market for our products some of which 
already are sold in that country said robert i gandel vice 
president for special projects for seagrams overseas sales co 
fyodorov who worked many years for the soviet tourist agency 
expects to learn much about restaurants and to impart a good 
feeling for doing business with soviet cooperatives of all kinds 
seagrams hopes he will go home with an understanding of the way 
the restaurant business is run and the importance of wines and 
spirits in the hospitality business gandel said 
toward those ends fyodorovs schedule in the united states 
included visits with chefs and meals at new yorks toniest 
restaurants also planned were visits to a supermarket and farmers 
market a winery tour a new york power breakfast and a night at 
rockefeller centers rainbow room 
philadelphia and washington were also on the itinerary before 
the fyodorovs return to moscow on monday 
gandel said americans who have eaten at sovietrun restaurants 
would be surprised by cafe kropotkinskyas food and friendly 
professional service 
at a state restaurant gandel said there might be lipstick on a 
glass or a 90minute wait to be acknowledged by a waiter 
at cafe kropotkinskya which seats 200 it is far from perfect 
in service but the desire is there and eventually the tree will 
bear fruit said fyodorov who watches over every detail and 
planned to make sure by telephone that all was well in his absence 
in march 1987 cafe kropotkinskya no 36 named for its street 
address became the first of an estimated 300 cooperative 
restaurants in moscow 
it was an instant hit and now wouldbe diners without luncheon 
reservations wait in line outside the 19thcentury townhouse 1 
hours most days at night dont even bother to come by without a 
reservation fyodorov said 
is it the food 
no said fyorodov talking amid the quiet elegance of 
aurora a midtown manhattan restaurant where a reception was held 
to mark the start of his tour 
its paradoxical the first three days the food was good he 
said but constant lines make it impossible to work the constant 
pressure its a factory 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachev has said he is depending on 
cooperatives organized under a series of recent laws to provide 
consumer goods and services the inefficient staterun economy 
cannot 
but the lines and the high price of a meal as much as two days 
pay has led to allegations that the new restaurants motivated by 
profit cater to foreigners and privileged soviets 
one moscow street cartoon showed a naked man holding his 
briefcase strategically and standing at his door opened by his 
shocked wife i just ate at the cooperative restaurant he 
explains 
such a reputation is a problem fyodorov acknowledged but he 
argued that soviets can afford to eat in his restaurant if only 
for special occasions and that no one would complain if a family 
reserved a table and ordered just four coffees and a couple of 
appetizers 
still fyodorov said he has no plans to lower prices as long 
as the restaurant is full only the market could lower prices 
there is some justification cooperative employees are better 
paid than people doing similar jobs for the state he said and to 
get fresh produce and meat fyodorov said he usually pays three 
times the normal cost and in cash 
his fish he said is alive and kicking when he gets it of 
his veal he boasted two hours ago it was alive 
some cooperatives now have been given permission to deal in 
foreign currencies which unlike rubles are good on world markets 
but enabling us entrepreneurs to make a profit in the soviet 
union remains an obstacle though fyodorov said it only takes 
desire from both ends we are prepared to open opportunities to 
american entrepreneurs 
everyone wants to eat and everyone is willing to pay for it 
we will find a way to divide up the money

educators were attacked for teaching such 
diverse subjects as birth control and the horror stories of author 
stephen king as far right groups last year continued to try to 
censor school curricula a liberal advocacy group says 
people for the american way said wednesday it counted 157 
incidents of extremist pressure on school systems or outright 
censorship challenges in the 198788 school year 
the civil liberties group said an alarming trend is that 
national and local pressure groups have adopted mainstream tactics 
they have lobbied state legislatures on curriculum guidelines 
and pressured textbook selection committees to reject books and 
programs that fail to pass their narrow sectarian litmus test 
said arthur j kropp president of the 270000member organization 
rebecca hageline director of communications for one group 
targeted in the report concerned women for america said it was 
typical of people for the american ways religious bigotry toward 
conservative christians 
parents have a right to have input into their childrens 
education she said 
the report said concerned women for america presented the 
barlow fla school board with 4456 petition signatures opposing 
teaching about contraception in sex education courses the board 
agreed the courses should stress abstinence and not mention 
contraception the report said 
among the 157 incidents people for the american way said it 
found was a dispute in panama city fla where a school board said 
60 books could not be used on a junior high supplementary reading 
list without its approval 
the policy later was reversed but the report said two books 
robert cormiers i am the cheese and farley mowats never cry 
wolf remain banned and a lawsuit is pending 
people for the american way said the most frequently challenged 
authors were judy blume and john steinbeck in seven cases each 
king four and cormier and jd salinger both three steinbecks 
novel of mice and men was the book most often singled out 
in parker colo patricia hermes novel a solitary secret 
about a 14yearold girls experience with incest was removed from 
the junior high to the high school library after a parents 
complaint 
in crown king ariz a teacher renamed her 666 reading club 
after parents and school board members objected that the number was 
a biblical sign for the devil the teacher who had picked it as 
the goal for how many pages students should read each month 
renamed it the 667 reading club 
in arlington texas in a high school production of a chorus 
line a homosexual character was changed to a victim of child 
abuse and references to sex were deleted 
in las cruces nm parents and conservative activists objected 
to halloween activities in several elementary schools as well as 
maurice sendaks where the wild things are the school district 
modified the activities but kept the book 
not all of the socalled censorship incidents came from the 
conservative end of the political spectrum 
paws list of incidents include a ban on inschool meetings of 
the teens for christ club at the high school in west fork ark 
after the american civil liberties union threatened a lawsuit

solidarity leader lech walesa walked with 
a bounce in his step as he left his house for his first meeting 
with senior officials of the communist government in more than six 
years 
not only did his longsought goal for talks with the government 
come true wednesday but it came on the anniversary of his greatest 
triumph the signing of the 1980 accords that legalized the soviet 
blocs first independent union federation 
for the 44yearold shipyard electrician who won the nobel peace 
prize in 1983 it was a testament to his unswerving determination 
not to give up on his vision of workers solidarity 
walesas vision was born in the december 1970 food price riots 
in which dozens of workers were killed by security forces along the 
baltic coast 
he was one of the workers who met later with the new communist 
party first secretary edward gierek gierek calmed the protest 
with promises to improve national leadership and inspired workers 
to chant we will help we will help 
but workers rose again in 1976 in a revolt brutally put down by 
authorities and walesa and a handful of associates began 
organizing illegal free trade unions along the coast 
when new price increases raised tensions in 1980 it was walesa 
who returned to lead the fight in two weeks that saw strikes 
spread nationwide he wrested from the government 22 concessions on 
social and trade union issues the most important guaranteeing the 
right to independent selfgoverning trade unions 
the accords were signed in the shipyard by walesa and 
thendeputy prime minister mieczyslaw jagielski on aug 31 1980 
and solidarity was born 
the triumph gave way to a euphoric but chaotic period that 
lasted 15 months before polish authorities accused the union of 
leading the country to anarchy imposed martial law and locked up 
walesa and thousands of his followers on dec 13 1981 
walesa was interned in a series of luxurious government homes 
until nov 13 1982 while locked up he was approached by various 
high officials in a bid to persuade him to endorse the governments 
emergency actions he refused 
solidarity was suspended and outlawed in october 1982 after 
walesas release from internment authorities did all in their 
power to make him a nonperson 
his photo and name rarely appeared in newspapers and never in a 
positive light he was called a tool of foreign powers and the 
former head of a former union one rather crude media campaign 
accused him of embezzling union funds 
but walesa continued leading the shellshocked remnants of the 
solidarity movement 
after martial law was lifted in july 1983 and most political 
prisoners were released in late 1986 solidarity began to function 
more and more openly 
walesa consolidated its leadership last year into a national 
executive commission with representatives from every region and 
with himself as chairman 
when strikes broke out on april 25 walesa joined a walkout in 
the shipyard despite his sense that the country wasnt ready he 
showed he still had the common touch comforting and inspiring 
young strikers half his age who sometimes lined up for his 
autograph 
the shipyard strike ended inconclusively may 10 but walesa 
vowed that next time it would be better prepared the latest round 
of strikes which began aug 16 showed a high degree of 
organization advisers fanned out around the country and a national 
information network was set up 
the strikes at last also resulted in an invitation from the 
government to talk to walesa who just moved into a new house with 
his wife danuta and eight children 
lt colonel wieslaw gornicki an aide to polish leader gen 
wojciech jaruzelski said walesa was invited as an eminent 
personality not as the chairman of a nonexistent union 
still it was significant that the government chose walesa to 
try to open a dialogue that could help lead the country out of 
economic despondency 
piotr konopka a walesa aide and adviser in gdansk savored the 
moment while walesa talked with interior minister czeslaw kiszczak 
and alternate politburo member stanislaw ciosek 
this union managed to survive managed not to lose its 
authority managed to keep its leader who today begins again to be 
a partner for talks a very necessary partner as it turned out 
he said

four senate seats the first the pri has ever relinquished and 139

will undertake a massive distribution of voting records literature 
and lawn signs to turn out older voters on behalf of democrat

the group planned to kick off its effort with news conferences 
today in 14 cities in wisconsin illinois california washington 
state and ohio

republicans led by presidential nominee george 
bush have repeatedly criticized massachusetts governor michael 
dukakis for granting pardons to more than 230 exconvicts since 
1983 but records show he has been tougher on the issue than his 
gop predecessors 
the massachusetts civic interest council in a report released 
tuesday said the democratic presidential nominee pardoned 232 
people between 1983 and 1987 
the council a nonprofit research organization founded and 
initially funded by state gop chairman ray shamie claims no ties 
to the republican leader and bull purdun president of the 
council said it was not trying to make an overall judgment 
about dukakis 
the report showed dukakis cleared criminal records ranging from 
five cases of manslaughter to 136 cases of breaking and entering 
and that 21 of his pardons were granted to people convicted of 
selling or possessing with intent to sell drugs 
however figures provided by the governors statehouse press 
office show that dukakis has granted fewer pardons than his 
predecessors 
republican governor john volpe granted 1324 pardons between 
1965 and 1968 and gop frank sargent granted 1755 pardons between 
1969 and 1974

rightwing president augusto pinochet 
made a rare plea for opposition support in his bid to rule until 
1997 while the generals supporters and foes reportedly battled in 
the streets of a southern city 
according to radio cooperative of santiago 10 people were 
injured one seriously when pro and antipinochet demonstrators 
clashed wednesday in the city of valdivia about 500 miles south of 
santiago 
police arrested 30 of the demonstrators the radio said quoting 
a local youth leader of the opposition christian democratic party 
in santiago students opposed to pinochet protested wednesday in 
two small demonstrations broken up by police who reported 19 
arrests and no injuries 
in a 20minute address broadcast to the nation via radio and 
television wednesday night pinochet said he planned to forge a 
new democracy offering economic progress and legal safeguards 
against communism 
this ambitious challenge is not the task of only some said 
the 72yearold pinochet who seized power in a bloody 1973 coup 
our democracy needs the collaboration of all chileans 
our democracy will be enriched and improved by 
disagreement and legitimate pluralism he added 
the speech was pinochets first formal campaign address since 
his nomination tuesday by fellow military commanders as the sole 
candidate in an oct 5 presidential referendum the selection 
prompted street disturbances in which three people were killed at 
least 20 injured and more than 800 arrested 
the farce has been consumated the president of the centrist 
christian democratic party patricio aylwin said wednesday of 
pinochets nomination as was foreseeable pinochet imposed 
his force and ambition 
members of a 16party opposition coalition on wednesday signed 
an accord calling for full democracy 
if pinochet wins a majority of votes in the ballot he will 
begin a new eightyear term starting in march if a majority of the 
citizens vote no in the referendum a multicandidate election 
will be held in 1990 with pinochet remaining in power until then 
if pinochet loses the referendum accord also calls for changes 
in a 1980 constitution drafted by the government which grants the 
military strong supervisory powers over national policy 
opposition leaders whom pinochet has in the past denounced as 
traitors cowards and rats were considered highly 
unlikely to heed his appeal for their support 
many polls show pinochet trailing the opposition in voter 
support and the speech indicated plans to promote a conciliatory 
image in the campaign 
pinochet spoke to chileans whom he addressed as my dear 
friends in the style of a fireside chat with a framed 
photograph of his wife on a wooden desk surrounded by a chilean 
flag a computer and books 
even his supporters admit pinochet suffers from a dictatorial 
image after imposing fierce political repression following the coup 
that brought him to power he suspended many civil liberties and 
ordered thousands of leftists arrested or expelled 
hundreds of citizens were killed or disappeared after being 
arrested by security forces human rights groups say 
the coup toppled the elected government of president salvador 
allende a selfdeclared marxist and ended decades of democratic 
rule 
in his address pinochet said the coup saved chile from becoming 
a marxist slave state

opponents waved the flag and sang o canada to 
decry what they called a sellout of national sovereignty as the 
house of commons overwhelmingly approved a sweeping trade bill that 
will open the border to more us goods and services 
prime minister brian mulroneys progressive conservatives with 
207 of the 282 seats in commons easily defeated the combined 
opposition on wednesday and sent the bill to the senate on a 17764 
vote 
members of the oppositiondominated senate vowed to stall the 
bill which was signed jan 2 by president reagan and mulroney 
the deal would amend 27 federal statutes to eliminate tariffs 
and reduce other barriers in nearly every facet of the 150 billion 
annual trading partnership between the neigbors 
proponents including big business have touted it as a boon to 
business and jobs and say it will cut the 2 billion a year in 
tariffs that canadian businesses and consumers pay on us imports 
opponents who include labor and cultural leaders say the deal 
threatens canadas sovereignty they argue that jobs will be lost 
as us businesses move into the canadian market 
this is a very positive development for jobs for the youth of 
canada for their economic future mulroney told reporters after 
the vote 
in washington a spokesman for us trade representative clayton 
yeutter said the united states has invested a lot of time energy 
and money negotiating the deal the us house of representatives 
has approved the bill and it is expected to pass the senate this 
month 
we are pleased the house of commons overwhelmingly passed the 
freetrade agreement because we believe the deal is good for both 
countries the spokesman kelly winkler said 
liberal parliament members unfurled a fullsize canadian flag 
and sang the national anthem o canada to interrupt the final 
vote on the deal which is scheduled to take effect jan 1 and be 
phased in over a 10year period 
they were joined by new democrats who had their own miniature 
canadian flags 
proponents of the bill wore buttons canadian flag buttons that 
read free trade stronger canada 
some protesters were removed from a visitors gallery after they 
interrupted the vote by chanting we want an election 
the liberal majority in the senate has vowed to block the bill 
until after the next election which mulroney has indicated will be 
this fall before the deal takes effect 
house speaker john fraser twice admonished legislators to settle 
down and told them to put down their flags 
the battle goes to the people the people of canada said 
liberal leader john turner as he left the commons 
trade minister john crosbie acknowledged that the deal is far 
from complete well do whatever is required in reference to the 
senate but in the meantime well wait and see what happens as far 
as an election is concerned 
gordon ritchie canadas deputy chief trade negotiator over the 
two years of talks with the united states agreed were saving 
the champagne for senate ratification he said 
under the trade agreement both countries would begin phasing 
out border taxes quotas standards and other regulations that stop 
or discourage trade disputes could be referred to fivemember 
panels of trade experts from both countries for settlement 
public opinion surveys indicate canadians are nearly equally 
divided on the agreement 
opposition stems from a variety of areas ontario grape growers 
for example are upset because the pact would eliminate an 
automatic 65 percent markup on usmade wine 
procanada network a coalition of labor social womens farm 
and other groups believes the bill could turn canada into the 51st 
state canadians are outnumbered by their powerful neighbor 101 
protests broke out across canada the day reagan and mulroney 
signed the bill more than 1000 unionorganized protesters 
chanting no free trade disrupted traffic for half an hour on 
the ambassador bridge between windsor ontario and detroit 
a smaller peaceful demonstration was held at peace bridge 
between fort erie ontario and buffalo ny 
protesters in london ontario filled a black coffin with 
canadian products they said would be endangered if cheaper us 
goods flooded the country one schoolteacher told the crowd i 
teach your children we want a future for them theres no way i 
want to use textbooks made in the united states

the crew of a delta jetliner that crashed 
at dallasfort worth international airport had clean flying 
records and the plane had only minor problems recently according 
to federal aviation administration records 
a pumplike device known as a power controller actuator on a 
wing flap had to be replaced in july 1987 after a flap on the delta 
air lines boeing 727s right wing jammed the documents filed in 
the last five years said 
the actuator which is activated as part of the process of 
operating the flaps during takeoffs and landings was removed and 
returned to the manufacturer and a new one was installed 
according to the records at the agencys headquarters here 
inspectors in august 1983 found two small cracks in the fuselage 
skin the faa records said the first crack measured onehalf inch 
in length at the corner of the pilots window the other found in 
an inspection the same month was threequarters of an inch long at 
the upper corner of the captains windshield the report said 
bobbie mardis a spokeswoman for the faa described the problems 
as very minor 
a report showed that on nov 13 1986 at raleigh nc the 
aircraft didnt stay at the altitude assigned by air traffic 
controllers ms mardis said 
the aircraft was built by boeing in 1973 and delivered new to 
delta the faa said 
none of the crew of wednesdays flight pilot larry davis 
copilot carey wilson kirkland jr and flight engineer stephen judd 
had a previous record of accident incident or violation ms 
mardis said 
the three were among the nearly 100 survivors of wednesdays 
crash which occurred during take off the cause of the crash was 
not determined federal investigators said davis 48 has been a 
delta pilot since 1965 and a boeing 727 captain for the last nine 
years kirkland 37 was hired by delta in 1979 and judd has been 
with delta since november said airline spokesman henry conley in 
dallas 
the jetliner was powered by jt8d engines manufactured by 
connecticutbased pratt amp whitney which sent two investigators to 
the scene 
the engines are a mainstay of the airline industry according to 
david m long a pratt amp whitney spokesman long said the company 
routinely sends investigators to crashes in which aircraft are 
powered by pratt amp whitney engines 
long said it was way to early to speculate on the cause of 
the crash 
the jt8d received its initial certification from the faa in 1967 
and about 10000 are now in use it provides a thrust at takeoff of 
14000 to 18000 pounds according to pratt amp whitney documents 
problems with jt8d engines were cited as factors in 1985 airline 
crashes in london and milwaukee

when john sawyer landed his 
singleengine airplane on a street here recently to conduct some 
business he also landed in trouble 
city officials are seeking a court injunction to make sure he 
doesnt use streets for runways again 
sawyer landed his airplane on a street aug 24 in this city of 
15000 people 20 miles northwest of denver to conduct business at 
the nearby colorado tech center 
city administrator dave stahl happened to glance out his 
secondfloor office window to see the small plane preparing to land 
since there was no airport in that direction stahl and police 
officers investigated ending up with a chat with sawyer who 
couldnt understand what the fuss was about 
sawyer a telecommunications consultant said he routinely uses 
his plane to make business calls in the area and has flown in to 
the tech center four times during the past four months to pick up 
equipment or attend meetings 
he said he doesnt leave the plane in the street he parks it in 
the company parking lot 
i didnt even come within 500 feet of a building sawyer 
said 
thats like saying theres no buildings on us 36 so you 
could land there stahl said when you land a plane on a public 
street you dont know if a pedestrian car bicyclist or 
motorcyclist are in the area 
but sawyer said its a city street in name only theres not 
even any light poles around its vacant land theres zilch 
traffic out there 
it looks far more like a landing strip than a road 
sawyer challenged city officials to cite a law forbidding planes 
from landing on city streets the city responded by pointing to its 
zoning laws and seeking an injunction in boulder district court to 
ban sawyer from making runways out of louisville streets 
mitch baker public affairs officer for the federal aviation 
administration in seattle said there is no federal law prohibiting 
a plane from landing on a public street 
but he said faa regulations prohibit landings that endanger 
people on the ground 
i intend to fight it sawyer said of the citys court 
action im not doing this for fun its for convenience

share prices plunged on the tokyo stock exchange on 
thursday while the us dollar rose sharply against the yen 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues the tokyo stock 
markets main barometer closed at 2693426 points down 43169 
points or 158 percent 
in foreign exchange trading the dollar which opened at 13620 
yen 123 yen higher than wednesdays close finished at 13670 
yen up 173 yen 
the dollars rise was due to a selloff of the yen by investors 
according to foreign exchange analysts sumio fukushima of sumitomo 
bank in tokyo said one of the factors cited was the bank of japans 
announcement wednesday that it would not raise interest rates 
toshiaki kakimoto chief economist at sumitomo bank said 
investors who had been selling west german marks now were targeting 
the yen 
after interest rates rose in europe last week the rate in 
japan has become the lowest and investors started selling the yen 
to buy more dollars he said 
but kakimoto speculated the fluctuating exchange rate was 
temporary 
finance minister kiichi miyazawa dismissed concern over the 
yens downswing currency rates change every day said miyazawa 
on the stock exchange share prices were lower across the board 
according to an analyst with nomura securities in tokyo 
almost nothing has been traded this morning because investors 
were shocked by the yens downfall he said 
i almost jumped up when i found out the bank of japan had 
announced they would not raise interest rates because investors 
certainly would lose interest in the yen the analyst said

syrias faltering economy lack of 
allies and friction with moscow lessen the chances that damascus 
would engage israel in a war according to an israeli think tank 
the assessment contrasts with frequent warnings from israeli 
officials and military commanders who stress the military threat 
posed by the sovietbacked syrian regime 
the study released wednesday by tel aviv universitys jaffee 
center for strategic studies also says enhanced arab capabilities 
means israels rear echelon is no longer immune to missile or 
chemical weapons attack 
the 498page annual study entitled middle east military 
balance says syrias total armed forces have declined from 840000 
in 1986 to 730000 last year it says president hafez assad was 
last year forced to trim his defense budget by about 100 million 
or 3 percent 
due to extreme economic difficulties syria was forced to 
mothball a couple of divisions and remains without allies it also 
increasingly appears to be encountering differences of opinions 
with the soviets joseph alpher executive editor of the study 
said in an interview 
retired brig gen aharon levran a former intelligence officer 
wrote in the report that the belttightening genuinely weakened 
syrias armed forces by reducing training time and cutting back on 
fuel and food for the troops 
alpher predicted the end of the iraniraq war will likely 
increase the traditional rivalry between baghdad and damascus that 
and the unresolved conflict in lebanon could preoccupy syria 
he said syria has warehoused hundreds of tanks and turned 
regular army units into reserve forces 
if a state plans to go to war in the next six months or a 
year it usually doesnt do things like that said levran who 
also commanded armor and infantry units before retiring in 1984 
the jaffee center experts said that in any future war israel 
would be more vulnerable to attacks aimed at population centers or 
locations where reserve units are mobilized 
they said syria iraq and saudi arabia had developed 
intermediate range ballistic missiles chemical warheads and longer 
range air power 
i see a very reasonable possibility that they will be used on 
military targets in a possible future war and maybe even the home 
front said retired brig gen aryeh shalev of the jaffee center 
alpher said iraq became the first arab country to develop 
longrange bombing capability even though it was only 18 percent 
effective in hitting targets 
at least on paper that air arm could be used against israel 
just as it was used in long range bombing runs all the way to the 
straits of hormuz in the persian gulf alpher said 
he also said iraq had emerged from the war with a large army and 
a newly developed ability to move armor quickly with an impressive 
force of 3000 tank transporters 
in the future he said such a capability could allow iraq to 
bring more and better forces to israels eastern front than in 
the past 
he also noted saudi arabia had acquired longrange missiles from 
china and that other such missiles were being developed by iraq 
with egypt and argentina and by libya with brazil 
we looked around us and suddenly saw that we were surrounded 
by countries that had an intermediate range ballistic missile 
capacity with the exception of jordan and lebanon alpher said 
he said iraq had semilegitimized the use of chemical 
weapons during the persian gulf war and this could result in such 
weapons being used against israel in a future war 
the israeli analysis says the syrians indicated they have 
developed chemical warheads only as a counter to israels perceived 
edge in nuclear potential the probability that they would be 
used in a war against israel seems low because of israels 
enhanced retaliatory capability 
alpher said that despite iraqs increased capabilities it is 
unlikely president saddam hussein would want to plunge his country 
into a new military conflict after eight years of war

on a glorious texas morning delta 
flight 1141 pulled away at 831 am from gate 15 at dallasfort 
worth international airports terminal 4e to continue a flight 
that began in jackson miss 
then in the hazy sunshine that so previews a hot august day the 
boeing 727 carrying more than 100 people to salt lake city idled 
for 30 minutes on a taxiway 
just after 9 am capt larry davis received clearance from the 
tower and steered the jet down a runway toward the south end of the 
sprawling airfield 
we didnt make 50 feet in the air said jim hammock of 
garland who was aboard the plane 
then the plane bounced 
we all just clinched said michelle christensen 25 of 
dallas 
it bounced again 
oh my god melissa lewis 24 of tupelo miss cried out 
she began praying out loud 
the plane bounced yet a third time 
the ride got very rough said bernard glim 69 of north 
port fla 
we were tossed back and forth said his wife natalie 
it was relatively quiet inside 
we veered to the right said peter wright of dallas i 
heard a banging noise under the carriage and then someone said 
were not going to make it 
everything got dark 
and then it was orange ms christensen said 
smoke filled the cabin flames licked outside 
the smoke was coming down fearfully glim said it came 
down to id say about 2 feet from the floor it was difficult to 
breathe it was very tight trying to get to any place in the plane 
particularly a hatch 
you were just looking for a way to get out of the plane 
said penn waugh of dallas youre hoping you werent going to 
die 
someone kicked the door open 
it was a big fire according to 5yearold evan wood who 
was traveling with his mother and 2yearold brother we jumped 
out 
the fuselage cracked about 5 feet behind the cockpit it 
cracked again about 25 feet from the rear of the plane and about 5 
feet in front of the engines and rolled on its side 
you just slide down the side and jump penn waugh said 
everybody kept jumping one side was on fire so you couldnt get 
out on the left side you had to crawl out the right side 
people were saying lets get out of here lets get out 
the wings were red hot from the heat the flames intensified 
but at least 94 people would survive 
we were just terrified we jumped on the wing but it looked 
like we were jumping into a pit of fire said mona thomason

above below and on board doomed delta 
air lines flight 1141 people realized something was terribly 
wrong they watched horrified as the plane skidded off a runway 
splintered crashed and burned 
then they marveled that anyone survived the accident wednesday 
at dallasfort worth international airport the crash killed 13 
but at least 94 survived authorities said 
i saw it take off and i knew something was wrong said lon 
might an airport employee 
passengers in a commuter plane arriving at the airport spotted 
the boeing 727 struggling to get airborne and shouted encouragement 
to the pilot 
we were cheering this guy to get the plane off the ground 
said gene metzig it was very emotional 
said michelle christensen 25 a dallas real estate agent aboard 
flight 1141 the minute we took off the ground i knew we were 
going to crash 
from an office building edward leb looked out and noticed the 
aircraft was not flying in a normal position that it was almost 
level with the ground and its nose barely was up 
and then it just fell straight down it fell like a pancake on 
its big belly the back end lower than the front end leb said 
at an airport toll booth mary centron 47 of hurst who 
witnessed a delta air lines crash here three years ago knew at 
once the plane was flying too damn low to be taking off 
sobbing nauseated and recalling the previous tragedy in which 
137 died she said the tail disappeared first and next the nose 
disappeared behind a hill and then there was a humongous fireball 
i didnt think anybody had made it 
aboard the craft en route from jackson miss to salt lake 
city via dallas passenger peter wright heard a banging noise 
under the carriage and then someone exclaim were not going to 
make it 
within moments of its 9 am takeoff flight 1141 dropped like a 
wounded bird from the cloudless sky skidded off the runway 
bounced into a field of waisthigh prairie grass and broke apart in 
flames smoke and debris 
the crash ripped off one wing and two engines tore three gaping 
holes in the fuselage and left the crippled aircraft with its tail 
dangling and its nose twisted grotesquely to one side 
it looks like a beached and dying bottlenosed dolphin said 
a photographer others said it resembled a giant stricken goose 
no one could say with certainty what happened only that the 
death toll could have been staggering authorities indicated most 
of the deaths were caused by burns and smoke inhalation and that 
most of the injuries were cuts scrapes and bruises 
we feel lucky there were only 13 victims said dr nizam 
peerwani the tarrant county medical examiner initially we were 
told there would be 60 bodies so we were prepared for the worst 
jim hartman department of public safety officer at the airport 
called it incredible that so many survived in fact early 
reports from the control tower indicated the crash was 
nonsurvivable 
said norman newcity 36 a georgia businessman hospitalized with 
a broken heel it was just like a roller coaster ride with 
everything coming apart everything flying apart 
we were going down the runway and the sound of the engine 
changed said melissa lewis 24 a graduate student at 
mississippi state university there was a different sound 
other passengers said they heard knocking noises or popping 
sounds or loud thumps and dale patterson 36 of plano thought it 
sounded like it blew a tire 
but dan walker a 40yearold dallas veterinarian said there 
was no audible explosion before the crash he said the plane did 
encounter turbulence before it veered out of control and 
insisted that the pilot did an excellent job of bringing it down 
on its belly 
walker suffered a fractured rib but was treated and released 
two dallasarea friends with him on a planned fishing excursion to 
montana were hospitalized with more serious injuries 
austin attorney rick arnett seated in a plane on the ground 
said he and other passengers saw the wobbly delta jetliner through 
their windows and were hollering get up get up 
but it was not to be

northwestern section of the country wont get any relief from the 
unusually hot dry weather that has contributed to fires ravaging 
the area until well after labor day 
government broadcasters said wednesday abovenormal temperatures 
will persist over much of the west during the next five days 
through the labor day weekend and a trend toward rain and cooler 
temperatures wont begins until sometime in october 
only the longer outlook through november brings cool wet 
conditions to the northwest the service said it should be 
warmer in the southwest and california and most areas of the east 
with rain extending up the mississippi and ohio valleys to the 
great lakes and midatlantic regions 
the service added that streamflows are expected to remain below 
average across much of the country and water reserves at major 
reservoirs remain average to below average for this time of year

the library of congress has received what it 
called the greatest composite gift in the history of its music 
division 
the library announced wednesday that hans moldenhauer a 
spokane wash pianist teacher and musicologist who died last 
october bequeathed to it several thousand documents written by 
composers musicians and literary figures dating to the 12th 
century including handwritten musical scores by beethoven chopin 
and mendelssohn 
the bequest received in july represents the overwhelming bulk 
of the moldenhauer collection which the library described as one 
of the greatest archives of musical primary source materials ever 
assembled 
the oldest of the documents apparently is 18 lines of latin text 
on vellum with musical notations from a 12th century german 
prayer book 
among the many composers represented in the collection is a copy 
in ludwig van beethovens handwriting of music from mozarts opera 
don giovanni probably written as studies for portions of 
beethovens only opera fidelio

the confusing scene at the dallasfort worth 
airport and delta air lines policy of not counting infants riding 
its flights free contributed to erroneous reports of how many 
people died aboard flight 1141 airline officials said 
at least one infant was among the 13 passengers known to have 
died when the boeing 727 crashed and caught fire seconds after 
takeoff from dallasfort worth international airport on wednesday 
at least 94 passengers and crew escaped although some 
discrepancies remained early today between lists provided by 
hospitals and delta 
the number of casualties fluctuated throughout the day 
wednesday from seven to 15 down to nine up to 11 and then to 13 
bill berry a delta spokesman in atlanta said one reason for 
the discrepancies was that officials werent sure how many children 
under age 2 were aboard 
an infant does not buy a ticket and if it does not buy a 
ticket so many times you are going to have a discrepancy in your 
manifest count berry said 
he said passengers dont normally notify ticket agents that they 
plan to take an infant on board 
at least three infants were aboard the jet he said one was 
among the dead but the fates of the others werent known 
part of the problem berry said was that emergency personnel on 
the scene requested 15 body bags initially leading delta 
officials to give out an erroneous casualty figure later some 
victims died at hospitals 
victims were taken to eight hospitals 
as you well know in these types of situations the numbers 
often fluctuate until you can get various hospitals contacted

president jose azcona hoyo blamed 
the influx to his country of nicaraguan rebels and their civilian 
supporters on a lack of democracy under the sandinista government 
he said more than 240000 of the guerrillas known as contras 
have fled across the border into honduran camps since april a 
figure honduran officials say includes 11000 rebels and 13000 
civilians an estimated 2000 rebels remain inside nicaragua 
the lack of democracy by the sandinistas is paid for by 
honduras which is a victim of the central american problem 
azcona hoyo said wednesday it is necessary to strengthen the 
struggle to democratize nicaragua 
azcona hoyo said the leftist sandinistas deliberately lifted 
protection of their border to allow the contras to move into 
honduras 
other estimates say the number of contras in honduras who 
receive food medicine clothing and other nonlethal us aid 
totals 14000 including 9000 rebels and 5000 civilians the 
exodus began in april after nicaraguan government forces withdrew 
from two northern border areas under a march 23 peace plan 
the united states which has supplied and trained the rebels 
since 1981 cut off military aid to the contras at the end of 
february congress has refused to renew the funding saying it 
would violate a ceasefire the two sides have agreed to 
however congress earmarked 17 million in nonlethal aid to the 
rebels supplied on condition that it go to honduras not 
nicaragua the supplies began arriving in april and are being 
distributed by the agency for international development

jerry weeks said he rushed to help at 
the scene of the fiery crash of delta air lines flight 1141 because 
he could not ignore another tragedy at dallasforth worth 
international airport 
i just bit my lip and went said weeks 45 who runs an 
airport shuttle bus company and has long regretted not offering his 
aid after the 1985 crash of delta flight 191 which killed 137 
people and injured 25 others 
when 191 occurred i was driving trucks and had just seen a 
terrible accident in which some girls were beheaded he said 
im tough and ive seen plenty of horrendous wrecks as a truck 
driver but i was near the airport when 191 crashed and i just 
couldnt go 
it was a different story wednesday when weeks who is married to 
an american airlines flight attendant became one of the first to 
arrive and offer assistance after the crash which killed at least 
13 people 
at first weeks and an irving policeman he was with assumed the 
thick column of billowing black smoke was merely a controlled 
burn another of the frequent drills held at the airport to 
prepare emergency workers for plane crashes 
but eusebio padilla who drives a bus for weeks airport shuttle 
service called in on the company radio to say he had just seen a 
plane go down 
padilla 31 said he was putting gas in his bus at a filling 
station on the south side of the airport when the crash occurred 
it got up to about 30 or 40 feet up in the air then it veered 
to one side and went out of my sight padilla said two 
seconds later i hear a large explosion i see smoke and flames 
probably 30 feet up in the air 
weeks in turn called police to report that a plane had just 
crashed on the southwest quadrant of the airport police already 
had received a handful of similar reports 
weeks arrived at the crash site within 10 minutes remembering 
flight 191 and figuring he would join a team in the grim task of 
tramping through brush for remains when the smoke cleared he was 
shocked at what he found 
it wasnt a violent crash he recalled about a dozen 
survivors were standing up and walking around nobody was terribly 
distraught 
weeks went from survivor to survivor all waiting to be 
transported to area hospitals and asked if he could call anyone 
for them five of them took advantage of his offer he also offered 
free transportation to relatives upon their arrival to dallas 
it could have been so much worse weeks said if you look 
at where this plane stopped youll notice if stopped a couple 
hundred yards short of water tanks when delta 191 crashed it hit 
the same kind of tanks on the other side of the airport and look 
what happened it could have been worse 
weeks a pilot himself for 20 years said his first thought was 
that he didnt want to see an air crash in person his wife had 
been due to take off in chicago in 1979 when an american airlines 
dc10 crashed killing 275 he suffered through a couple of hours 
until he learned it was not her plane 
it is a worry shared by anyone married to an airline crew 
member weeks said 
you can be tough as a boot but your heart still stops when 
you hear theres a plane down

massachusetts joins montana today as the only 
states barring life insurance companies from their common practice 
of charging men higher rates than women 
massachusetts regulations became effective after a state 
appellate judge refused wednesday to delay the debut of the 
socalled unisex rules women generally pay less than men for life 
insurance because women statistically live longer than men and 
therefore have more years to pay premiums 
the ruling by state appeals judge joseph warner came in an 
11thhour appeal in a classaction suit filed by nine life 
insurance policyholders the lawsuit sought a temporary injunction 
to block the regulations from taking effect until the case goes to 
trial 
we are disappointed obviously that the regulations have not 
been enjoined said peter lauriat an attorney for the nine 
plaintiffs he predicted it will be at least three to six months 
before the case is heard in berkshire county where it was filed 
the plaintiffs contend that life insurance companies will raise 
rates for women to comply with the regulations 
but assistant attorney general countess c williams argued that 
it is not clear women will pay higher premiums under the new 
regulations 
life insurance rates are unregulated in massachusetts although 
it is anticipated that insurers will blend their male and 
female rates to reach a middle ground there is no requirement to 
do so lauriat said 
instead lauriat and some industry officials expect some 
companies will simply raise womens rates to what men are charged 
which could add hundreds of dollars a year to some womens premiums 
under the regulations ordered by insurance commissioner roger 
singer life insurance companies are barred from using sex as a 
basis for setting prmiums or benefits just as the use of race 
color religion marital status and national origin are prohibited 
because the case hasnt been fully argued at the lower court 
level warners decision wednesday was limited to affirming that 
berkshire superior court judge john l moriarty committed no 
error or abuse of discretion when he rejected the temporary 
injunction request a week ago 
montana requires unisex insurance pricing under a state law 
passed in 1985 a study indicated that after initial premium 
increases of less than 10 percent for women premiums were expected 
to decrease and dividend returns were expected to increase

jim bakker made the highest bid for the 
assets of ptl moving him a giant step closer toward recapturing 
the television ministry he was forced to leave after a sex and 
money scandal 
ptl bankruptcy trustee mc red benton said he expected 
today to formalize the 165 million proposal bakker made wednesday 
to buy the heritage usa christian retreat ptl television network 
and other assets 
bakker and his attorney jim toms met wednesday with benton to 
outline their plan 
weve discussed the terms weve agreed on everything 
benton said the lawyers are now documenting it and as soon as 
the papers are ready and everybodys agreed we probably will 
both sign it and then well have us a deal 
toms said bakker intends to present a letter of credit and to 
make a formal announcement today of the plan which could total 
200 million when money for improvements and repairs at heritage 
usa is included 
final approval of bids for ptls assets rests with bankruptcy 
judge rufus reynolds who set a sept 10 deadline for benton to 
present any offers to buy the ministry which is under chapter 11 
protection from creditors 
canadian real estate magnate peter thomas chairman of samoth 
capital corp had offered 113 million thomas said wednesday he 
was unwilling to increase his bid and enter a bidding war but 
was skeptical of bakkers proposal 
bakker has been all talk so far and unwilling to reveal his 
financial backers he said it makes one wonder where hes 
getting the cash from 
thomas said from his office in vancouver that his 1 million 
deposit was mailed back to him but he added that his offer would 
be renewed if bakker fails to come up with the funding 
ptl filed for bankruptcy reorganization in june 1987 three 
months after bakker left the ministry amid allegations of misuse of 
money and revelations of his sexual encounter with church secretary 
jessica hahn 
bakker was greeted wednesday at the offices of the jim and tammy 
ministries his new ministry by cheers of praise god and 
thank you jesus 
as it stands now we will be able to have heritage usa its 
been a long wait bakker said to the applause of his followers 
bakker said he has the financial backing for a bid that totals 
at least 165 million including about 70 million in cash up front 
at closing and up to 15 million to pay off debts owed kansas 
contractor roe messner who was ptls prime builder 
bakker also plans to obtain an 80 million mortgage on 1000 
acres of undeveloped land at heritage usa the money would be a 
guarantee that he will restore the benefits of ptls major 
contributors its socalled lifetime partners 
when you boil it all down its a matter of who would provide 
the most dollars for the creditors benton said he said there 
remained the possibility that someone could come up with a better 
bid but its getting late he said 
benton had said he wanted all bids in before today 
bakker said his financial backer is a corporation of 28 
international business people who pool their money for investments 
in the us he said the terms of his agreement with the backer 
prevented him from further identifying those involved 
toms said a lawsuit filed by ptl officials seeking to recover 
52 million from the bakkers and his top aides for allegedly 
mismanaging ministry funds should not impede approval of the 
plan 
part of the negotiations included that all claims would be 
assumed by the new owner toms said if the suit were to 
continue after bakker regained the ministry he would essentially 
be suing himself

rival gang members emerged from peace talks 
and stripped off their gang colors donning white tshirts as 
symbolic evidence of their commitment to become silent warriors 
against street warfare 
the gang members joined ministers and actor robert blake at a 
news conference wednesday following two days of talks at a secret 
location 
they will not be known as gangs they will be known as silent 
warriors were not forming a larger gang were not forming a 
super gang to terrorize the city said the rev charles mims jr 
organizer of two socalled gang summits held here this summer 
about 50 members of various factions of the bloods and crips 
gangs took off their shirts on the steps of city hall and put on 
the tshirts depicting figures of the rival black gangs shaking 
hands 
blake who played an innercity priest who helped street 
hoodlums in the shortlived tv series hell town said he has 
been helping young people for 30 years and never witnessed such an 
effort as the gang summit 
i swear to you on the heads of my children that what ive seen 
in the last couple of days is an absolute miracle said blake 
who sat in on the talks 
i have been on the bus with crips and bloods together ive 
been in the room when theyre eating lunch together ive been with 
them when theyve held hands and prayed in a circle together i 
swear on my life that what ive seen in the last couple of days i 
never thought i would see till the day i died 
the second gang summit was attended by about 90 gang members in 
southcentral los angeles the area hardest hit by the gang 
violence that has claimed more than 200 lives in los angeles county 
this year 
rival gang members of watts attended a gang summit and 
challenge all other rival gang members to join us in stopping the 
violence and killing in our neighborhoods said a gang member 
called twilight who also participated in the first talks 
mims said no truce had been called but 15 factions have pledged 
to end their gang affiliations lay down their weapons and form a 
network to bring about peace 
these young people want jobs they want homes they want wives 
and children and dogs in the front yard and birds in the back he 
said 
critics contend the gang summits are a futile gesture in the 
face of the estimated 70000 gang members and 600 gangs in los 
angeles but mims said a journey of 1000 miles starts with one 
step

the rev jesse jackson shook hands to seal a 
shaky truce with mayor edward i koch but warned the mayors 
reelection hopes could be hurt by his attacks on jackson during 
the new york presidential primary 
todays meeting did not focus on april 1988 i did not ask 
the mayor to respond to april of 88 it is the people of this city 
who must respond jackson said wednesday after a more than 
twohour peace session convened by gov mario cuomo 
koch who apologized for the stridency of his attacks on jackson 
during primary told a packed news conference we did not engage 
in recreating history we did not talk about the past but about 
the future michael dukakis election 
the mayor also revealed he would not use any of the photos shot 
with jackson on wednesday during his bid for a fourth term and 
seemed to surprise jackson by shaking his hand new yorks mayoral 
elections are next year 
koch endorsed sen albert gore jr of tennessee in the 
democratic primary and vociferously opposed jackson suggesting 
jews would be crazy to vote for a candidate with jacksons 
positions on the middle east blacks reacted with outrage as did 
many jews 
on wednesday koch praised jackson for his generosity of 
spirit and both democrats vowed they would work toward a dukakis 
victory in november koch promised he would never again attack 
jacksons or other politicians integrity but would limit his 
fusillades to the issues 
but jacksons actions belied the upbeat words at no point 
during the news conference did the democratic leader stand directly 
beside koch and he kept a dour expression despite several attempts 
at levity by the mayor 
jackson dismissed questions about his personal feelings toward 
koch telling reporters i bear no animosity in my heart toward 
anyone the black civil rights leader also said he never expected 
an apology from koch 
i didnt request an apology i dont need it and the people 
who felt it anger against koch must be addressed he said 
cuomo who stood between the two as they entered the news 
conference said it was difficult for koch and jackson but 
especially for jackson to sit down and discuss a truce 
this was a conscious effort to work on an agenda not to 
create a new relationship said cuomo who praised the pair for 
sending a wonderful wonderful message to the nation

new eightyear high in august with a total of 1864 jews allowed 
to leave the country the agency helping them resettle said today 
but the number of armenians permitted to emigrate from the 
soviet union dropped to 223 in august from 1018 in the previous 
month the intergovernmental committee for migration said 
spokeswoman regina boucault had no explanation for the drop she 
said that so far this year 8241 armenians have been allowed to 
leave 
the jewish emigres represented the eighth straight monthly 
increase in the number of arrivals at the vienna austria transit 
center ms boucault said only 116 emigres opted to go to israel 
the august figure was the highest since may 1980 when 1976 
soviet jews were allowed to emigrate ms boucault said the 
eightmonth total for 1988 is now at 9560 emigres of whom 1046 
went to israel

a tribal court granted a nonindian 
couple permanent guardianship of a 13monthold navajo girl who had 
lived with them since birth but was brought to the reservation by 
indian social workers 
wednesdays ruling which settled a 4month dispute between the 
tribe and the biological mother and foster parents of allyssa 
kristian keetsopitts leaves the child with two mothers 
i dont have any problems with that a relieved cheryl pitts 
said after navajo tribal childrens court judge manuel watchman 
granted her and husband rick pitts permanent custody of allyssa 
while maintaining the parental and visitation rights of the 
biological mother patricia keetso 
ms keetso 22 a tribal member who has lived with the pittses 
in san jose calif since shortly before allyssas birth said she 
hoped her daughter would understand why she has two mothers 
thats the most important thing i didnt do this because i 
dont love her i did this because i love her so much i just hope 
shell understand ms keetso said 
while she was pregnant and unmarried ms keetso contacted the 
pittses about adoption through a newspaper advertisement she said 
she loves the pittses and considers them as family 
the case drew national attention in april when tribal social 
workers took the girl then 8 months old from the pittses and ms 
keetso at san joses airport and brought the child back to the 
reservation for three days 
the pittses originally sought outright adoption but the tribe 
intervened this year under the indian child welfare act which 
gives tribes jurisdiction over custody of indian children in 
adoption proceedings involving nonindians 
watchman approved an april 22 agreement giving the pittses 
permanent guardianship and custody a proposal supported by ms 
keetso and the childs grandparents susie and howard keetso 
under the agreement the tribe will retain jurisdiction until 
allyssa is 18 when she can petition for adoption pitts said 
mrs pitts 34 said allyssa will retain her culture and receive 
a navajo census number as an official tribal member we pretty 
much all got what we all wanted im so glad its over i feel 
really happy that we can go home and be a normal family she 
said her voice breaking 
pitts estimated that the legal proceedings surrounding allyssas 
custody had cost him and his wife 23000 to 25000 in addition to 
about 30000 in lost business 
but concerns over the couples financial ability to support the 
child and the childs retaining her navajo culture and heritage 
were satisfied by testimony at the hearing pitts said 
mrs pitts said she looked forward to not have to wake up 
every morning and wonder if she allyssa was going to be there or 
not

a flight of 279 amerasian children and 
relatives arrived today from vietnam bringing to more than 12300 
the number the united states has taken for resettlement since 1982 
a us embassy spokesman said 
the flight arrived in bangkok from ho chi minh city called 
saigon when it was the capital of the usbacked south vietnam 
government said spokesman ross petzing a flight of 334 amerasians 
and relatives the largest ever landed here on aug 22 he said 
the amerasians were fathered by us servicemen and civilians 
during the war which ended with the communist north vietnamese 
victory in april 1975 they have been emigrating to the united 
states under the united nationssponsored orderly departure program 
since september 1982 
most of the children stay in bangkok for a few days before going 
to a us refugee processing center in the philippines for 
englishlanguage training and orientation to life in the united 
states 
progress on humanitarian issues has been hampered by the lack of 
diplomatic relations between the united states and vietnam 
official radio hanoi said tuesday that vietnams foreign 
minister nguyen co thach has told the united states that major 
differences prevented resumption of talks on us resettlement of 
thousands of people who were detained in reeducation camps 
because of their ties to the americans during the vietnam war 
but thach also announced that vietnam was resuming cooperation 
on joint efforts to find the remains of nearly 1800 americans 
listed as missing in action or mia in the war 
vietnam had suspended cooperation aug 3 complaining about what 
it called americas hostile policy of isolating vietnam to try 
to force hanois occupation troops out of cambodia 
a us technical team will travel to hanoi in september to work 
out details for joint field survey and excavation activities in 
vietnam us state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said 
tuesday 
she said a us team also will visit hanoi sept 58 to discuss 
a plan to allow private american organizations to treat vietnam

jailed black leader nelson 
mandela recuperating from tuberculosis met today with the justice 
minister after being transferred from a state hospital to a large 
private clinic 
kobie coetzee said mandelas health appears to have improved 
considerably and described conditions at the clinic as excellent 
the minister did not elaborate on his meeting with the 70yearold 
prisoner whose release has been the focus of repeated 
international campaigns 
mandelas lawyer ismail ayob said he had expected the transfer 
and did not view it as an indication the government has decided 
whether it would free the african national congress leader after 
his recovery 
ayob said neither he nor mandelas wife winnie was told in 
advance of the move from cape towns tygerberg hospital to the 
constantiaberg clinic mandela was moved late wednesday 
mandela jailed since 1962 was transferred on aug 12 from 
pollsmoor prison to tygerberg where doctors say he made a good 
recovery following the drainage of fluid from his lungs 
the clinic which opened in march is a 228bed private hospital 
with a view of the mountains overlooking cape town it is a bit 
more expensive than most south african hospitals with private 
rooms costing about 68 a day 
the government will pay for his stay as it would any prisoner 
a prison spokesman danie immelman said mandelas condition 
has improved to such an extent that his further treatment in the 
tygerberg hospital was no longer necessary 
he gave no indication how long mandela would be in the clinic or 
what the conditions of his stay would be like 
while there mandela is expected to have access to a greater 
number of visitors than he had in prison and may even be allowed to 
give interviews 
government officials have suggested mandela would be moved to a 
clinic and possibly allowed more visitors before a final decision 
was made whether to release him outright 
mandelas full recuperation could take months after that the 
government could send him back to prison or grant him freedom 
president pw botha in a speech two weeks ago said he was 
seriously considering releasing mandela the countrys bestknown 
black leader mandela is serving a life sentence for sabotage and 
plotting to overthrow the whiteled government 
if botha releases mandela the president risks an enormous white 
backlash and the possibility of reactivating militant black 
opposition that has been suppressed under a 26monthold state of 
emergency 
however there could be widespread unrest if the black 
majoritys most popular leader dies in custody 
botha has offered to release mandela if he will renounce 
violence mandela said he will do so only if the african national 
congress is no longer banned apartheid is dismantled and blacks 
are given full political rights 
the anc is the main guerrilla group fighting to overthrow south 
africas government and end apartheid under which the black 
majority has no voice in national affairs 
nationwide municipal elections are set for oct 26 further 
complicating bothas dilemma the government is engaged in a 
massive campaign to encourage blacks to vote in the township 
elections but faces growing opposition from conservative whites 
mandelas release is likely to encourage black voters to go to 
the polls but could harm bothas national party in the separate 
white local elections

a sailor accompanying a woman who died trying to 
swim the english channel said the athletes trainer ignored his 
advice to halt the swim even though the woman was in obvious 
distress the times of london said today 
the newspaper quoted colin cook as blaming judith russo for the 
aug 23 death of renata agondi a fellow brazilian 
it quoted ms russos lawyer bernardcharles costenoble as 
saying the trainer denied that she refused to let ms agondi 
abandon the swim 
ms agondi a 25yearold sao paulo resident described by the 
channel swimming association as a marathon swimmer of worldwide 
status died trying to swim from the southeast english port of 
dover to france 
the times said cook whose trawler was hired to accompany the 
swim told french police ms agondi would not have died three miles 
off france if ms russo had heeded his advice 
a french magistrate charged 51yearold ms russo on friday with 
failing to assist a person in danger the magistrate concluded 
that ms agondi was exhausted which led her to drown 
the times quoted cook as saying ms agondi started out well but 
became disoriented and didnt seem to know in which direction to 
swim ms russo was supervising the swim from the trawler 
we carried on a bit further but by now i was really worried 
and thought it had to stop the newspaper quoted cook as saying 
i looked over the side of the boat at the swimmer and i drew my 
hand across my throat to tell her to finish the swim but she took 
no notice the trainer assured me everything was all right 
i realized that things were getting bad and dangerous i was 
so worried that i called the dover straits coast guard and said we 
were having problems with the coach to the point of being 
detrimental to the girls life 
ms agondi finally was hauled onto the trawler and an air force 
helicopter picked her up she was dead on arrival at a hospital in 
the french port of calais 
the times said french authorities released ms russo from 
custody wednesday on 48000 bond 
it quoted ms agondis father raul camara agondi as saying he 
asked ms russo to be his daughters coach and accompany her on the 
swim it quoted him as saying i dont believe judith insisted 
that renata continue swimming 
ms agondi was the fourth person known to have died trying to 
swim the channel since the first recorded swim by matthew webb a 
captain in the english merchant marine on aug 24 1875 
the distance from dover in a straight line to the nearest point 
in france is 21 miles but winds tides and currents nearly always 
add 10 miles or so to the distance for swimmers

a medical equipment company pleaded guilty to 
selling thousands of defective pacemakers to doctors knowing the 
devices could stop working without warning and four executives 
were charged with the coverup 
the officers of the cordis corp ignored internal memos urging 
that doctors be informed about the defects and sent false 
statements to the food and drug administration to conceal the 
problems according to federal indictments returned wednesday 
cordis a miamibased company that has since sold its heart 
pacemaker division pleaded guilty to concealing the defects in 
federal court in a related action the company said the plea covers 
only cordis and not its officers at the time 
the 43count indictment against the officers said the problems 
affected tens of thousands of the pacemakers sold between 1980 and 
1985 the batterypowered devices are implanted beneath the skin of 
heart patients to regulate their heartbeat by electrical impulses 
food and drug administration commissioner frank e young 
stressed that the defective pacemakers have long since been the 
subject of notifications to physicians and are no longer on the 
market prosecutors did not allege that anyone had died as a result 
of the devices 
one of the former officers harold hershenson of san carlos 
calif is accused of criminal conspiracy as well as 22 felony 
counts and 10 misdemeanor counts of violating federal law 
the indictment said hershenson the executive vice president who 
ran the daytoday operations of the company rejected an internal 
memo in 1981 urging cordis to inform doctors of the pacemakers 
problems 
also charged was john pagones of coral gables a former vice 
president who had direct responsibility for ensuring quality for 
the pacemakers and dean ciporkin of miami and stephen vadas of 
homestead both of whom worked for pagones 
if convicted the four each face possiblity prison sentences 
from 40 to 127 years and fines of more than 350000 
calls to hershensons home were not returned wednesday night 
but pagones attorney ted klein accused the government of 
misrepresenting management decisions at the company 
they assume these people intentionally put out a defective 
product and it just isnt so the evidence is going to show nobody 
was injured klein said 
the fda said that most of the potentially defective pacemakers 
were not removed and are being monitored by doctors but some 
patients highly dependent on the devices have had them removed by 
surgery 
basically the defects were the sudden loss of the ability to 
control the heartbeat the pacemakers were not pacing said 
diane cossin spokeswoman for the us attorneys office 
attorneys for cordis entered guilty pleas to 11 felony and 13 
misdemeanor counts before us district judge stanley marcus the 
company agreed to pay 264000 in fines and costs 
the company reported net losses of 561 million in 1987 but 
underwent a major restructuring since selling the pacemaker 
operation to telectronics of australia net earnings for 1988 
totaled 24 million on sales of 132 million 
cordis main operations now include making catheters for 
diagnosing and treating heart problems and gauges for monitoring 
pressure on the brain 
the case is the most significant felony prosecution to date 
under the 1976 medical device amendments to the fda law said a 
statement by assistant attorney general john r bolton head of the 
justice departments civil division in washington and by interim 
miami us attorney dexter lehtinen

to this african nation after a twoyear break with a 17 million 
package for agricultural development 
the threeyear agreement was signed in harare wednesday by 
american ambassador james w rawlings 
zimbabwe finance minister bernard chidzero called the aid a 
giant step in strengthening relations between the two nations 
which for years have been plagued by political and ideological 
feuds

attacked american policy toward south africa while thenpresident 
jimmy carter was vising zimbabwe washington cut 135 million of 
205 million pledged for that year and subsequently did not renew 
assistance 
this southeast african nation has been one of the most strident 
critics of president reagans refusal to support economic sanctions 
against whiteruled south africa zimbabwe has also criticized us 
aid to rightwing guerrillas in afghanistan angola and nicaragua 
blackled zimbabwe was known as the british colony of rhodesia 
until it won its independence in 1980 
rawlings who was appointed us ambassador in 1986 said 
wednesday that the resumption of aid signaled american confidence 
in zimbabwes economic potential and good will between the two 
nations 
under the aid agreement the us government will sell american 
farming equipment and spare parts to farmers and help to develop 
agricultural programs

the us warship vincennes begins its 
13000 journey home sunday ending a persian gulf assignment marred 
by tragedy 
the departure will represent the first cutback in american 
forces in the gulf since the iraniraq ceasefire 
the 9600ton missile cruiser officially will be detached sunday 
from the navys joint task force middle east navy sources said 
allowing for a months sailing time and at least one port call en 
route the vincennes should reach san diego in midoctober 
the departure ends the vincennes first combat zone assignment 
since being christened at a mississippi shipyard in 1984 by marilyn 
quayle wife of indiana sen dan quayle the republican nominee for 
vice president 
on july 3 the vincennes crew shot down an iranian civilian 
jetliner over the strait of hormuz killing all 290 aboard after 
mistaking the a300 airbus for an attacking f14 fighter 
pentagon officials attributed the blunder to crew stress in 
combat but ruled out punitive action and said iran shared the blame 
by allowing the jetliner to fly over a skirmish between the 
vincennes and iranian gunboats 
while in the gulf region the vincennes also rescued five 
iranian fishermen adrift for eight days after their boat sank 
its withdrawal from the carrier battle group in the arabian sea 
trims the american naval force in the region from 27 to 26 warships 
the pentagon says the us fleet will be scaled back further if 
the ceasefire between iran and iraq which took effect aug 20 
holds 
but it has given no timetable and other ships in the force are 
still being replaced on schedule 
us officials said withdrawing the vincennes was a gesture 
toward reducing tensions 
the vincennes entered the gulf may 27 the first of the navys 
billiondollar aegis cruisers assigned to the waterway 
some critics questioned the deployment of a floating powerhouse 
designed for longrange fleet defense to the tight congested 
gulf even some of the ships officers admitted they were less than 
clear about their assignment 
senior us officials said the vincennes would greatly expand 
air surveillance capability and offset an iranian missile threat 
shortly after arriving the cruiser was out of action for radar 
system repairs us officials said the problem was unrelated to 
the airbus incident 
the vincennes later idled at anchor in manama for another two 
weeks while a us team investigated the jetliner downing it then 
was reassigned to the navys carrier group in the arabian sea and 
did not return to the gulf 
it also made a port visit to the seychelles islands off the 
african coast the 385member crews first real liberty since the 
airbus tragedy

currencys movements since wednesday were not a development that 
requires immediate action he described the yens weakness as

fall if the bearish market persists 
dealers in frankfurt said european traders were straining to 
guess what the bank of japan would do about its falling currency 
people are waiting for the bank of japan to step in anytime 
soon but all they get is confusing messages complained a dealer 
at a major west german bank 
one trader in milan said he doubted the bank of japan would 
raise its discount rate as long as the dollar was under 140 yen 
in tokyo where trading ends before europes business day 
begins the dollar rose 173 yen to a closing 13670 yen later in 
london it was quoted at 13667 yen 
but another milan trader said dealers were slightly wary of 
pushing the dollar too high against the yen for fear of central 
bank intervention 
the japanese appear in no hurry for the moment to break the 
dollars rise against the yen he said 
the dealer stressed that market sentiment was still positive on 
the dollar and said he expected dealers to buy dollars ahead of 
fridays release of the us august employment figures

fbi sting companies and people linked 
to their political corruption probe spread at least 56000 in 
political contributions around the california capitol in the past 
two years finance reports show 
assembly speaker willie brown national chairman of jesse 
jacksons presidential campaign received 5000 directly from two 
firms identified as fbi fronts and 6500 from another company with 
ties to the sting 
a 5000 contribution from one of the fbi fronts was listed in 
reports filed by assembly republican leader pat nolan of glendale 
before the corruption probe came to light 
nolans attorney ephraim margolin said nolans campaign 
reports would be amended to list another 5000 contribution from 
the fbi front 
during the sweeping twoyear probe of legislative corruption 
the fbi sting companies reportedly offered payments in return for 
votes on two bills drafted to give special bank loan benefits to 
the bogus fbi firms 
terry knowles chief of the fbis sacramento office said 
wednesday that he didnt expect the investigation to be concluded 
until october at the earliest 
we are working i dont like to say around the clock but full 
days with a full squad he said 
in a related development the daily news of los angeles reported 
wednesday that nolans personal calendar for the night prior to the 
date of those contributions listed a private dinner meeting in a 
hotel room with a man now believed to be an fbi agent posing as an 
outofstate businessman seeking legislative favors 
reports filed with the secretary of states office show that 
northern california research associates a firm reportedly retained 
by one of the dummy fbi companies gulf shrimp fisheries gave 
campaign contributions of 6500 to brown the powerful democratic 
leader of the legislatures lower house and 3500 to democratic 
assemblywoman gwen moore of los angeles 
two bills written by moore to give special benefits to the phony 
fbi companies are the focus of the capscam scandal 
records at the secretary of states office showed that brown 
also received a 4000 contribution on may 26 from peachstate 
capital and 1000 from gulf shrimp in 1986 
peachstate and gulf shrimp have been identified as fbi front 
companies by donald heller an attorney for a legislative staffer 
cooperating with federal agents federal and capitol sources 
confirmed hellers statement 
brown spokeswoman susan jetton said the peachstate contribution 
in the form of a cashiers check was for four tickets to a large 
fundraising dinner and that it was no big deal we didnt have 
anything to do with them its not unusual that people who do 
not have any connection to the speaker to come to these things 
jetton also said the 6500 contribution from ncra in no way 
linked the speaker to the investigation adding were not going 
to comment on anything that silly 
regarding moores receipt of 3500 from ncra moores 
spokeswoman amy king declined comment and nolan referred all 
questions to his attorney who said only that the facts would 
vindicate the republican leader 
gulf shrimp and peachstate were among bogus firms federal agents 
set up in the probe of legislative corruption that came to light 
with a late night search of capitol offices by fbi agents last week

the us army today removed nine 
pershing 2 missiles from a base in west germany the first step in 
the withdrawal of all us intermediaterange nuclear rockets from 
europe 
the removal comes under the terms of an arms treaty signed by 
president reagan and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev in december 
its the first time that us intermediaterange missiles have 
been withdrawn in europe us navy cmdr gerry ryan of the 
european command headquarters in stuttgart told the associated 
press 
the remainder of the us army europeanbased 
intermediaterange nuclear missiles are scheduled to be removed 
over a 36month period he said 
a group of antinuclear activists who came to witness the 
removal applauded as the 15 us army trucks bearing the missiles 
began leaving the site in southern west germany 
the group held up a banner saying heilbronn never again a 
nuclear powder keg 
the nine pershing 2 missiles had been deployed as part of a nato 
plan to station 572 intermediaterange nuclear missiles in five 
west european countries to counter soviet rockets pointed at the 
west 
the united states had stationed 108 pershing 2 missiles and 96 
cruise missiles at four bases in west germany as part of the plan 
deployment of the missiles began late in 1983 and led to massive 
protests in western europe especially in west germany 
but the antimissile fervor waned and by the time the 
intermediaterange missile treaty was signed last year only a 
handful of protesters was still active on a daily basis in west 
germany 
 
 
ryan told the ap that a truck convoy carrying the missiles left 
the camp redleg us army missile site near the southern city of 
heilbronn at about 10 am today 
heilbronn is about 35 miles north of stuttgart 
one part of the convoy was heading to a us army post in 
frankfurt while another part was heading to a different base in 
preparation for air transport back to elimination sites in the 
united states ryan said 
us officials have said that some of the rockets would be 
destroyed at the frankfurt site and that the nuclear warheads 
would be shipped back to the appropriate authority in the 
united states 
under terms of the inf traty the soviet union and united states 
agreed to eliminate all landbased intermediaterange nuclear 
missiles which have a range of up to 3000 miles

the government today asked a court to 
reject ferdinand marcos request to come home to face an accuser 
and said it should be up to the united states whether the former 
president can leave hawaii 
the anticorruption court gave marcos 10 days from receipt of 
the transcript of todays proceedings to submit a written reply to 
the governments motion to reject his petition 
court clerk luisabel cortez said formal legal notice would be 
forwarded to marcos by the philippine consulate in honolulu where 
he has lived since the february 1986 uprising that drove him from 
power 
marcos petitioned the court to allow him to return to the 
philippines to confront a former cabinet member scheduled to 
testify in november on alleged corruption during his administration 
president corazon aquino refused to allow marcos to return 
citing national security mrs aquino said she would abide by the 
decision of the courts if they allowed marcos to come home 
but last week she authorized francisco chavez the 
solicitorgeneral to appeal to the supreme court if necessary to 
block marcos return 
assistant solicitorgeneral romeo dela cruz argued today that it 
was up to the us government to decide if marcos could leave 
hawaii 
if he cannot leave us territory it is not by an act of the 
philippine government but by an act of the us government dela 
cruz said so it would be presumptuous of this court to interfere 
with the affairs of a sovereign state 
us officials have restricted marcos to the island of oahu 
following attempts allegedly instigated by him to topple mrs 
aquinos government us officials said they would lift travel 
restrictions on marcos only with mrs aquinos concurrence 
marcos filed the petition through his sister fortuna marcos 
barba on aug 24 one week after the antigraft court granted the 
solicitor generals request for a special hearing on the testimony 
of former public works secretary baltazar aquino 
in its ruling the court said marcos had the right to defend 
himself in the proceedings since the solicitor general had said he 
intended to use baltazar aquinos testimony in a future criminal 
suit against marcos 
aquino who is not related to the president had served in 
marcos cabinet according to government lawyers he has agreed to 
testify about millions of dollars in kickbacks marcos allegedly 
received from japanese firms

about 2000 strikers carrying solidarity 
banners and marching behind a cross left the lenin shipyard today 
after solidarity leader lech walesa called on them to end their 
strike 
however striking coal miners who began the current labor unrest 
in poland demanded to meet with walesa before ending their strikes 
the workers were demanding higher wages and legalization of 
solidarity 
as the shipyard workers in gdansk marched toward the st 
brygidas church a crowd of supporters chanted thank you thank 
you and there is no freedom without solidarity the strikers 
and the crowd sang the national anthem just before the shipyard 
gates swung open 
every pole is with us today the crowd shouted in unison 
the government welcomed walesas appeal to end the strikes but 
also announced that a policeman died while on duty inside the 
strikebound stalowa wola steel mill in southeast poland on 
wednesday night 
it is not known if he was murdered or committed suicide under 
psychological terror or persecution i am awaiting results of the 
investigation government spokesman jerzy urban said today 
solidarity spokesman piotr niemczyk in warsaw said strikers 
reported that a policeman committed suicide by shooting himself 
but had no other details 
in a breakthrough meeting with walesa on wednesday senior 
government officials promised talks on reinstating the banned free 
trade union movement and jointly solving the countrys daunting 
social and economic problems 
in exchange the officials demanded an end to polands most 
serious strike wave in seven years 
walesa won agreement to end the strikes from workers at the 
lenin shipyard and the separate repair shipyard as well as the 
gdansk port after he went to all three facilities to deliver his 
appeal 
upon his return to st brygidas church from the port a buoyant 
walesa said jokingly more than 100 percent had supported his 
appeal 
walesas meeting with communist authorities wednesday was his 
first since they outlawed solidarity in 1982 previously the 
government had refused to treat him as anything more than a private 
citizen 
seven other enterprises in poland remained on strike today 
niemczyk said workers at the july manifesto mine in southern 
poland said they would not end their occupation strike until local 
issues of pay and work conditions are settled and until walesa 
visits the mine to explain his appeal 
at the stalowa wola steel mill management refused to give 
strikers a copy of walesas postmeeting statement delaying a 
decision to end the strike there niemczyk said 
a report on polish radio at noon said talks between management 
and strikers at stalowa wola started to discuss the technical 
ending of the strike and the departure from the enterprise of 
people taking part in it 
in an initial reaction to walesas statement strike leaders in 
szczecin the countrys other main baltic port said they would not 
automatically end their strike while local grievances were still 
pending he said 
the labor unrest began aug 16 at the july manifesto mine at 
its peak the strike wave has affected 20 enterprises employing 
about 100000 workers 
the strikers demanded higher wages and legalization of 
solidarity which was crushed in a dec 13 1981 military crackdown 
after meeting wednesday with interior minister czeslaw kiszczak 
and stanislaw ciosek an alternate member of the communist partys 
ruling politburo walesa said i raised the presently most 
important problem of paths leading to trade union pluralism 
including solidaritys place 
the partners in the discussion stated that all problems 
connected with the union movement would be discussed at the round 
table he said i have thus decided that we now stop the strike 
actions 
walesa also said the government agreed to discuss broad 
political and economic issues at the round table to be convened in 
the near future 
his statement was sent to strikers nationwide and read to 
reporters in gdansk 
the staterun news agency pap in a short dispatch on the 
session said the parties discussed the premises for organizing a 
roundtable meeting and the procedure for holding it 
after the talks in warsaw walesa went straight to the lenin 
shipyard where he is employed as an electrician to explain his 
appeal 
it is a difficult decision because there are no written 
guarantees said walesa aide piotr konopka 
walesas talks with the officials came on the eighth anniversary 
of the signing at the gdansk shipyard of the 1980 accords that for 
the first time guaranteed free trade union rights in a soviet bloc 
country 
walesa kiszczak ciosek and bishop jerzy dabrowski of warsaw 
met for three hours in a government villa in warsaw 
andrzej stelmachowski a prominent intellectual trusted by both 
the authorities and solidarity helped arrange wednesdays meeting 
afterward he said it represented the beginning of a process to 
resolve problems that include 60 percent inflation and the failure 
of wages to keep pace with increases in governmentcontrolled 
prices 
walesa said the talks to bring about solidarityrelated union 
organizations would require patient negotiations which have to 
take a certain time 
the problem of trade unions the right to form associations and 
the role of other groups in the governments reform programs would 
be the round tables main subjects said stelmachowski

two alleged ira members captured 
this week are prime suspects in recent bombings of british military 
installations in west germany authorities said today 
authorities also said the men were caught with a weapon believed 
to have been used in a shootout in the netherlands that killed a 
royal air force member in may 
an arrest warrant issued late wednesday says the two men are 
urgently suspected of taking part in two bombings and an 
attempted murder in west germany the federal prosecutors office 
said 
the warrant was issued after a federal court hearing in 
karlsruhe the prosecutors spokesman alexander prechtel said in 
a telephone interview 
under west german law issuance of a arrest warrant means the 
two men may be held indefinitely in investigative custody until 
they are formally charged 
the suspects are being held at a maximum security prison 
prechtel said he declined to give the location of the prison 
prechtel identified the suspects as gerard thomas hanratty and 
terence gerard mcgeough both 29 
they were arrested late tuesday after crossing the dutch border 
into west germany near the town of waldfeucht british military 
installations are near the town 45 miles northwest of cologne 
police found two kalashnikov ak47 automatic rifles and three 
38caliber pistols in their car prechtel said 
ballistics experts believe that one of the rifles found in the 
car is the same one used in the july 13 attack on the british army 
barracks in duisburg and in the may 1 shooting of a british soldier 
in the netherlands prechtel said 
on may 1 three royal air force members were fired on from 
pointblank range in the southern dutch city of roermond one 
airman died instantly and his two colleagues were injured 
on july 13 two bombs planted by the ira exploded at the 
duisburg barracks injuring nine soldiers at about the same time 
shots were fired from a passing automobile at a police car in the 
same area 
other evidence links the men to an ira bombing on aug 5 at a 
british army barracks in duesseldorf prechtel said three british 
soldiers and a civilian were injured in that attack 
the suspects were arrested while driving a peugeot 305 car 
rented in mainz 27 miles west of frankfurt where they also rented 
a car from aug 3 to aug 8 said prechtel 
the arrest warrant also says the two are suspected of illegal 
possession of weapons and falsifying documents prechtel said 
hanratty was arrested with a falsified british passport and a 
drivers license prechtel said no documents were found on 
mcgeough 
hanratty said he was born in belfast on jan 26 1959 mcgeough 
said he was born in carry castle on sep 2 1958 the two men gave 
the court no further information prechtel said 
we are reasonably sure that these are their correct

the boston symphony orchestra didnt violate 
vanessa redgraves civil rights when it canceled her performances 
after receiving threats of protest over the actress proplo views 
a us appeals court ruled 
the decision by the full 1st us circuit court of appeals 
reversed an earlier finding by a threemember panel of the court 
that the orchestra had violated the massachusetts civil rights act 
the 32 ruling wednesday upheld the first amendment right of the 
orchestra to cancel the performances because of concern over their 
artistic integrity 
we have no reason to think that the massachusetts legislature 
enacted the mcra in an attempt to have its courts at the 
insistence of private plaintiffs oversee the editorial judgments 
of newspapers the speechrelated activities of private 
universities or the aesthetic judgments of artists said judge 
frank m coffin writing for the majority 
however the court reinstated an award of 12000 that ms 
redgrave would have earned in a broadway role she lost during the 
suit against the symphony 
symphony officials were relieved by the ruling said bso 
attorney bob sullivan they can go back to doing what theyre 
best at making music he said 
attorneys for ms redgrave daniel j kornstein and marvin 
wexler did not immediately return calls 
ms redgrave was hired by the symphony in 1982 to narrate six 
performances of stravinskys oedipus rex at boston at 
tanglewood in western massachusetts and at new yorks carnegie hall 
the symphony canceled the contract after it received letters and 
phone calls indicating there would be picketing and other protests 
because of ms redgraves support of the palestine liberation 
organization 
the symphony argued that massachusetts law allowed it to cancel 
performances because of concern that disruptions would mar their 
artistic integrity 
in 1984 a federal jury ruled the symphony breached its contract 
with ms redgrave and awarded her the 27500 she was to have 
received plus 100000 for work ms redgrave said she lost because 
of the cancellation 
a federal judge out the 100000 award in 1985 and ruled the 
symphony had not violated ms redgraves civil rights in october 
the threemember appeals panel restored 12000 of that award but 
agreed that her rights had not been violated

audi of america inc having failed to reach a 
settlement of a lawsuit alleging its audi 5000 is prone to sudden 
unintended acceleration says it has no choice now but to defend 
itself in court 
the classaction lawsuit was filed on behalf of some 390000 
audi owners 
in june attorneys for both sides announced a settlement that 
would have given each owner a credit of between 300 and 2000 
toward the purchase of a new audi 
but on aug 11 cook county circuit judge thomas r rakowski 
rejected the settlement because it would have forced owners to buy 
another audi to benefit 
on wednesday audi attorneys informed the judge that the 
automaker a troy michbased subsidiary of volkswagen of america 
would fight the suit in court 
were kind of back to the wall we have to defend the car 
audi spokesman joseph bennett said in a telephone interview we 
were looking for possible solutions to this and couldnt come up 
with anything 
the audi 5000 owners contend the cars surge forward or backward 
when shifted into gear audi vehemently denies there is anything 
wrong with the cars 
mark steinbach a washington attorney who represents an 
organization of disgruntled audi owners said the rejected 
settlement would not have cost audi anything and would have 
represented a bonanza in terms of sales 
the center for auto safety in washington contends 402 people 
have been injured and five killed in at least 1650 accidents 
blamed on unintended acceleration by the audi 5000

an underground electrical fire caused a 40block 
power outage downtown sending many workers home early and utility 
officials said they couldnt start working on repairs until this 
morning 
power was not expected to be restored to some areas until 
tonight according to seattle city light spokesman hugh mcintosh 
city light crews scrambled today to locate and deploy generators 
for some hotels and buildings that house mostly poor elderly 
people he said 
about 95 percent of the major buildings in the area have at 
least some auxiliary power supply officials said 
the affected area included the downtown retail financial and 
hotel center along with some residences longdistance phone 
service also was disrupted for some customers 
the number of affected residents businesses and hotels was 
undetermined since many establishments continued operating using 
backup generators 
fourteen officers were added to the usual 10 on patrol in the 
blackedout area overnight and no looting was reported officer 
steven thomas said early today 
fiftyfive additional police officers patrolled and directed 
rushhour traffic on wednesday fire marshal bl hansen said 
city light officials said it was the worst outage the 
municipally owned utility had experienced eclipsing an 80block 
downtown blackout that lasted five hours in 1966 
a total of 3000 feet of cable had to be replaced and work 
couldnt begin on repairs until this morning according to 
spokeswoman dorothy nelsen 
this could cost me 5000 to 10000 said mike mcalpin 
owner of mamas mexican kitchen 
others fared better david sivinski proprietor of a 
propanepowered popcorn wagon said his booming business 
represented the revenge of lowtech 
fears of a toxic chemical release proved unfounded when it was 
determined that no transformers ruptured during the fire easing 
concern that oil containing potentially dangerous pcbs had burned 
mcintosh said 
firefighters originally thought transformer oil was burning when 
they saw black smoke said fire department spokesman roy davis 
they learned it was the plastic insulation around the transformers 
that ignited mcintosh said 
the fire was confined to the underground vault firefighters 
took two hours to extinguish it by filling the chamber with carbon 
dioxide no injuries were reported 
the loss of power and longdistance phone service prompted some 
businesses to send employees home early but mass evacuations were 
avoided because so many major buildings in the area switched to 
their backup systems 
two window washers stuck on an electrically powered scaffold 
outside the 14th floor of a building lowered themselves by hand on 
a bosuns chair drawing applause from spectators 
the claremont hotel was evacuated because of heavy smoke 
emanating from manholes in the street the bon marche department 
store also was evacuated because a backup power system failed said 
a woman who answered the telephone there and identified herself as 
an employee 
the warwick hotel distributed 150 flashlights to its guests 
said cyndy sparhawk the hotels sales director 
auxiliary power meant warwick guests had elevator service hot 
and cold water and hall lights wednesday night but room lights 
will be out until the power service is restored said kevin klein 
a front office assistant manager 
jerry wolsborn managing director of the 865room westin hotel 
said emergency lighting and one elevator in each of the hotels two 
highrise towers were sustained with backup systems

its longdistance phone service by wednesday evening and was 
trying to provide emergency generator power for other longdistance 
carriers said spokesman vic kucera

iran accused iraq today of taking 752 
iranian troops prisoner in the past 10 days and baghdad charged 
tehran with stalling peace talks in an effort to rebuild its 
flagging army 
as the two sides continued to trade accusations of numerous 
ceasefire violations un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar said he was frustrated by the slow pace of peace talks in 
geneva 
official tehran radio said the 752 iranians were taken prisoner 
since a unsponsored ceasefire went into effect aug 20 the 
official islamic republic news agency said wednesday that 700 
iranians had been captured 
in baghdad the governmentrun aththawra newspaper said iran 
was stalling peace talks to disguise its attempt to rebuild its 
forces 
the iranian government is seeking to improve its international 
stand and be in a better situation to renew the war forgetting 
that the decisive factor which prompted it to accept the 
ceasefire was the final defeat that afflicted iran the paper 
said in an editorial 
peace talks have hit a snag over iraqs demand to have the 
disputed shattalarab waterway immediately cleared of sunken 
tankers iraq also has demanded sovereignty of the waterway its 
only outlet to the sea 
iran says a permanent ceasefire and troop withdrawal must come 
before the waterway is cleared 
iraqi newspapers lashed out at iran today for its insistence on 
reviving the 1975 algiers treaty between the two countries as a 
basis for a peace settlement the treaty divided the disputed 
waterway between the two sides 
the algiers agreement is an issue of history said the 
staterun aljomhouriya it has become meaningless and there is 
no justification whatsoever to revive it 
in other reports of violations tehran radio said iraq fired 20 
artillery shells wednesday into oshnavieh in the north and that 
iraqi troops later moved inside iran from their bases across the 
border no casualties were reported 
the radio monitored in nicosia also charged iraq with 
capturing four villages firing shots and operating military trucks 
close to the warfront over the past three days 
iraq meanwhile charged iran with setting up observation posts 
and bunkers moving troops close to the border and launching 
gunboats into the shattalarab 
un observers monitoring the truce have not reported any 
serious violations by either side 
in another development today the islamic republic news agency 
said 900 kurdish families fleeing iraqi air raids had arrived in 
northwestern iran 
the refugees elderly men women and children were being 
settled temporarily in the towns of piranshahr and orumieh in west 
azarbaijan province said irna monitored in nicosia 
the report said 300 of the families arrived from turkey while 
the rest came directly from iraq fleeing shelling and chemical 
weapons it did not specify the number of people involved 
diplomats in baghdad say iraq has taken advantage of the aug 20 
ceasefire in the nearly 8yearold persian gulf war to intensify 
operations against the kurds who want autonomy and who sided with 
the iranians in the war 
in ankara turkey premier turgut ozal said today that 60000 
kurdish refugees had fled into the country since it opened its 
border two weeks ago he said preparations were under way for 
housing the refugees

republican george bush today staged a quick 
campaign raid into michael dukakis home state in a bid to raise 
doubts about the democratic presidential candidates environmental 
record accusing him of delay while the boston harbor got dirtier 
and dirtier 
two hundreds years ago tea was spilled in the boston harbor in 
the name of liberty he said in a statement prepared for delivery 
after a boat tour of the polluted harbor if tea were spilled in 
the boston harbor today it would dissolve in the residue of my 
opponents neglect and delay 
bush was greeted in the harbor by about 70 dukakis supporters 
who chanted where was george a refrain from the democratic 
convention 
bush said dukakis as governor had twice fought to avoid making 
it cleaner he asserted that dukakis had sought permission from 
former environmental protection agency administrator william 
ruckelshaus to delay a ban on dumping wastes in the harbor 
dukakis in his first term drafted papers seeking the delay but 
it was his succesor ed king who actually filed the delay request 
to ruckelshaus in 1979 
the stealth candidate is at it again making promises on one 
hand but hiding his secret record on the other bush said 
the vice president noted that dukakis has visited the new jersey 
coast and spoken of his concern over the pollution along the shore 
what he didnt tell them is this the dukakis administration had 
applied in 1985 for a permit to dump massachusetts sewage sludge 
off the new jersey coast he said 
in december 1985 dukakis sought temporary permission from epa 
to dump sludge at a site 106 miles off the new jersey coast where 
new jersey and new york already were dumping sludge a compromise 
allowed massachusetts to dump it farther away at a deepwater site 
beyond the continental shelf 
today was the second of a threeday campaign swing devoted to 
the environment 
our land water and soil support a remarkable range of human 
activities the vice president said wednesday in a speech in 
michigan that aides said was designed to demonstrate a greater 
commitment to environmental cleanup than the reagan administration 
has exhibited but they can only take so much we must remember 
to treat them not as a given but as a gift 
bush pledged in a visit to a park on the shores of lake erie 
that he would support establishment of a set timetable for 
reduction of acid rain pollution with the details to be worked out 
with congress he also said he would convene an international 
conference during his first year in the white house for a 
discussion of the greenhouse effect that threatens a change in 
the earths climate because of gradually rising temperatures 
dukakis sought to tout his own record on environmental matters 
earlier this summer when he broke ground for a cleanup effort of 
the harbor but his critics complained he should have recognized 
the problem years ago 
bush drew a few critics of his own on wednesday with his 
environmental speech 
taking bush to task for calling himself an environmentalist 
blake early of the sierra club said we havent seen it in his 
record so it comes as a revelation to us 
for george bush to come here and present himself as an 
environmentalist its like bonnie and clyde coming out for gun 
control former us sen paul tsongas of massachusetts said 
but bush had the stage all to himself in michigan on wednesday 
first making his environmental speech and later paying a visit to 
the michigan state fair in detroit 
earlier in his visit to the park on the shore of lake erie 
bush said i am an environmentalist always have been from my 
earliest days growing up and then as a congressman and i 
always will be to my last days as president of this great and 
beautiful country 
he did not mention president reagan by name but aides said his 
call for tougher steps against acid rain was designed to illustrate 
a tougher approach than the current administration 
on the question of acid rain the time for study alone has 
passed he said 
as president i will ask for a program to cut millions of tons 
of sulfur dioxide emissions by the year 2000 and to significantly 
reduce nitrogen oxide emissions as well 
i will work out the exact amounts and the exact methodology 
with congress he said 
the sierra clubs early asked however where was george bush 
when bill ruckelshaus then head of the environmental protection 
agency was trying to get a 4 million ton bill and was shot 
down by the white house 
bush also said he would make greater use of the epas emergency 
authority to clean up toxic waste dumpsites although he said the 
superfund established for the purpose has enough money 
when america moves into the 90s i want to ensure that zero 
tolerance is applied not only to those who poison our childrens 
minds with drugs but to those who poison our water with toxic 
chemicals bush said

a group of us citizens claims 
thailand is trying to stop it from offering a 24 million reward 
for the return of us servicemen it believes remain held in 
communist indochinese countries 
a foreign ministry official today said thailand doesnt want the 
group to distribute the reward offer because it would be seen as a 
hostile act by vietnam laos and cambodia and harm thailands 
efforts to improve relations with these neighboring countries 
the group said it was sponsoring seven vietnam war veterans and 
relatives of missing servicemen who plan to travel to thailand in 
october and float on the mekong river vietnamese currency notes 
stamped with the reward offer the money was pledged by former 
north carolina congressman bill hendon former vietnam war prisoner 
eugene mcdaniel and 21 republican congressmen 
the government of thailand is attempting to roadblock the 
effort said the group the national steering committee for 
american war veterans in a telex this week to the associated press 
bureau in bangkok 
it said ted sampley committee chairman and vietnam war veteran 
met aug 26 with officials of the thai embassy in washington and 
was told we have received word from bangkok that you are not to 
do this if you violate our laws you know what we must do 
the embassy officials refused to say what laws would be 
violated the telex said we have no intention of violating any 
thai law but if they are trying to shortcircuit our plans because 
of some political policy they are going to have a problem the 
telex quoted sampley as saying 
he said a very large part of the reason the us became 
involved in the vietnam war was to protect thailand our most 
valued friend and ally in southeast asia from the threat of north 
vietnamese military adventurism over 58000 americans gave their 
lives in that cause and some of the americans who fought that war 
are still prisoners in vietnam and laos i cant believe the thai 
government is trying prevent us from helping those men 
the foreign ministry official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said he had not received any formal notice of the 
groups plans 
he said it was an entirely american decision to enter the 
war thai soldiers also fought and died in a war that was 
important for both countries i dont accept mr sampleys 
reasoning 
vietnams official communist party newspaper on aug 3 denounced 
the reward offer and the thai offficial noted that laos strongly 
objected when relatives of servicemen missing in action or mia 
floated similar offers on the mekong last year both countries have 
angrily denied holding american prisoners 
were not opposed to the mia group the official said 
but thailand cannot permit the group to stage what is 
regarded as provocative activities on its soil 
the new government of prime minister chatichai choohavan has put 
priority on improving relations with indochina relations have been 
sour since the communist victories in all three countries in 1975 
and especially since 1979 when vietnam invaded and occupied 
cambodia

nonfarm businesses in the united states lost 
some of their efficiency in the second quarter of the year but not 
as much as previously believed the labor department said today 
in revised figures for april through june the department said 
productivity among nonfarm businesses responsible for about 
threefourths of the nations economic activity declined 14 
percent its first drop since 1986 
using preliminary figures the government last month had put the 
decline at 17 percent the revision upward reflects a larger 52 
percent increase in the output of goods and services than the 47 
percent rise first reported 
to achieve that increased output businesses had to raise the 
number of hours worked by their employees by 66 percent 
analysts said the increase in hours and conseqent decrease in 
productivity reflects a hiring boom in which employers are having 
to compete for lessskilled workers because of decadelow 
unemployment 
hourly wages and benefits nominally rose at an annual rate of 
42 percent in the second quarter but after taking inflation into 
account the buying power of each hour of work declined 06 
percent the first drop in real compensation for workers in a year 
the higher nominal wages and reduced productivity sent labor 
costs skyrocketing at an annual rate of 57 percent compared with 
just a 01 percent increase the first quarter the labor department 
said 
the apriljune increase in labor costs was the largest quarterly 
gain since the fourth quarter in 1986 when it jumped 61 percent 
however labor costs are still only 29 percent above what they 
were a year ago lower than the rate of general consumer price 
inflation 
among manufacturers responsible for onefourth of the economic 
activity productivity improvements were slightly greater than 
previously reported 36 percent compared with 35 percent for the 
quarter 
the output of goods coming off factory assembly lines was 
revised upward from 54 percent to 57 percent with only a 2 
percent increase in the number of hours worked to achieve it 
manufacturers also have been more successful than businesses as 
a whole in keeping a lid on wages and labor costs as workers laid 
off in the 198182 recession were eager to return to their factory 
jobs 
wages and benefits among manufacturing workers nominally rose at 
an annual rate of 3 percent in the second quarter reducing their 
buying power in real terms by 17 percent 
the higher productivity and relatively small increases in hourly 
wages and benefits enabled manufacturers to actually reduce their 
labor costs in the second quarter by 06 percent 
measured in dollars us factories have outperformed the rest 
of the world in the past year in reducing labor costs partly 
through the smallest wage increases of any industrial country last 
year

attorney general richard l thornburgh 
will not comply with an absurd summons issued in an 
investigation of a contract awarded while he was governor a 
spokesman said 
the summons was filed in state court last week by auditor 
general don bailey who is seeking to question thornburgh as part 
of baileys investigation of a contract between hubco ford truck 
sales of allentown and the state 
the 23 million contract for 428 trucks was awarded in 1984 
when thornburgh was in his second term as pennsylvania governor 
the us senate unanimously confirmed him as attorney general last 
month 
bailey contends that the state paid too much for the trucks and 
that they were underpowered and says he has evidence of forgery 
fraud and conspiracy in the deal by various officials under 
thornburgh no charges have been filed 
it would normally be thornburghs intent to cooperate with 
any legitimate questions having to do with his administration 
said david runkel a thornburgh spokesman but this is absurd 
its a lot of nonsense and mr bailey knows it 
runkel said the summons is politically motivated bailey who is 
seeking reelection is a democrat thornburgh a republican 
runkel said the matter has been fully investigated by the fbi 
the state attorney general and the us attorneys office and no 
problems have been found 
the summons orders thornburgh to testify before bailey on the 
hubco contract and on other issues under investigation by his 
office 
bailey vowed to take the matter to court if thornburgh does not 
comply the auditor general had submitted his allegations to the 
senate judiciary committee during thornburghs confirmation 
hearings last month 
as auditor general bailey is authorized to gather information 
on state matters under his jurisdiction issue summonses to compel 
testimony and forward evidence of wrongdoing to the state attorney 
general

thousands of postal workers walked off their jobs 
for a second day today after the postal service hired temporary 
workers to clear a massive backlog 
the union of communication workers had promised wednesdays 
walkout would last only 24 hours but said the hiring of temporary 
workers could provoke indefinite strike actions 
royal mail which holds a nearmonopoly in mail services argued 
that such hiring was done every christmastime to clear backlogs and 
it would continue to implement contingency measures to plow through 
a backup of up to 100 million letters and parcels 
the vast majority of postal staff are back but we have some 
problems around the country said postal spokesman martin 
prestage its affecting a lot of customers today and tomorrow 
as we do at christmas if we have a backlog of over 50 million 
letters we bring in other workers he said a lot of regular 
staff are not sympathetic to this 
areas affected by the new walkouts included parts of london 
manchester and liverpool the union said 
prestage said the postal service also planned to use private 
vehicles to tackle the pileup which could reach 100 million 
pieces 
wednesdays 24hour strike the first nationwide walkout at 
royal mail since 1971 paralyzed mail deliveries in many parts of 
england scotland wales and northern ireland 
about 140000 union workers involved in sorting and delivery 
were called out on strike and the union claimed nearly total 
participation royal mail disputed the claims but provided no 
figures 
the dispute revolves around bonus payments for new recruits in 
london and southeast england where royal mail has trouble 
attacting staff because of high living costs 
the union said it wanted bonus payments given either to all 
workers or none it said it feared the practice might lead to the 
end of national pay bargaining agreements

delta flight 1141 from jackson took off 
with its usual passenger load today with some fliers saying the 
fatal crash one day earlier of the same flight in texas improved 
their odds 
i think these kinds of accidents are only one of so many 
said passenger gregory haygood hopefully it will make the pilots 
and the maintenance people better check everything on the plane 
later in the day after the flight arrived at dallasfort worth 
international airport the plane taxied out for takeoff but was 
forced to turn back apparently because of an incorrect instrument 
reading a delta spokesman said 
flight 1141 let off its passengers after returning to the 
terminal at the airport 
on wednesday flight 1141 a 625 am salt lake citybound 
flight that originates in jackson crashed and burned on takeoff at 
dallasfort worth airport thirteen passengers were killed and at 
least 95 survived 
only six of the 34 passengers who boarded in jackson had been 
ticketed to travel on to salt lake city none died 
its strange for them to leave with the front page stories 
about the crash yesterday clotene lathan of pearl said as her 
daughter and soninlaw boarded the plane today but ive worked 
here at the airport for 22 years and im not afraid of flying 
lathan said that shed recently retired after working 22 years 
at the jackson municipal airport as a flight insurance agent and 
that the hundreds of policies shed written without having to pay 
benefits convinced her the couple were safe 
todays flight left 10 minutes late as boarding was delayed by 
reporters interviewing travelers 
delta employees said they were told not to talk with reporters 
but one boarding agent who asked to remain anonymous said there 
were 50 passengers on flight 1141 today which the employee said 
was an average number 
none of the passengers interviewed said they were afraid to fly 
i think the odds probably increased in my favor university 
of mississippi professor chester quarles said quarles and his 
wife bobbe were headed to visit relatives in california 
a middleaged man in a business suit said the greatest hazard he 
faced today was getting through the halfdozen reporters and onto 
the plane 
this is bloody nonsense just bloody nonsense he said 
motioning at a tv cameraman and news reporters this is morbid 
nonsense

economic changes and political reforms that 
led to more democratic elections are only starting points in a 
process that will help mexico face the future president miguel de 
la madrid said today in his final report to the nation 
in a speech prepared for delivery to congress today de la 
madrid noted that on dec 1 1982 he had inherited a nation near 
bankruptcy and faced a crisis that shook the very foundations of 
our social structure 
the composition of the new sharply divided congress is itself 
evidence of the significant transformations that the country has 
undergone de la madrid said 
he said he had renegotiated a foreign debt that now stands at 
104 billion resisted pressure for a moratorium on payments 
reduced the role of the state in the economy and opened mexico to 
foreign competition 
he also instituted a painful austerity program that cut 
mexicans buying power by about 50 percent 
we recognize that the cost of these changes has been high for 
the majority of our population de la madrid said but mexicans 
wisely understood that to attain lasting wellbeing it was 
necessary to truly reform the country 
he said that further debt renegotiation is necessary on the 
principle of joint responsibiility between debtors and on adjusting 
debt servicing to countries real capacity to pay but gave no 
details on how that might occur 
de la madrid called the july 6 vote in which the longruling 
institutional revolutionary party or pri suffered reverses an 
electoral process of historic significance 
he made no direct reference to charges of massive fraud that 
tainted the vote saying the process was orderly peaceful and 
closely monitored 
the combined opposition won nearly 50 percent of the vote and 
leftist candidate cuauhtemoc cardenas who gained 31 percent of the 
official tally claims he beat carlos salinas de gortari the pri 
candidate due to succeed de la madrid on dec 1 
in the chamber of deputies the pri ended up with 260 seats and 
a divided opposition with 240 seats 139 for the leftist front and 
101 for the rightist national action party the left also won four 
of 64 seats in the senate the first time the pri has ever lost 
senate seats 
protests have continued since the election with 10000 people 
rallying in favor of cardenas in downtown mexico city wednesday 
de la madrid called on all citizens to continue perfecting our 
democracy in accordance with the law 
the journey along the road to democracy is a neverending one 
the recent elections should be seen as a further stride toward its 
higher reaches said de la madrid 
on relations with the united states de la madrid noted that he 
met with president reagan six times and said moments of 
difficulty and lack of understanding are being gradually overcome 
he hailed the participation of the mexican army navy and air 
forces in the fight against drug trafficking but said the problem 
could not be solved unless the demand for drugs is combated in 
major centers of consumption 
de la madrid who has lowered mexicos highprofile role in 
central america said little about the conflicts there except to 
note mexicos role in efforts to achieve a regional peace 
he said that the attempt to decentralize mexicos economy would 
help reduce pressure on mexico city which is one of the worlds 
largest and most polluted cities industry is being directed to 
small and mediumsized cities he said 
he said mexico had been badly hurt by low petroleum prices but 
other sectors such as auto manufacturing had helped compensate in 
the export market unemployment and strikes were both down he said

michael dukakis accused vice president 
george bush today of playing hooky on education while the 
reagan administration has slashed teacher training and remedial 
courses for poor children 
opening a prelabor day foray into three crucial west coast 
states the democratic nominee boasted of a school aid program he 
initiated as massachusetts governor and asked about his republican 
opponent 
where was george while all this was going on where was the 
man who now says he wants to be the education president he was 
playing hooky he was nowhere to be found 
dukakis said in the prepared text of an oakland speech that the 
nov 8 presidential election offers a choice between those with a 
lifetime commitment to education and those who see it as an 
electionyear strategy 
on his arrival in california wednesday night dukakis also took 
a swing at bushs newly proclaimed interest in protecting the 
environment including steps to eliminate acid rain 
dukakis called bush one of the charter members of the 
environmental wrecking crew which went to washington in 1981 with 
president reagan he said bush had flipflopped on offshore oil 
drilling a hot political issue in california 
dukakis made his remarks as the bush campaign devoted a day of 
campaigning wednesday to environmental issues dukakis is touring 
three west coast states california oregon and washington in an 
effort to attract the conservative democrats who voted for 
president reagan in the last two elections 
while campaigning last june in california bush said he opposed 
offshore drilling for oil according to dukakis last week in 
texas he said he was for it dukakis said 
an aide to the massachusetts governor later showed reporters a 
los angeles times story that quoted bush as telling a texas 
audience my opponent opposes offshore drilling and i support 
it 
dukakis said we need a president who understands how 
important our environment is how important out quality of life is 
a president whose environmental policy doesnt change with the time 
zones 
i understand mr bush was in michigan talking about the 
environment dukakis said coming from somebody who was charter 
member of the environmental wrecking crew which went to washington 
in 1981 thats very strange indeed 
earlier in the day maine sen george mitchell delivered a 
political preemptive strike designed to blunt bush criticism of 
dukakis record on the cleanup of boston harbor 
bush was in boston today to tour the polluted harbor 
the three states dukakis is visiting have not supported a 
democrat in the last four presidential elections 
democrat hubert h humphrey carried washington in 1968 the last 
time california and oregon backed a democrat for president was in 
1964 
those three states have large numbers of democrats who have 
consistently backed republican presidential candidates a pattern 
dukakis hopes to break this fall 
referred to now as reagan democrats those voters are a major 
target of the dukakis campaign 
top dukakis campaign strategists are convinced bush cannot hold 
the support once reliably democratic blue collar voters gave to 
reagan 
we are not rerunning the elections of 1980 or 1984 said 
dukakis campaign manager susan estrich we are not running 
against ronald reagan we are running against george bush and our 
focus is very much on the future 
before he left boston dukakis had a joint news conference with 
mitchell who said in 1981 the reaganbush administration tried 
to kill the entire water pollution program congress resisted and 
so they then settled for undermining it 
republicans have blamed dukakis for dragging his feet on efforts 
to clean up the harbor 
its been polluted for hundreds of years said dukakis 
im very proud of the fact that im the governor whos cleaning 
it up 
mitchell also gave his support to dukakis renewed questioning 
of bushs role in the sale of arms to iran 
a member of the senatehouse committee that investigated the 
arms sale mitchell quoted bush in a television interview as saying 
he went along with the arms sale because if he erred he erred on 
the side of getting the hostages out 
the maine senator said that in his bushs own words it is 
unmistakably clear that he went along with the sale of arms and 
knew that it was an exchange for hostages 
increasingly under attack by bush and reagan dukakis responded 
this week by renewing his criticism of the arms sales

an aids patient and a cryonics laboratory 
have sued the state for the right to have his body frozen after 
death in the hope he can someday be revived 
the lawsuit was filed in superior court on tuesday by an 
unidentified man and by alcor life extension foundation inc of 
riverside which offers cryonic suspension 
cryonic suspension is the practice of freezing bodies after 
death in the belief that eventually they may be able to be brought 
back to life and cured of their illness 
the lawsuit challenges the health services departments refusal 
to grant a permit so the aids victim can have his body frozen the 
state granted such permission until it changed its policy in june 
the suit stated 
the suit claims the man has a constitutional right to control 
the disposition of his body 
pete weisser a health services spokesman in sacramento said 
wednesday that the department had not been served with the lawsuit 
and had no comment on it 
weisser said that there is no provision in state law for 
issuance of a permit for of cryonic suspension but saul kent a 
member of alcor life extension foundation contends the law does 
not forbid the issuing of such a permit 
the only reason they have yet given for declaring it illegal 
or saying it may be illegal is there is nothing in the law saying 
you can do it kent said 
riverside county authorities have been investigating alcor since 
kents 83yearold mother dora died there dec 11 without a 
doctor present and her head was removed and frozen 
the coroners office ruled mrs kents death a homicide brought 
on by a lethal dose of barbiturates authorities have not filed any 
charges however and alcor won a court order barring examination 
of mrs kents head

pay for weapons he said the arms would be kept in barracks and 
used by the civilians in case of security threats 
his remarks indicated however that military officers would 
retain some authority over the civilian militias

congresses are libyas governing bodies and the committees are 
revolutionary panels that serve as watchdogs of gadhafis

having a relationship with egypt he said if there is any 
advantage it would be for america when arafat heard his name 
mentioned he straightened up turned to a colleague and smiled

destroyed much of the historic chiado shopping district a week ago 
the cabinet of the centerright social democrat government said 
it would set aside 325 million in subsidized loans for

consider holding a referendum on oneparty rule a process that 
could lead to amendment of the constitution and general elections

the ruling burma socialist program party is legal must be changed 
in what was seen as a gesture to students who have been at the 
vanguard of prodemocracy protests maung maung said the government 
would permit student unions as long as they were properly 
formed 
he also said that after passions cooled the government would 
rebuild the rangoon university student union building which the 
military destroyed in july 1962 after ne win led the coup that 
ended democracy in burma 
ne win who resigned in july after 26 years of authoritarian 
rule abolished all political parties except his own outlawed all 
unions and opposition groups and imposed rigid controls on the

sein lwin masses of demonstrators have rallied and held strikes 
demanding immediate formation of an interim government to restore 
democracy

emergency meeting to consider a referendum on the issue but the 
call did not end protests

isolated the southeast asian nation union burma airways last

dispersed two small rallies one outside the nearby us embassy 
and one at a nearby government building also broke up 
on wednesday the government of president maung maung warned it 
would take action against demonstrators illegally occupying 
government buildings and facilities

bank employees heard about the request and demanded the bank not 
comply they said ne win no long had authority to order such 
transfers 
as word spread of the transfer request a crowd gathered arond 
the bank and senior bank officials eventually rejected it the 
official said he declined to identify the people who sought the 
transfer or the bank in london

some of the justice department officials who 
went to japan to attend a legal conference with edwin meese iii 
this week might have been barred from the trip under attorney 
general richard l thornburghs travel policy an aide says 
thornburgh sworn in to succeed meese on aug 12 will pursue 
the policy he had as governor of pennsylvania allowing trips only 
when they relate directly to official duties the aide said 
wednesday speaking on condition he not be named 
based on his experiences in pennsylvania he will only permit 
travel when it pertains exactly to your job the aide said he 
said this policy would rule out traveling on peopletopeople 
type cultural exchanges 
the decision in pennsylvania was not to go on these kinds of 
trips he said 
thornburgh and his assistants discussed the five participants on 
the tokyo trip but decided against bumping any of them because the 
trip had been planned long before the attorney general assumed 
control of the agency the aide said 
moreover they felt that pulling back from the fourday legal 
symposium that ended today could embarrass the japanese hosts he 
said it involved a foreign government and certain commitments 
had been made 
the seminar entitled usjapan bilateral session a new era 
in legal and economic relations ran from aug 29sept 1 
although some of the participants went over days earlier 
joseph a morris director of the office of liaison services and 
head of the justice delegation submitted requests for travel per 
diem for 10 days in japan at a cost of 237 daily 
morris a reagan administration appointee as were the other 
participants has announced his resignation to join the midamerica 
legal foundation in chicago on sept 18

general at the office of justice programs patrick korten director 
of the office of public affairs robert bonner us attorney in 
los angeles and cheryl nolan morris subordinate 
deborah bustionwade a justice department spokeswoman 
initially said that charles rule assistant attorney general for 
antitrust went on the trip later she said that although rule 
went to japan he did not attend the legal conference but was on 
other business 
but his travel as a seminar participant was approved by harold 
christensen the acting deputy attorney general in a memorandum 
dated aug 19 
the program included seminars such as creating a crimefree 
society and japanus relations sharing a common goal 
there were also addresses by japanese and americans and field trips 
to prisons japanese companies and government offices 
the justice department paid the expenses of the six us 
officials but did not pick up the tab for meese or his wife 
ursula 
norman swanson a spokesman for peopletopeople international 
the kansas citybased sponsor of the conference told the new york 
times the group would cover the meeses travel expenses 
but william barraclough the head of peopletopeople a 
nonprofit group said he did not know if his group had paid the 
meeses way 
us officials from other agencies also attended the trip 
they included susan liebeler and ronald cass members of the 
international trade commission and jim craig the itc spokesman 
the itc paid their expenses 
but edward fleischman a commissioner at the securities and 
exchange commission accepted a free trip from the sponsors sec 
attorney paul gonson said the sec like some agencies has the 
authority to allow some people to accept gifts so long as the 
purpose is to represent the commission 
last year a similar conference attended by meese and other 
justice officials was held in china sponsors of the trip picked up 
expenses for mrs meese and deborah morris morris wife the 
office of government ethics said recently that the women should not 
have taken the free trips federal regulations prohibit relatives

un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
today named swedens un ambassador as his special representative 
to the faltering iraniraq peace talks to continue negotiations in 
his absence 
perez de cuellar announced his selection of jan eliasson 47 
shortly before departing for lisbon with the 8dayold talks 
deadlocked 
the iraqi and iranian foreign ministers have not met 
facetoface since last friday because of problems over formalizing 
the ceasefire and agreeing on early troop withdrawal and freedom 
of navigation negotiations have continued on a lower technical 
level 
in the hour before his departure the un chief held separate 
meetings with the two ministers tariq aziz of iraq and ali akbar 
velayati of iran to introduce them to eliasson 
velayati later told reporters he was very pleased with the 
appointment of eliasson and was glad the secretarygeneral will 
continue his supervision and guidance of the talks 
perez de cuellar said he was prepared to return to geneva on 
friday if necessary to continue negotiations in person 
these are very difficult complicated negotiations and it 
takes time the secretarygeneral said as he continued 
lastminute efforts to arrange a joint meeting of the two 
ministers the problem is lack of confidece distrust like 
sand you cannot build on sand 
but he said i am persuaded that both parties honestly are 
interested in finding a solution 
he said both ministers would remain in geneva as long as 
necessary 
eliasson worked for six years as special assistant to the late 
swedish prime minister olaf palme on the iraniraq problem 
former un secretarygeneral kurt waldheim appointed palme as his 
special representative on the persian gulf war 
eliasson was appointed by palme shortly before the outbreak of 
the war in september 1980 
on wednesday night the secretarygeneral failed to persuade 
iranian and iraqi envoys to meet facetoface 
the main issue stalling the talks centers on a 1975 treaty 
making the shattalarab waterway the southern border of the 
warring nations 
iraq has repudiated the treaty and wants full control of the 
waterway its only outlet to the sea it also demands that the 
channel immediately be cleared of sunken ships which have blocked 
it since the beginning of the war 
iran maintains the 1975 treaty is valid it refuses to clear the 
waterway until a permanent ceasefire and troop withdrawals are 
worked out 
a preliminary truce took effect aug 20 
iranian leaders claimed wednesday that iraq had violated the 
unbrokered ceasefire on three occasions 
president ali khamenei was quoted by irans official islamic 
republic news agency as calling for the massive presence of 
people on the battefield to enable us to stand against any new 
aggression by the enemy khameini made the statement in a speech 
in the northeastern city of mashad 
irna is monitored in cyprus 
in baghdad the staterun aljomhuriya newspaper demanded that 
iran abandon once and for all its greedy intentions in iraq and 
other arab countries and not interfere in iraqs internal affairs 
international pressure appeared to be building to persuade the 
countries to reach an agreement 
perez de cuellar met separately tuesday with the ambassadors of 
the five permanent members of the un security council britain 
china france the soviet union and the united states observers 
believe he urged the five to exert pressure on iran and iraq to 
achieve progress in the stalled talks 
in baghdad the ambassadors of the five countries met president 
saddam hussein on wednesday the official iraqi news agency said 
hussein reiterated iraqs desire to reach a settlement with iran 
it did not elaborate 
the geneva talks were preceded by irans acceptance in july of a 
us ceasefire resolution iraq accepted the resolution when it 
was passed last year the two sides agreed to a ceasefire followed 
by the direct talks

66 million acres of woodland and montanas governor urged 
residents to find asphalt to limit the number of new wildfires 
as flames threatened homes in two states 
in wyoming yellowstone national parks south gate opened this 
morning for the first time in almost two weeks all five gates and 
public roads within the park are now open despite fires that have 
charred more than a halfmillion acres 
fire also blackened forest and brush wednesday in washington 
california idaho and utah 
about 180000 more acres burned during the past week as new 
blazes ignited in eastern oregon and washington northern 
california and northern idaho a federal drought advisory issued 
this week said

dry contributing to the worsening forest fires and little relief 
was expected soon 
oregons department of forestry announced wednesday that 38 
million acres of private state and other forest in eastern oregon 
will be closed indefinitely due to extreme fire danger and scarce 
resources to fight new blazes already closed are 28 million acres 
in western oregon 
the state needs to limit the risk of wildfire and this has 
proven to be an effective way to do that said state forester 
james brown 
dry grass timber and rugged terrain also made it too dangerous 
to directly attack oregons biggest forest fire the 36000acre 
tepee butte blaze so it will be allowed to burn to fire lines 
the blaze in the wallowawhitman national forest and hells 
canyon national recreation area on the idaho line will grow to 
59000 acres before it reaches the lines us forest service 
spokesman ron dehart said 
we cannot safely put crews up close to this fire he said 
the forest service on wednesday also began training the first of 
350 backup firefighters from oregon to relieve weary crews around 
the nation 
montana gov ted schwinden appealed to the public wednesday to 
avoid outdoor recreation during labor day weekend and said 
restrictions may be imposed if the fire hazard doesnt ease 
his advice to labor day recreationists find some asphalt 
the governor said 5000 firefighters were battling blazes on 
208000 acres in montana and 173000 acres burned in earlier 
fires he put the cost at 15 million 
we simply dont need any more fires at this point schwinden 
said 
the montana fish and game commission reluctantly bowed wednesday 
to a request from schwinden and postponed the start of all hunting 
seasons until sept 16 because of fire danger sheep and mountain 
goat seasons were to open today and several other seasons were to 
open saturday 
some woodland in washington where fires have burned more than 
23000 acres also was put offlimits wednesday due to fire danger 
a forest products company closed 400000 acres to the public and 
the us forest service banned campfires outside designated 
campgrounds in the wenatchee national forest 
along western montanas rocky mountain front bulldozers cut a 
fire line wednesday to protect two ranches from a 51000acre blaze 
that spread monday from the scapegoat wilderness to private land 
crews also hosed down a cabin as a precaution 
weve had lots of calls from people all over the area offering 
bulldozers and whatever they got said john krause whose ranch 
is a mile and a half from the fire 
at west yellowstone mont on the western border of yellowstone 
national park officials assured nervous residents that flames from 
the 109000acre north fork blaze two miles away in the park would 
not reach town 
about 1000 firefighters dug 12footwide lines with bulldozers 
and removed vegetation from the edge of the community an 
evacuation plan is ready as a precaution 
in the absarokabeartooth wilderness north of yellowstone two 
fires consumed more than 83000 acres by wednesday and firefighters 
fought to keep flames from advancing farther south 
in nearby livingston mont some residents covered their faces 
wednesday with bandanas surgeons masks or gas masks 
the smokes been really bad said dain kovash a motel 
clerk it makes smoking cigarettes seem healthy 
yellowstones chief naturalist said wednesday that nothing but 
winter weather will snub wildfires that have blackened more than 20 
percent of the parks 22 million acres 
we are still anticipating that these fires will keep burning 
until the first heavy winter snows said naturalist george 
robinson 
in eastern idaho crews and bulldozers protected ranches in 
caribou national forest from the raging 6800acre trail creek 
fire a mile away 
the majority of the ranches are on alert said forest 
spokesman dan pugmire but we didnt have to alert them they 
were all standing outside watching it 
the fire was the most threatening of 17 major blazes in idaho 
that have burned more than 70000 acres 
in california crews fought two fastmoving fires in the central 
sierra nevada one sparked by children playing with matches 
destroyed at least one home forced the evacuation of 17 people

two amorous bulls have landed their 
owner in court facing a lawsuit charging that the pairs romantic 
adventure blighted the careers of some dairy cows from a 
neighboring herd 
judge james p fiedler scheduled trial for nov 28 to determine 
how much damages should be assessed in the 1986 incident 
dairy farmers michael and paul mieden of rural barneveld are 
seeking about 74000 including 33000 for reduced milk 
production from lloyd vivian and his insurance company vivians 
attorney has offered to settle for 2500 
the miedens argue that vivian failed to patch a hole in a fence 
and the bulls got into a pasture containing about 80 of their cows 
about 30 cattle became pregnant including some heifers that 
will never reach full potential in size and production because 
they were so young when they became pregnant colleen martin an 
appraiser hired by the miedens said wednesday 
a veterinarian hired by vivian said that the miedens could have 
gotten abortions for the pregnant cattle for only 500 
fiedler said there have been similar cases but usually 
involving only a few cows 
in a case that reached the wisconsin supreme court in 1911 a 
farmer objected to the social status of a lowly born bull that 
trespassed in his field and courted one of his heifers named 
martha

life wandered beyond the confines of his own pastures and sought 
the society of the adolescent and unsophisticated martha justice

construction spending in july posted its 
sharpest increase in four months only partly recovering from a 
slump in june the government said thursday 
the commerce department said building activity rose 12 percent 
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4010 billion in july 
following a revised 15 percent drop in the previous month the 
june figure was originally estimated as a slight 01 percent gain 
construction activity this year has been generally lackluster 
seesawing from month to month the july performance was the 
strongest since march while the june decline was the worst in five 
months 
i think it shows the futility of the federal reserve board 
raising interest rates in expectation of a great economic boom 
in construction there isnt going to be a great boom i think its 
just sort of plugging along said michael sumichrast an 
economist in washington who publishes a construction newsletter 
for the first seven months of the year construction activity 
was up only 09 percent over the same period in 1987 that doesnt 
even keep pace with the 19 percent increase in building costs 
between the two periods 
the strength in july came from increases in government building 
projects offices and apartments singlefamily housing factories 
and shopping centers registered declines 
construction of office buildings in july was up 29 percent to 
288 billion activity in that sector has risen or held steady in 
every month since february despite high vacancy rates in many parts 
of the country particularly the southwest where the energy 
industry has slumped 
its incredible i dont know why theyre still building 
because the amount of empty office buildings is staggering 
sumichrast said 
the july level of office construction was up 95 percent over 
the same month in 1987 
sumichrast said the strength in the office sector is fueled in 
part by insurance companies and pension funds looking to shift 
money from the stock and bond markets also foreigners who have 
been accumulating dollars because of the us trade deficit are 
investing in us real estate 
government construction projects rose 38 percent to an annual 
rate of 812 billion and included a 128 percent jump in highway 
construction 
factory construction which had enjoyed strong gains in march 
april and may as manufacturers increased capacity to meet rising 
overseas for us goods fell 07 percent to 138 billion in july 
residential construction overall was up 05 percent to an annual 
rate of 1883 billion in july following three monthly declines 
construction of multiunit housing rose 19 percent to 218 
billion but construction of singlefamily homes which has been 
hurt by a steady rise in mortgage interest rates fell 06 percent 
to 1144 billion 
shopping center and other commercial projects were off 07 
percent to 285 billion hotel and motel construction fell 97 
percent to 65 billion reversing a 75 percent increase in june

the same salt lake citybound delta 
flight involved in a crash here that killed 13 wednesday aborted 
takeoff today because of an apparent loss of power in one engine 
an airline spokesman said 
based on the incident that happened yesterday the captain was 
extremely cautious and elected simply to come back to the gate and 
let maintenance look at the engine said bill berry in atlanta 
flight 1141 like the one that crashed a boeing 727 let off 
its passengers after returning to the terminal at dallasfort worth 
international airport they were put on another 727 and sent on 
their way about three hours late 
the flight which originated in jackson miss had been 
scheduled to leave here at 831 am the number of people aboard 
was not immediately known 
berry said the captain today released the brakes and started his 
takeoff roll reaching about about 30 mph but did not get the 
proper readings from one of his engines he decided to go back to 
the gate 
the captain feels that he had what is called a compressor 
stall there was a crosswind blowing across the runway that can 
interrupt the smoothness of the airflow that goes into the engine 
creating a temporary loss of power this is very likely what 
happened berry said 
the 727 like the one that crashed had pratt and whitney 
engines berry said 
don burkhalter an assistant us attorney in jackson who was 
aboard the plane said it was a routine takeoff until we got 
almost to the end of the runway then we heard what sounded like 
bumps and the pilot deaccelerated he said there was a problem with 
the compressors 
the captain said and this is a quote its just one of those 
things burkhalter said we just laughed 
burkhalter said a couple of people on todays flight said they 
were among the survivors of wednesdays crash

death penalty are you kidding cuomo said on a flight from 
albany ny to quantico va this is so far the most 
superficial campaign and it is because republicans have made it 
that way the republicans are not talking about any big issues so 
far 
cuomo said the tone of the campaign was ignoring other important 
issues including drugs national defense international affairs and

a traveling circus that planned to give a 
show for free to prison inmates pulled out at the last minute after 
prison authorities said reporters couldnt cover the event circus 
officials said 
officials of circus vargas charged that authorities at 
stateville correctional center reneged on their agreement by 
denying media access to the shows after the company complied with 
costly personnel and equipment checks 
john heber circus vargas director of marketing said the circus 
had planned two performances in the prison recreation yard 
wednesday but the visit was canceled hours before showtime 
officials at the prison declined comment but nic howell 
spokesman for the illinois department of corrections said he 
became aware of the dispute tuesday afternoon 
the warden told me he was concerned about security as well he 
should be but the bottom line was that it all was more hassle than 
it was worth howell said 
in february 1987 a stateville inmate escaped by riding a movie 
crews truck out of the maximumsecurity prison during the filming 
of weeds starring nick nolte 
heber said plans for the circus visit included extensive 
discussions with prison officials 
we had done everything they asked he said we even 
previewed the show for the assistant warden 
background checks were done on the 35 performers who would go 
into the prison we gave them a list of every tool we agreed to 
have the trucks stripped and searched 
then suddenly they came back tuesday night and said no media 
at all 
heber said the companys president clifford vargas said it 
is a free show and all we were going to get out of it was some 
publicity he said it wasnt fair and canceled the show

a federal appeals court today upheld former 
navy radioman jerry whitworths conviction and 365year prison 
sentence for peddling communications secrets to the soviet union as 
a member of the walker family spy ring 
in a 30 decision the 9th us circuit court of appeals said 
there was ample evidence that whitworth who admitted stealing 
cryptographic information but denied knowing its destination knew 
the material was being sold to the soviets 
the court also said the sentence which prohibits parole 
consideration for 60 years is not disproportionate to 
whitworths crimes 
john walker mastermind of the spy ring pleaded guilty in 
maryland and was sentenced to life in prison with parole possible 
in 10 years 
the appeals court today rejected defense arguments that 
whitworth should be treated no more harshly than walker 
alan caplan a lawyer for whitworth said he would appeal 
whitworth was convicted of espionage in 1986

two men who dug a beached ship out of 
the sand face federal charges they damaged the home of the 
endangered alabama beach mouse 
thomas bagwell and melvin mcpherson were cited with vehicle 
trespass and damaging critical habitat of an endangered species 
which can net each up to a 500 fine said jerome carroll manager 
of the bon secour national wildlife refuge 
bagwell said he checked with the sheriffs office before 
removing the boat but didnt know he needed permission from the 
us fish and wildlife service 
he said the removal of the 38foot vessel in june at request of 
its owner actually helped protect the environment because it was 
full of oil and diesel and other debris that would have caused 
one heck of a mess 
the mouse which has a buffcolored back a white belly and is 4 
inches from head to tail was added to the fish and wildlife 
service list of endangered species in 1985 the mouse numbers in 
the hundreds carroll said 
the sand dunes in the refuge are designated by the government as 
the critical habitat of the alabama beach mouse 
bagwell described himself as an environmentalist but said his 
concern stops short of rodents 
how would you like to have a rat in your pocket he said 
youd stomp it wouldnt you 
carroll said heavy machines such as a crane and fourwheel drive 
vehicles were used to pull the the boat out

george bush today lashed out at michael dukakis environmental 
record in his democratic rivals home state charging that the 
governor has repeatedly fought efforts to make boston harbor 
cleaner dukakis called the republican nominee a member of the 
reagan administrations environmental wrecking crew 
while the two presidential candidates traded rhetorical salvos 
over the environment former contender jesse jackson denied reports 
that aides to dukakis had told him not to campaign in several 
states 
the democratic nominee upon ariving in california wednesday 
night said that he will be meeting with leaders of the jackson 
campaign who are already becoming a very important part of our 
campaign in california 
the democratic party has never been so united as it is this 
year dukakis said 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
later in a speech today for the oakland public school system 
dukakis criticized his gop rival for playing hooky while the 
reagan administration cut education programs 
and where was george while all this was going on where was 
the man who now says he wants to be the education president he was 
playing hooky he was nowhere to be found dukakis said in 
prepared remarks 
he charged the reagan administration has eliminated remedial 
math and reading programs for 500000 poor children while in 
massachusetts he started an essential skills program the 
reagan administration sought cuts in the remedial programs in 1981 
but was unsuccessful in an april 1988 report the education 
department said the number of children in remedial programs had 
dropped from 5 million in 197980 to 45 million in the 198586

bush who took an early morning boat tour of the polluted harbor 
in dukakis hometown said dukakis had sought permission from 
former environmental protection agency administrator william 
ruckelshaus to delay a ban on dumping wastes in the harbor 
dukakis first administration prepared the papers to do so but it 
was his successor ed king who actually filed the epa request 
two hundred years ago tea was spilled in the boston harbor in 
the name of liberty the vice president said if tea were 
spilled in the boston harbor today it would desolve in the residue 
of my opponents neglect and delay 
while campaigning in his opponents backyard bush was greeted 
by about 70 dukakis supporters who chanted where was george 
a refrain questioning bushs role in the reagan administration 
a new national poll meanwhile shows bush and dukakis in a dead 
heat but a 2to1 sentiment that the democratic vice presidential 
nominee sen lloyd bentsen of texas is more qualified than sen 
dan quayle of indiana the republican nominee for the no 2 slot 
another poll found dukakis running even against bush in 
massachusetts two months after the governor led the republican 
nominee by 14 percentage points in a similar survey 
in the boston herald poll of 400 likely massachusetts voters 
conducted wednesday dukakis and bush were tied at 42 percent each 
with 15 percent undecided and one percent favoring other candidates 
i cant believe it in massachusetts a pleased bush 
responded when shown the newspaper headline 
bush who aides said was trying to separate himself from reagan 
administration policies on the environment began touting the new 
theme wednesday during an appearance on the shore of lake erie in 
michigan 
promising swift action on acid rain if elected bush also said 
he would convene a global conference during his first year in 
office to address the problem of the warming of the atmosphere he 
further called for wetlands protection and pledged a policy of 
zero tolerance for polluters 
i am an environmentalist always have been from my earliest 
days growing up and then as a congressman and i always will 
be he said in michigan 
dukakis on wednesday shifted blame to the reagan administration 
saying it tried to eliminate federal funding for waste treatment 
plants and called bush an electionyear convert to the 
environmental cause 
i understand mr bush was in michigan talking about the 
environment dukakis said coming from somebody who was a 
charter member of the environmental wrecking crew which went to 
washington in 1981 thats very strange indeed 
dukakis is campaigning today on the west coast in an effort to 
win back conservative democrats who voted for president reagan in 
the last two elections 
in atlanta jackson was meeting with a number of key supporters 
a week after meeting quietly with the dukakis camp 
jackson met with dukakis aides in washington last week and was 
reportedly angered by the suggestion he stay out of several states 
according to one participant in the discussions who asked not to 
be identified the request was withdrawn 
the dukakis campaign denied such a suggestion was made and 
jackson in an appearance on cbs this morning said no that 
never has happened 
i would assume that there will be a lot of focus between now 
and labor day the time is getting late to determine whether 
there will be targeted states where priorities will be jackson 
said on nbctvs today show 
dukakis and jackson made a pact at the democratic convention in 
atlanta in july that essentially was designed to give the jackson 
constituency and its issues a voice in the democratic general 
election campaign 
both bush and dukakis came out just about even in the newest 
poll but the survey also found that bushs attacking campaign 
style has yet to win over the reagan democrats 
according to the abcwashington post poll released wednesday 
dukakis led bush 48 percent to 47 percent a statistical dead heat 
because of the 35point margin of error 
bushs harsh attacks on dukakis patriotism and defense 
positions have had no effect on dukakis lead among the reagan 
democrats who favor dukakis 5834 
the survey also found twice as many voters thought democratic 
vice presidential candidate lloyd bentsen was more qualified than 
quayle 
the survey of 1129 registered likely voters was begun last

five years after west europeans 
took to the streets in massive antimissile protests the united 
states on thursday began removing its intermediaterange rockets in 
accordance with a superpower treaty signed last year 
a truck convoy hauled nine pershing 2 missiles from a base near 
stuttgart and us officials said they would remove the remaining 
420 medium and shorterrange missiles from western europe in the 
next 36 months 
this is an important event in postwar history west german 
government spokesman friedhelm ost told a news conference in bonn 
the stationing of the missiles had sparked huge protests in 
western europe including a coordinated demonstration in several 
cities that drew hundreds of thousands of people in october 1983 
deployment of the missiles began the following month 
but the antimissile fervor waned and by the time president 
reagan and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev signed their treaty 
banning intermediaterange nuclear missiles in december only a 
handful of protesters was still active in west germany 
a group of antimissile activists who came to witness the 
removal applauded as the 15 us army trucks carrying the missiles 
left the heilbronn site in southern germany about 35 miles north 
of stuttgart 
they held up a banner saying heilbronn never again a nuclear 
powder keg 
one 66yearold woman who had taken part in dozens of protests 
said we have fought trembled sung and cried we were arrested 
and taken off in buses but weve always renewed our courage she 
declined to give her name 
a rocket motor explosion at heilbronn in january 1985 killed 
three us soldiers and injured 16 others west german news reports 
said the accident led thendefense minister manfred woerner to 
promise residents that heilbronn would be the first site from which 
missiles would be removed 
us navy cmdr gerry ryan of european command headquarters in 
stuttgart told the associated press its the first time that 
us intermediaterange missiles have been withdrawn in europe 
the remainder of the us army europeanbased 
intermediaterange nuclear missiles are scheduled to be removed 
over a 36month period he added 
the soviet union began removing its missiles from czechoslovakia 
and east germany in february before the us senate had ratified 
the treaty 
east germanys official news agency adn said in march that the 
soviets had completed the removal of all 54 shorterrange ss12 
missiles but said nothing about the 53 ss23 missiles also covered 
by the treaty 
the official czechoslovak news agency ctk reported in july that 
all of the 39 ss12 shorterrange missiles based in that country 
had been removed in february and march 
original nato plans called for 572 intermediaterange nuclear 
missiles in five west european countries to counter the soviet 
rockets pointed at the west 
but the united states ultimately deployed only 429 missiles in 
west germany britain italy and belgium after plans to station the 
rockets in the netherlands were scrapped 
of those deployed 108 pershing 2 missiles and 96 cruise 
missiles were stationed at four bases in west germany 
one part of the convoy carrying the us missiles headed to a 
us army post in frankfurt while another was heading to a 
different base in preparation for air transport back to 
elimination sites in the united states ryan said 
us officials have said that some of the rockets would be 
destroyed at the frankfurt site and that the nuclear warheads 
would be shipped back to the appropriate authority in the 
united states 
under terms of the treaty the soviet union and united states 
agreed to eliminate all landbased nuclear missiles that have a 
range from 300 to 3000 miles

joan brann who established the first just say no club and 
helped give a theme to the first ladys antidrug crusade resigned

abbott declared the organization was about 600000 in debt and 
needed more professional management than it was getting from brann 
or from tom adams foundation president who has since resigned 
the board also decided it could no longer afford to underwrite 
the local just say no office in oakland 
i cant understand why they would close us down practically 
without warning said brann 
ivy cohen a former pampg employee who runs the foundations 
national headquarters in walnut creek said other just say no 
offices are operated by volunteers and are selfsufficient 
the only local office the national foundation was paying for 
was oaklands she said and that made up a big chunk of our

iran brainwashed iraqi prisoners of war 
turning many into fanatical supporters of iran and many pows from 
both nations are afraid to return home a un report said thursday 
the prisoners fear interrogation about their loyalty to their 
homeland becaue they surrendered said the report by three un 
experts who visited iranian and iraqi pow camps in late july and 
early august 
similar problems accompanied negotiations for the voluntary 
return of prisoners that prolonged the korean war for more than a 
year until april 1953 
iran and iraq now under a unbrokered ceasefire in their 
eightyear war are deadlocked in peace talks in geneva over the 
withdrawal of forces and rights to the shattalarab waterway 
forming their border the talks also are supposed to arrange the 
prompt repatriation of prisoners 
the un experts are maj gen rene bats of the belgian army and 
international law professors wolfram karl of the university of 
salzburg austria and torkel opsahl of the university of oslo 
norway 
in both countries we learned that one set of pows was used to 
influence or inform upon another they said in their report 
pow camps in iran were dominated by iraqi prisoners who swore 
allegiance to irans ayatollah ruhollah khomeini and denounced 
iraqs president saddam hussein as an atheist the report said 
cultural committees in the camps provided religious and 
political instruction called spiritual guidance it said 
to us it is indistinguishable from mental pressure it said 
many pows stated that the guidance took the form of 
brainwashing putting them under permanently heavy mental 
pressure the un team said the results of the treatment are 
striking 
in each camp we visited there were fanatical hysterical and 
sometimes violent demonstrations by the prisoners who were 
assembled inside along the barbedwire fences shouting 
prokhomeini slogans and denouncing hussein and the superpowers 
the report said 
about half the camp residents joined the rallies but the un 
team observed that a zealous shiite minority of 10 or 20 percent of 
the prisoners dominated the rest 
iranian authorities said that system developed because they 
allow the iraqi prisoners considerable autonomy in the camp 
any iraqi pow who took part in antihussein demonstrations might 
well worry about having to explain his actions when debriefed after 
repatriation particularly if another pow informed the iraqi 
authorities 
iranians also are worried about repatriating iraqi prisoners 
the report said 
there is a risk that riots may break out for example in the 
moment when transfer is to take place with a view to registration 
and repatriation it said 
in iraq the un team found iranian pows were also worried 
about going home 
the report said iranian pows had divided loyalties some favored 
the khomeini government some preferred the prerevolutionary 
government of the shah of iran and some were loyal to the 
mujahedeen khalq rebels fighting khomeini 
the majority however seemed inclined to return to iran 
provided they were given effective guarantees that they would not 
be subject to persecution on their return in the absence of such 
guarantees however their future looks gloomy the un team 
said 
the un teams main criticism of iraqs pow camps was 
occasional abuse by guards they found no proof of systematic 
indoctrination 
the un investigators estimated that iran may be holding up to

united states and soviet union should halt 
production of a key component of nuclear weapons as a way of pacing 
cuts in their arsenals according to a group of arms control 
specialists 
in an article to be published friday in the journal science the 
group called for stopping further production of tritium a hydrogen 
isotope that decays at a rate of 55 percent yearly tritium is a 
component of the modern compact nuclear warheads deployed by the 
superpowers 
a nuclear weapons scientist from lawrence livermore national 
laboratory however responded that the proposal poses numerous 
problems and could complicate ussoviet arms talks 
advocating the tritium factor as a means of arms control 
were four specialists headed by j carson mark associated with 
the nuclear control institute a washingtonbased policy group 
mark is former leader of the theoretical division at los alamos 
national laboratory 
mark contended that the 55 percent annual decay of tritium 
could serve as a forcing function to produce steady verifiable 
reductions in the superpowers nuclear arsenals such reductions 
would result in a comprehensive 50 percent cut in warheads by about 
12 years after an agreement the year 2001 if the cutoff were to 
begin now 
mutual suspension of new tritium production he wrote would 
represent a shared commitment to keep reductions in nuclear 
armaments going at a steady pace 
mark noted that such a halt also would allay safety concerns 
on both sides associated with continuing to operate their aging 
production reactors 
the preactor at the department of energys savannah river plant 
near aiken sc which produces both tritium and plutonium was 
shut down last month after undergoing a sudden power surge while 
workers were attempting to restart the reactor the plants two 
other production reactors currently are also shut down one for 
maintenance and the other due to safety concerns 
with a halt in tritium production mark said expensive plans to 
upgrade and eventually replace these reactors could be set aside 
the production reactors of both sides would be placed on standby 
ready to restart tritium production only if nuclear arms talks 
break down he wrote 
mark said an agreement to halt nuclear materials production 
could be verified by reconnaissance satellites monitoring 
heatgenerated infrared radiation at the facilities 
any undeclared source of thermal radiation could be challenged 
as a potential clandestine facility and made subject to onsite 
inspection he argued 
in a rebuttal published alongside marks proposal wg 
sutcliffe a scientist with the evaluation and planning program at 
lawrence livermore said that any proposal to limit nuclear 
materials as a means of arms control is premature 
he contended that asymmetries in nuclear materials production 
capabilities design practices and delivery system capabilities 
could lead to disparate impacts on the us and soviet stockpiles 
possibly leaving the us in a vulnerable position 
proposing nuclear materials limits is fraught with great 
uncertainties about the comparability of effects on the two 
stockpiles and verification issues because of the unknowns about 
the soviet stockpile and production capabilities sutcliffe said 
noting that early nuclear weapons did not use tritium he said 
that as a result of the inevitable research efforts new 
technology might circumvent or reduce the need for tritium in 
efficient modern warheads 
coauthoring the mark article were paul l leventhal president 
of the nuclear control institute milton m hoenig the institutes 
scientific director and retired rear adm thomas d davies former 
assistant director of the us arms control and disarmament agency

the united states is concerned about reports 
that iraq may have used chemical weapons in a campaign to suppress 
kurdish rebel groups the state department said thursday 
if the reports are accurate this is a grave violation of 
international human rights standards said spokeswoman phyllis 
oakley noting that use of chemical weapons was condemned in a un 
security council resolution approved last week 
she commended the turkish government for offering temporary 
shelter to kurdish refugees 
the turkish government said wednesday that 20000 kurdish 
refugees have been allowed into turkey from northeastern iraq 
where kurdish rebels said the baghdad government has launched its 
biggest offensive 
the kurds seek autonomy and sided with iran during the persian 
gulf war 
in geneva un spokesman francois giuliani said wednesday the 
world body was taking no action following allegations of the 
chemical attacks saying there was no independent confirmation the 
united nations has condemned iraq for use of chemical weapons 
during the iraniraq war

education 
she sees him as the light at the end of the tunnel if she can 
just get her foot into the door shell be ok she gets out of this 
horrible life shes been leading to her hes everything that she 
wants to be 
mccarthy played opposite ringwald in pretty in pink in both 
films his character has a a wealthier background than ringwalds 
it was a big question in all our minds before we started the 
film are people going to see this as pretty in pink ii 
ringwald said its stupid im a good actress and hes a good 
actor and were good together once we dove in and started working 
pretty in pink never came up 
ringwald admitted to being nervous about handling the role of 
jewel 
i didnt know if i could play that character she said i 
read pretty in pink and i thought i could do this in my 
sleep with jewel i wondered if it was possible for me to be 
sexy 
jewels experiences are considerably different from ringwalds 
i think you have to use your imagination to a large degree 
she said ive never been raped i didnt grow up the way she 
did i had to use research meet people look through pictures 
just get a feel for it and use your imagination 
jewel is not as educated as i am but she knows exactly whats 
going on 
ringwald did manage to find common emotional ground with her 
character 
i related to her insecurity a lot of people dont know what i 
have to be insecure about the actress said anybody when they 
fall in love is insecure do they think im attractive do they 
think im smart what affects jewel is her insecurity 
unlike most people her age ringwald can look back at a lengthy 
career she began acting in 1977 playing kate in the west coast 
stage production of annie in 1982 she made her film debut in 
paul mazurskys tempest and earned a golden globe nomination 
for best actress 
ringwald recently saw tempest on television and couldnt get 
over how much her acting had changed 
my voice was a lot higher she said i was all over the 
place i wasnt always in control i wasnt aware of what i was 
doing i was paying attention then not paying attention im a lot 
more focused than i used to be 
what about the future what does molly ringwald see herself 
doing in the 1990s 
everybody worries about where theyre going to be in 10 years 
i always wonder where im going to be i could be married raising 
children anythings possible 
would she still be like to be acting 
it wouldnt be the worst thing

labor costs rose productivity fell and 
workers despite higher wages lost some of their purchasing power 
in the second quarter the government said thursday analysts 
called the report a warning flag of inflation and more difficult 
economic times 
in revised figures for april through june the labor department 
said the efficiency of nonfarm businesses in churning out goods 
and services dropped at an annual rate of 14 percent its first 
quarterly decline since 1986 
labor costs meanwhile shot up at an annual rate of 57 percent 
the biggest increase since 1986 reflecting the productivity 
declines and wage and benefit increases averaging 42 percent 
annually 
charles renfro of alaphametrics an economic forecasting firm in 
bala cynwyd pa said the figures indicate that an inflationary 
head of steam is building 
some rise in unit labor costs and a decrease in productivity 
is a reflection of an economy that is beginning to battle itself 
he said the question really is whats going to hit first a 
recession or an inflationary period followed by recession 
the labor department had earlier put the productivity decline 
among nonfarm businesses responsible for threefourths of the 
nations economic activity at a worse 17 percent 
however that was before the government last week revised 
economic growth figures for the second quarter upward from 31 
percent to 33 percent annually 
with the higher growth output of goods and service by nonfarm 
businesses in the private sector increased 52 percent instead of 
the 47 percent estimated earlier 
but to achieve that increased output businesses had to raise 
the number of hours worked by their employees by 66 percent 
analysts said the increase in hours and conseqent decrease in 
productivty reflects a hiring boom in which employers at a time of 
decadelow unemployment are having to use lessskilled workers more 
if the marginal labor is less skilled the result is going to 
be some productivity declines said renfro we may have moved 
to a point where we have absorbed all of labors skilled capacity 
that is one of the things that usually characterizes an 
inflationary period 
roger brinner of data resources inc in lexington mass said 
employers were overzealous in hiring last spring predicting a 
slight increase in the unemployment rate the second half of this 
year 
there will not be any decrease in employment there just wont 
be the large increases there have been he said the cyclical 
boost to productivity is over and we need to run the economy at 
idle speed for a while rather than at the fast pace we did in 
1987 
despite the secondquarter decline businesses are still 16 
percent more efficient than they were a year ago according to the 
labor department numbers and labor costs over the 12 months are up 
just 29 percent 
essentially productivity is still moving upward although the 
trend is becoming somewhat discouraging said larry chimerine of 
the wefa group another bala cynwyd consulting group 
productivity is the number one economic issue in the country 
right now because it is what determines whether living standards 
improve chimerine said the presidential candidates should be 
debating how to improve it but they arent he complained 
the labor department said hourly wages and benefits nominally 
rose at an annual rate of 42 percent in the second quarter but 
after taking inflation into account the buying power of each hour 
of work declined 06 percent the first drop in real compensation 
for workers in a year 
the 57 percent increase in labor costs compared with just a 
01 percent rise in the first quarter was the largest since that 
last quarter of 1986 when it rose 61 percent 
while businesses as a whole turned less efficient the 
rebounding manufacturing sector continued to show large 
productivity gains at an annual pace of 36 percent in the second 
quarter atop a 34 percent increase in 1987 
thanks to the restructuring that took place in the 1980s 
manufacturing productivity is better than it has been in four 
decades said bruce steinberg an economist for merrill lynch 
but in the services area where most people are employed it has 
been dismal despite huge investments in computers and office 
equipment

the republicans won lady libertys hand for 
the traditional labor day kickoff of their presidential campaign 
but the democrats will try to steal their thunder with a visit to 
neighboring ellis island two days earlier 
sen dan quayle the gop vice presidential nominee beat the 
other candidates in reserving both liberty and ellis islands in new 
york harbor for campaign ceremonies all day monday the official 
labor day holiday 
they were there first said edie sheanhammond of boston a 
spokeswoman for the national park service which is custodian of 
both politically popular landmarks 
liberty island is the site of the statue of liberty and ellis 
island is where millions of european immigrants were processed for 
entry into the united states in the late 19th and early 20th 
centuries 
but dukakis reserved ellis island for a saturday morning 
appearance with his mother the former euterpe boukis who arrived 
there from greece as a young girl in 1913 with her immigrant 
parents and sisters 
quayle whose ancestors did not pass through ellis won the race 
for liberty and ellis islands when his aides tracked down park 
superintendent kevin buckley in washington on thursday and reserved 
both sites for labor day 
ms sheanhammond said reservations for the popular sites are 
granted on a firstcome firstserved basis to avoid charges of 
favoritism we have to play this really close to the book she

gov madeleine kunin today proposed 
excluding drug offenders from the house arrest program that allowed 
john zaccaro jr to serve his cocaine trafficking term in a 
1500amonth luxury apartment 
we must have public confidence in the system the governor 
said we have to send a very strong message to drug dealers 
the move came in part from the outcry over the corrections 
departments decision to allow the 24yearold son of former vice 
presidential candidate geraldine ferraro to participate in the 
program which allows nonviolent criminals to find their own 
housing and serve their sentences outside prison under supervision 
zaccaro was convicted in april of selling 25 worth of cocaine 
to an undercover officer he was sentenced to four months in jail 
but allowed to enter the house arrest program after less than an 
hour in prison 
later it was learned he was serving his time in a hotelstyle 
luxury apartment with cable television and a linen service 
kunin defended the program overall saying it provided 
punishment while alleviating prison overcrowding but proposed 
changes under which drug offenders like zaccaro would be considered 
more serious criminals and thus be excluded 
i think anyone who sells drugs is a serious offender 
kunin said 
kunin said the original guidelines for the program were drafted 
in 1983 and many assumptions about drug offenses had changed since 
then 
other changes kunin proposed would require all offenders in the 
program to spend at least 24 hours in jail 
she said she would also ask corrections officials to address 
equity in the program so that the poor would not be excluded 
because they could not come up with suitable accomodations and the 
rich are not favored with more luxurious conditions 
hallelujah addison county states attorney john quinn said 
upon learning of kunins proposal quinn prosecuted zaccaro and 
opposed allowing him him into the house arrest program 
i never considered that drug dealers were nonviolent 
offenders he said i never thought they should be in the house 
arrest program no matter who they are

kushum sat motionless on the heap 
of rotting straw and two corrugated tin sheets that once was her 
house and stared at the floodwaters that swept away her only child 
her 5yearold son rahim was one of seven children who drowned 
when the ganges river swollen with floodwaters coursing down from 
the himalayan foothills in neighboring india inundated this 
village of 500 people about 70 miles west of dhaka 
since the rainy season started in june more than 680 people 
have died in bangladesh the new nation and other dhaka newspapers 
said thursday the government whose toll is generally considered 
to be understated puts the toll at 250 
the government estimates the floods have displaced 25 million 
people nearly onefourth of bangladeshs population 
village elders in borshilla said thursday the village was 
flooded aug 22 when kushums son and the other children drowned 
and the water has been rising ever since 
for the past week kushum has refused to move from the spot where 
she last saw her son 
khaleque bhiyan one of the leaders said many villagers fled to 
stay with relatives in pabna 30 miles northwest of here 
some of those who remained were stricken with dysentery but were 
recovering with the help of medicine brought by relief workers from 
pabna 
blackish water stood up to 4 feet deep in many parts of 
borshilla people cried almost in unison please send us 
drinking water and cooked food we dont want anything else 
in pabna deputy magistrate khairul alam said government 
storehouses in the region contained enough food to feed flood 
victims in the region but there were not enough boats to get it to 
them 
what we need most urgently are boats to rescue thousands of 
people marooned in farflung areas and to provide relief to the 
flood victims he said 
president hussain muhammad ershad issued an international appeal 
for boats and grain 
on thursday government officials and a reporter were flown by 
helicopter to pabna from the capital dhaka 75 miles to the east 
the aircraft passed over villages where only roofs were visible 
occasionally twisted railroad tracks could be seen through the 
water 
the flood is playing havoc with life and property in 39 of the 
countrys 64 districts information minister mahbubur rahman said 
in pabna 
we need international help in meeting the emergency he 
said we want 2 million tons of grain either as a grant or a 
loan we are even prepared to buy some of it 
bangladesh is one of the worlds poorest nations its 109 
million people a figure recently revised by the government from 
105 million have a per capita income of about 150 a year 
floods bring annual disasters to the lowlying country where 
mighty rivers like the ganges dwarf the fields between them 
last year more than 1500 people died in the summer monsoons 
and in 1985 more than 10000 people were killed by cyclones and 
tidal waves along the bay of bengal 
in dhaka the flooding buriganga river has submerged onefourth 
of the city under water ranging from an inch to 5 feet but so far 
no deaths have been reported in the capital 
the city of 4 million is virtually isolated from the rest of the 
country the ministry of communications said 18 highways leading 
out of dhaka were closed because of flooding

the interior department wont offer oil and 
gas leases off massachusetts in the coming fiscal year if a 
congressional ban on leasing the best areas goes forward an 
official said thursday 
opponents of drilling are mistaken because the georges bank 
areas of the north atlantic most likely contains gas far less 
environmentally damaging in an accident than crude oil said 
william bettenberg director of the departments minerals 
management service 
core sample drilling carried out last spring by texas aampm 
university would not be permitted under a new provision of the 
congressional ban although seismic work still could continue he 
said 
bettenberg told reporters that the appropriations bill approved 
by a housesenate conference committee placing waters less than 
1312 feet deep 400 meters offlimits leaves nothing worth 
offering at an auction 
action on the bill is expected after congress returns next week 
interior secretary donald hodel has said he would recommend a veto 
but bettenberg said he did not know whether president reagan would 
do so 
the ban if it becomes law would expand the offlimits area to 
55 million acres from 32 million in previous years prohibitions 
limited to areas less than 656 feet 200 meters deep 
at this point nobody has produced at 400 meters bettenberg 
said interest beyond 400 meters lies somewhere between small and 
negligible 
the deepest offshore well is in the gulf of mexico at about 
1000 feet or 300 meters 
when the smaller moratorium was in effect in 1985 the interior 
department held a lease auction for the area and received no bids 
although estimates vary the department believes there is a 30 
percent chance of finding commercially valuable oil or gas in the 
moratorium area and if any is there the odds are 5050 that there 
is 1 trillion cubic feet of gas but only a remote chance of oil 
we think of the north atlantic as essentially a gas 
province bettenberg said 
environmental damage from an offshore gas well would be even 
less than oil said carolita kallaor assistant director for 
offshore operations bettenberg said it would be virtually 
none although an explosion could endanger workers 
while gas wells usually produce liquid as well as gas it 
evaporates he said 
asked if opponents of georges bank drilling were wrong to stress 
the dangers of oil spills bettenberg said we think so 
georges bank is one of the worlds most productive fishing 
areas and fishing interests strongly backed by environmental 
groups and massachusetts gov michael dukakis the democratic 
presidential nominee for years have vigorously opposed drilling 
congress has responded with a series of yearlong bans on 
leasing frequently coupled with prohibitions covering parts of the 
waters off florida and california as in this years bill 
in an effort to head off another ban hodel earlier had 
announced a delay in north atlantic lease offering of about six 
months from february 1989 
bettenberg said texas aampm was under contract to oil companies 
for its core sampling and any findings while made available to the 
department were proprietary and could not be made public 
previous congressional action has not mentioned core sampling 
and seismic exploration bettenberg said and the new bill would 
specifically permit seismic work while banning core drilling in the 
moratorium areas

efforts to protect airline passengers from 
rapidly spreading postcrash fires such as the one that swept 
through the delta air lines jet in texas remain stalled after more 
than a decade of frustrating research 
four years ago the federal aviation administration was on the 
verge of requiring airliners to use a special fuel additive which 
its supporters said would stop aircraft fuel vapors from igniting 
in a crash 
although the antimisting additive suppressed the spread of 
flames in repeated static tests a highly publicized test using a 
remotecontrolled boeing 720 in the california desert failed 
miserably in november 1984 as the deliberately crashed jet was 
engulfed in a ball of flames 
the failed test came only weeks before a regulation requiring 
the additive was to have been announced although the airlines had 
argued the additives value was questionable and there were 
indications it could interfere with engine performance 
eleven months later after the government and chemical industry 
and spent millions of dollars on the research the faa abandoned 
the fuel additive idea because the agency said the concept is not 
practical for daytoday airline operation in the foreseeable 
future 
according to government figures about 40 percent of the 
fatalities in potentially survivable airline crashes are caused by 
flames or the inhalation of toxic smoke 
most of the 13 people killed in the crash wednesday of delta 
flight 1141 as it was taking off from the dallasfort worth airport 
were believed to have died from the flames and smoke according to 
investigators it is believed that many more might have perished if 
the plane had not ripped apart in three places allowing passengers 
to more rapidly escape 
concern about the danger of fire after crashes has been raised 
by aviation safety experts for years research into ways to reduce 
the threat gained momentum in 1977 after the fiery collision of two 
boeing 747 jumbo jets on a fogbound runway at tenerife in the 
canary islands killed 553 people 
for six years after the tenerife crash the faas focus was on 
developing a polymer called avgard which was supposed to prevent 
the misting of jet fuel and thereby prevent the fireball that often 
engulfs a jet when fuel lines are severed in a crash 
the faa estimated at one point that as many as 135 lives a year 
could be saved if the polymer were used as a fuel additive by all 
commercial airlines a british company imperial chemical 
industries invested more than 15 million in develping avgard 
prior to the illfated test in the california desert in 1984 
when fuel lines are severed or fuel tanks rupture in a crash 
jet fuel often turns into a mist of small droplets that can readily 
explode into a fireball when exposed to heat or flames the polymer 
was hoped to prevent the misting 
there hasnt been any research done by the faa on the 
antimist polymer since the crash test in 1984 said agency 
spokeswoman joann sloane 
in recent years the faa has explored other methods aimed at 
reducing the danger of fuel fires after crashes and has taken 
actions to reduce the fire danger inside airline cabins 
airlines have been required to install fireblocking seat covers 
that allow passengers as much as 40 additional seconds to escape 
before being exposed to toxic fumes and smoke airlines also have 
had to install lowlevel emerency lights to help guide passengers 
from smokefilled cabins 
last year congress directed the faa to conduct a special 
oneyear study on ways to prevent fiery fuelfed explosions after 
a plane crashes a draft report on the agencys findings is 
expected later this month 
according to faa officials the report is not expected to revive 
research into the antimisting fuel additive program but focus on 
varous ways of making aircraft fuel systems more crash resistant

rescue crews reached the wreckage of a 
commuter plane that crashed in a remote section of the western 
sierra madre and said all 20 people aboard died a military 
official said today 
bad weather had hampered the search for the twinengine plane 
a helicopter owned by the federal electricity commission spotted 
the wreckage at 9 pm wednesday about 210 miles southwest of 
mexico city 
helicopters were unable to fly in the area again until late this 
morning and army and civilian rescuers hiked to the rugged 
mountainside site 
they found the plane they have located the bodies and the 
parts of both are dispersed in an area with a radius of about 50 
meters yards gen carmelo teran chief of staff of the 21st 
military zone said 
they have found no survivors he said he spoke by telephone 
from morelia capital of michoacan state where the crash occurred 
the flight left uruapan on wednesday morning for the 100mile 
flight to lazaro cardenas said adalberto mandes director of the 
uruapan airport he said most of the 17 passengers and three crew 
members were from uruapan 
the plane was a brazilianmade badeirante belonging to the small 
mexican airline aerofederal a federal aviation inspector contacted 
at the airline in mexico city said 
rescuers left arteaga 40 miles north of lazaro cardenas at 7 
am on what was estimated to be a sixhour trip most of it on 
foot to the crash site on heavily forested el calero hill 
spokesmen in the mayors offices of arteaga and lazaro cardenas said 
its 15 kilometers nine miles to where they leave the 
vehicles then they climb the hill there are lots of rocks you 
cant walk well said jesus gutierrez an assistant to the 
arteaga mayor 
he said weather conditions improved enough this morning for 
helicopters to take off from arteaga 
francisco javier flores lazaro cardenas city secretary said 
the area had been lashed by hurricane kristy for the past two days 
and it had been raining for about four days 
yesterday wednesday morning there were strong winds in 
lazaro cardenas but i dont know if they were strong where the 
accident occurred he said 
the inspector in mexico city who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said land and helicopter crews from the government civil 
aeronatics department were among those heading for the site 
about 100 soldiers backed by helicopters were moving into the 
area 10 miles south of the town of arteaga teran said 
we only have information from people who live in the area 
some say they heard noise some saw the plane pass teran said 
ricardo alvarez a worker with the electricity commission in 
lazaro cardenas said wednesday that people in el tahuazal a 
nearby village had reported a loud explosion and mandes said 
federal highway police and army troops then began a search 
mandes said the lazaro cardenas airport had no radar or air 
communications facilities that could have helped controllers track 
the plane 
aerofederal is a governmentowned cargo transport airline that 
also services regional passenger routes

oil production from federal waters off 
california should double by 1992 an interior department official 
said thursday 
william bettenberg director of the departments minerals 
management service said production from platforms for which 
permits already had been granted should bring the total to 200000 
to 225000 barrels a day 
current california production is about 100000 barrels a day 
nearly twice the 53700 barrels a day in 1981 and almost quadruple 
the 27900 barrels a day in 1980 
federal waters currently hold 16 producing platforms and 22 
should be in operation in 1992 after additions and retirements 
officials said 
almost all production is from the santa barbara channel and the 
santa maria basin 
in a meeting with reporters bettenberg said the interior 
department expects new proposals in about four weeks from other 
parties in negotiations attempting to resolve a 9yearold lawsuit 
by the state of california challenging the adequacy of air 
pollution regulations for offshore rigs 
those negotiations now almost two years old involve industry 
environmental groups and others 
bettenberg said the federal government proposed a new set of 
regulations in june to its negotiating partners and warned that it 
would adopt them if there were no agreement 
he said the others put up a counterproposal one we thought 
there was a serious possibility the government could accept but 
last week groups that had not been terribly active in the 
negotiations indicated they had some problems with it and the 
government agreed to grant four weeks for another counterproposal 
in june i thought chances for an agreement were slim in 
july they looked really great they dont look quite so good 
now bettenberg said 
he declined to give specifics because all parties have agreed to 
keep their proposals secret until the talks are over

president maung maung on thursday refused 
to bow to massive protests demanding an interim government but he 
said his government would proceed with plans that could end 26 
years of oneparty rule 
tens of thousands of people staged prodemocracy demonstrations 
in the capital but a mass rally called by striking government 
employees fizzled a strike by airport workers grounded all 
international flights 
maung maung burmas first civilian president since 1962 said 
in a speech on staterun radio and television that he called an 
emergency meeting of the ruling party for sept 12 to consider a 
referendum on ending singleparty rule an emergency parliament 
session is scheduled for the next day in a process the government 
says could lead to a multiparty general election 
there is no constitutional provision to form the interim 
government said maung maung speaking slowly and calmly without 
visible emotion 
the government will proceed with the constitutional process of 
holding the referendum after obtaining the approval of the 
burma socialist program party and the emergency parliament 
we cannot violate these fundamental provisions he said 
we cannot hand over to the future generation an inheritance of 
the example of easily breaking discipline he said 
in a conciliatory gesture to protest leaders maung maung said 
the government will permit student unions and will rebuild the 
rangoon university student union building the military blew up the 
building in july 1962 while suppressing student dissent after gen 
ne win led the coup that ended democracy in burma 
students met on the campus sunday to form a union one of 
several illegal associations recently announced in defiance of the 
constitution 
maung maung urged government employees who have been staging 
crippling prodemocracy strikes to return to work he asked the 
army buddhist monks and other religious leader to help the 
government ease the crisis 
union burma airways suspended domestic and international service 
on aug 26 but until thursday flights by other carriers continued 
from bangladesh nepal and thailand union burma airways also 
managed a flight to bangkok thailand and back on wednesday

stateowned corporations who formed a general strike committee this

gardens rangoons largest park 
tens of thousands of people rallied in the streets thursday and 
several thousand striking government employees and students 
gathered outside the park the gates to the park were shut but not 
locked and the obviously poorly organized crowd made no attempt to 
enter 
an hour later all but a few hundred demonstrators had 
peacefully dispersed small rallies outside the nearby us embassy 
and near a government building also broke up 
the government said wednesday it would take action against 
demonstrators who illegally occupied government buildings and 
facilities protesters in several towns have taken over and 
sometimes destroyed government and party offices

the foreign trade bank and tried to transfer 3 million to a bank 
in london a senior bank official said

the bank and senior bank officials eventually rejected it the 
official said he declined to identify the people who sought the 
transfer or the bank in london 
ne win resigned july 23 taking indirect responsibility for 
bloody studentled riots in march and june he called for a

israel and jordan have been the big 
losers in the nearly ninemonth palestinian uprising in the 
occupied territories an israeli research group says 
the annual middle east balance of forces report published this 
week by tel aviv universitys jaffee center for strategic studies 
concluded israels use of force alone has been unable to restore 
order in the west bank and gaza strip 
retired brig gen aryeh shalev a former head of israels 
military government in the west bank wrote that the israeli army 
had been weakened by the confrontation 
israel lost much of its deterrent image with respect to the 
arab residents he said the use of riot batons instilled fear 
into the local residents but did not restore the armys 
deterrence 
additional measures did not suppress the violence because of 
the readiness of many palestinian youths and young adults to 
persist in the confrontation and pay the price shalev said 
speaking on israel radio shalev said jordans influence 
disappeared as the uprising grew but he said so far the palestine 
liberation organization had failed to transform its success in the 
streets into a peace process 
the plo can lose a potential political achievement the plo is 
now facing the problem of changing its strategy in order to become 
an acceptable partner to the israelis and maybe before that to the 
united states he said 
in july king hussein announced that jordan was severing ties 
with the west bank which israel seized along with the gaza strip 
in 1967 
the jaffee center study also says that the risk of war with 
syria had lessened because the damascus regime faced severe 
economic difficulties lacked allies and experienced increased 
friction with the soviet union its main arms supplier 
the analysis contrasts with frequent warnings from israeli 
officials and military commanders who stress the threat of 
conflict with syria 
the 498page report says syrias total armed forces has declined 
from 840000 in 1986 to 730000 last year this was mainly because 
president hafez assad trimmed his defense budget by about 100 
million or 3 percent 
due to extreme economic difficulties syria was forced to 
mothball a couple of divisions and remains without allies it also 
increasingly appears to be encountering differences of opinions 
with the soviets joseph alpher executive editor of the study 
said in an interview 
retired brig gen aharon levran a former intelligence officer 
wrote in the report that the belttightening genuinely weakened 
syrias armed forces by reducing training time and cutting back on 
fuel and food for the troops 
alpher predicted the end of the iraniraq war will likely 
increase the traditional rivalry between baghdad and damascus that 
and the unresolved conflict in lebanon could preoccupy syria 
he said syria has warehoused hundreds of tanks and turned 
regular army units into reserve forces 
if a state plans to go to war in the next six months or a 
year it usually doesnt do things like that said levran who 
also commanded armor and infantry units before retiring in 1984 
the jaffee center experts said that in any future war israel 
would be more vulnerable to attacks aimed at population centers or 
locations where reserve units are mobilized 
they said syria iraq and saudi arabia had developed 
intermediate range ballistic missiles chemical warheads and longer 
range air power 
i see a very reasonable possibility that they will be used on 
military targets in a possible future war and maybe even the home 
front said shalev

a foreign ministry official said 
thursday the government doesnt want a group of americans to 
distribute a 24 million reward for the return of missing us 
servicemen because it might offend thailands communist neighbors 
the group said it was sponsoring seven vietnam war veterans and 
relatives of servicemen missing in indochina who plan to travel to 
thailand in october and float on the mekong river vietnamese 
currency notes stamped with the reward offer 
the government of thailand is attempting to roadblock the 
effort the national steering committee for american war veterans 
said in a telex this week to the associated press bureau in bangkok 
the money was pledged by former north carolina rep bill hendon 
former vietnam war prisoner eugene mcdaniel and 21 republican 
congressmen 
the ministry official said the plan might be seen as a hostile 
act by vietnam laos and cambodia and harm thailands efforts to 
improve relations with those neighbors 
the group said ted sampley committee chairman and vietnam war 
veteran met aug 26 with officials of the thai embassy in 
washington and was told we have received word from bangkok that 
you are not to do this if you violate our laws you know what we 
must do 
the embassy officials refused to say what laws would be 
violated the telex said we have no intention of violating any 
thai law but if they are trying to shortcircuit our plans because 
of some political policy they are going to have a problem the 
telex quoted sampley as saying 
the foreign ministry official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said he had not received any formal notice of the 
groups plans 
vietnams official communist party newspaper on aug 3 denounced 
the reward offer and the thai official noted that laos strongly 
objected when relatives of servicemen missing in action or mias 
floated similar offers on the mekong last year both countries have 
angrily denied holding american prisoners 
the new government of prime minister chatichai choohavan has put 
priority on improving relations with indochina relations have been 
sour since the communist victories in all three countries in 1975 
and especially since 1979 when vietnam invaded and occupied 
cambodia

the british broadcasting corp said thursday it is 
adopting a new title by which it is already known to millions of 
its overseas listeners the bbc world service 
out goes bbc external services a name that managing director 
john tusa says has increasingly sat in a clumsy and uncomfortable 
way on our shoulders 
it is the fourth time the bbc has changed the name of its 
broadcasts that reach an estimated 120 million people around the 
world 
as far as everyone else is concerned we have always been the 
bbc world service tusa said so we have decided to adopt that 
title it is familiar intelligible universal and clearly reflects 
our global role 
the term world service long has applied to the bbcs 24hour 
broadcasts in english but not to the 36 foreign language services 
it transmits 
the bbc first began international broadcasts in 1932 under the 
banner bbc empire service that was changed to bbc overseas 
services in 1938 when foreign language transmissions were added by 
1952 bbc external services was the invogue phrase meant to 
embrace all overseas output english included 
we have now recognized we were wrong about external services 
and everyone else was right tusa said

moslem guerrillas launched rockets at 
kabul and its airport thursday and afghan fighters struck deep into 
pakistani territory in one of the most violent days of 
afghanistans 10yearold civil war 
western diplomats quoting dispatches from missions in the 
afghan capital said the airport was shrouded in thick black and 
gray smoke from the rocket attack 
earlier in the day pakistani authorities said seven afghan 
fighterbombers struck the deepest to date into pakistani 
territory killing one person and injuring seven 
diplomatic dispatches from kabul said the rockets started 
hitting the city around 255 pm at kabul airport and 
significant parts of the city 
by 320 the fire was out of control said a dispatch from 
one western embassy there were secondary explosions and 
foreigners were ordered to evacuate the airport it said 
rockets have been exploding in kabul all afternoon said a 
us diplomat on condition of anonymity the force of the 
explosion indicates it may have been an ammunition dump he said 
in a report from kabul the official soviet news agency tass 
said opposition units today subjected to massive bombardment with 
groundtoground rockets the kabul international airport area the 
rockets damaged depots and transport aircraft 
the report added that several rockets exploded in residential 
districts of kabul and authorities had put out the resulting fires 
reports said it was not clear how many rockets had fallen there 
were no immediate reports of casualties and staterun kabul radio 
in its nighttime broadcast made no mention of the attack 
both the kabul attack and the bombing of villages near the 
pakistani frontier city of peshawar appeared more daring and 
destructive than any operations this year afghan insurgents began 
fighting communist afghan forces in 1978 
pakistani sources reported thursday that seven sovietbuilt 
afghan fighterbombers hit villages 30 miles east of the afghan 
border 
kabul radio said four people including children were killed 
and nine others were wounded pakistans foreign ministry said one 
person was killed and seven injured and five houses were destroyed 
in washington state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley 
condemned the bombing as the latest and most extreme incident of 
armed intervention against pakistans territorial integrity and 
said it violated the 4monthold geneva accords 
the united states condemns this act of aggression against 
pakistan ms oakley said adding that us figures had one 
person killed and 18 wounded 
ms oakley said it was not clear whether the planes were flown 
by soviets or afghans she said the united states would raise the 
issue with the united nations and with soviet authorities 
foreign ministry spokesman nasir jamal said the attack may have 
been the worst violation of pakistans territory since 
afghanistans civil war broke out 10 years ago 
government officials originally said five planes conducted the 
raid but later claimed there were seven 
nasir said the planes flew 43 miles into the warsak district of 
northwest pakistan killing one person injuring seven and 
destroying five houses 
according to my knowledge it was the deepest violation of our 
territory so far in the war nasir said 
crossborder shellings and bombings are frequent in the tribal 
areas of pakistans frontier where the usbacked guerrillas 
stage their attacks 
the raid was the first on what pakistanis call a settled 
area dotted with villages and under full provincial control 
omar amir a pakistani journalist who visited the site said 
villagers believed the intruding aircraft were sovietbuilt mig 
bombers 
omar said 12 people were injured all pakistanis 
moscow and kabul repeatedly have accused pakistan of violating 
an accord providing for the withdrawal from afghanistan of soviet 
troops who entered in 1979 to back the government troops 
afghan president najib on wednesday proposed a meeting between 
the foreign ministers of pakistan the united states the soviet 
union and afghanistan to discuss implementation of the accord 
signed april 14 in geneva 
tass quoted najib as saying thursday that since may when the 
soviets began withdrawing their troops the armed opposition has 
been imposing war on us and we regrettably are being drawn into 
it even more actively 
if war is being imposed on us we in turn should impose the 
policy of reconciliation he told a meeting of leaders of 
afghanistans political parties above all it is necessary to 
press for the ceasefire not only in the country as a whole but 
also in individual villages districts and provinces

authorities have begun making arrests and 
seizing equipment in a crackdown on video pirates who peddle 
satellite devices used for free viewing of pay tv programs the 
federal communications commission said thursday 
fcc official richard smith estimated that nearly half of the one 
million satellite dishes used to receive pay tv programs have 
illegal devices that unscramble the picture and let the viewer 
watch for free 
smith chief of the field operations bureau said the fcc and 
the justice department have decided to target manufacturers and 
distributors of the equipment rather than individual users 
but he cautioned home viewers with the devices that they are 
acting illegally and subject to criminal and civil penalties if 
caught 
the illegal devices are clones of authorized computer chips 
which unscramble the television picture beamed to satellite dish 
antennas 
if unchecked said fcc chairman dennis r patrick the 
growth of the illegal chips threaten the viability of the 
satellitetohome program market 
patrick has said the devices not only steal from those who 
created the programming but from viewers who pay for the service 
and may lose it if the problem is not brought under control 
criminal penalties for those convicted of distributing or 
selling the equipment face up to 500000 in fines and five years 
in prison individuals convicted of using the devices could be 
sentenced to a maximum 100000 fine and up to a years 
imprisonment 
smith said that john r ross jr of cartersville ga was 
arrested last week on charges of marketing unauthorized satellite 
descrambling equipment 
in ocala fla a firm vc bytes was charged with selling the 
devices he said 
descrambling equipment was seized from satellite television 
center in palestine texas and from united satellite of america 
in las vegas nev although no charges have been filed in either 
case

the debate over presidential debates remained 
unresolved thursday as campaign managers for democrat michael 
dukakis and republican george bush failed to agree on how many 
facetoface encounters the candidates should have 
neither side has budged from positions taken earlier this week 
when bush campaign manager james a baker iii offered two televised 
presidential debates and dukakis manager paul brountas held out for 
three 
however the bush campaign appeared to nudge the schedule back 
by a few days and pushed for an open format as opposed to sticking 
to specific topics 
unlike the earlier meeting which was conducted in person in 
washington thursdays negotiating session was on the telephone 
the two sides did agree to talk to each other again on the phone on 
tuesday 
in statements issued after the phone call both sides said time 
was running short with the election just two months away and 
television schedules already crowded with the major league baseball 
playoffs and the olympics 
the american people should have an opportunity to view the 
presidential candidates discussing the important issues concerning 
americas future in full brountas said they should not have 
to choose between watching the nominees debate world events and 
watching the world series 
baker said vice president bush is willing to debate dukakis any 
time between sept 25 and oct 17 on tuesday baker said that the 
first debate could be held as early as sept 22 
our campaign hopes to resolve a debate schedule soon baker 
said in his statement thursday our schedule cannot be kept open 
for this full 23 days forever and we hope the democratic campaign 
will see fit to come to an agreement on a debate schedule as soon 
as possible 
the dukakis campaign wanted the first debate to be on foreign 
policy and national security issues but that was rejected by the 
bush campaign on tuesday after the thursday session baker said 
the debates should be on the broad range of issues being 
discussed in the campaign rather than being subject specific 
the two campaigns have agreed that the vice presidential running 
mates republican dan quayle and democrat lloyd bentsen would meet 
for one televised debate

a bus swerved to avoid bricks 
tumbling off an oncoming truck and plunged into a reservoir 
killing 31 people officials said thursday 
the bus which crashed wednesday night about 150 miles west of 
belgrade was hoisted from the water thursday with three bodies 
still inside 
the state news agency tanjug quoted officials at the scene as 
saying they believed they accounted for all the passengers but 
divers continued to search the muddy bottom of the reservoir 
tanjug said 14 people survived the 50yard plunge off a cliff 
into the water and were hospitalized 
most of the passengers were workers from the branko krsmanovic 
knitwear factory in paracin about 75 miles southeast of belgrade 
and their families on their way home from a vacation at the 
adriatic resort of gradac 
tanjug said at least eight children were among the dead 
yugoslav television said the driver of the truck left the scene 
of the accident and that police detained him about 1 am in a 
nearby town he was identified as mirsad muminivic 
the bus plunged into the reservoir that supplies the gabrovica 
hydroelectric power plant about 9 pm wednesday 
i was asleep when i felt a terrible crash and fell between the 
seats said zoran dencic one of the survivors i saw light and 
managed to swim to the surface 
another passenger svetlana mosovski said she also was sleeping 
when the bus crashed into the water 
i do not remember how i swam to the surface she said she 
said she sat on one of the bus tires but then the bus began to 
sink i do not recall who brought me to shore 
the water was 60 feet deep where the bus fell and divers said 
it was cold and the visibility poor complicating rescue 
operations the level of the reservoir was reduced by 15 feet to 
aid rescue operations tanjug said 
the road was closed briefly while cranes lifted the bus from the 
water yugoslav media said 
the paracin factory said it would grant the families of dead 
workers 66 belgrade radio reported

the navys top admiral has upheld disciplinary 
action against a senior officer found guilty of improprieties 
involving travel forcing him to retire at lower rank the service 
said thursday 
adm carlisle ah trost the chief of naval operations 
reviewed the case of vice adm kendall e moranville and approved 
the results of the flag mast disciplinary hearing the navy 
said in a statement released in response to a reporters query 
under these circumstances it would be inappropriate to 
nominate vice adm moranville for retirement in his present grade 
and therefore retirement was approved at the permanent grade of 
rear admiral effective oct 1 1988 
the navy said trost had conducted his review on wednesday 
studying an appeal filed by moranville after he was disciplined 
with a punitive letter of reprimand last month 
in rejecting the appeal trost decided that moranville would 
have to retire with the permanent twostar rank of rear admiral 
rather than the threestar rank he has held since june 1 1985 the 
navy said 
while there is almost no difference in pension between the two 
ranks for an officer with moranvilles tenure trosts action 
amounts to a permanent blemish for an officer of such high rank 
the navy which previously had declined comment on details of 
the case disclosed thursday that moranville had been disciplined 
for improprieties involving travel claims and the use of 
government aircraft 
pentagon sources who demanded anonymity said the charges 
involved arrangements made by moranville on behalf of a woman 
employed by the united service organizations while he was commander 
of the navys 6th fleet in naples italy 
moranville 56 stepped down from that post on aug 20 in a 
routine rotation and had been expected to assume a new post at the 
pentagon until word of the disciplinary action surfaced 
late last week the navy acknowledged moranville was taken to 
admirals mast on aug 19 1988 before adm james b busey 
the commander of us naval forces europe and disciplined with a 
letter of reprimand 
after receiving the letter moranville appealed the decision to 
trost but also filed a request for retirement the navy said 
an admirals mast is a closeddoor nonjudicial proceeding 
during which an admiral reviews the evidence on his own and decides 
if any discipline is warranted 
moranville a veteran combat pilot who fought in vietnam had 
been widely rumored as the next deputy chief of naval operations 
for naval warfare

speculation centered on engine trouble 
indicated in cockpit conversations as investigators and 
manufacturers representatives today tried to determine the cause 
of a delta air lines jetliner crash that killed 13 people 
nearly 100 people many leaping through thick smoke and blazing 
jet fuel survived the crash of the boeing 727 that broke open and 
burned during takeoff wednesday morning at dallasfort worth 
international airport 
the recording of cockpit conversations reviewed in washington 
indicated an engine problem lee dickinson a spokesman for the 
national transportation safety board said today 
shortly after takeoff there was a sound he said it was 
apparently a warning a stall condition may be approaching 
dickinson said shortly after that there was some conversation 
about an engine problem 
the information was obtained after safety board officials 
listened to the cockpit tape recording once and they will listen to 
it again he said 
the same flight today taxied out for takeoff but then turned 
back to the terminal delta officials said from atlanta 
on wednesday survivors many suffering burns crawled or jumped 
through gaping holes in the fuselage and clambered over redhot 
wings to safety as black smoke billowed three stories high 
witnesses said 
you heard the thing crumple so you knew you were going to 
crash the whole time said passenger penn waugh a lawyer from 
dallas you were just looking for a way to get out of the plane 
youre hoping you werent going to die 
ninetyseven passengers and a crew of seven were listed aboard 
the aircraft flight 1141 en route to salt lake city but the exact 
count was uncertain because babies were not included on passenger 
lists the flight originated in jackson miss 
nearly two dozen investigators from the ntsb converged on the 
crash site spokesmen for boeing and for pratt amp whitney 
manufacturer of the planes three engines said they would also 
send investigators 
witnesses said there appeared to have been a fire or explosion 
in an engine on takeoff federal aviation administration spokesman 
jack barker said today but that was not confirmed this was 
merely what some witnesses were reporting 
a delta official said there had been an apparent engine problem 
and a passenger on another plane said he saw flames from the right 
engine 
ntsb investigator warren wandel said the aircraft flight data 
recorder and cockpit voice recorder the socalled black boxes 
were found in good shape they were sent to washington for 
examination 
delta released names of 95 survivors while hospitals who 
treated victims counted at least 96 people many suffering from 
burns smoke inhalation and broken bones some walked away 
unscathed and flew to their destinations 
thirteen fatalities were confirmed including an infant and two 
flight attendants said bill berry delta spokesman in atlanta all 
were from texas the airline said 
sixtyone people were treated and released from seven hospitals 
officials said 
survivors said the 15yearold jet appeared to lose power after 
leaving the ground in hazy sunshine bouncing three times before it 
slid along the ground and broke into pieces about 1000 feet beyond 
the end of the runway spurting flames 
the plane its hull burned and tailsection broken came to rest 
in a grassy field dotted by sunflowers one of the three engines 
lay several hundred yards away 
apparently the pilot made an attempt to abort there 
apparently was an engine problem said fred h rollins deltas 
district manager for marketing in salt lake city 
rick arnett an austin attorney who was on a plane that had just 
landed said he saw flames from an engine 
as the plane came up to take off it was barely getting off 
the ground and the right wing was dipping as it passed beyond us 
there were flames coming out of the right engine and the wing 
touched the ground the plane started spinning and there was an 
explosion he said 
however delta officials in dallas would not confirm speculation 
about the engine and dickinson said we will not rule out 
anything all doors are open 
federal aviation administration records show the cockpit crew 
had clean flying records and the plane reported only minor 
problems during the past five years including replacement of a 
wing flap controller 
delta spokesman henry conley said none of the airlines other 
727s would be pulled from service because of the crash we dont 
see anything serious enough to pull any planes he said 
among the survivors were the three pilots officials said 
including capt larry davis 48 of greenville a delta pilot since 
1965 and a boeing 727 captain for the last nine years 
parkland hospital officials said davis who was pinned in the 
wreckage was talking but in shock his injuries were described as 
traumatic 
mary cintron a toll booth cashier at the airport who saw the 
accident said she was astonished at how many people survived 
particularly since she witnessed the worst aviation disaster in 
texas history the aug 2 1985 crash of another delta flight that 
attempted to land at the airport during a thunderstorm killing 137 
people 
today looked 200 times worse she said i didnt think 
anybody had made it 
most of the fatalities occurred in the back of the plane 
authorities said 
cpl jim hartman of the dallasfort worth department of public 
safety said it was incredible that so many survived 
one passenger mona thomason said she and others jumped on 
the wing but it looked like we were jumping into a pit of fire 
she reported seeing a woman with two children she got one of 
them out but im afraid the other one was caught in the fire 
people were jumping on the planes wing and burning themselves 
on it because it was so red hot said passenger jim hammock we 
got out of the way fast because we thought it was going to 
explode 
andy dyer 38 a firefighter on his way to montana to help 
battle forest fires said the other passengers were orderly as they 
left the plane 
it was kind of surprising there wasnt any screaming 
hardly at all it was real quiet i think everybody was aware of 
what was going on said dyer who was treated for seconddegree 
burns on his arms and hands 
the jetliner was dark after the crash said david carmichael 
38 who headed toward a source of light a hole in the torn 
fuselage 
i waited in line to crawl out through that hole it was the 
nearest light that i could see coming into the plane other than the 
fire down the right side you could feel the heat and the smoke was 
terrible carmichael said 
seattlebased boeing co said the aircraft was purchased new by 
delta in 1973 and officials said new engines pratt amp whitney 
jt8ds were installed five years ago spokesman david jimenez said 
the jet had accumulated 38629 takeoffs and landings a number he 
described as average 
the 727 has been a workhorse for many of the worlds airlines 
for nearly 25 years the aircraft which was discontinued in 1984 
remains the most widely used jet in the united states making up 
nearly onethird of the us fleet of 3476 passenger and cargo 
aircraft

the justice department on thursday charged the 
city of philadelphia with violating the clean water act by dumping 
excessive amounts of pollutants and sludge into the delaware river 
the departments lawsuit filed in us district court in 
philadelphia represents the fourth civil action brought against 
the city in the past 10 years for alleged violations at its three 
sewage treatment plants assistant attorney general roger j 
marzulla noted the city has received 575 million in federal grants 
over the years to upgrade the system 
the latest suit charges numerous violations at the citys 
southwest sewage treatment plant some of which it says began in 
1984 and have continued since the purported unlawful discharges 
include several oxygendepleting pollutants suspended solids 
fecal coliform and the heavy metals copper and cadmium 
in addition the department charged that the citys water 
treatment plants illegally discharged sludge that interfered with 
the operations of the sewage plant or passed through it 
in four counts the complaint asked the court to impose a civil 
penalty of up to 10000 for each day of each violation occurring 
before feb 4 1987 and a penalty of up to 25000 daily for each 
violation since although it did not specify the number of alleged 
violations leaving that for future proceedings the total 
potential fine conceivably could range in the millions of dollars 
the city also was charged with failure to provide the 
environmental protection agency with pollutant sampling 
information and sought a penalty of 25000 for each day of each 
violation on or after feb 4 1987 
marzulla noted the action was the latest in a series of 
complaints brought under epa policies requiring municipalities to 
comply with the clean water act earlier lawsuits were filed 
against san diego calif boston los angeles st louis denver 
and minneapolis 
the justice department and epa are determined that all 
municipalities in the nation meet the acts requirements 
marzulla said we will continue to bring enforcement actions 
until there is full compliance the epa recently estimated that 
87 percent of the publicly owned water and sewage plants around the 
nation are in compliance 
the departments earlier complaints against philadelphia 
included a 1978 suit that charged construction reporting and 
pollution violations at the three sewage plants it was resolved by 
a consent decree requiring rehabilitation work at the plants 
in 1982 the government alleged that the city failed to meet 
construction deadlines and pollution limitations at the southwest 
plant again the city agreed to resolve the problems and paid a 
40000 penalty into a trust fund to finance other environmental 
projects 
in 1986 the city was sued again this time over construction 
and pollution problems at its northeast plant the city accepted 
revised construction schedules agreed to carry out 23 million 
worth of other environmental projects and paid an additional 
240000 into the trust fund for future projects

authorities halted construction at a nuclear power 
station in lithuania after learning it might not be safe during an 
earthquake it was reported thursday 
the government has spent 412 million has already been expended 
on the third reactor at the ignalinskoy nuclear power plant alone 
the government newspaper izvestia reported reactors no 1 and no 
2 have already been built 
although the soviet scientific establishment repeatedly has 
assured the nation that nuclear power is safe and also necessary 
for the countrys economic development the 1986 accident at the 
chernobyl power plant in the ukraine has made many soviets warier 
of the atom 
the council of ministers of the soviet republic of lithuania met 
recently to consider ecological and safety questions raised by the 
construction of the ignalinskoy power station izvestia said 
without giving the date of the session 
the power plant was built to withstand seismic shocks that 
measure 6 on the scale used in the soviet union although an 
earthquake rated at 7 on the same scale shook that area of the 
baltic republic at the turn of the century izvestia said 
the first deputy secretary of the lithuanian state environmental 
committee y sabalyauskas told the council of ministers a whole 
range of safety violations was committed during construction of the 
plants first reactor and that the safety breaches were repeated 
during the building of the third unit 
as a result of the meeting lithuanian authorities and the 
moscowbased ministries of atomic energy and mediummachine 
building decided to freeze work on the third reactor pending full 
answers to all questions of safety

twenty years after it was founded the 
american indian movement continues to struggle for american indian 
rights but its methods are quiet compared to the violence and 
confrontation that marked its early days 
the american indian movement broke a hole through the wall and 
everyone else came through said rosemary ackley christensen 
director of indian education for minneapolis public schools 
people may not have always liked the form these strategies 
took but i appreciate what these men have done 
other indian leaders are critical of aims legacy 
the violence of their tactics created a backlash against 
people on the reservations said tim giago editor of the lakota 
times a weekly indian newspaper in martin sd 
aim got a lot of national attention but not all of it was 
good attention it upset people in congress who voted against 
bills that would have helped american indians were still 
recovering from that giago said 
the group began a 20thanniversary celebration thursday at fort 
snelling state park featuring dancers and drum groups from around 
the country and speeches by aim leaders 
we have much to celebrate said spokesman vernon bellecourt 
whose brother clyde was an aim founder and is now its executive 
director but we have to look at the fact that our lands and 
resources are still being exploited 
one of the organizations first acts was organizing a patrol to 
monitor allegations of police harassment and brutality against 
indians in minneapolis 
but the concerns that brought about 150 indians to a july 28 
1968 meeting such as housing education and jobs went beyond 
the borders of minnesota and often were overshadowed by aim 
tactics 
aim gained notoriety with the 1972 seizure of the bureau of 
indian affairs building in washington dc and a 1973 riot at the 
custer sd courthouse 
the 71day reservation occupation at wounded knee sd left 
two indians dead and a federal marshall permanently paralyzed 
felony charges against aim activists russell means and dennis 
banks who led the uprising were dismissed after an eightweek 
trial 
a 1975 shootout at pine ridge reservation at wounded knee left 
two fbi agents dead and got aim activist leonard peltier two life 
prison terms 
christensen who has no formal ties to aim said the violence 
during the early years divided the indian community but she would 
not judge aim leaders 
god knows the fbi and white people had a hell of a lot more 
weapons and other things than indians had christensen said i 
respect and admire people who are not going to give up against all 
odds 
aim activists in the early 1970s also opened schools and 
organized legal rights and job training projects 
don allery historian for the red lake tribe said he was 
involved with aim during its formative years but became 
disenchanted when it didnt follow through on complaints about such 
things as job discrimination 
the route they took i guess it served a purpose allery 
said but he said he thinks aim failed on anything that required 
a consistent ongoing followup 
vernon bellecourt said the movement in 1988 has taken on a new 
character 
protecting treaty rights and sacred indian burial grounds are 
among todays goals he said as well as protecting the interests 
of indian nations throughout the world 
means who has resigned feels aim is no longer necessary 
aim people are now integrated into every productive and 
responsible segment of indian and nonindian society said means 
who lost his campaign to become libertarian party candidate for 
president this year the american indian movement has 
accomplished the impossible aim has worked itself out of a job 
giago said the need for political advocacy continues but he 
said aims negative image in many peoples minds may hamper its 
efforts 
we need a militant group somebodys got to keep stirring the 
pot because our numbers are so small he said

a top soviet arms control official said thursday 
the superpowers could agree on a treaty limiting intercontinental 
nuclear forces before the end of the year if we still use all 
the possibilities 
viktor karpov the soviet foreign ministrys top arms control 
official said such a treaty was possible within two or three 
months 
however if you mark time then there will be no such 
chance he told a news conference speaking through an 
interpreter 
karpov was responding to questions about us demands that the 
soviet union dismantle its partially completed radar installation 
at krasnoyarsk in siberia before agreement on a treaty on 
intercontinential nuclear weapons is possible 
the united states put forth that position in a statement 
wednesday at the close of a oneweek conference reviewing the 1972 
antiballistic missile treaty karpov headed the soviet delegation 
us and soviet negotiators have conducted separate talks in 
geneva on longrange or strategic missiles since march 1985 they 
have agreed in principle to reduce such arsenals by 50 percent but 
a number of details have yet to be resolved 
in december the superpowers signed a treaty to destroy 
mediumand shorterrange nuclear missiles 
the soviets have constantly linked an agreement on longrange 
missiles to restrictions on the reagan administrations spacebased 
missile defense system known officially as the strategic defense 
initiative and popularly called star wars the united states 
has rejected such a linkage 
karpov said that the soviet union had repeated to the united 
states an offer to dismantle the equipment of the krasnoyarsk 
radar if the united states would agree to commit itself to the abm 
treaty for nine or 10 years 
the soviets originally made that offer in july speaking of a 
period of 10 years the united states said at the time it welcomed 
the offer to dismantle the radar but that it would not accept the 
conditions imposed on the offer 
the united states maintains that the krasnoyarsk radar violates 
the abm treaty because it could be used to help direct the soviet 
response to a nuclear missile attack the soviets say the radar is 
designed to track space objects and therefore doesnt violate the 
treaty 
the abm treaty limits the antimissile defense systems that each 
side can build 
karpov said that the soviets were willing to dismantle two other 
radars deployed last year in gomel near kiev which the united 
states also has complained about 
we would be prepared to destroy the elements karpov said 
the us statement wednesday said that the soviet union during 
the review conference did not satisfy us concerns about the 
krasnoyarsk radar and that the united states may take action to 
suspend or terminate the abm treaty 
karpov seemed to appeal for restraint saying that unilateral 
actions in such a serious matter as the abm treaty are 
inadmissable

food and drug administration lawyers have told 
their bosses they doubt the agency has legal authority to regulate 
a new type cigarette being tested by rj reynolds tobacco co an 
fda official said thursday 
the official who discussed the internal agency matter only on 
grounds he not be identified by name noted that regulation of 
cigarettes has long been reserved to congress 
rj reynolds is aware of that and is making no claim that its 
new smokeless cigarette is anything other than a cigarette he 
said it will be taxed as a cigarette and carry the same warning 
labels congress requires on conventional cigarettes 
moreover the official said the company is bending over 
backward not to make any health claim on behalf of its new 
cigarette 
if the manufacturer claimed some health benefit for the new 
product such as less risk of incurring ailments linked to smoking 
it might come under fda jurisdiction 
the fda source said agency lawyers have told fda commissioner 
frank young that they would marshall whatever legal arguments they 
could find if he decides to attempt regulate the cigarette but 
that they would see little prospect of winning a court battle 
because of the way rj reynolds is presenting the new product 
there has been little expectation even by antismoking forces that 
the fda would take the position it could regulate the new product 
however the agency was obligated to formally consider the 
matter because of a petition filed in april by the washingtonbased 
coalition on smoking or health which represents the american heart 
association american lung association american cancer society and 
the american medical association

italys famed la scala opera troupe opened its 
second tour of japan on thursday with a stirring rendition of 
verdis nabucco that earned 11 curtain calls 
musical director riccardo muti and an 80member orchestra 
brought 3500 opera fans to their feet at the end of the fourhour 
performance 
all of the music was just wonderful said tadae nashida one 
of the spectators 
its a very difficult opera to watch you need to study the 
text carefully first mrs nashida said but the melodies were 
so easy to become attached to 
the cast was led by baritone renato bruson in the title role of 
nabucco king of babylon and tenor bruno beccaria as ismael 
nephew of the king of jerusalem 
but charismatic bass paata burchuladze as the high priest 
zaccaria and powerful soprano ghena dimitrova as nabuccos jealous 
adopted daughter abigaille stole the show and grabbed the loudest 
applause of the 13minute ovation 
we expect a triumph said renato garavaglia chief of la 
scalas press office before the show 
1981 was very triumphant for us garavaglia said of la 
scalas previous visit to japan japanese people are better than 
we expected 
la scala director general carlo maria badini said he was 
delighted with the audiences reaction to nabucco 
it was a fantastic reaction intelligent passionate these 
people know well the italian music badini said backstage at 
tokyos nhk hall 
but nabucco is not one of verdis popular operas its not 
like la traviata he said its very important to show it to 
the japanese public were making it into a popular verdi 
opera 
the milanbased opera shipped to japan the stunning sets for 
which it is renowned with only slight alterations necessary 
the technicians know very well this theater where we played 
in 1981 garavaglia said there are some adjustments a little 
cut of scenes but its not a problem because our scenes are 
elastic 
the dazzling sets of huge snarling lions or tremendous sweeping 
wings drew gasps from thursdays audience who paid up to 40000 yen 
298 us dollars to attend opening night

businesses scrambled to find emergency generators 
and city crews hustled to lay new cable thursday a day after a 
fire caused a 40block blackout that officials feared could last 
until the weekend 
the fire of undetermined origin wrecked a double underground 
vault containing two transformers and switching equipment 
wednesday cutting electricity to much of the citys retail 
financial and hotel center 
power cant be restored before tomorrow evening or early 
saturday julia greenlee of seattle city light said thursday 
friday evening is our target and were pulling out all 
stops said marsha iverson another utility official 
the number of residents workers businesses and hotel guests 
affected by the outage was undetermined said hugh mcintosh city 
lights chief spokesman weve got about 40 blocks here with 
buildings ranging from one story to 41 stories thin fat 
short and tall it would take a week to count them all 
city light officials said it was utilitys worst outage ever 
eclipsing an 80block downtown blackout that was limited to five 
hours in 1966 
police doubled patrols overnight and no looting or injuries were 
reported 
uncounted hundreds of workers were sent home early wednesday 
many night spots were dark and some restaurants served free food 
rather than have it spoil numerous businesses remained closed 
thursday 
with street lights and traffic signals dark police directed 
traffic at most intersections during business hours and erected 
stop signs at other times 
tangles of twisted scorched cable littered virginia street 
where the vault was located a trailer bearing a spool of new cable 
was parked near a cluster of utility trucks 
buildings affected by the outage ranged from show world 
featuring peep shows and nude dancers to the palatial cinerama

others fared better david sivinski proprietor of a 
propanepowered popcorn wagon said his booming business wednesday 
night represented the revenge of lowtech

lights said kevin klein a front office assistant manager 
the fire knocked out two 35000 transformers six primary 
cables each carrying 13000 volts and feeding 15 transformers and 
about two dozen secondary cables each carrying 110 or 208 volts 
said gerd jerochim manager of underground operations and street 
lighting 
electricity cannot be restored piecemeal and at least five of 
the primary cables must be replaced for service to resume jerochim 
said he said that if just one cable were reactivated it would 
draw the electricity for all six and burn out an estimated 3000 
feet of cable must be replaced 
jerochim estimated the utilitys costs for labor equipment and 
materials at 250000 excluding police and firefighting expenses 
and private business losses

the state filed civil rights charges thursday 
against three state senate court officers accusing them of using 
excessive force and abusive language in removing gay rights 
demonstrators from the senate gallery in january 
the commonwealth seeks to insure that the defendants do not 
further assault or harass persons because of their sexual 
orientation race color or national origin said attorney 
general james shannons complaint filed in suffolk superior court 
the state also seeks to guarantee that the officers do not use 
excessive force illegally detain or illegally arrest persons who 
are participating in the expression of their political views the 
complaint said 
the complaint stems from a jan 4 demonstration over senate 
delays in passing a gay rights bill it was brought against court 
officers conrad bailey thomas sheehan and william marcelonis 
shannons complaint seeks a permanent injunction prohibiting the 
three from policing any demonstration until they receive 
appropriate training in police techniques 
this is a message that needs to be sent over and over again 
until everyone finally learns it that in massachusetts you cannot 
harass people nor can you beat people up because of their sexual 
orientation said kevin cathcart executive director of the gay 
and lesbian political caucus 
fourteen to 20 demonstrators participated in the protest inside 
the senate chamber questioning a senate committees refusal to 
release a gay rights bill supported by shannon to ban 
discrimination in employment housing credit and public 
accommodations based on a persons sexual orientation 
during the protest some demonstrators shouted down to the 
senators urging them to pass the bill others handcuffed 
themselves together 
court officers who have sole police jurisdiction in the senate 
removed 14 demonstrators and turned them over to capitol police 
the demonstrators were charged with trespassing in march six were 
found innocent and charges against the others were later dismissed 
shannons complaint alleges that bailey threw one demonstrator 
into a gallery chair when the man started to speak to the senate 
yanked another by his tie until it ripped grabbed another 
demonstrator by his hair dragged another over a chair and struck 
others with a rolledup newspaper 
marcelonis allegedly grabbed the shirt of another demonstrator 
and pushed his hand into the mans face sheehan was accused of 
repeatedly kicking one demonstrator while the man was carried from 
the gallery 
all three allegedly used antigay epithets the complaint said

contract talks between teamsters drivers and 
hollywood producers convened thursday one day after the union 
overwhelmingly rejected the producers last offer 
the teamsters who have been working for more than a month 
without a contract voted against the proposed contract by more 
than a 95 percent margin according to earl bush 
secretarytreasurer for the teamsters local 399 
the tally announced early thursday was 1409 to 67 against the 
offer bush said 
a walkout by the teamsters representing 2200 film and 
television drivers could hobble hollywood production which 
returned to work only recently following a fivemonth 
scriptwriters strike 
bush said the producers contract proposal would require about 
half the members of local 399 to take 261perhour pay cuts 
lowering their pay to 14 per hour 
well negotiate as long as theres meaningful negotiations 
going on bush said 
the negotiations were expected to last throughout the day and 
there was no immediate news of any progress 
the teamsters contract expired july 30 but the powerful union 
has continued to work by daytoday extensions 
meanwhile officials of plasterers local 755 and of the 
international brotherhood of electrical workers local 40 have 
announced that their members have also rejected managements offer 
by overwhelming votes 
the teamsters like the plasterers and electricians are also 
unhappy with a new overtime formula suggested by the producers 
under the new plan union members would be paid overtime for 
saturday and sunday work only if more than five days had been 
worked in a row teamsters normally collect overtime pay for any 
weekend work regardless of the circumstances 
the producers have said that union concessions are necessary to 
keep costs down and prevent runaway productions where film and 
televison crews move to nonunion work sites

southern california smogcontrol 
officials say theyll meet federal cleanair standards maybe 20 
years late but theyll do it 
by the year 2010 air quality will be at least as good as in 
the san francisco area probably better said carolyn green of 
the south coast air quality management district the cleanair 
agency for the fourcounty los angeles basin 
on wednesday an environmental protection agency ban took effect 
preventing the construction of big factories in the region the ban 
is expected to have little impact since no large factories or 
industrial projects are planned for the los angeles basin 
the area which has the nations worst smog failed to meet the 
dec 31 1987 deadline for achieving minimum smog standards set by 
the federal clean air act 
but norton younglove chairman of the south coast airquality 
board said the agency had cracked down recently on some of the 
areas biggest polluters and now requires employers to encourage 
ridesharing 
we now have public support solidly behind us in our fight to 
clean up the air and i do see it as a fight younglove said 
he said the district is to adopt in december a plan to meet us 
smog standards by 2007 the plan calls for greater use of 
cleanfuel or electricpowered vehicles tighter controls on 
emissions from cars trucks trains and airplanes and developing 
nonpolluting paints and solvents

ira supporters fired at a 
police station and hurled firebombs at security forces who shot 
back with plastic bullets and injured three people before dawn 
thursday police said 
the violence was touched off by the killing of three irish 
republican army guerrillas police said british troops ambushed the 
three on tuesday as they drove along a country road armed and 
wearing ski masks 
rioting broke out in roman catholic areas of belfast on 
wednesday night and continued until dawn police said 
the three injured were taken to a hospital after the clash near 
falls road an ira stronghold in west belfast their condition was 
not immediately known 
youths set fire to a bus two vans and more than 35 cars and 
hurled gasoline bombs and rocks at security forces while a gunman 
fired on the citys new barnsley police station police said 
thursday night half a dozen cars were stolen in the falls road 
area a police spokesman said on condition of anonymity but it was 
not on the scale of the previous violence 
two brothers killed in tuesdays ambush gerard and martin 
harte will be buried friday and the third man brian mullen will 
be buried saturday police said all three were known ira operatives 
prime minister margaret thatcher in an interview published 
thursday said the recent increase in ira attacks strengthens the 
resolve of the british government that northern ireland is part of 
the united kingdom and will remain so 
the mainly catholic ira is fighting to drive britain from 
predominantly protestant northern ireland and unite the province 
with the 95 percent catholic irish republic 
police said they found a submachine gun a pistol and ammunition 
in an empty west belfast house and seized an air pistol and 
bombmaking equipment in a raid on the strabane office of sinn 
fein the outlawed iras legal political wing 
they said a bomb planted by a masked man exploded near a gas 
station at strabane on the irish border 60 miles west of belfast 
no injuries were reported 
the ira launched a steppedup campaign against the british army 
this summer but suffered three blows in quick succession this 
week starting with tuesdays ambush followed wednesday by a 
bombing blunder that killed two civilians in londonderry and the 
arrest of two ira suspects in west germany 
spreading its bombing and shooting campaign to mainland britain 
and continental europe the ira has killed 27 british military men 
this year including eight in a bus bombing in the west of the 
province on aug 20 
that attack prompted a british pledge to crack down on the ira 
tuesdays ambush killing apparently by an elite antiguerrilla 
squad was seen as the start of the counterattack 
blows on three fronts for the ira headlined the times of 
london 
west german authorities thursday said two alleged ira members 
captured near the dutch border are prime suspects in recent 
bombings of british military installations in west germany 
the men were caught wednesday with a weapon believed to have 
been used in a shootout in the netherlands that killed a royal air 
force member in may they said 
mrs thatcher was quoted as saying the ira and its supporters 
think that if they step up terrorism it will weaken our resolve 
to stay in the province quite the reverse is true terrorism will 
not win 
she refused to spell out what new measures against the ira were 
adopted but my message to them is this do not doubt our resolve 
to defeat terrorism 
the irish government called for an urgent meeting with british 
officials and said the frightening escalation of violence 
undermines the very maintenance of the rule of law 
a senior sinn fein official martin mcguinness criticized 
wednesdays bungled ira operation which killed sean dalton 55 
and sheila lewis 60 in londonderry 
dalton broke into a neighbors apartment concerned he had not 
seen its occupant for several days and triggered a bomb rigged by 
the ira to blow up an army squad mrs lewis was standing on a 
balcony outside 
the ira apologized and said although the operation was 
carefully planned it went tragically wrong 
mcguinness said he was not criticizing the ira as a whole but 
i do have a responsibility to criticize individual ira operations 
that result in civilian deaths this tragic accident raises a 
number of questions which the ira must answer 
eleven ira members have died violently this year and 20 
civilians have been killed in botched ira operations

hundreds of iraqi kurds have fled to iran 
after government bombardments and chemical attacks an official 
iranian report said thursday 
also thursday irans parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani 
suggested turkey close its pipelines to iraqi oil 
the united states expressed concern about reports iraq used 
chemical weapons in its latest assault on kurdish rebel strongholds 
in the mountainous northeastern part of the country 
diplomats in baghdad say iraq has taken advantage of the aug 20 
ceasefire in the nearly 8yearold war with iran to intensify 
operations against the autonomyseeking kurds who sided with the 
iranians 
the official islamic republic news agency said 900 kurdish 
families arrived in northwestern iran the agency quoted a senior 
iranian official as telling a visiting turkish envoy that iraq was 
planning to exterminate its kurdish population 
turkey says it has allowed 20000 kurdish refugees into the 
country and the number is expected to rise 
the refugees in iran elderly men women and children were 
being settled temporarily in the towns of piranshahr and orumieh in 
west azarbaijan province said irna monitored in cyprus 
the report said 300 of the families arrived via turkey while the 
rest came directly from iraq fleeing shelling and chemical 
weapons it did not specify the number of people involved 
an official of the kurdish democratic party speaking on 
condition of anonymity said wednesday that iraqs offensive began 
monday with at least 60000 troops backed by tanks aircraft 
helicopter gunships artillery and chemical weapons 
the reports could not be independently confirmed 
rafsanjani who spoke in an interview on iranian television that 
was monitored in cyprus said there was nothing iran could do 
to prevent iraqi attacks on kurdish rebels or civilians 
the only help we can offer is to protect the refugees who come 
to iran he said of course the world can stop the attacks 
by putting iraq under pressure 
for instance if turkey closed its pipelines to iraq to stop 
it from exporting its oil as well as other actions by other 
countries then this criminal regime will be forced to stop its 
criminal acts 
the two pipelines which take oil to mediterranean ports were 
built to help iraq export its oil during the war when the persian 
gulf was closed to iraqi shipping 
in washington the state department expressed concern about 
reports of iraqi chemical attacks 
if the reports are accurate this is a grave violation of 
international human rights standards said deputy spokeswoman 
phyllis oakley noting that use of chemical weapons was condemned 
in a un security council resolution approved last week 
she commended the turkish government for offering temporary 
shelter to kurdish refugees 
in geneva un spokesman francois giuliani said wednesday the 
world body was taking no action following allegations of the 
chemical attacks saying there was no independent confirmation 
unappointed experts say iraq has used the weapons against iran 
and the united nations has condemned their use during the war 
irna quoted deputy prime minister for political affairs alireza 
moayyeri as saying the iraqi regime aims to exterminate its 
kurdish population 
it said he made the comment during a meeting with nuzhei 
kandemir an undersecretary in turkeys foreign ministry in tehran 
on an official visit

democratic presidential candidate michael 
dukakis said thursday that vice president george bush was playing 
hooky when the reagan administration slashed education programs 
in a speech for the oakland public school systems 
backtoschool day the massachusetts governor said voters this 
fall have a choice between those who see education as a lifetime 
commitment and those who see it as an electionyear strategy 
the hardhitting speech followed a pattern set in recent days by 
the democratic nominee who has markedly stepped up his attacks on 
bush 
upon arrival in california late wednesday night dukakis 
described bush as one of the charter members of the environmental 
wrecking crew which went to washington in 1981 
he said bush while opposing offshore oil drilling in california 
where it is politically unpopular recently supported it in texas 
he said the nation needed a president whose environmental 
policy doesnt change with the time zones 
dukakis was on a brief prelabor day west coast campaign swing 
through california oregon and washington 
while he was away a poll by the boston herald showed dukakis 
running neck and neck with bush in massachusetts compared with a 
poll in july that gave dukakis a 14point lead the newest poll 
giving both candidates 42 percent reflected the responses of 400 
registered voters contacted wednesday the poll had a fivepoint 
margin of error 
dukakis said he wasnt worried carrying his home state and 
spokesman dayton duncan said were very confident michael 
dukakis will carry massachusetts were also confident he will 
carry george bushs other home states maine texas washington 
dc and any others he claims 
in his education speech dukakis also portrayed the difference 
between himself and bush as one between those who believe that 
good education should be the property of a few and those who 
believe it is the birthright of every american no matter who they 
are or where they come from or what the color of their skin 
he charged the reagan administration has eliminated remedial 
math and reading programs for 500000 poor children while in 
massachusetts he started an essential skills program the 
reagan administration sought cuts in the remedial programs in 1981 
but was unsuccessful in an april 1988 report the education 
department said the number of children in remedial programs had 
dropped from 5 million in 197980 to 45 million in the 198586 
school year 
while theyve been lecturing teachers and cutting teacher 
retraining programs weve invested in professional development 
centers to help our teachers keep pace with changing times he 
said 
and where was george while all this was going on where was 
the man who now says he wants to be the education president he 
was playing hooky he was nowhere to be found 
he said the reagan administration was investing billions of 
dollars in star wars while in his state weve developed a 
regionwide network of star schools 
dukakis first stop of the day was at the california musuem of 
science and industry where he met with a participant in the los 
angeles education partnership a program under which private 
industry assists urban public schools 
i think what youre doing is terrific dukakis said there 
is no way under the sun the federal treasury given the red ink 
its looking at can do this by itself 
participating in the meeting was los angeles mayor tom bradley 
who told dukakis that the schools need help because students are 
dropping out before the fourth grade

a memorial service on thursday marking 
the anniversary of s brian willsons failed bid to halt a navy 
munitions train was marred by blaring horns obscene chants and 
signs mocking willson who lost his legs when the train struck him 
we came to protest these crazy people said jack withrow 
65 of sacramento a world war ii veteran and one of about 15 
people who appeared at the concord naval weapons station to oppose 
the service 
he carried a sign which read you supply legs well supply 
arms 
willson a 47yearold vietnam veteran who has become a martyr 
to the antiwar movement since he was injured last sept 1 seemed 
more saddened than angry at the demonstrators 
its not going to stop people blocking the trains he said 
if they want to murder people i suggest they sign up and go to 
central america and do it dont ask somebody else to do it 
the service took place on the tracks where willson and others 
tried to halt the train as part of a protest opposing us 
involvement in central america the others managed to scramble off 
the tracks but willson was hit 
the train whose crew had been ordered not to stop to avoid 
allowing demonstrators to climb on board severed one leg and the 
other was amputated later 
eight white crosses stood thursday between the rails near where 
the tracks enter the base the target of daily demonstrations since 
willson was injured a rainbow of crepe paper rose near the 
chainlink fence which guards the area near the gate 
i am celebrating personally having survived 365 days and im 
very thankful im alive and youre alive here today willson told 
the crowd of about 100 people gathered to mark the incident 
i encourage all of us to continue asking how much do we want 
peace 
during the service trucks and cars passed with horns and radios 
blaring as passengers shouted obscene slogans in an effort to drown 
out the proceedings some passed out a package that included an 
organ donor card and a copy of a last will and testament 
the navy has said it is concerned about the safe transportation 
of explosives across a 200foot intersection near the demonstration 
site and wants to build a 10 million overpass to take vehicles 
over the highway 
about 325 arrests have been made over the past year but not one 
person has been convicted 
also complaining about the ongoing protests are many residents 
of the neighboring town of clyde population 450 they contend the 
ragtag encampment of sleeping bags lawn chairs picket signs and 
american flags is an unkempt eyesore 
if the protesters asked said willson he would tell them that 
he is speaking the truth of my heart

jesse jackson said thursday that i will 
campaign for voter registration and voter turnout in every state 
that i can get to for the democratic ticket 
jackson denied that aides to democratic candidate michael 
dukakis had tried to keep jackson from campaigning for dukakis in 
some states 
i have seen no such list jackson told reporters after 
meeting with dukakis campaign officials on a joint voter 
registration effort 
he said he will concentrate on reaching farmers trade unionists 
and students 
in some instances well speak directly for as a surrogate 
for the ticket jackson said while elsewhere he will represent 
the democratic party or his own rainbow coalition wing of the 
party 
he said he would focus so hard on those groups because i 
would hate to wake up on the morning of nov 9 the day after the 
election and hate to think that we lost by the lack of my work 
jackson the civil rights activist and former dukakis rival for 
the partys nomination said the transition toward a unified 
campaign in some states has gone very well in some states it is 
incomplete 
jackson predicted that the remaining areas of incompleteness 
will be resolved in the next few days 
some of the 70 party officials and campaign workers from the 
southeast who attended the meeting attributed reports of alleged 
restraints on jacksons campaign appearances in some states to 
tensions arising from the merger of the dukakis and jackson 
organizations 
there are always problems during a campaign but i havent 
seen any evidence that a great divisiveness exists said jackson 
adviser bert lance former white house budget director under 
president carter 
the meeting thursday was called by jackson to discuss voter 
registration but joseph gardner director of operations in 
jacksons chicago office said in advance that he expected the 
group to discuss the extent to which dukakis has fulfilled his 
pledge to bring jackson supporters into his campaign 
sources close to jackson had said wednesday that he was angered 
because dukakis aides had told him to avoid campaigning in 
michigan louisiana mississippi georgia texas new york and 
alabama 
i have no knowledge of that jackson said on nbctvs 
today show thursday 
dukakis said in california that he would meeting with some 
leaders of the jackson campaign who are already becoming a very 
important part of our campaign in that state 
gardner said transition problems were serious in georgia where 
the rev cameron alexander a jackson supporters took his name off 
the list of nine cochairmen of the state dukakis campaign 
charging that the state party was giving only token attention to 
blacks 
larry harrington dukakis southern political director who 
attended the meeting here said the party had made a significant 
and a successful effort to involve jackson supporters at all 
levels of the campaign 
i dont really think theres a serious problem but if he 
jackson identifies some problems then well work with him 
harrington said 
others at the meeting including rep john lewis dga and 
bobby kahn executive director of the georgia democratic party 
denied suggestions of a rift

a rescueswimmer school neared its conclusion thursday one of two 
courtmartial proceedings under way in the death of a recruit 
a panel of four officers was to hear closing arguments thursday 
afternoon in the derelictionofduty courtmartial of lt thomas a 
torchia the officer in charge of the navy rescue swimmer school 
when airman recruit lee mirecki 19 died march 2 
mirecki of appleton wis had a phobia about being pulled 
under water and suffered a fearinduced attack before drowning a 
navy pathologist testified in the torchia trial 
instructors had thrown the panicstriken recruit into a swimming 
pool after he climbed out and shouted he wanted to quit the 
voluntary training witnesses have said 
petty officer 2nd class michael w combe 28 of tempe ariz 
also faces a courtmartial in the case and attorneys argued for 
dismassal of the charges before a military judge on thursday combe 
is accused of holding mireckis head under the water 
he is charged with involuntary manslaughter battery and 
conspiracy to commit battery if convicted he could get up to a 
threeyear prison term on the manslaughter count 
the maximum punishment torchia faces is a fine of two months 
pay a reprimand and loss of seniority for promotion but a defense 
lawyer says that is enough to put his career on the line torchia 
32 is from princeton ill 
in their dismissal motion combes lawyers have alleged that 
vice adm nr thunman chief of naval education and training was 
unqualified to convene the general courtmartial because he had a 
personal interest in the case and had been influenced by others 
against the defendant 
the military judge cmdr newell d krogmann had rejected the 
same motion last week in torchias case 
thunman denied the allegations in testimony wednesday the 
admirals lawyer capt robert vander lugt took the witness stand 
thursday to support thunmans testimony 
the pretrial hearing was recessed thursday until prosecution and 
defense lawyers could make legal arguments on the issue 
in his testimony wednesday thunman revealed that an 
investigation initially resulted in a recommendation for no 
disciplinary action he said charges werent filed until it was 
reopened with a different officer leading the probe 
i felt we had to go a lot further thunman said 
thunman earlier denied reports that the navy failed to fully 
investigate until pressured by the press and mireckis family and 
congressman 
in addition to the two courtmartial cases the investigation 
also led to nonjudicial punishment for five other navy men 
including a letter of reprimand to torchias former boss 
nowretired capt cl lavinder who had headed the naval aviation 
schools command

the shrinking of the aral sea formerly the 
worlds fourthlargest lake could prompt the soviet union to 
revive a plan to divert water into the sea from siberian rivers a 
us analyst concludes 
the campaign has already begun wrote philip p micklin 
professor in the geography department at western michigan 
university in a survey of the arals problems in this weeks issue 
of science magazine dated friday 
as rivers feeding it were diverted for irrigation the aral 
about 250 miles east of the caspian sea shrank 40 percent from its 
1960 size of 26000 square miles as big as west virginia or 
ireland it is now the sixthlargest lake 
if current trends continue there was zero inflow in 1986 the 
lake could reach 9000 square miles in 2000 soviet scientists have 
estimated 
in the 1970s and 1980s the national water management design 
institute drew plans for a huge diversion of the ob and irtysh 
rivers in western siberia for both irrigation and to help the 
aral 1550 miles away 
these plans were attacked by scientists and others who foresaw 
severe ecological economic and cultural damage occurring in 
northern regions of water export 
final engineering designs for the first stage of 22 million 
acrefeet of water per year a flow as big as the wabash river in 
indiana were being drafted in 1985 when mikhail gorbachev became 
leader of the communist party 
in august 1986 the project was halted 
gorbachev and his advisers see northsouth water transfer 
projects as a poor investment of scarce resources and believe less 
costly more effective local means of solving water supply 
problems can be used in dry areas micklin wrote 
a special commission last year reported on plans to preserve one 
river delta and safeguard drinking water but the government has 
taken no concrete measures to improve the condition of the aral 
micklin said 
though party and government officials in the uzbekistan and 
kazakhstan republics have been silent recently scientists 
writers and journalists from the region continue to plead angrily 
and sometimes eloquently in the regional as well as national 
press for action to save the aral he said 
as the situation worsens those living around the sea will put 
great pressure on the national government to resurrect the siberian 
diversion plan in order to provide minimum inflow to the aral while 
maintaining irrigation 
in march the president of the uzbeck academy of sciences said 
publicly the aral problem could not be solved without the siberian 
diversion 
irrigation planners foresaw the reduction in the aral and a 
number of experts saw this as a worthwhile tradeoff a cubic meter 
of river water used for irrigation would bring far more value than 
the same cubic meter diverted to the aral sea 
warnings to the contrary were not heeded the unprecedented 
changes for such a large body of water have led some soviet experts 
to call it one of the very greatest ecological problems of our 
century 
today 47 million tons of salts are blown from the lake bottom 
onto 58000 square miles of adjacent land each year commercial 
fishing has been all but killed costing an estimated 60000 jobs 
river delta ecosystems have dried up with major damage to livestock 
producers and native game and summers have become warmer and 
winters colder up to 180 miles away 
reduction of irrigation by 24 million acrefeet per year could 
halt the shrinkage but micklin noted irrigation is the economic 
mainstay of the aral sea basin where over 90 percent of the harvest 
comes from irrigated lands

its a year late but the national education 
association said thursday that vice president george bush has 
finally turned in the assignment that all presidential contenders 
were given last summer a detailed questionnaire about schools and 
other issues 
we need to spend more on education bush wrote providing 
an excellent education is an investment in americas future and 
it is one of the most basic roles of government 
the tone is much more positive than we had anticipated said 
nea president mary hatwood futrell but she gave the republican 
presidential nominee an incomplete for not answering all the 
questions 
bush reiterated his campaign promises to expand head start and 
create a new 500 million merit school program to help 
disadvantaged children he also opposed laws that would declare 
english the official us language 
he did not respond directly to some of the 20 questions the nea 
asked on issues ranging from education to social security to a 
nuclear freeze but reiterated his support for tuition tax credits 
and merit pay which the nea opposes 
bush who has said repeatedly that he wants to be the 
education president ignored the teachers questionnaire when it 
was sent to him last summer 
asked why she thought he responded now futrell said i think 
he filled it out because he finally realizes the nea is a powerful 
political entity in this country 
nearly onethird of the neas 19 million members are 
republicans futrell said and you just dont blow your nose or 
fan your hand at 600000 votes 
futrell whose union is expected to endorse democratic nominee 
michael dukakis next thursday also defended the massachusetts 
governors veto of a 1977 bill requiring teachers to recite the 
pledge of allegiance 
we believe that the pledge of allegiance is very critical and 
very important as part of the whole effort to teach patriotism in 
america we do not believe that it should be mandated you cannot 
mandate patriotism futrell told a backtoschool news conference 
at the national press club 
bush has made a campaign issue of dukakis 1977 veto of the 
mandatory pledge of allegiance bill which the states highest 
court had advised him beforehand was unconstitutional the 
legislature passed it over dukakis veto 
the massachusetts law would penalize teachers who refuse to lead 
daily recitations of the pledge but futrell said it is not being 
enforced there or in other states with similar laws 
she said the pledge should not be mandatory for either teachers 
or students 
i have sometimes difficulty dealing with people who dont 
stand up to recite the pledge futrell said but i respect their 
right not to do that this is a democracy 
the nea has been camped in the corner of the democrats in the 
past three elections and it is expected to be there again sept 8 
when it announces the results of a presidential preference poll of 
8400 union activists it fielded 300 delegates to the democratic 
convention in atlanta compared with about 25 at the gop convention 
in new orleans 
futrell said she would like to see the next president gradually 
increase the 21 billion department of education budget by at least 
5 billion to 9 billion

flowers and cheers greeted shipyard 
workers as they ended an 11day strike thursday and marched from 
the yard to church in what seemed like a victory parade holding a 
cross and solidarity banners aloft 
they acted with some reluctance on the advice of their leader 
lech walesa supporters chanting we thank you lined their path 
to a nearby roman catholic church that has functioned as the 
national strikecentral 
the departure had an air of victory even though the more than 
3000 men went through the gate with no guarantee that their main 
demand would be met the government has agreed only to discuss 
making the outlawed solidarity union legal again 
strikers massed behind the main gate of the lenin shipyard in 
the early afternoon under brilliant skies about 2000 supporters 
waited outside in welcome 
delegations from three other shipyards joined them for the 
formal end of the labor action agreed upon thursday morning after 
walesa spoke to them then they marched out 
before the gates opened the waiting crowd shouted approval for 
the strike we will win we will win every pole is with us 
as the men emerged the chant we thank you we thank you 
arose and the strikers answered we also you we also you 
someone had used black paint on the main sign to rename the 
lenin shipyard the solidarity yard 
a worker began singing the national anthem poland has not yet 
perished while we still live and the crowd became a sea of 
hands making the v sign of solidarity marchers and onlookers 
joined the song 
the line of marchers stretched hundreds of yards behind a cross 
seven feet high and beneath bobbing solidarity banners 
there was little police interference but some in the crowd were 
touchy when several young officers politely but firmly cleared a 
corner moving about 50 bystanders across the street they got an 
earful from women old enough to be their grandmothers 
reconciliation so this is the reconciliation the women 
shouted borrowing a favorite word of the government 
kiszczak should come here to see this one woman said 
referring to interior minister czeslaw kiszczak who met with 
walesa the day before 
some people handed bouquets of flowers to marching workers on 
the road to st brygidas church which became the nerve center of 
the nationwide wave of strikes that began aug 16 
in the long file were men carrying bedding on their backs 
polish strikers occupy their plants rather than leaving them and 
remain inside 24 hours a day 
onlookers and marchers struck up a sort of yodel usually heard 
in the stands at soccer games but one old man in a suit and black 
beret continued chanting solidarity solidarity with a hand 
raised in the v salute 
when the procession reached the church for a welcoming ceremony 
and a mass celebrated by bishop tadeusz goclowski of gdansk people 
began a rhythmic clapping that lasted about 10 minutes until the 
church was filled 
wooden crosses carried by delegations from the four shipyards 
were brought to the front along with placards for various groups of 
solidarity activists 
among the first in the church was alojzy szablewski a 
62yearold engineer who led the strike committee in the lenin 
shipyard he walked to the altar and knelt in silent prayer 
bishop goclowski said at the outset of the service i thank 
you for your wisdom you sons of a 1000yearold nation which has 
always been connected with the church during this mass we will 
pray not for ourselves but for our country

ptl founder jim bakker may be back on 
television as soon as next week the ministrys bankruptcy trustee 
said thursday as lawyers worked on details of bakkers 165 million 
plan to buy back ptl 
trustee mc benton said he received offers of 120 million and 
114 million thursday the last day he was taking bids for the 
ministrys assets both were larger than the previously announced 
offer of 113 million from canadian real estate magnate peter 
thomas chairman of samoth capital corp 
benton said the offers were from american groups and that they 
had not been mentioned previously but he declined to be more 
specific he said he did not anticipate getting an offer higher 
than bakkers 
a 3 million letter of credit that should be ready in a day or 
so will secure bakkers deal said his attorney ryan hovis during a 
news conference at the world outreach center at heritage usa 
headquarters for the ptl 
benton and hovis would release no details about the unidentified 
greek financiers who are backing bakkers deal 
new covenant partners inc is being formed to buy ptl hovis 
said the contract being negotiated calls for creditors to get cash 
payments and for securing the benefits of major ptl donors 
the deal calls for bakker to pay 85 million in cash and to pay 
the internal revenue service the money it is owed that amount is 
being disputed 
bakker said he will obtain an 80 million mortgage on 1000 
acres of undeveloped property at ptl 
hovis said bakker may lease facilities from the bankruptcy 
trustee until the deal can be closed benton said during the news 
conference that bakker could be back on the air as early as sept 9 
benton has until sept 10 to bring a buyer to us bankruptcy 
judge rufus reynolds who will decide who gets to buy the ministry 
although his decision can be appealed to us district court 
a spokeswoman in reynolds office in greensboro nc said 
thursday the judge could not comment on a pending case the judge 
has not said when he will decide on the buyer but has said he 
wants to sell the ministry as soon as possible to pay off creditors 
and keep heritage usa operating 
benton said he had not talked to reynolds about the possibility 
of bakker regaining control of the ministry he left in march 1987 
when he resigned amid allegations of misuse of money and 
revelations of his sexual encounter with church secretary jessica 
hahn 
ptl filed for bankruptcy reorganization in june 1987 
the trustee said the law requires that he secure the best 
financial deal for the creditors and that his own opinion of bakker 
is not relevant to his job 
its not what i believe its what bankruptcy law says my 
obligation here is benton said 
lawyers said among the things still being discussed are what to 
do with heritage ministries a newly formed nonprofit organization 
that includes the ministrys religious operations 
the president of heritage ministries don edwards has said he 
will not stay if bakker returns whether he bakker would want 
me or not 
heritage village church pastor sam johnson also has said he 
would not remain under bakkers leadership

regulators on thursday extended by a day their 
talks with the robert m bass group of fort worth texas on a 
federal rescue of american savings and loan association of 
stockton calif 
in a statement released late in the day m danny wall chairman 
of the federal home loan bank board described the negotiations as 
intensive and said any announcement would be delayed by 24 
hours 
according to industry sources the proposal involves a 
contribution of about 500 million from the bass group and up to 2 
billion in promissory notes from the bank board which would make 
it the largest rescue ever of a single sampl the largesttodate is 
the 13 billion infusion into vernon savings and loan association 
in texas 
american is owned by the irvine califbased financial corp of 
america the secondlargest thrift holding holding company in the 
nation with 302 billion in assets as of june 30 
karl hoyle a spokesman for the bank board would not say what 
was holding up a resolution of the talks 
the bank board on april 21 granted bass exclusive negotiating 
rights on american and had twice given onemonth extensions of the 
deadline originally set for july 5 the oneday delay was the 
third extension 
financial corp which first came under regulatory scrutiny in 
1984 when it suffered a run on deposits lost 2237 million in the 
first six months of this year 
congressional leaders and executives of first nationwide savings 
of san francisco a ford motor co subsidiary which earlier sought 
to acquire american have complained about basss exclusive 
arrangement 
rep fernand j st germain dri criticized the bank board in 
a letter this week saying it would seem a matter of a sound 
negotiating posture to maximize competition whenever possible 
it is essential that there be no appearance of exclusion or 
suggestion that any alternative was overlooked st germain wrote 
wall in his statement thursday noted that the failed 
negotiations with first nationwide were longer than the talks with 
bass 
sen donald w riegle dmich who is expected to become 
chairman of the senate banking committee next year wrote to wall 
on wednesday saying he was concerned about the bank boards plan 
to allow american to remain under a state charter when bass assumes 
ownership 
he said it was unprecedented for regulators to allow a 
rescued thrift institution to remain under a state charter which he 
said permitted extremely liberal powers 
one factor that had delayed a deal in the past appears to be 
cleared up the bass group was concerned that the federal 
assistance would be subject to californias 11 percent corporate 
income tax that risk would be eliminated by a bill that cleared 
the california legislature tuesday and awaits the governors 
signature

less than two years after he won reelection in a 
historic landslide michael dukakis finds himself in an 
embarrassing position at home with a new poll showing him even with 
george bush in massachusetts and widespread unhappiness with his 
recent performance as governor 
while aides to the democratic presidential nominee scoffed at 
the poll results and predicted dukakis would defeat bush handily in 
massachusetts political observers from both parties were nearly 
unanimous in blaming dukakis slide on a recent spate of problems 
and protests related to the governors handling of a state budget 
crisis 
ironically the presidential poll showing dukakis and bush each 
with 42 percent support among massachusetts voters was published 
thursday a day when the republican nominee was campaigning behind 
enemy lines in massachusetts and dukakis was on the west coast 
i cant believe it in massachusetts a pleased bush 
responded when shown the headline on the story in the boston 
herald which commissioned the poll 
the telephone survey of 400 likely voters was conducted 
wednesday by krc research and had a margin of error of five 
percentage points fifteen percent of the respondents said they 
were undecided 
were out to win here said republican state sen argeo paul 
cellucci the massachusetts chairman of the bush campaign 
michael dukakis is in trouble here in massachusetts 
dukakis said no when asked whether he was worried about 
carrying his home state dukakis aides and democratic political 
consultants dismiss talk about dukakis being threatened in his home 
state 
were very confident michael dukakis will carry 
massachusetts said press secretary dayton duncan were also 
confident he will carry george bushs other home states maine 
texas washington dc and any others he claims 
were going to do to george bush in massachusetts what he said 
he did to geraldine ferarro in 1984 said jack corrigan director 
of operations for the dukakis campaign a reference to bushs 
statement that he kicked a little ass in a debate with ferraro 
the 1984 democratic vice presidential nominee 
yea george bush should target massachusetts thats my advice 
to him said corrigan 
corrigan declined to speculate on factors that allowed bush to 
pull even with dukakis in massachusetts only two months after a 
poll showed the governor with a 14point cushion 
but democratic political consultant michael goldman reflecting 
a consensus among political observers in both parties said the 
reasons behind the poll numbers are really very simple 
he has been under intense pressure to balance his 
responsibilities as governor and candidate at a time when michael 
has run into some real bumps on the massachusetts road said 
goldman 
those muchpublicized bumps include repeated outcry from 
interest groups and legislators mostly republicans related to the 
plan dukakis pushed through the legislature to balance the 1988 and 
1989 state budgets by canceling more than 500 million in planned 
program expansions and by trimming state aid to cities and towns by 
91 million dukakis also supported several narrowly focused tax 
measures 
since securing the democratic presidential nomination dukakis 
also has been a frequent target of protests and complaints on 
issues ranging from crime in the city of boston to his plans to 
locate a prison in a rural central massachusetts town dukakis has 
spent six days in the last three weeks touring different regions of 
the state and was met by demonstrators at virtually every stop 
there also have been complaints from gop legislators about the 
amount of time dukakis spends out of state a concern that 
according to the krc poll appears to be shared by voters 
the survey found that 56 percent of the respondents considered 
dukakis performance as governor during his presidential campaign 
not effective while 33 percent rated him effective and 11 
percent said they didnt know whether he had been effective 
nearly half of the respondents 49 percent said dukakis should 
remain in office during the presidential campaign while 40 percent 
said he should resign and 11 percent had no definite opinion on the 
question dukakis campaign aides have said repeatedly that he will 
not resign before the election 
people in massachusetts are obviously disappointed in the way 
their governor is running the state and theyre taking it out on 
him said krc pollster gerry chervinsky 
while republicans delighted in the results dukakis partisans 
said they viewed the numbers more as a referendum on his handling 
of recent state troubles than a fair assessment of his strength 
against bush in the presidential contest 
corrigan said dukakis state operation has just begun its 
grassroots organizing an effort being led by many of those who 
helped dukakis win nearly 70 percent of the vote in his 1986 
reelection bid im not worried one bit he said 
momma said thered be days like this said goldman any 
attempt to take this and make a relation between how november is 
going to come out is ridiculous but it is a nice way of sending 
the message to dad that he better as hell spend some time looking 
at the kid back home

it took tear gas a swat team a battering 
ram and a electric stun gun thursday to remove a 65yearold woman 
from her home where she had been holed up for three days shooting 
at police and slightly wounding the chiefs brother 
i think they had to do this because the old lady had a gun 
its terrible said neighbor bang lee looking at a gaping hole 
left in the neat house by the battering ram 
the woman barbara maxson had lived in the house on the citys 
south side for more than 20 years she barricaded herself inside 
monday afternoon after arguing with her daughter 
she began shooting when officers entered her house about 4 am 
thursday after firing tear gas inside said police spokesman lt 
fred nixon 
she was found in a bathtub clutching a pistol and holding a 
blanket over her head to block the tear gas fumes nixon said 
officers shot her with a taser stun gun which shoots a dart 
that emits an electrical charge temporarily disabling the person 
nixon said she was taken to torrance memorial medical center for 
psychiatric observation he said 
the brother of police chief daryl gates capt stephen gates 
was treated at another hospital after a bullet grazed his head as 
he approached the house wednesday to talk to mrs maxson nixon 
said 
it does underscore that when someone is armed and decides for 
whatever reasons to make an armed stand their age and sex doesnt 
matter whatever makes them dangerous is their escape from reality 
or their disregard for human life said cmdr william booth the 
chiefs spokesman 
the standoff began monday when the womans daughter tried to 
coax mrs maxson who reportedly had a history of psychiatric 
problems from the house for psychiatric care nixon and neighbors 
said 
mrs maxson allegedly pointed a gun at her daughter who called 
police police watched the house then decided to take action 
wednesday after being warned by mrs maxsons husband that there 
were several weapons inside 
the police departments special weapons and tactics team was 
called in then the departments armored car equipped with a 
battering ram which is usually used against the heavily fortified 
homes of drug dealers 
we used the ram because the house had fortified bars on the 
window and furniture piled in front of the windows there was no 
other safe way for our officers to make safe entry nixon said 
the woman fired at the battering ram he said 
the ram damaged the front of the greenandbrown onestory 
house strewing a refrigerator and household items in the driveway

sam arvin gathered thousands of pull 
tabs from aluminum cans to help people suffering from kidney 
failure only to learn what other wouldbe dogooders have learned 
before that the tabs are worthless 
the 53yearold janitor broke the tabs from countless aluminum 
cans and persuaded about 100 colleagues at the auto plant where he 
works to do the same he even went to texas to get the tabs from 
4000 aluminum cans in a nephews collection 
he believed the tabs could be cashed in for time on a dialysis 
machine for patients with kidney failure but when he tried to 
redeem them officials of bethany medical center and the national 
kidney foundation told that no such program existed 
i really wanted to help these unfortunate people he said 
i wanted to take pictures of the patients and publish them in our 
company newspaper to get more people interested 
but then i learned that the tabs werent going where i thought 
they were going he said i could have had 500 people saving 
those tabs now im left wondering what to do next 
the stories that aluminum tabs can buy a kidney patient some 
time on a dialysis machine are completely untrue gigi 
poliposki communications director for the national kidney 
foundation in new york told the kansas city times hundreds of 
thousands of tabs have been collected by people and our chapters 
nationwide receive hundreds of calls every day from people 
wondering how they can use them to help patients 
we have tried to trace the source of the rumors but with 
absolutely no luck she said 
ms poliposki said bogus or misguided information about the 
tab program had been very specific with posters appearing in 
libraries school classrooms and buildings where civic groups meet 
in response to the hoax the national kidney foundation and the 
reynolds aluminum recycling co have started a program called 
keep tabs on your cans 
under the program people can take aluminum cans pie plates 
foil frozen dinner trays or other aluminum products to a reynolds 
recycling center and request that payment go to the kidney 
foundation a company spokesman said that 38 cents was being paid 
for each pound of aluminum although that price is subject to 
change

the radio quoted tamir as saying that for the palestinians 
there can be no substitute for the plo 
tamir said rifts within the plo will probably prevent it from 
recognizing israel and renouncing terror two of the conditions 
imposed by the united states for accepting the plo as a partner in 
the peace process 
however tamir said the plo should give its blessing to direct 
talks between israel and palestinian representatives from the 
occupied territories 
the plo should not prevent local leaders in the territories 
from discussing with us interim arrangements that will quiet down 
the situation and pave way for political process tamir said 
his remarks created a storm of controversy the rightwing likud 
bloc led by prime minister yitzhak shamir demanded that tamir be 
immediately returned from washington 
tamir is in the united states to prepare a visit of foreign 
minister shimon peres later this month 
no doubt he has seriously violated the governments policy 
said shamir aide yossi ahimeir we expect his superiors or 
superior peres to take action 
ahimeir emphasized that tamir did not speak on behalf of the 
israeli government adding theres a wide consensus in the 
government and the public that there should be no negotiations with 
this terror group 
foreign ministry spokesman alon liel said in a statement that 
israel has not changed its standing policy 
our position has been and will remain that as long as the plo 
does not recognize israel accept the un resolutions 242 and 338 
and stop terror we shall continue to see it as a terrorist group 
with which there should be no contact whatsoever it said 
the un security council resolutions assert israels right to 
exist within secure borders 
peres leader of the leftwing labor party declined comment on 
tamirs statement 
im not sure he has said it we have to check what he said 
exactly and then we shall pass judgment peres said 
yuval neeman leader of the rightwing tehiya party said 
through a spokesman that tamir should resign immediately 
in another development the accidental shooting of two israeli 
soldiers by a usborn jewish settler fueled a stormy debate 
thursday over the use of force by israeli civilians in the occupied 
territories 
leftwing legislator ran cohen blamed shamir in part for the 
shooting saying the prime ministers calls for less restrictive 
openfire orders set the stage for settler vigilante acts 
but ronni milo of the likud bloc lashed out at the critics they 
are ready to abandon jews to stones firebombs and pogroms the 
daily yediot ahronot quoted milo as saying 
the shooting occurred wednesday night near the west bank 
settlement of efrat south of jerusalem after a firebomb exploded 
about 20 yards from the car of settler gedalia becker 
becker fired 11 shots from his pistol and struck two soldiers 
who were also chasing the firebomb thrower one soldier was wounded 
in the stomach and lost a kidney israel radio said the second 
soldier was wounded in the leg 
becker was questioned by police and released on bail but police 
confiscated his weapon 
on tuesday shamir told settlers he supported a change in policy 
to permit civilians and soldiers to open fire on arab 
stonethrowers without shooting warning rounds first 
in other developments thursday 
about 110000 students in the gaza strip returned to school 
after their summer vacation and leaflets distributed by the moslem 
fundamentalist group islamic jihad urged them not to stage 
antiisraeli demonstrations during class hours 
military government officals ordered schools in the west bank to 
remain closed for at least another month saying they have been the 
focus of antiisraeli violence

the united states may be headed for a shortage of 
family doctors unless they receive more respect and larger incomes 
the american medical association says 
between 1975 and 1986 the overall active physician population 
increased by almost 45 percent in contrast the active family 
physician population including general practitioners grew by only 
24 percent the ama said 
by the year 2000 the total physician population will rise by 22 
percent while the number of family physicians will increase by 
only 9 percent the association predicted in fridays issue of the 
journal of the ama 
family practice may be less prestigious than other specialties 
because it stresses breadth rather than depth lacks emphasis on 
research and publication and is unrecognized by the public as a 
bona fide specialty the ama said 
family practitioners the secondlargest group of doctors behind 
specialists in internal medicine also make considerably less money 
than their colleagues the ama said mean net income in 1986 for 
family practitioners after expenses and before taxes was 80300 
compared with 119500 for physicians overall it said 
part of the problem is that the medicare program and insurance 
companies typically reimburse doctors more for hightech procedures 
than for the timeintensive diagnosis counseling and consulting 
that are the hallmarks of family practice the ama report said 
yet demand for family physicians at hospitals is nationwide 
the ama said citing a recent survey that found greatest demand in 
the midwest where 40 percent of all responding hospitals reported 
a need for family specialists 
family practitioners see more patients each week 1392 
compared with 1177 for physicians overall in 1986 and work more 
weeks each year 483 compared with 475 for physicians overall 
the ama said 
and patients of family practitioners wait only about 27 days to 
be scheduled for an appointment compared with a wait of 62 days 
for physicians overall the report said 
it has been almost two decades since the american board of 
family practice set training and certification requirements for 
family practitioners and mandated that certified members pass new 
tests every six years the ama said 
the board defined family practice as providing continuing 
comprehensive health maintenance and medical care to the entire 
family regardlesss of sex age or type of problem be it 
biological behavioral or social 
the number of approved medical residency programs for family 
practice has declined slightly from 388 in 1983 to 381 in 1986 
and the specialty still struggles for recognition the ama said 
it called for doctors to promote the image of the family 
practitioner work for fairer reimbursement from thirdparty 
payers and ensure familypractice residency programs are of the 
highest quality 
there may be a shortage of family physicians despite a 
predicted oversupply of physicians in general the ama said 
shortages of family doctors may occur particularly in rural 
areas and settings such as health maintenance organizations where 
case managers with a broad range of expertise are needed said the 
ama report

burglars ransacked the home of 6yearold 
aids victim eliana martinez and stole about 1800 worth of 
possessions including a medical device used to treat the deadly 
disease police say 
health officials say there is a slight chance that anyone 
handling the stolen intravenous pump could become infected with 
aids if residue blood in the device comes in contact with an open 
cut 
the robbery believed to have occurred either monday or tuesday 
probably was not related to the publicity surrounding rosa 
martinezs legal fight to get her daughter into public school 
classes said police spokesman steve cole 
mrs martinez is appealing a ruling last month by us district 
judge elizabeth kovachevich that allows eliana to attend a public 
school only if she remains inside a specially built glass booth 
the family also lost a color television a videocassette 
recorder two calculators and a lawn mower in the burglary

windhoek southwest africa ap a bomb exploded thursday 
evening in a downtown hotel patronized by blacks and set it ablaze 
killing two people and wounding 15 police reported 
a mine exploded 90 minutes later on a railroad line about a mile 
from the threestory hotel slightly wounding two more people said 
officials at the windhoek state hospital 
the explosions occurred on the day the southwest africa 
peoples organization said it would begin a voluntary ceasefire 
swapo has fought a long guerrilla war against south african control 
of the territory also known as namibia 
south africas governmentrun broadcasting network said an 
anonymous telephone caller claimed responsibility for the hotel 
bombing on behalf of swapo the guerrilla group normally attacks 
military targets or white residential or shopping areas 
louis pienaar the territorial administrator appointed by south 
africa blamed swapo and accused it of violating the pledge of a 
truce he did not explain why the guerrillas would bomb a hotel 
patronized by blacks 
swapo and other black groups have warned of a possible white 
backlash in namibia because of preliminary south african proposals 
for independence elections that probably would result in government 
by the black majority 
the continental hotel was severely damaged by the explosion at 
about 7 pm witnesses said several parked cars were hurled across 
the street 
firefighters needed more than 90 minutes to bring the blaze 
under control the explosion apparently occurred near the hotel 
entrance witnesses said 
police spokesman kerri du rand said officials feared the 
building could collapse he said one black man and one white man 
were killed but he did not comment on the races of those injured 
a correspondent for the south african broadcasting corp at the 
scene said the bombing was one of the biggest explosions windhoek 
has experienced 
swapo has said its guerrillas would stop launching attacks in 
the territory as of thursday as their contribution to a regional 
peace initiative 
south african commanders have not formally endorsed the truce 
but have said their forces will not initiate offensive action 
against swapo 
swapo has been fighting since 1966 in a bid to win independence 
for southwest africa also known as namibia 
on tuesday south africa said it has pulled all its troops out 
of angola where it was fighting alongside rebels in their battle 
against angolas marxist government and its cuban allies south 
africa cuba and angola had been observing a ceasefire in angola 
since aug 8 
swapo was not included in peace talks involving those three 
countries and us mediators and is not bound by any of the 
agreements they have reached 
the south african military reported tuesday it had killed 14 
swapo insurgents the previous week and that the guerrilla groups 
had launched several sabotage attacks but the military said there 
were no new attacks reported thursday 
the south african military has said it expects angola to use its 
influence to keep swapo rebels at least 150 miles north of the 
namibian border swapo has not said publicly if it will abide 
swapo has its main bases in southern angola from which it 
launches attacks into northern namibia 
south africa has administered namibia for 73 years despite 
repeated united nations resolutions since 1966 calling for 
independence in the territory 
south africa says it will begin withdrawing from namibia on nov 
1 and allow the territory to hold independence elections june 1 if 
cuba pulls its 50000 troops out of angola by the latter date 
several rounds of peace talks have failed to achieve a mutually 
acceptable date for namibian independence and the complete cuban 
withdrawal from angola more talks are planned monday in 
brazzaville congo

nato kept its jets out of west 
german skies thursday in memory of victims of the ramstein air show 
disaster and an expert on treating burns said the quality of 
rescue work had been a scandal 
west german officials gave the first breakdown by nationality of 
the dead and injured in the fiery tragedy sunday when three 
italian air force jets collided and one crashed into the crowd at 
the ramstein us air force base 
the bild newspaper reported that some children who died had 
such bad burns their parents couldnt even recognize them that 
happened to a boy of about 13 who died in offenbach with his face 
burned beyond recognition 
a badly burned man died early thursday raising the death count 
to 49 said juergen dietzen spokesman for rhinelandpalatinate 
state where ramstein is located he said the us air force count 
of 52 dead was incorrect 
he said 40 of the dead had been identified 33 west germans two 
americans a dutch citizen and one from france and the three 
italian pilots involved in the collision he did not release any 
names 
a us air force statement thursday said the 9yearold son of 
an american woman who died in the tragedy also had been killed 
it identified him as joshua frymyer the son of pfc genevieve 
riggs who also died in the accident the child is survived by his 
father michael d frymyer of lewistown pa the air force 
reported the death of mrs riggs 36 on wednesday

110th military police company in pirmasens west germany sgt 
riggs was among the injured and has been returned to the united 
states for treatment

hospitalized 
his breakdown of the 168 was 144 germans 16 americans two 
britons and one each from france italy belgium portugal africa 
and the philippines he did not name the african country 
a leading west german expert on burns said emergency crews 
delivered many victims to hospitals incapable of treating serious 
fire wounds 
the organizational handling of the catastrophe was a 
scandal and an unbelievable failure of those responsible said 
leo koslowski former director of the tuebingen university surgical 
clinic he spoke to reporters in stuttgart 
i find it unimaginable that none of the victims were 
immediately brought to the highly modernized treatment centers in 
aachen and berlin he said 
wolfgang herbig director of the kaiserslautern hospital where 
many victims were taken said a day earlier he felt there were not 
enough mobile medical teams available at the air show 
rhinelandpalatinate officials have defended the rescue efforts 
and praised the cooperation between americans and germans 
hesse state radio said several people had filed criminal 
complaints with local prosecutors against defense minister rupert 
scholz and the air show organizers for alleged negligent 
manslaughter according to hesse state radio 
offices that process financial claims for damages against nato 
forces have added personnel to deal with an expected surge the zdf 
television network said 
in rome the italian air force said thursday the aerobatic team 
that performed at the ramstein air show will participate only at 
military ceremonies in the immediate future 
the air force also said in a statement that the participation of 
the team known as the frecce tricolori tricolor arrows would 
be limited to traditional flyovers with the planes trailing 
tricolored smoke

faith when informing people they are at risk of getting the hiv 
virus which causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome the law 
stipulates that doctors cant tell people the name of the 
aidsinfected person only that someone close to them has

shipyard and steel workers ended strikes 
thursday and lech walesa urged others to halt polands worst labor 
turmoil in seven years now that the government has agreed to 
discuss solidaritys future 
a solidarity spokesman said the walkout at the july manifesto 
mine where the nationwide strike wave began more than two weeks 
ago appeared to be nearing an end 
but by thursday night walesa failed to convince striking bus 
and dock workers in the baltic port of szczecin to end their 
strike and the strike committee decided to press for settlement of 
their local issues said the spokesman arkadiusz rybicki 
walesa met with ranking officials wednesday for the first time 
in six years and the government agreed to discuss the outlawed 
union and other issues restoring solidaritys legal status was the 
main demand of the strikers 
workers at the stalowa wola steel mill in southern poland began 
leaving the plant at 7 pm after receiving a telephone appeal from 
walesa and a message from the roman catholic episcopate a strike 
committee spokeswoman said 
at least 3000 strikers were in the lenin shipyard where walesa 
works as an electrician including workers from other yards in this 
baltic port they hoisted solidarity banners as members of their 
strike committee led them out 
about 2000 onlookers chanted thank you thank you and 
there is no freedom without solidarity strikers and the crowd 
outside joined in singing the national anthem just before the 
shipyard gates swung open 
more people lined the route to st brygidas church a 
headquarters of sorts for the men of the shipyard where walesa led 
a strike eight years ago that gave birth to solidarity 
polands communist authorities recognized solidarity in an 
agreement signed aug 31 1980 but declared martial law in 
december 1981 to suppress the first independent union in the soviet 
bloc and outlawed it the following year 
in the packed church the rev henryk jankowski declared 
in your wisdom which you showed today you decided about 
suspending the protest but it is only the end of the physical 
protest the strike goes on through dialogue 
bishop tadeusz goclowski conducted the mass and said at its 
outset i thank you for your wisdom you sons of a 1000yearold 
nation which has always been connected with the church 
shipyard workers gave up their strike in response to an appeal 
by walesa who said an end to the labor turmoil would will open the 
way for talks the government promised the strikes began aug 16 
and at their height idled 20 sites employing 100000 people 
one group of gdansk port workers complained of bad faith by 
authorities they said they were told not to return to their jobs 
because they had been fired for striking said antoni graberczyk a 
member of the gdansk port strike committee 
he said the men would rally outside the port friday to protest 
the action 
a statement from government spokesman jerzy urban said of 
walesas efforts to end the strikes 
we appreciate any positive and reasonable step the appeal to 
stop the strike is such a step it should be especially valued when 
it comes from a participant in the strikes 
on wednesday walesa met in warsaw with interior minister gen 
czeslaw kiszczak and stanislaw ciosek an alternate member of the 
politburo 
in a statement afterward he said he raised the issues of union 
pluralism and solidaritys role authorities promised talks on 
those points and on broad economic and political issues he said 
walesa toured the lenin shipyard other striking shipyards and 
the gdansk docks thursday morning and won the agreement to end the 
strikes 
he spent the afternoon on the telephone with striking dock 
workers in szczecin the steel mill employees in stalowa wola and 
coal miners at the july manifesto mine in the silesian town of 
jastrzebie in southwestern poland 
at present walesa has the extremely important task of being in 
constant telephone communication with the centers still on strike 
its a difficult matter said jacek merkel chairman of the 
gdansk interfactory strike committee and an aide to walesa 
at the july manifesto mine management laid in a special 
telephone line so walesa could consult with the strikers who are 
advised by gdansk solidarity activist bogdan lis said rybicki 
bogdan lis assured walesa that the miners would end the strike 
soon the solidarity spokesman said 
earlier in the day miners refused to take a call from walesa in 
the management office which is outside the mine gate fearing it 
was a trick to get them to leave the mine 
piotr niemczyk a solidarity spokesman in warsaw said strikers 
at the mine were demanding that walesa make his appeal in person 
the miners also want issues of higher pay and better working 
conditions settled 
urbans statement also said a policeman at the stalowa wola mill 
died while on duty wednesday night but the circumstances were not 
clear 
it is not known if he was murdered or committed suicide under 
psychological terror or persecution the statement said i am 
awaiting results of the investigation 
niemczyk said strikers at stalowa wola reported that a policeman 
shot and killed himself but no details were available 
bishop jerzy dabrowski sent a telegram to the mill workers 
saying the church had undertaken discussions with authorities to 
guarantee personal and employee safety

sen orrin hatch said thursday he never 
intended to brand all democrats as homosexuals in comments made the 
previous day but democrats quickly pounced on the utah 
republicans remarks as unbelievable and insulting 
hatch in an extemporaneous speech wednesday during a gop 
fundraiser in southern utah referred to democrats as the party 
of homosexuals and initially denied making the comment until a 
tape of the speech was replayed for him 
i would never say that deliberately lets put it that way 
he then said at a news conference if that was said that was a 
mistake 
hatch said he had intended to point out that the national 
democratic party caters to homosexual activists proabortionists 
guncontrol groups opponents of school prayer and almost every 
other liberal radical group in this country 
brian moss hatchs democratic opponent for the senate seat 
sharply criticized the remark during a speech to the utah aflcios 
state convention thursday then issued a news release that termed 
the remark childish namecalling 
in an interview moss said hatchs worst offense was to 
initially deny having made the statement 
whats more disturbing is that he tried to deny it until they 
had it on tape moss said thats got to say something about 
the veracity of the man 
state democratic chairman randy horiuchi said thursday he was 
disappointed by hatchs remarks 
i had respect for senator hatch as our united states 
senator he said its just unbelievable that he would say this 
sort of thing 
a tape of hatchs remarks made by radio station kdxu in st 
george showed hatch called the democratic party the party of big 
government antidefense continual failure to support freedom 
fighters all over the world weak foreign policy really a 
denigration of the monroe doctrine if you look at what theyve been 
doing to reagan over these last eight years 
and of course they love they are the party of homosexuals 
they are the party of abortion theyre the party that has fought 
school prayer every step of the way hatch said theyre the 
party that has basically i think denigrated a lot of the values 
that have made this country the greatest country in the world 
hatch said the remark was a small part of a much longer speech 
that included many other issues 
you cant take just one line out of a 25minute speech and say 
this is what he meant when in fact it was clear i didnt mean 
that he said theyre taking one line out of context if 
thats accurate i dont know that it is 
campaign manager bud scruggs said on thursday that the senator 
was not denying that he made the statement but was concerned that 
it had been taken out of context 
if he were making a formal statement it would have been 
worded more diplomatically scruggs said 
scruggs said the controversy would not harm hatchs chances for 
a third term hatch has led moss by nearly 50 percent in recent 
opinion polls 
in utah i think most people are going to say that sounds kind 
of undiplomatic but its true scruggs said 
meanwhile horiuchi called for an end to negative 
namecalling campaign tactics saying he was worried the voters 
would become so disenchanted that they would simply refuse to vote 
in november

the boston church of christ opened a fourday 
seminar thursday amid criticism from traditional church of christ 
groups who contend the church uses mind control techniques and is 
taking over other ministries 
al baird an elder in the boston church blames the accusations 
on a few disgruntled former members and jealousy from less 
successful congregations the boston church has risen from a few 
dozen members to more than 3300 members in ministries as far away 
as south africa and argentina over the last 10 years 
and people are suspicious of anything growing as rapidly as we 
are baird said there must be something wrong with it there 
must be something mysterious about it nobody else is growing like 
that what are you guys doing you must be controlling people 
the churches of christ comprise about 18000 independent 
congregations with a us membership of more than 2 million the 
churches preach basic bible teachings and consider baptism an 
essential part of the salvation process 
the 1988 world missions seminar is attracting about 9000 church 
of christ members and other christians to workshops on gods 
eternal plan and gods secret weapon and speeches from church 
elders 
people come and really get some indepth teaching a lot of 
indepth reports on whats going on around the world said baird 
and its a time that people make some new commitments in their 
personal lives 
the controversy surrounding congregations related to the boston 
church stems from their highprofile recruiting techniques and 
their practice of discipling an intense oneonone 
relationship between a person in the congregation and a new convert 
new church members are taught to submit to their discipler 
in personal as well as spiritual matters to learn the ways of the 
church 
members have been barred from proselytizing on the campuses of 
boston university and northeastern university in boston because 
students complained they were being harangued to join bible study 
groups 
in nashville tenn the president of the church of 
christaffiliated david lipscomb university last week denounced a 
newly founded boston church of christ offshoot in nashville 
harold hazelip the schools president warned students not to 
join the new ministry which he likened to a mindcontrolling cult 
after church members began circulating pamphlets on the lipscomb 
campus 
baird denies that the church seeks to control minds and 
compares the discipling process to an internship or a

tell you what to do baird said obviously no one has to do

protest mushroomed thursday against 
austerity measures imposed by new president rodrigo borja to 
correct what he called economic chaos caused by the previous 
government 
bus and taxi drivers in the capital of quito halted work 
forcing thousands to walk to their jobs and ecuadors most 
powerful labor federation threatened a general strike 
borja a moderate leftist who took office aug 10 put an 
economic emergency package into effect wednesday doubling the 
price of gasoline devaluing currency 355 percent and tightening 
exchange controls 
he said harsh measures were required because former president 
leon febres cordero a controversial conservative tried to 
sabotage the new government by lying about key economic statistics 
and purposely running up a huge deficit 
the government also announced an increase in the minimum monthly 
wage of 42 but leftist labor leaders rejected it and demanded an 
increase to 77 
these measures are a hard strike against the poor they are 
criminal said edgar ponce spokesman for the communistled 
united front of laborers said of the austerity program 
ponce said directors of the federation may set a date next week 
for a general strike during his fouryear term febres cordero 
faced seven nationwide strikes which affected the majority of 
ecuadors work force of more than three million 
febres cordero a political enemy of borja has denied 
attempting to derail the new government borja won the presidency 
in may defeating populist candidate abdala bucaram cordero was 
not eligible to run for reelection 
febres cordero said on leaving office that the 1986 collapse of 
world prices for oil ecuadors principal export and a devastating 
earthquake a year later pitched the nation into the crisis of the 
century 
borja said the previous government spurred inflation expected 
to hit 60 percent this year compared to 327 percent in 1987 by 
deliberately running a spending deficit of 16 percent he said 
accurate figures on the growing 11 billion foreign debt and 
declining dollar reserves were deliberately withheld 
with an emergency economic program we hope to bring these 
grave disorders under control within 12 months borja said in an 
official communique 
the devaluation affects the official exchange rate which went 
from 250 sucres to 390 sucres to the dollar

republican nominee george bush showered michael 
dukakis with scorn in the governors polluted home port thursday 
accusing his democratic rival of hiding his secret record of 
antienvironmental actions 
on a ferry tour of boston harbor which has become a major 
environmental embarassment to massachusetts bush noted that this 
was where american revolutionaries dumped tea to protest british 
taxes 
if tea were spilled in the boston harbor today it would 
dissolve in the residue of my opponents neglect and delay bush 
said aboard his chartered ferry which was followed by a handful of 
boats carrying chanting dukakis supporters 
bush exclaimed fantastic when he was shown a copy of the 
boston herald reporting the results of a new poll under a banner 
headline reading shocker bush ties mike in mass the vice 
president said he couldnt believe it 
during the day bush harshly accused dukakis of trying to avoid 
ridding the harbor of sludge and sewage the state is now beginning 
its cleanup program under a federal court order 
bush said voters should know that the reason the boston harbor 
is not cleaner today is that the dukakis administration twice 
sought to avoid making it cleaner he said half a billion gallons 
of barely treated sewage enter the harbor every day 
the environmental protection agency confirmed boston releases 
500 million gallons of sewage every day 
my opponents solution delay fight anything but clean up 
well i dont call that leadership and i certainly dont call that 
competence bush said invoking dukakis frequent argument that 
competence is what voters want in the 1988 election 
bush said that in 1978 and in 1984 dukakis as governor sought a 
waiver of a federal clean water act provision requiring secondary 
treatment by all publicly owned treatment facilities 
while dukakis prepared the waiver request in 1978 it was his 
successor gov edward j king who made the first request in 1979 
douglas foy an attorney for the conservation law foundation 
which sued dukakis as governor in 1983 to clean up the harbor said 
it was the environmental protection agency that took no action on 
the waiver request for three years 
bush brushed aside a question about an epa delay under the 
reagan administration of which he was part he said he was focusing 
on what he would do as president and on dukakis record 
the stealth candidate is at it again making promises on one 
hand but hiding his secret record on the other bush said 
he said dukakis had visited the wastestrewn beaches of new 
jersey and promised to end pollution there what he didnt tell 
them is this bush said the dukakis adminsitration had applied 
in 1985 for a permit to dump massachusetts sewage sludge off the 
coast of new jersey 
massachusets asked the epa in 1985 for temporary permission to 
dump at a site 106 miles offshore where new york and new jersey 
already were dumping a compromise arrangement allowed 
massachusetts to dump further out beyond the continental shelf 
bush pressing his effort to attract environmentminded voters 
campaigned later thursday at the maritime center in norwalk conn 
where people are concerned about pollution of long island sound 
when it comes to preserving and protecting the environment 
bush told an audience at the center i do consider myself a teddy 
roosevelt republican we are not going to give away this 
constituency to the democrats 
standing on the deck of the ferry boat as it passed deer island 
the future site of a sewage treatment plant near the mouth of boson 
harbor the vice president urged a ban on ocean dumping of sewage 
sludge after 1991 
he also called for more intensive coast guard efforts with the 
help of the fbi to apprehend violators 
bobbing in the wake of bushs ferry were several boats carrying 
protesters waving produkakis campaign signs 
one motorized raft carried a banner that read bush loves 
toxic h2o a sailboat had one reading bush loves noriega a 
reference to panamas military leader gen manuel noriega who has 
been implicated in drug trafficking 
on a larger boat about 20 dukakis suppoters chanted where was 
george the democrats favorite rallying cry since their 
nominating convention in atlanta in july 
bush laughed and waved at the demonstrators and called them 
pathetic 
out of respect for my office there ought to be more than 
that he said

the pay and benefits gap between workers in 
declining industries such as steel and mining and growth businesses 
like restaurants and health services has widened to more than 
10000 a year in the 1980s a study prepared for the joint 
economic committee of congress said thursday 
although such a shift in employment patterns has been occurring 
since the end of world war ii its acceleration this decade has 
created an unprecedented drag on pay growth said the report 
prepared by university of massachusetts economist robert costrell 
in the 1950s pay and benefits for workers in expanding 
industries averaged 6133 a year below those in contracting 
businesses as measured in 1987 dollars the gap narrowed to 647 a 
year in the 1960s widening slightly to 811 in the 1970s the 
report said 
but this decade it has increased more than tenfold 
in the 198187 period during the reagan administration jobs in 
expanding sectors of the economy paid an average of 21983 a year 
19154 in wages plus 2829 in health pension and other 
benefits including employer contributions to social security the 
report said 
however that is 10404 a year below the average compensation 
of workers in retreating industries where the average wage was 
26193 plus 6194 in benefits or a total of 32387 
only part of the gap is due to difference in hourly wage rates 
about 308 according to the report 
another factor is that the jobs in manufacturing and other 
retreating industries usually offered overtime opportunities with 
an average workweek of 404 hours jobs in the expanding areas of 
the economy had an average workweek of only 327 hours the report 
said 
the committees chairman sen paul s sarbanes dmd said the 
study reflects serious setbacks experienced by exporting and 
importcompeting industries in a prolonged period of policy 
indifference 
republicans were quick to criticize the report with sen 
william roth rdel calling it creative economic analysis 101 
it should come as no surprise that in this election season 
the author of this study is from massachusetts the home state of 
the liberals favorite presidential candidate democratic gov 
michael dukakis roth said 
by concentrating on 198187 mr costrell includes the 
recession year of 1982 during which unemployment rose dramatically 
but excludes the gains in employment made thus far in 1988 
costrell acknowledged that the report does not include data from 
this year with its strong rebound in manufacturing employment 
but he said he found two turning points in labor market shifts 
in the past 1973 when energy prices jumped and 1981 when us 
trade deficits began emerging and energy prices started falling 
reversing the pattern of the 1970s 
its possible that analysis of this sort a few years hence 
will discern another turning point around 1987 if recent trade 
gains continue and energy prices start rising again costrell 
said 
he said the effect of jobs shifting more rapidly from 
higherpaying to lowerpaying industries this decade has retarded 
the recovery of real wage growth from the slowdown of the 70s 
after adjustments for inflation the average real compensation 
of workers this decade has grown about onehalf percent or an 
average 126 annually still ahead of increases averaging less than 
100 a year in the 1970s but it would have grown a full percentage 
point or about 239 per year had there been no shift in employment 
the report said 
much of this shift effect may represent the losses of the 
younger generation who are unable to enter or move up to the jobs 
of their retiring parents costrell said 
not all of the shifts have been negative for example the 
report noted that the lowpaying apparel and textile industry and 
private household services contracted sharply this decade while 
financial brokerage firms with highpaying jobs expanded rapidly 
at least up until the stock market crash last october

the fifth and final test of seals and 
joints on the redesigned space shuttle booster rocket went smoothly 
thursday according to engineers at the marshall space flight 
center 
based on all appearances the test was a complete success 
said jim thomas technical assistant to the manager of the solid 
rocket motor project 
the twominute static test firing with the booster segment 
anchored in a 25 million test stand put launchstyle pressure on 
joints redesigned after the challenger disaster 
this fifth test increases our confidence level and improves 
our engineering understanding of the redesigned joints thomas 
said i believe the test data will show that we have a 
reproducible and reliable design 
the seals are designed to keep internal hot gases inside the 
twin rockets that help kick shuttles into orbit 
the failure of a joint in one of challengers two boosters was 
blamed for the jan 28 1986 explosion that killed all seven crew 
members 
the national aeronautics and space administration hopes to 
launch the space shuttle discovery from the kennedy space center in 
florida by the last week of september marshall is responsible for 
shuttle propulsion systems including the booster rockets 
thursdays test was the fifth time marshall engineers have 
pressurized and then examined the new joints the four previous 
tests all have shown the new designs properly seal joints even when 
damaged 
weve done four other tests and thats all that was in the 
program said marshall spokesman jim solley but we had time to 
do one more and wanted to get all the additional data we could 
the 548000pound booster segment was fired for sixtenths of a 
second and then pressurized for 120 seconds

george bush venturing into michael dukakiss backyard accused 
his opponent thursday of fighting efforts to clean up dirty boston 
harbor dukakis attacked his rivals claims on education and asked 
where was george when school programs were being cut 
he was playing hooky dukakis said answering his own 
question 
the presidential candidates campaigned on opposite ends of the 
country each trying to take the offensive and demonstrate that 
their fall campaign is near full swing well before the traditional 
labor day kickoff 
a day after declaring himself to be a lifelong 
environmentalist the republican nominee traveled to massachusetts 
and took a boat tour of the harbor an event aimed at making its 
pollution problems an embarrassment for the governor 
the vice president was encouraged by a new poll showing his race 
with dukakis deadlocked even in dukakis home state where he has 
won three terms as governor 
two hundred years ago tea was spilled in the boston harbor in 
the name of liberty bush said if tea were spilled in the 
boston harbor today it would dissolve in the residue of my 
opponents neglect and delay 
dukakis ridiculing bushs claims to be an environmentalist 
said bush was one of the charter members of the environmental 
wrecking crew of the reagan administration 
he also charged bush had told california voters he opposed 
offshore oil drilling while telling texas audiences he supported 
it dukakis said his environmental policy doesnt change with the 
time zones 
bushs running mate sen dan quayle was on a weeklong trip 
through the south in little rock ark he said that despite his 
wealth i identify with people that need help 
democratic vice presidential nominee lloyd bentsen was on 
vacation in wyoming 
in boston bush contended that as governor dukakis opposed and 
delayed cleaning up the harbor and had sought permission from the 
environmental protection agency to delay a ban on dumping wastes in 
the harbor 
dukakis drafted papers seeking the delay in his first term but 
it was his successor ed king who actually filed the request in 
1979 
bush said that in 1978 and in 1984 with dukakis as governor 
massachusetts sought federal waivers for meeting secondary sewage 
treatment standards 
he did not want to meet the clean water requirements bush 
said 
dukakis campaigned at an oakland public school gathering and 
linked the vice president to education program cuts during the 
reagan administration he ridiculed bushs vow to be the 
education president as an electionyear strategy 
he said the reagan administration eliminated remedial math and 
reading programs for 500000 poor children cut college loans and 
grant programs and lectured teachers while cutting teacher 
retraining programs 
where was george while all this was going on dukakis said 
where was the man who now says he wants to be the education 
president he was playing hooky he was nowhere to be found 
dukakis also attacked bush on another front the vice 
presidents proposal for a cut in the capital gains tax which he 
said would cost the country 40 billion in revenues over five years 
he said those making over 200000 a year could gain 30000 
from the cut more than the average california teacher makes in a 
year enough to allow some families to send their children to 
college in style 
dukakis faced embarrassing poll results in his home state 
including a survey conducted for the boston herald that found 
dukakis and bush tied in the state at 42 percent each the poll of 
400 likely voters conducted wednesday had a 5point margin of error 
a poll for the herald in july found dukakis leading by 14 
percentage points 
asked by reporters in california if he was was worried about 
carrying his home state dukakis responded no 
dayton duncan the democratic nominees press secretary said 
the campaign was confident that dukakis will win massachusetts and 
added were also confident he will carry george bushs other 
home states maine texas washington dc and any others he 
claims 
the debate over presidential debates remained unresolved as 
campaign managers for the two candidates failed to agree on the 
number of facetoface encounters bush campaign manager james a 
baker iii is seeking two debates while dukakis manager paul 
brountas has asked for three debates 
the only agreement between brountas and baker came on plans for 
the two sides to talk to each other again by telephone on tuesday 
democrat jesse jackson and some of his advisers on thursday 
tended to dismiss reports of tensions between his organization and 
the dukakis campaign 
interviewed on nbcs today program jackson said i have no 
knowledge of a list of states the dukakis campaign reportedly 
wants jackson to avoid while campaigning on behalf of the 
democratic ticket but he said such a list would not be a good 
thing 
after a meeting in atlanta with 70 party officials and campaign 
workers jackson said i will campaign for voter registration and 
voter turnout in every state that i can get to 
in some instances well speak directly for as a surrogate 
for the ticket jackson said while elsewhere he will represent 
the democratic party or his own rainbow coalition wing of the 
party 
i would hate to wake up on the morning of nov 9 the day 
after the election and hate to think that we lost by the lack of 
my work he said 
there are always problems during a campaign but i havent 
seen any evidence that a great divisiveness exists said jackson 
adviser bert lance former white house budget director under 
president carter

china and the soviet union ended five days of 
talks on the cambodian conflict friday but fell short of resolving 
their differences the official xinhua news agency reported 
the meeting marked the first time china the chief backer of 
antivietnam resistance forces in cambodia and the soviet union 
the main supporter of vietnam have met specifically to discuss how 
to bring an end to the 9yearold conflict 
the meeting also has been seen as a crucial step in normalizing 
longstrained relations between beijing and moscow and paving the 
way for the first chinesesoviet summit in 29 years 
on thursday chinas foreign ministry spokesman jin guihua said 
the two sides stood for a fair and reasonable settlement to the 
kampuchean cambodian question by political means and expressed 
their willingness to do their best to promote the attainment of 
this goal 
the meeting also shows that the two sides find common ground 
as well as differences he said 
soviet deputy foreign minister igor rogachev and chinas deputy 
foreign minister tian zengpei headed the delegations 
soviet officials were not immediately available for comment on 
the talks 
the brief xinhua dispatch said little except to quote tian as 
saying the two sides had conducted candid discussions done 
useful work and found some common points during their working 
meeting 
jin speaking at a weekly briefing would not provide details of 
the talks or the remaining differences 
but he said the talks focused on how to urge vietnam to pull 
its troops out of kampuchea as soon as possible 
jin said the meeting enhanced mutual understanding and was 
beneficial and we hope the meeting can be conducive to the 
improvement of the relations between the two countries but he 
would not say whether it had improved the possibility for a 
chinesesoviet summit 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachev has called for a summit to end 
nearly three decades of enmity between the two countries but china 
insists that the soviet union must first persuade vietnam to leave 
cambodia 
one sign that sharp differences remain on the cambodian question 
was a strongly worded commentary by xinhua which blasted vietnam 
for stepping up the vietnamization of cambodia and trying to 
create a puppet government in phnom penh 
the commentary appearing in major dailies thursday charged 
that vietnam which has pledged to withdraw 50000 troops this 
year has put tens of thousands of its troops in the uniform of 
the puppet forces of the hanoibacked hun sen government in phnom 
penh 
it said the phnom penh regimes troops have expanded to 
70000 men within a year and the militia has grown to tens of 
thousands surpassing the total number of the three kampuchean 
resistance forces 
the news agency claimed that vietnam has installed trusted 
followers in the hun sen leadership and that there are now at 
least 700000 vietnamese migrants in cambodia 
it repeated that china understands concerns that the 
beijingbacked khmer rouge the most powerful resistance force 
will return to power but insisted that hun sens domination of a 
future government is a more acute danger 
the khmer rouge between 1975 and 1978 killed hundreds of 
thousands of people in an attempt to return cambodia to a totally 
agrarian society vietnam has linked its withdrawal to assurances 
the khmer rouge will not be able to return to power 
china says vietnams withdrawal must come first and supports a 
fourparty coalition headed by resistance leader prince norodom 
sihanouk and including the hun sen forces the khmer rouge 
sihanouks group and a third resistance faction

sen dan quayle saying im still 
ticking toured a timex plant thursday courting the bluecollar 
vote and found himself defending his record on controversial 
plantclosing legislation 
in a day scheduled mostly as a series of photo opportunities 
the republican vice presidential nominee shook hands with workers 
at the watch plant toured a day care center at a childrens 
hospital and then traveled to mississippi to watch a highschool 
football practice 
at a news conference here quayle was asked about his opposition 
to the plantclosing bill which requires manufacturers with 100 or 
more employees to give worker 60 days notice before shutting the 
facility quayle was a leading senate opponent of the legislation 
which was supported by a substantial portion of the public 
according to polls 
they should give notice quayle said it ought to be much 
more than 60 days 
but quayle said he favored a voluntary plan that would have 
offered employers incentives to participate as a matter of 
principle however he said companies should go along with such a 
program 
any ceo chief executive officer that doesnt give notice 
should be fired on the spot quayle said 
the plantclosing legislation was cited by president reagan as 
the reason he vetoed a sweeping trade bill earlier this year the 
plant provision was then passed as a separate piece of legislation 
that reagan allowed to become law without his signature 
quayle said a legislative compromise that would have allowed 
more flexibility in the bill had been agreed on by the principal 
drafters of the bill including sen lloyd bentsen quayles 
democratic counterpart but the compromise fell apart at the last 
minute quayle said suggesting that bentsen was a major reason 
he was part of it quayle said 
quayle said he was not concerned about people who say he is not 
qualified to be president if the situation arose 
we still have a long time in this campaign by election day 
there will be no doubt 
quayle toured a timex plant where he joked timex takes a 
lickin but keeps on ticking i know what john cameron swayze 
meant 
im still ticking im going to continue to talk about the 
issues it is an upbeat campaign quayle said 
quayle also toured the employee day care center at arkansas 
childrens hospital where he made made a pitch for george bushs 
approach to day care giving parents tax credits for day care but 
without imposing stringent federal regulations on how day care 
programs should be conducted 
we dont need a massive federal bureaucracy to come in and 
tell us how to run our day care he said 
quayle was also asked about a forthcoming article in the new 
republic which said that a public relations firm run by quayles 
campaign manager stuart spencer was paid 350000 in 198485 to 
lobbyist for panamanian ruler manuel antonio noriega 
according to advance copies of the article the firm lobbied 
against drug investigations of noriega and defended him against 
allegations of killing former president dr hugo spadafora in 
september 1985 
quayle said he did not know about the specifics of the 
story he said he only met the longtime republican strategist when 
spencer came in to handle his campaign after work in both reagan 
presidential campaigns 
from my observation stuart spencer is a political pro 
quayle said

president miguel de la madrids final report 
to the mexican congress was interrupted thursday by opposition 
shouts of fraud demonstrations in protest of the july 
elections and a tumultuous opposition walkout 
the raucous scene which included physical attacks on one 
opposition leader was unprecedented in the history of the congress 
in his 3hour speech de la madrid sought to sum up a sixyear 
administration that inherited massive economic problems and a 
corrupt political system he said it was a time of necessary 
sacrifice that hurt mexicans but that his reforms prepared mexico 
for the 21st century 
de la madrid spoke to a breakdown of congressmen such as no 
mexican president has faced in the 60 years the institutional 
revolutionary party pri has held power one where the opposition 
has nearly half the seats even so the opposition claims the pri 
maintained its grip only through massive cheating 
near the end of the speech sen porfirio munoz ledo led a 
walkout by leftist democratic front delegates amid cries of 
traitor and get out judas from pri delegates munoz 
ledo who was once head of the pri was kicked in the back and hit 
in the neck as he left 
we are walking out in protest because they refused to let the 
voice of the oppositon be heard he said afterwards de la 
madrids speech was full of falsehoods and inaccuracies he 
said 
earlier in the speech de la madrid was interrupted for at least 
five minutes by delegates chanting fraud fraud delegates of 
the rightist national action party held up remains of what they 
said were partly burned and void ballots 
pri deputies tried to shout down the opposition clapping and 
chanting mexico mexico 
national action members did not walk out but leader abel 
vincenio tovar said the ruling party had packed the gallery he 
said spectators included a large military contingent 
when the ruling party doesnt have the backing of the peopl 
they have to bring their own supporters he said 
after the walkout de la madrid departed from his text to call 
for tolerance even in the face of insults by our political 
adversaries 
a presidential aide who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
protests might be new but were normal in any parliamentary 
system and manuel camacho solis general secretary of the pri 
praised what he viewed as de la madrids coolness under fire 
we condemn the intentions and tyrannies of the small group 
that wanted to impose its antidemocratic practices on the 
majority camacho solis said in a statement 
there were also interruptions as de la madrid spoke of his 
economic policy which reduced government control of the economy 
encouraged domestic and foreign investment and sharply reduced 
inflation 
but mexicans paid the price with a drastic reduction in buying 
power and lifestyle as petroleum prices and the mexican currency 
collapsed 
the austerity was needed de la madrid said becase we had to 
face and accept the fact that we would have to live within our 
means 
the crisis we have lived through shook the very foundations of 
our social structure de la madrid said it is was though we 
had run the rapids in the current of history it was rough but we 
also made considerable progress 
the new congress was the result of the political reforms 
sponsored by de la madrid and he lashed out at opposition parties 
that have criticized the electoral process and accused his 
administration of abetting electoral fraud 
political pluralism is a vital sign of democracy he said 
and should never be a symptom of a divided or splintered nation 
negotiations between the pri and the opposition had made it 
possible only two days ago to install the new congress in time for 
the de la madrids sixth and final state of the nation message the 
pri holds 260 seats in the chamber of deputies to 139 for the 
leftist democratic front and 101 for the rightist national action 
party 
the pris stranglehold on power has been so strong that until 
this year no opposition candidate had ever been elected to the 
senate now four of 64 senators belong to the leftist opposition 
the same fractious congress must in the next two months 
certify the election of de la madrids chosen successor carlos 
salinas de gortari 
salinas the pri candidate won barely more than 50 percent of 
the popular vote cuauhtemoc cardenas the democratic front 
candidate took 31 percent in the official count but claims he was 
the actual winner 
on other matters de la madrid said mexico will continue its 
fight against drug trafficking and in a clear reference to the 
united states added we hope that everyone is doing their 
part mexico he said cannot fight drugs successfully unless 
the demand for drugs is combated in major centers of consumption 
de la madrid said the problem of mexicos foreign debt now at 
104 billion has not been resolved despite renegotiation and 
the sale of mexican government bonds 
in a preview of what is expected to be salinas policy de la 
madrid said mexico must insist on greater joint responsibility 
and understanding on the part of the creditors in order to achieve 
a solution to the problem they helped to foster 
statecontrolled mexican television broadcast the entire speech 
illustrating passages with videotape it at first showed protests 
but no walkout but the walkout itself was broadcast on later

one day after delta flight 1141 crashed 
on takeoff the pilot of another boeing 727 beginning the same 
flight to salt lake city aborted takeoff because of an apparent 
minor stall officials said 
passengers including six who had been among the survivors of 
wednesdays crash were stunned when the captain brought the jet to 
a halt and taxied it back to the terminal 
we figured this would be the safest flight we could ever take 
today said passenger louise cox of baton rouge la as she 
waited to board another 727 for salt lake city evidently not 
in portland ore the pilot of a delta lockheed l1011 aborted 
takeoff thursday at portland international airport after a faulty 
cockpit warning light indicated an engine was overheating an 
airline spokesman said 
the texas flight scheduled to depart at 831 am finally left 
dallasfort worth international airport more than two hours late 
the replacement plane landed at salt lake city without incident 
delta spokesman bill berry said the type of problem that 
apparently occurred thursday would not have necesssarily forced a 
pilot to abort the takeoff 
the pilot whose name was not released was probably being extra 
cautious because of the crash wednesday that claimed 13 lives 
berry said nealy 100 other passengers and crew members survived 
speaking from deltas atlanta headquarters berry said the pilot 
believed his problem stemmed from what is called a compressor 
stall there was a crosswind blowing across the runway that can 
interrupt the smoothness of the airflow that goes into the engine 
creating a temporary loss of power 
delta maintenance crews were unable to find anything wrong with 
the aircraft berry said 
thursdays flight carried 102 passengers plus a crew of seven 
according to delta spokesman henry conley in dallas conley said 
that to his knowledge all on board the aborted flight got on the 
replacement plane 
shaken passengers waiting to board that plane described their 
experience 
it was a routine takeoff until we got almost to the end of the 
runway said assistant us attorney don burkhalter of jackson 
miss then we heard what sounded like bumps and the pilot 
decelerated he said there was a problem with the compressors 
the captain said and this is a quote its just one of those 
things we just laughed but it was nervous laughter said 
burkhalter who was on his way to california with his wife 
waiting to board thursdays flight before it was aborted a 
survivor of wednesdays crash talked of the difficulty of getting 
on flight 1141 a day after it ended in tragedy 
its pretty hard said ronald black 30 of west monroe la 
youve got to do it sometime cant live in dallas he said he 
opted to continue his trip west because ive either got to go 
home or go hunting ive got to fly either way so i might as well 
go hunting 
berry said that when the pilot decided to stop the takeoff as 
the plane rolled down the runway the plane had speeded up to 
roughly 25 mph which is extremely slow 
the airplanes get up to 100 knots 115 mph before they become 
airborne he said he did not get the proper readings from one 
of his engines he decided to go back to the gate 
ordinarily a pilot dealing with such a minor stall would 
simply increase thrust to see if everything continued to perform 
right berry said but based on the incident that happened 
yesterday the captain was extremely cautious and elected simply to 
come back to the gate and let maintenance look at the engine 
he emphasized that pilots have got to go by their years of 
experience and can abort flights if they dont like what they 
feel if theyve just got a gut feeling 
the delta jet in portland ore never left the runway and 
braked to a stop there were no injuries among the 190 passengers 
and crew on board said david zielke deltas portland district 
marketing manager 
mechanics in portland inspected the l1011s engines and 
determined they had not overheated and that the warning light was 
faulty flight 51 originated in atlanta and was en route to tokyo 
also thursday in orlando fla an eastern airlines boeing 727 
en route to philadelphia turned back shortly after takeoff when the 
pilot felt vibration from an open cargo door an airline spokesman 
said 
flight 832 with 101 passengers and a crew of seven returned 
safely to orlando international airport said eastern spokesman 
george owen in miami no one was injured and no luggage was lost

nobel prizewinning physicist luis w 
alvarez a brilliant and wideranging scientist who helped develop 
the atomic bomb and a theory that asteroids wiped out the 
dinosaurs has died at the age of 77 
alvarez who was awarded the nobel prize in physics in 1968 for 
his development of the liquidhydrogen bubble chamber and for the 
numerous elementary particles his team discovered using the device 
died late wednesday at his berkeley home 
lawrence berkeley laboratory spokeswoman mary barberia quoted 
alvarezs wife janet as saying her husbands health had declined 
since he underwent surgery for a benign brain tumor last fall and 
that he died from complications of a series of operations to treat 
cancer of the esophagus 
alvarez who did much of his research at lawrence berkeley 
laboratory but also was on the university of california at berkeley 
faculty was noted not only for physics but for his work in the 
fields of archaeology paleontology and astronomy 
during world war ii he was credited with inventing a number of 
radar systems and an effective bomb sight he also played a 
significant role in developing the atomic bomb during the manhattan 
project invented several types of atom smashers and did a personal 
analysis of evidence in the 1963 assassination of president john f 
kennedy 
but in the last decade he was catapulted into headlines by the 
dinosaur extinction theory he developed with his son berkeley 
geologist walter s alvarez and lawrence berkeley chemists frank 
asaro and helen michel 
they argued that asteroids or comets struck the earth 65 million 
years ago kicking up dust and smoke that blocked enough sunlight 
to sharply lower surface temperatures destroying food plants to 
spur mass extinction of dinosaurs and many other species 
the theory triggered rancorous debate that continues today and 
relates to a theory that nuclear warfare would create enough smoke 
to plunge earth into a cold dark nuclear winter that would 
wipe out survivors of the nuclear exchange 
while geologists and astronomers tend to support the dinosaur 
extinction theory biologists and fossil experts usually argue that 
gradual climate change caused the mass extinction others argue 
huge volcanic eruptions were responsible or that asteroids caused 
the mass extinction not by blocking sunlight but by triggering 
intense acid rain or extreme global warming 
university of california president david p gardner said he was 
personally saddened as is the entire university of california 
community by the death of professor alvarez 
a creative and energetic scientist he not only brought 
recognition and honor to the university by receiving a nobel prize 
but he also personally embodied the best of those qualities that 
defined his chosen profession concern for the student commitment 
to meaningful and distinctive research and devotion to the 
betterment of society gardner said he will be missed 
alvarez born in san francisco was the son of walter c 
alvarez a noted physician and medical columnist at minnesotas 
mayo clinic 
as an undergraduate at the university of chicago alvarez built 
one of the first geiger counters in the united states which he 
used as a graduate student to discover the eastwest effect in 
cosmic rays and prove that radiation from space consists mostly of 
protons 
in 1936 he began his work in berkeley among his discoveries 
were electron capture by nuclei the radioactivity of tritium and 
the magnetic moment of the neutron 
he gained public notice for several applications of physics to 
popular subjects he xrayed an egyptian pyramid in search of 
hidden chambers only to find there were none he developed 
evidence regarding the assassination of president kennedy which 
supported the findings of the warren commission that lee harvey 
oswald was the lone assassin 
in addition to his wife alvarez is survived by two sons two 
daughters two sisters and a brother 
arrangements for a memorial service were pending

of leftists including some of his fiercest marxist critics

un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
left the deadlocked iraniraq peace talks thursday and put a 
swedish diplomat in charge while the two belligerents accused each 
other of violating the ceasefire 
iran accused iraq of taking more than 750 iranian troops 
prisoner in attacks since the unsponsored ceasefire began aug 
20 the iraqi government said iran continued setting up observation 
posts and bunkers moving troops close to the border and launching 
gunboats into the disputed shattalarab waterway 
un observers monitoring the truce have not reported any 
serious violations by either side only minor problems that 
were resolved 
jan eliasson swedens un ambassador arrived in the swiss 
city from new york to continue perez de cuellars work of seeking a 
permanent peace after eight years of war that cost up to 1 million 
lives 
perez de cuellar introduced eliasson to the iranian and iraqi 
foreign ministers in separate meetings before departing for other 
un duties in lisbon he said he could return when necessary 
peace talks started eight days ago but have been stalled for six 
days over troop withdrawal navigation rights and the shattalarab 
waterway which forms the southern border between the two nations 
and is iraqs only outlet to the sea 
foreign ministers ali akbar velayati of iran and tariq aziz of 
iraq have not met directly since their last formal session aug 26 
the day after the talks began negotiations have continued at a 
lower level 
we are working at the experts level not the level of 
ministers perez de cuellar said thursday we hope to 
accelerate the pace as much as possible but at the moment we are 
honest brokers we cannot impose anything on the parties 
the main problem is lack of confidence he told reporters as 
he turned over responsibility to eliasson it is impossible to 
deal on the basis of distrust it is sand and you cannot build on 
sand 
eliasson 47 assumed the ambassadors post in march he is an 
expert on the iraniraq war and made 12 trips to the persian gulf 
as part of swedens earlier efforts to help the united nations find 
a settlement 
at the news conference he said the gulf of distrust has 
been very wide and we hope it will be becoming a little bit 
smaller 
the secretarygeneral said eliason would try to arrange a 
meeting of the foreign ministers but added it is a very 
difficult complicated negotiation and it needs time 
when talks began aug 25 five days after the ceasefire perez 
de cuellar wanted to announce timetables for troop withdrawal 
prisoner exchange and the work of a commission to determine which 
side started the war 
stalemate came the next day however and he has been unable to 
break it 
perez de cuellar said thursday he believes both sides honestly 
are interested in finding a solution to the problem but it takes 
time for the parties to see which way they can achieve with 
assistance of the un a compromise 
he described the two direct meetings as very helpful because 
each side officially listened to the other they spoke through 
translators and the secretarygeneral however not directly to 
each other 
a threepoint un compromise would guarantee free navigation 
for both nations in the persian gulf withdrawal to internationally 
recognized borders and an impartial study of conflicting positions 
on the shattalarab 
international pressure appears to be building on iraq to accept 
early troop withdrawal 
the five permanent members of the un security council the 
united states soviet union britain china and france support 
the secretarygeneral and their representatives met with president 
saddam hussein of iraq on wednesday 
iraq insists on freedom of navigation and wants iran to stop 
searching vessels bound for its ports it also wants the un to 
have the shattalarab dredged before a troop withdrawal 
a 1975 treaty between iraq and iran draws the border down the 
middle of the waterway but the iraqis says the agreement was 
invalidated by the 1979 revolution that overthrew the late shah 
mohammad reza pahlavi iraq now claims the entire waterway 
iran says the first item of business is withdrawal by iraq from 
territory it captured in offensives just before the ceasefire 
with clearing of the shatt and other issues to be discussed 
afterward 
in south yemens port of aden the first iraqi tanker to sail 
through the the persian gulf and the strait of hormuz since the 
ceasefire docked with 17000 tons of iraqi crude oil south 
yemens official news agency reported thursday 
the ain zalah which arrived wednesday set sail from the 
southern iraqi port of basra on aug 20 the day the ceasefire 
went into effect and took 11 days to reach aden the agency said

books by former soviet officials who fell afoul of 
josef stalin went on public display thursday after decades of being 
banned from library shelves an official report said 
however other books including some of zionist or 
antisemitic content others promoting national strife and 
pornography remained offlimits to the general reading public a 
government official said 
a total of 800 books were exhibited at the lenin library the 
nations leading library including works by victims of the late 
dictator stalins political purges generals who fought against the 
establishment of soviet power and members of the provisional 
government overthrown by the bolsheviks in 1917 october revolution 
according to the official news agency tass 
tass said the books had been out of the reach of general 
readers for decades it said they were being transferred from the 
librarys restrictedaccess stocks to general use where they would 
be accessible to the general public 
that move was another example of the increased tolerance 
fostered by soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs campaign for 
glasnost or greater openness the drive has also brought about 
judicial rehabilitation of stalin foes like bukharin and kamenev 
who were convicted of spying in the 1930s and killed as enemies 
of the people their books were among those on display 
last year a commission was created to determine which banned 
books should be transferred to public use in soviet libraries its 
head vladimir solodin is an official of the government agency 
glavlit which is charged with screening the press to prevent the 
publication of state secrets it has acted in the past as chief 
government censor 
tass quoted solodin as saying the review commission would 
conclude its work in october and that about 500 books would 
remain in the restrictedaccess library stocks down from 10000 
before 
the books remaining there are first of all those of 
antisemitic and zionist content solodin said there are other 
books which propagandize national strife as well as pornographic 
editions 
he gave no titles or other details 
in addition solodin said all works by stalins archfoe leon 
trotsky that had been published in periodicals were now in 
openaccess stocks

aug 20 ceasefire in its 8yearold war with iran to intensify 
operations against the autonomyseeking kurds who sided with the 
iranians

miles of the turkish border the independent hurriyet news agency 
reported wednesday from the border province of hakkari 
there was no immediate report by the iraqi government 
ozal talking to reporters after a national security council

delta air lines policy of not counting infants 
on its passenger list and misinformation from the chaotic scene led 
to fluctuations in the number of people reported killed in 
wednesdays jet crash officials said 
at least one infant was among the 13 passengers who died when 
the delta 727 crashed shortly after takeoff from dallasfort worth 
airport ninetyfour passengers and crew members survived 
officials said 
the number of dead fluctuated throughout the day from seven to 
15 down to nine up to 11 and finally to 13 bill berry a delta 
spokesman in atlanta said one reason for the discrepancies was 
that officials werent sure how many children under 2 years might 
be on board 
an infant does not buy a ticket and if it does not buy a 
ticket so many times you are going to have a discrepancy in your 
manifest count berry said 
he said passengers dont normally notify ticket agents that they 
plan to take an infant on board since they are not required to pay 
theyll just show up with an infant knowing they dont have to 
buy a ticket berry said they dont have to identify that they 
have an infant with them 
at least three infants were on the jet wednesday he said one 
was among the dead but the condition of the others was not 
immediately known 
part of the problem wednesday berry said was that emergency 
personnel requested 15 body bags leading delta officials to give 
out an erroneous casualty figure later fluctuations happened 
because some victims died at hospitals 
as you well know in these types of situations the numbers 
often fluctuate until you can get various hospitals contacted

and the childs grandparents susie and howard keetso mrs pitts 
said 
under the agreement the tribe will retain jurisdiction until 
allyssa is 18 when she can petition for adoption pitts said 
as the pittses spoke to reporters watchman stepped outside 
briefly to shake pitts hand and wish the couple well 
but the ruling did not come before brief uncertainty over yet 
another possible delay 
the case pitted the navajo tribe against the keetsos who are 
tribal members and the pittses who initially had sought outright 
adoption of allyssa the keetsos supported that effort and 
subsequently the guardianship plan 
in april a california court transferred the pittses adoption 
petition to the tribal court in response to a tribal request to 
intervene the california judge said the tribe held jurisdiction in 
determining the childs custody under the indian child welfare act 
a law intended to slow the exodus of indian children to nonindian 
families 
during a hearing wednesday morning a tribal social worker 
initially sought an additional 90day delay requesting further 
information about the pitts finances and home life and raising 
questions about the childs heritage and culture and plans for 
visitation by other tribal family members said pitts 33 an 
independent contractor 
after testimony from pitts the request was withdrawn

efforts to protect airline passengers from 
rapidly spreading postcrash fires such as the one that swept 
through the delta air lines jet in texas remain stalled after more 
than a decade of frustrating research 
four years ago the federal aviation administration was on the 
verge of requiring airliners to use a special fuel additive which 
its supporters said would stop aircraft fuel vapors from igniting 
in a crash 
although the antimisting additive suppressed the spread of 
flames in repeated static tests a highly publicized test using a 
remotecontrolled boeing 720 in the california desert failed 
miserably in november 1984 as the deliberately crashed jet was 
engulfed in a ball of flames 
the failed test came only weeks before a regulation requiring 
the additive was to have been announced although the airlines had 
argued the additives value was questionable and there were 
indications it could interfere with engine performance

here on lake winnipeg just north of 
minnesota and north dakota a band of people fleeing natural 
disasters a little over 100 years ago founded one of historys 
leastknown republics 
it was called new iceland 
some 20500 descendants of those pioneers survive today as 
canadians living in manitoba and proudly forming the largest 
icelandic community outside the north atlantic island itself 
the community dates to 187375 when volcanic eruptions on 
iceland destroyed homes a plague killed the sheep summers were 
icy and the cod were dwindling 
boarding a boat for canada appeared the best solution and the 
result was the selfgoverning colony of new iceland that existed 
from 1875 to 1887 
one of the descendants is helgi tomasson 72 a ruddyface 
fisherman who has lived all his life on lake winnipegs hecla 
island 
the climate is the same as iceland or russia invigorating 
he said it tends to make vigorous people 
tomasson icefished for 20 years with only a dog team to pull 
the heavy crates of pickerel and whitefish back to shore then he 
bought a 1952 bombardier a tractorlike ice vehicle which hes 
managed to keep running despite winter temperatures that plunge to 
22 below zero fahrenheit 
its the same spirit of selfsufficiency that enabled his 
grandfather and 1500 other settlers to face smallpox and scarlet 
fever epidemics grasshopper plagues flooding and a religious rift 
in their first tumultuous years in new iceland 
the immigrants signaled their determination by naming their 
original settlement gimli a reference from norse mythology to the 
great hall of gimli where gods giants and the best of men meet 
following the end of the world 
only about 1000 of gimlis 2500 residents today are of 
icelandic heritage but they give the town its flavor through the 
99yearold islendingadagurinn festival their traditional cuisine 
such as smoked lamb flanks and vine terte prune cake and a museum 
that contains a log house from the old settlement 
gimli has a viking pharmacy viking motor lodge and viking 
travel agency the harbor is guarded by a 15foot statue of a 
viking wielding an ax 
summer tourists keep the original 1910 cash register busy at 
hp tergesen amp sons general store with its racks of icelandic 
sweaters and books 
our daughter is leaving to go to university in iceland to 
study icelandic culture and literature said lorna tergesen 
whose greatgrandparents were in the first party to reach new 
iceland on oct 21 1875 
tomasson speaks such fluent icelandic that he felt right at home 
on a visit to iceland with his wife helga in 1978 
they asked what part of iceland we were from and just about 
keeled over when i said i was thirdgeneration canadian said 
tomasson whose grandfather arrived here in 1876 
icelands ambassador to canada ingvi ingvarsson said his small 
nation takes pride in the cultural preservation of its former north 
american colony 
they speak really good icelandic although its a little bit 
archaic he said in a telephone interview noting that 
contemporary idioms are missing from the 19thcentury tongue 
icelandiccanadians still pass on to their children 
icelandic is no longer taught in local elementary schools but 
the university of manitoba in winnipeg has a department of 
icelandic language and literature and canadian icelanders continue 
to publish a newspaper and support cultural groups such as the 
icelandic canadian front 
this cohesiveness contrasts with the integration of later 
scandinavian and german immigrants and professor david arnason of 
the university of manitoba attributes the difference to the 
icelandic fascination with myth 
when we tell our epic stories they are stories located in the 
new land stories like the horrors of the smallpox epidemic when 
the bodies of children were stacked on the roofs of houses so that 
wolves would not get them he wrote in a recent article 
lord dufferin the british governor general of canada in the 
1870s offered volcanofleeing icelanders the virgin land about 42 
miles long and 11 miles wide beside lake winnipeg about 100 miles 
north of the us border 
cree indians probably saved the lives of early settlers by 
teaching the seafishing immigrants how to fish through thick ice 
with nets 
before joining canadas province of manitoba in 1887 new 
iceland had its own constitution which declared icelandic the 
official language preserved icelandic civil law and established an 
elaborate social welfare system only icelanders were allowed to 
settle in the region 
the immigrants often did without doctors or policemen but 
always built schools and began publishing a newspaper in a log 
cabin within two years of arrival 
they were great believers in education said tomasson 
they all brought a little chest with them containing their most 
precious books the bible the icelandic sagas prose and verse 
and educational books 
a split between strict lutherans and a more liberal faction that 
eventually became unitarian resulted in the early exodus of 
hundreds of settlers to north dakota and western canada but the 
towns along lake winnipeg have remained the center of icelandic 
culture 
only hecla island has seen a sharp decline in population from 
500 people half a century ago to four families now following the 
closing of island schools and the designation of hecla as a 
provincial park 
we used to put on our own socials with accordion bands and our 
own plays in icelandic recalled tomasson looking at the boarded 
up community hall and tworoom schoolhouse he attended as a boy 
we all spoke icelandic in those days

jerry lewis whos spent a lifetime 
making people laugh was deadly serious as he faced 250 local 
television personalities from cities across america key players 
in this years labor day telethon 
what probably put me in that hospital five years ago was 
saying goodbye to those little giants said lewis referring to 
his 1982 doublebypass heart surgery and the children whove been 
lost to muscular dystrophy in the 22 years he has been raising 
money through the telethons to fight the crippling disease 
the local tv hosts ranging from rookies to 20year veterans 
were gathered at caesars palace where final preparations were 
underway for the telethon this weekend they spent two days mapping 
strategy for what has become the telethon lewis annual effort 
for the muscular dystrophy association 
lewis the consumate showman understands the impact of the 
local tv hosts in his labor day entertainment extravaganza they 
orchestrate the 15minute local cutaways each hour on some 200 
stations dubbed by lewis his love network 
last years telethon raised a record 39021723 the annual tv 
events which began in 1966 and feature arrays of stars who 
participate at lewis behest have raised 443182370 
this years show is scheduled to run from 9 pm edt sunday 
until 630 pm monday 
your work has produced some tremendous inroads this year 
lewis told the local tv hosts 
this is my one shot at thanking you he said we are no 1 
because of your dedication this year our researchandpatientcare 
budget was over 100 million thanks to you 
he praised the hosts who have been with the telethon for as long 
as 20 years and he promised the firsttimers tis will be the 
first day of the rest of your life 
lewis guided the local tv hosts through an emotional threehour 
presentation of some poignant taped presentations for this years 
show and introduced several victims and their families who are 
subjects of the segments 
paul miller director of the show said his hope was that 
someday ill be able to say i directed the last jerry lewis 
telethon 
singer tony orlando one of the cohosts urged the local hosts 
to make 1988 one more year better than the last year so we can 
get closer to that final year 
one of the afternoons more dramatic moments came when the local 
hosts previewed a segment on singercomedian dennis day who died 
this summer of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis more commonly known 
as lou gehrigs disease als is one of 40 neuromuscular diseases 
fought by mda 
the video segment includes old blackandwhite footage of day as 
sidekick for the late jack benny as some of his songs play in the 
background day talks of his hope for beating the disease and two 
of his 10 children fight back tears as they recall the final months 
of their fathers life 
i could see it in his eyes said son tom mcnulty he was 
afraid i was afraid too afraid of losing him 
mcnulty then appeared in person before the local tv hosts 
i wish my dad could be here to celebrate this time he said 
i wish my dad was here to sing 
lewis wept at one point when susan and leonard destefano talked 
of losing their daughter at the age of 6 months 
its so hard he said hugging the parents what we dont 
plan on is the susan and leonard destefanos we ask of them an 
outrageous task to relive that pain 
united airlines executive bob sampson himself crippled by 
muscular dystrophy told the local hosts they hold the key to the 
success of the telethon he cried as he talked of two of his young 
grandchildren who died of neuromuscular disease 
they never had a chance they never had a chance sampson 
wept as many of the hosts dabbed at their eyes lets do this 
for them

it is a situation in which the fate of the haves 
and the havenots are so closely linked that what happens to the 
havenots might determine how comfortably the haves live 
it concerns the topheavy home real estate market one in which 
the future of highpriced housing is dependent on what happens at 
the lowest end of the scale where firsttime buyers generally 
enter the market 
firsttime buyers increasingly are denied access to the market 
by relatively high prices insufficient incomes and rising interest 
rates that push carrying charges beyond their financial abilities 
the link to the other end of the market is this in recent 
years the market for higherpriced housing has been made up mainly 
of existing homeowners using their equity to move upto more 
expensive homes 
that is the primary source of downpayment money for expensive 
homebuyers has been the equity accumulated in starter homes 
very few homebuyers have been able to accumulate downpayment 
money without having owned previously inevitably such buyers have 
been restricted at first to the least expensive starter homes 
those who have sought to accumulate downpayments through savings 
accounts or investments have been stymied by income taxes by home 
prices increasing faster than their incomes and by sometimes high 
costs of renting 
now along with higher interest rates that may make carrying 
costs unaffordable their problems with accumulating downpayments 
may be worsening 
a study of firsttime homebuyers conducted for the national 
association of realtors shows that housing affordability is now 
lower than it was 11 years ago firsttime buyers it said are 
losing ground 
the study found that in this years second quarter a typical 
family of renters had only 798 percent of the income needed to 
qualify for a conventional mortgage with 10 percent down on a 
medianpriced starter home 
in contrast the typical family in early 1977 had 889 percent 
of the necessary income 
the babyboom had a lot to do with the situation since it 
filled the market with an overflow of potential buyers and a 
relative scarcity of houses thus housing had its own inflation 
apart from general consumer inflation 
in 1977 the median price of an existing singlefamily home was 
42900 it was more than double that in 1987 the median price of 
a new singlefamily home was 48000 in 1977 it was about double 
that in 1987 
a big demand and a limited supply helped do that but 
supplydemand also affected the job market glenn crellin realtor 
economist observes that the growth in incomes of the babyboom 
generation has been held back to some extent by the same 
supplydemand phenomenon 
he explains there are lots of babyboomers but not as many 
mid and upperlevel jobs the result is that incomes have not 
increased as rapidly as previous generations have seen 
it poses this threat to housing prices if fewer buyers can 
afford starter homes which are the primary source of downpayments 
for more expensive homes in the future a prop will have been 
removed from the upper end of the market 
there may be an offset to the situation in the demographics 
as the population bulge works its way through the economy there 
will be a somewhat reduced demand for starter homes a reduction 
that might be reflected in a slowdown of price increases 
the bulge of babyboomers then will be in an older age category 
one in which couples historically seek more expensive housing 
there will therefore be a lot more people in the expensivehome 
market 
but unless several factors are in their favor including better 
incomes and lower interest rates a big question remains 
if they cant buy starter houses now where will the 
downpayments come for the bigger more expensive houses in the 
future 
moreover if prices for starter homes dont rise as fast as in 
the past a reflection of reduced demand wont that diminish the 
equity available to those seeking to move up to more expensive 
homes 
that poses another question 
given such factors can the upper end of the market maintain its 
high prices

garankuwa south africa ap a creation of apartheid 
politics south africas black medical school is producing 70 badly 
needed doctors a year and even those who oppose it concede it is 
advancing black medicine in the country 
south africa has 26 million blacks but only about 800 black 
doctors as opposed to more than 21000 white doctors among its 5 
million whites 
when the medical university of southern africa was established 
11 years ago in the homeland of bophuthatswana however many 
activists rejected the school as an inferior institution built to 
keep medical training segregated 
however modern facilities and a qualified staff have helped the 
university graduate 273 doctors who work in some of the countrys 
best hospitals as well as remote rural areas where health workers 
are in severely short supply 
the students reject the idea of segregated education but we 
accept that we are getting good training said a 26yearold 
student asking to be identified only as gwen 
the schools new buildings and landscaped grounds sit behind a 
barbedwire fence 20 miles outside pretoria the capital the 
pristine campus appears out of place in dusty rundown garankuwa 
a sprawling collection of dirt roads and squatter shacks 
many of the prospective doctors come from similarly impoverished 
communities some students arriving for the sixyear program live 
with electricity for the first time and most have little or no 
experience in laboratories 
when students come here they face tremendous adjustments 
said the vice principal len karlsson who is white as are all the 
top administrators the pace and the intensity of the program is 
unlike anything theyve experienced previously 
he said black public high schools do not adequately prepare 
students for the rigors of medical school and therefore the 
university often selects older students with some practical medical 
experience 
about half the students are at least 25 years old and most have 
worked in the health care field before enrolling said karlsson 
the university offers remedial courses in most basic subjects 
but the failure rate remains high about 40 percent of the 120 
firstyear students fail although they are given the chance to 
repeat 
the university is expanding its entering class annually and is 
one of the largest medical schools in africa with about 1500 
students including its denistry veterinary nursing and 
postgraduate programs 
the school referred to by the acronym medunsa produces half of 
south africas 140 new black physicians each year the rest come 
from schools that are predominantly white such as the university 
of the witwatersrand in johannesburg 
medunsa is producing some outstanding doctors said dr 
nthato motlana a prominent antiapartheid activist who runs a 
clinic in soweto the black township outside johannesburg 
motlana and other activists initially opposed medunsa calling 
it a racist plan to build black medical school out in the bush 
motlana still opposes segregated schools but says medunsa has 
served to increase the meager supply of black doctors 
health services remain segregated and the shortage of doctors 
and facilities is acute in most black areas 
johannesburgs main white hospitals are about 50 percent empty 
while an average of more than 200 patients sleep on the floor each 
night at sowetos 2700bed baragwanath hospital the only 
fullservice health facility for the townships 25 million 
residents 
despite the overcrowding at black hospitals in urban areas the 
quality of care is much higher than in rural areas where the 
doctors are far too few and the facilities often inadequate or 
nonexistent motlana said 
medunsa encourages graduates who want to work in rural areas 
but most students are from the cities and see no incentive to 
relocate school officials and students said 
to combat the dearth of rural doctors black homeland 
governments provide scholarships for medunsa students who then are 
required to return to work in the territories for several years 
after graduation 
until its becomes attrative for doctors to practice in rural 
areas most blacks will have trouble getting adequate health care 
said motlana medunsa has helped the situation but it is not 
enough by itself 
the university is financially supported by the south african 
government but students are required to pay a tuition the 
equivalent of about 2500 a year 
virturally every student receives some form of financial aid 
however 
school officials say us companies were generous with 
scholarship money but many of them have pulled out of south africa 
because of its apartheid policies and no longer donate funds 
school officials didnt have exact figures on the reduction in 
american assistance but said its amounts to thousands of dollars 
annually some usbased firms still operating in south africa 
including 3m colgate and johnson and johnson continue to provide 
scholarship money

he was the spiritual father of american folk 
music an artist with a social conciousness who captured the hopes 
dreams joys and sorrows of a nation in such political anthems and 
protest songs as this land is your land 
his name was woody guthrie and he inspired generations of 
singers and composers including pete seeger bob dylan and his 
son arlo guthrie 
but if guthrie was the spiritual daddy of folk music then 
leadbelly huddie ledbetter was its granddaddy 
the two heroes who carved a music for the common people are 
celebrated on a new album folkways a vision shared subtitled 
a tribute to woody guthrie and leadbelly 
the album the brainchild of bob dylan features performances of 
guthrie and leadbellys work by such artists as dylan seeger 
bruce springsteen arlo guthrie u2 little richard john cougar 
mellencamp willie nelson sweet honey in the rock emmylou harris 
and taj mahal 
royalties from the lp will be donated to the smithsonian 
institution which bought folkways records last year from the estate 
of its founder moses asch the birch tree group of princeton 
nj now manages marketing and distribution folkways was a label 
that championed folk music and its stars and is perhaps the most 
complete library of folk music in existence 
asch son of novelist sholem asch founded the folkways label in 
1947 with recordings of leadbelly and such countryblues musicians 
as jack dupree big bill broonzy sonny terry and brown mcghee 
mo asch who died in 1986 at the age of 81 was interested in 
documenting traditional music and sounds from around the world 
folkways recorded guthrie and seeger as well as jazz 
appalachian music gospel spoken words speeches poetry and 
plays childrens songs ragtime environmental sounds from 
street noises to the conversation of frogs and traditional music 
from around the world asch produced more than 2100 records during 
his 50year career and tried to keep them all available for sale to 
the general public and as a reference resource for scholars 
showtime will air a special about the project on sept 17 with 
footage from some of the recording sessions and an interview with 
springsteen who often includes a guthrie song or two in his 
concerts in october a vision shared will go on sale in video 
stores 
springsteen sings i aint got no home and vigilante man 
both written by guthrie brian wilson sings leadbellys goodnight 
irene dylan sings guthries pretty boy floyd 
dylan was fascinated by guthrie from the first time he ever 
heard one of his records growing up in minnesota he visited 
guthrie in the hospital during his last days and cheered the 
composer by singing his songs to him guthrie died at creedmoor 
state hospital in new york in 1967 at the age of 55 following a 
13year battle with huntingtons chorea 
dylan wrote a guthriestyle talking blues for his first record 
album when the smithsonian bought folkways which included 
recordings by guthrie 19121967 and leadbelly 18851949 plus 
the woody guthrie archives it was suggested to dylan that he give 
a benefit concert to help pay for it he suggested more might by 
raised by a recording 
joe mcewen artists and repertory director at columbia records 
and one of four executive producers of a vision shared 
recently talked about the significance of the record 
i think the fact that these songs can still be translated into 
the 1980s shows that this music its passions and experiences are 
universal he said the fact that contemporary artists are 
interpreting these songs shows theyre still as vital today as when 
originally written 
these are great american folk songs part of a tradition that 
will always be with us i think its encumbent upon us to keep 
reinvestigating this tradition 
mcewen couldnt predict how the lp released aug 23 would sell 
the executive producers made a list of some 40 performers 
giving no preference to those signed to columbia records to be 
invited to perform 
dylan had done his song that gave the project some 
credibility mcewen said most artists chose the songs they 
performed executive producers made sure they didnt duplicate and 
sometimes suggested tunes 
this land is your land was obviously designated for pete 
seeger from the beginning and rock island line seemed to make a 
lot of sense for little richard it sounded like his kind of song 
doc watson plays guitar with seeger who sometimes performed on 
the same bill with guthrie and leadbelly in his youth and at 69 
continues to sing songs by both of them the los angeles rock 
group fishbone performs with little richard 
we wanted a real crosssection of different styles of music i 
think we achieved that said mcewen 
asking performers and getting responses was quick he said so 
fast that there wasnt time to take volunteers performers and 
their own producers then went into recording studios around the 
country during a year and a half u2 the irish superstars and only 
nonamerican participants used the sun studios in memphis tenn 
during an american tour 
the general idea in recording mcewen says was simplicity 
to maintain the integrity of the original sound while doing a 
personal interpretation 
brian wilsons goodnight irene doesnt sound like 
leadbellys its probably the most different from the original on 
the album 
mcewen has been asked why there isnt one cut each by guthrie 
and leadbelly i didnt think of it and it was never brought up 
in conversations any of us had he said 
i think the smithsonian is doing a record of the original 
versions of these same songs

in the middle of this sunbaked 
anatolian plateau in western turkey us archaeologists are 
working to preserve the tomb of king midas around whom grew the 
myth of the golden touch 
archaeologists believe the 2600yearold tomb is the oldest 
standing wooden structure in the world 
about 90 pyramidshaped mounds of earth rise on the land where 
the phrygians had their ancient capital of gordion 
the largest and highest of the burial mounds is believed to be 
the tomb of king midas believed to have lived from 725 bc to 675 
bc 
the tomb chamber within a mound about 150 feet high and 900 
feet in diameter has started to show signs of deterioration 
mostly because of lack of air circulation and the high rate of 
humidity inside the grave 
there are cracks in the north wall and the wall is slightly 
bulging out explained professor kenneth sams of the university 
of north carolina who has undertaken the preservation work in the 
name of the university of pennsylvania museum 
there is no imminent danger of collapse but we want to keep 
this unique monument as it is for the coming generations he said 
the tomb was excavated in 1957 under the direction of the late 
rodney s young of the university of pennsylvania 
according to historians it was the phrygians who first 
introduced the tumulus or mound burial style in anatolia this 
small central anatolian village is 60 miles southwest of the 
turkish capital city of ankara 
thirty grave chambers have been excavated 25 by the us 
excavators over the past few decades and the rest by the germans in 
1900 
the midas chamber was made of squared logs and an outer casing 
of round logs of juniper and pine to take the pressure of the 
rubble from a wall covering the tomb phyrgians built a roof and a 
waterproof stone covering on top of the tomb and then covered it 
with tons of earth 
the body and funeral gifts were placed inside the rectangular 
chamber which measures about 320 square feet 
large white fungi today cover the upper sections of the wooden 
chamber 
they are slowly eating the wood says sams we have to 
bring mycologists fungi specialists here to determine how many 
kinds of fungi exist here and why they find this place so 
comfortable 
sams said the archaeologists are in the preliminary stage of the 
conservation work first they are trying to find the reason for 
the fluctuations in the humidity which ranges from a low of 35 
percent to a high of 85 percent while temperatures remain steady 
throughout the year at about 60 degrees 
the phrygians moved into anatolia from thrace and the balkan 
peninsula in 10th century bc and became the major power in asia 
minor in the 9th century bc inheriting the remains of the 
hittite civilization they served as a cultural bridge from the 
hittites to the anatolian civilizations of the lydians and the 
greeks 
they bequeathed to greek mythology and roman religion their 
mothergoddess cybele 
professor ekrem akurgal one of turkeys most prominent 
archaeologists said many phyrgian kings were named midas but the 
one whose tomb is being preserved is the great monarch who 
established phrygian hegemony in asia minor and is mentioned in 
assyrian tablets of the period 
akurgal said this midas is the one on whom the legend of the 
golden touch is based 
according to the legend midas son of king gordius was a 
spendthrift who begged the gods for the power to turn anything he 
touched to gold his wish was granted but midas nearly starved 
because even the food he tried to eat turned to gold 
the curse was lifted when he cleansed himself by bathing in the 
river pactolus known today as sart cayi famous for its golden 
sands 
the burial mounds are on a site on which according to greek 
legend gordius tied his cart to a pole with an intricate knot 
the gordian knot oracles said that whoever untied the knot would 
rule asia alexander the great cut the knot with a stroke of his 
sword according to the story 
archaeologists today are particularly interested in the woodwork 
of the phrygians 
in the midas burial chamber excavators found remains of tables 
inlaid wooden screens bronze and leather belts bronze cauldrons 
and other items lying beside the skeleton of the king 
a team of us art conservators and archaeologists led by 
elizabeth simpson of the metropolitan museum of art in new york are 
restoring these artifacts 
this extraordinary furniture from gordion occupies a special 
place in the history of woodworking and of ancient art in 
general she said the inlay work is ingenious the geometric 
decoration bold and elegant 
the phrygians used wood of contrasting colors and displayed a 
unique sense of design in symmetry and patterns she said the 
findings from the tombs are alsoimportant because very little 
ancient wooden furniture has survived 
the team members have so far restored two inlaid screens and a 
wooden table that are on display in ankaras anatolian 
civilizations museum 
their restoration work sponsored by the us kress foundation 
of new york city continues at the laboratory of the ankara museum

robert wilke parlayed 500 and frugality into 
a quartermilliondollar estate but after eight decades of tending 
his finances growth his harvest is heartache at age 103 his 
yield is unhappiness 
a family feud has grown up over who should handle his money and 
how his estate should be divided as a result the courts have 
declared him incompetent and placed him and his personal wealth 
under guardianships 
advocates for the elderly say proposed reforms in pennsylvanias 
guardianship law might have spared him anguish and indignities in 
old age including three medical examinations and the loss of many 
of his rights 
on the one side are wilke and his two sons robert 60 and 
william 54 on the other side are his two daughters frances 
mcaleer 62 and sylvia eaborn 50 who successfully petitioned a 
judge to declare him incompetent and to appoint guardians to make 
his personal and financial decisions 
it was in the midst of the incompetency hearings in april that 
wilkes wife of 63 years amelia died at age 89 and his mourning 
for her mixes with bitterness toward his daughters with whom he no 
longer speaks 
both daughters wanted to take everything over that i worked 
all my life for wilke contends even though an audit found no 
impropriety when mrs mcaleer was handling his daytoday finances 
i cant even spend my money after saving it complains 
wilke who started work at age 15 for a dollarandahalf a week 
when you think you got money you aint got nothin 
he never earned more than 4200 a year in 57 years of work as a 
machinist and maintenance engineer he retired at age 72 
he started saving when he was 29 by putting 500 from his share 
of the family house sold upon his fathers death into five banks 
shopping for bargains and rarely traveling wilke saved and 
saved his will provided that each of his children would receive 
onefourth of the accumulated wealth 
after he and his wife entered a nursing home he asked his elder 
daughter in late 1986 to help with his billpaying and other 
accounts and gave her legal authority under a power of attorney 
still he continued to monitor his finances and at one point 
their figures conflicted father accused daughter of being unable 
to explain how 20000 was spent 
last october wilke transferred his power of attorney to his 
sons he also changed his will to make the sons executors instead 
of the daughters 
i cried the whole day mrs mcaleer testified my heart 
was broken that my father would do this to me without telling me 
mrs mcaleer and her sister filed the incompetency petition 2 
weeks later and an orphans court judge declared wilke incompetent 
on june 1 naming the pittsburgh national bank as his financial 
guardian and a lawyer as his personal guardian 
the incompetency petition upset wilke so much that he rewrote 
his will in march now the daughters are to receive 10 percent 
each the sons 40 percent each 
the daughters declined to be interviewed but their lawyer 
geoffrey p wozman said they apparently wanted protection 
after mrs mcaleer was accused 
i dont think they particularly thought the sons were going to 
take his money they didnt think the sons were the proper people 
to take care of it they didnt think they were either no matter 
who controls the money someone is going to complain theyre not 
doing something right wozman said 
explaining why the guardianship was sought the lawyer said the 
old man was not rational in terms of financial affairs 
a psychiatrist testifying for the daughters said wilke was 
incompetent due to the infirmities of old age another 
psychiatrist testified for the sons that while wilke needed help 
managing his finances he found no evidence of incompetency a 
third psychiatrist appointed by the court examined wilke seven 
weeks after he was declared incompetent and concluded that he is 
suffering from some mild cognitive impairment 
when the guardianship was declared wilke lost the right to 
vote to make decisions about his own health care and to travel 
without approval from his guardian 
against his wishes he was initially ordered back into a nursing 
home later the judge allowed him to continue to live with son 
william in suburban green tree where he had moved after his wifes 
death the elder wilke is permitted to keep his monthly 537 social 
security check and his 210 pension check for expenses and for 
spending money 
i think the wilke case provides an example of flaws in our 
current state law said dr linda m rhodes secretary of the 
pennsylvania department of aging 
among proposed legal changes now before the legislature is a 
provision to authorize limited guardianships for people who are 
only partially incapacitated as two doctors found wilke to be 
a number of states already allow such guardianships which 
tailor assistance to specific areas such as managing a persons 
income and assets while leaving most rights intact 
current pennsylvania law does not recognize partial incompetence 
and allows only for a blanket guardianship under which virtually 
all decisionmaking is turned over to someone else 
heres an individual who could use some assistance in 
financial planning but certainly he can make choices we all make 
every day mrs rhodes said of wilke 
at a department of aging hearing last month wilke himself 
testified in favor of the reform bill which would also eliminate 
infirmities of old age as a reason for a finding of 
incompetency an individuals faculties not birth date should be 
the deciding factor department officials have argued 
meanwhile wilke is challenging the incompetency finding a 
hearing is set before an orphans court panel sept 12 
as he sits in a rocking chair watching the news or the pirates 
ballgames the whitehaired man ponders what hell do if hes 
declared competent and gets control of his money again 
hell pay off some bills he says and visit his son robert who 
lives in tallahassee fla william says his father also feels he 
should pay him and his wife margaret for his care and shelter no 
more than 1000 
but reconciliation with his daughters is not in the cards 
theyre looking out for themselves not me he said it 
hurt me a lot i just cant forget

the writer traveled frequently to burma in the 
past decade as the associated press bureau chief in neighboring 
thailand burma now is closed to outsiders because of the upheavals 
there but in this dispatch he looks back at what led burmas 
summer of turmoil and what might be in store when it is over

before he toppled burmas civilian 
democracy gen ne win decried military interference in politics 
after taking power he promised a burmese way brand of 
socialism that would bring prosperity 
each man he said would be able to buy at least four 
saronglike longyis a year 
a quarter century later ne wins burmese way has turned out 
to be the wrong way for burmese 
his nation potentially one of asias most prosperous is 
formally classified as among the worlds neediest 
the country now is in upheaval with soldiers gunning down 
demonstrators daring to go into the streets to demand a democratic 
system now that ne win has announced his retirement the very 
defiance of the crowds in itself presents a serious challenge to a 
military seeking to maintain an authoritarian grip on the country 
but the embers setting off the explosions in the streets today 
apparently have been smouldering for years 
like many necessities in burma after 26 years of the burmese 
way the simple longyis worn by most men have become luxury items 
their price has risen 1500 percent since ne wins promise in 
1962 while wages have gone up a mere 35 percent 
with the price of a longyi now equivalent to a months wages for 
the average burmese ne wins promise has been relegated to a host 
of other blasted expectations about the man and his system 
some analysts maintain the 77yearold ne win who retired july 
23 is still pulling the political strings in burma where mass 
demonstrations have been directed at tearing down his political and 
economic structure 
others believe that ne win ailing and perhaps shaken by the 
course of events has truly stepped aside 
in either case the legacies of ne win oneparty rule 
isolationism ethnic insurgencies and his burmese way have 
sunk tenacious roots and could prove difficult to remove 
since his retirement ne win has been succeeded by widely 
disliked former general sein lwin and then by a civilian lawyer 
maung maung the current leader both are ne win loyalists sein 
lwin resorted to shooting hundreds of demonstrators and jailing 
vocal opponents to stay in power the short time he did 
ne win has created an apparatus with a vested interest in 
being perpetuated said one senior us government official at 
least two generations of military officers have a stake in keeping 
the system intact 
josef silverstein a leading american scholar on burma says 
effecting miracle solutions to burmas myriad problems would 
require the men in power to abandon the system and sack 
themselves then a good deal of ne wins work could be undone he 
believes if enough capable people came forward to take over 
beset by as many as a million demonstrators after he took over 
maung maung has promised to pave the way to democracy and usher in 
wideranging economic reforms but some skepticism exists because 
the governments word so far has been unreliable past promises of 
reforms including some made to major foreign aid donors either 
have not been kept or proved cosmetic 
a poster recently on a wall in rangoon the capital read 26 
years in vain 26 years of pain 
in the political field dismantling ne wins legacy would mean 
dissolving the 11 millionmember burma socialist program party and 
an array of institutions from the village level up created to 
support the sole power center 
it would also mean clipping the wings of an entrenched military 
bestriding the apex of the system was ne win charming 
ruthless and cunning maintaining what many analysts say was a 
greater hold on power than virtually any of the worlds dictatorial 
figures 
outright opponents were jailed or fled the country a half dozen 
rising stars within ne wins own ranks from vice chief of staff 
kyaw zaw in 1957 to brig tin oo in 1983 were dismissed or 
imprisoned 
thus ne win has seemingly left burma without any viable 
leaders within or outside the system antigovernment forces 
having nobody to turn to invoke heroic figures from the past 
diplomats describe the top government and party ranks as generally 
unimpressive 
theyre from the back row of the chorus line said max 
mcgrath a former journalist in rangoon and spokesman for burmese 
emigres in london 
robert h taylor a burma scholar at the university of london

in the economic field ne wins centralized socialism has long 
tottered on the edge of total collapse and western experts say only 
a major policy reorientation largescale foreign investment and 
new welltrained economic managers can reverse the downward spiral 
the burmese way forced the expulsion of some 200000 indians 
and chinese who formed much of the entrepreneurial class and 
impelled thousands of burmans including members of one of the best 
civil services the british colonials left behind to seek new lives 
abroad 
closing its doors to private investment the government set up 
23 state corporations staffed largely by officials fearful of 
making even trivial decisions and by the governments own 
admission susceptible to corruption 
privately burmese say the only successful entity has been 
corporation 24 the vast black market fed by border smugglers 
on which citizens must rely for everything from matches to 
medicines by contrast the shelves of government stores are barely 
stocked factories operate far below capacity and a 4 billion 
foreign debt makes even essential imports problematic 
another vast drain on the economy has been the war rangoon wages 
against rebels from a dozen ethnic minorities who demand the 
greater autonomy once promised them 
although ethnic dissent flared before 1962 the insurgencies 
have intensified greatly under ne win who refused reconciliation 
except under his own terms instead the armed forces were built up 
to the current 185000 level and more than 30 percent of the annual 
budget is being spent on what has proved an unwinnable war 
silverstein regards the civil war as perhaps ne wins most 
odious legacy one that has exacerbated previously existing 
tensions between the burman majority and minority groups 
it prevents the emergence of a genuine national feeling 
amongst the peoples of burma silverstein said in an interview 
in its relations to the outside world ne win laid down strict 
neutralism and isolationism as cornerstones of policy 
haunted by the british colonial yoke and exploitation by 
outsiders beset by fears of being drawn into conflicts such as 
were then engulfing vietnam laos and cambodia burma retreated 
into a hermit existence it kept all superpowers at arms length 
and ousted foreigners and their decadent alien culture 
little touched by western influences spared the ills of rapid 
development picturesque burma captivates many outsiders crime 
pollution heart attacks are rare closely knitfamily life and 
traditions vanishing in other parts of asia remain strong 
the reassertion of burmeseness rightly or wrongly is going 
to be regarded in the minds of future burmese as a positive 
legacy silverstein said they will say we are still our own 
people doing things in our own way finding solutions within our 
own capabilities 
although the government claims to have preserved burmese 
culture there has been no evidence of fresh meaningful artistic 
or intellectual activity since 1962 
those who have money talk about burmese cultural purity 
said a senior us diplomat in 1977 those who dont will gladly 
trade their purity for rice 
during the ne win years annual per capita income stagnated at 
below 200 and the country was officially designated by the united 
nations last year as one of the worlds 41 least developed nations 
many burmese privately express shame at this turn of fortune 
seeing themselves far oustripped by neighbors with far fewer 
resources than this fabulously endowed country 
although burmas chaotic experiment with democracy was used by 
ne win as a pretext for usurping power many accounts say that by 
1962 the country was making good progress in its infancy of 
independence and recovering from the immense destruction of world 
war ii 
according to silverstein petroleum production was 52 percent 
teak 93 percent and rice production 93 percent of prewar levels 
before the war burma was the worlds no 1 rice exporter more 
than 1 million tons were exported in 1962 this year exports will 
probably not reach more than 100000 tons and food shortages are 
occurring 
burma the rice bowl has become burma the begging bowl

with just two months left until election day 
republicans are hoping george bush and a little bit of luck will 
help them claim enough of the 33 senate seats up for grabs this 
year to oust democrats from control 
gop strategists say that goal remains within reach but concede 
it will take a strong showing by their presidential nominee and a 
sweep of virtually every close senate race for them to pull it off 
i cant look you in the eye and say were going to take it 
over said tom mason spokesman for the national republican 
senatorial committee but with good breaks a strong 
topoftheticket effort which were getting and with general 
good luck we could do it 
that luck seems to be elusive so far nonpartisan analysts say 
democrats seem to be having some early success in steering the 
debate to domestic issues which they charge have been neglected 
during the reagan era such as child and health care jobs and the 
environment 
there is a subtle but important shift in priorities says 
charles cook who publishes a political newsletter in washington 
he sees the public shifting its perception of the democrats from 
association with discredited policies of the past to emergence as 
the party of the future 
cook says it is ironic that because of president reagans 
successes on national security and the economy those issues have 
faded into the background 
when youre not in immediate danger of losing your job and 
youre not in danger of getting blown up these other issues 
percolate to the top cook said theyre democratic issues that 
the republicans should also be able to take advantage of but in a 
way they the gop are getting robbed 
major senate battlegrounds are scattered all across the country 
from california nevada and washington in the west to nebraska 
wisconsin and minnesota in the middle west florida and mississippi 
in the south and rhode island new jersey and connecticut in the 
northeast 
democrats now hold a 5446 edge in the senate which they won 
back in 1986 after six years of gop dominance while the arithmetic 
theoretically favors the gop they are defending just 15 seats 
compared with the democrats 18 neither side appears likely to 
gain or lose more than two or three seats 
attention so far has focused on six seats being vacated by 
retiring incumbents and another halfdozen or so states where 
incumbents are endangered or will have to scramble to withstand 
wellknown and wellfinanced challengers 
most questionable for the democrats are three seats being 
vacated by senior senators lawton chiles of florida william 
proxmire of wisconsin and john stennis of mississippi 
republicans also are vacating three seats the seat held by 
outgoing sen paul trible of virginia is a solid bet to be seized 
by former democratic gov charles robb the gop has a better chance 
of holding onto sen robert staffords seat from vermont where 
republican rep jim jeffords is considered the favorite the 
washington seat of sen dan evans is considered a tossup 
complicating matters for republicans is the endangered status of 
three incumbents 
sen chic hecht in nevada appears most likely to fall to a 
strong democratic challenge from gov richard bryan in nebraska 
where david karnes was appointed to the senate last year popular 
former gov bob kerrey is considered a good bet to defeat him a 
combination of factors has put veteran rhode island sen john 
chafee in jeopardy of being bumped off by lt gov richard licht 
thus far in the campaign no strong national trend has emerged 
in the issues that senate candidates are running on but polls show 
that after eight years of reagan the public seems ready for a 
change overall senate candidates are sounding less ideological 
and more pragmatic than at any time in the past decade 
seeking to exploit this perceived public mood the democrats are 
offering to meet a wide range of domestic needs although 
candidates usually avoid any talk of the need for higher taxes to 
pay for it 
they are talking about taking care of problems in their own 
neighborhoods and states says bob chlopak executive director of 
the democrats senate campaign arm 
it starts with shoring up the economy that means trade in 
some places manufacturing jobs or hightech education in others 
it is children and opportunties for the next generation health 
care social security chlopak said weve ignored those for 
too long 
national defense and foreign policy the issues that helped 
sweep reagan into office and win gop control of the senate in 1980 
seem less significant in most races even for republicans chlopak 
says 
a signficant number of republican senate nominees are running 
on change sorts of themes he said they are distancing 
themselves from the administration and in many instances from their 
own voting records 
he notes that in washington state former sen slade gorton a 
republican is making a comeback bid based in part on chiding the 
reagan administration for neglecting certain domestic problems 
in mississippi republican rep trent lott is running for 
stennis senate seat talking about college tuition assistance and 
more spending for highways reagan vetoed a major highway 
construction bill 
republicans arent conceding the point however 
the gops mason believes economic themes play well for 
republican candidates and says the party can claim credit for an 
absence of direct national security threats peace and prosperity 
issues ring pretty true he said

incumbents traditionally hold an overwhelming 
advantage in house races good news for the majority democrats 
this year and a continuing source of frustration for the republican 
opposition 
the democrats with 256 seats in the 435member house say they 
hope to win an extra three to five slots in 1988 the republicans 
with 177 seats are looking for a similar gain there are currently 
two vacancies 
housewatchers say the modest projections a maximum five seats 
plus or minus signal a year of limited ambitions but peggy 
connolly a spokeswoman for the democratic congressional campaign 
committee disagrees 
a gain of three to five seats is a fairly bold prediction 
she said in light of democratic failures in past presidential years 
the recent highwater mark was 1964 the year of the lyndon 
johnson landslide and 37 new democratic house seats in 1976 the 
last time the party won the white house the gain was one seat 
since 1960 presidentialyear losses have ranged from five house 
defeats in 1968 to 33 in 1980 
with the skyhigh safe rate of incumbency the best 
opportunities for both parties continue to be seats left open by 
death or departure but there are only 26 this year compared to 41 
in 1986 
a dozen of the open seats are currently held by democrats and 14 
by republicans connolly said only two of the democratic seats a 
florida district represented by dan mica and the new jersey 
district represented by the late jim howard are vulnerable to gop 
challengers 
by contrast she said democratic candidates are competitive for 
almost all of the 14 open gop districts but rich galen a 
spokesman for the national republican congressional committee said 
simply being competitive doesnt turn the tide 
galen said the 14 districts coming open are traditionally 
republican and likely to send gop successors to congress i wont 
concede any of those as potential losses he said 
despite the advantages of incumbency which range from heavy 
financial contributions to cheap satellite time there likely will 
be a handful of casualties in 1986 eight incumbents seeking 
reelection were defeated this year the first was rep ernest 
konnyu rcalif who lost a primary 
some of the endangered lawmakers like reps david skaggs 
dcolo and richard stallings didaho are from swing districts 
or areas normally dominated by the rival party others have been 
touched by scandal rep patrick swindall rga accepted a 
questionable loan from a man indicted for money laundering but 
later returned the loan roy dyson dmd whose chief of staff 
tried to limit the social life of male aides and later committed 
suicide and bill chappell dfla who has been implicated in the 
pentagon procurement scandal 
reps john hiler rind john miller rwash and ron 
marlenee rmont are facing rematches against tough challengers 
others considered vulnerable are reps bob lagomarsino rcalif 
facing state sen gary k hart and jack davis rill running 
against former state senate president george sangmeister 
the democrats are pouring money and attention into a georgia 
match that pits attorney david worley against rep newt gingrich 
the conservative ringleader who filed an ethics complaint against 
house speaker jim wright of texas 
though democrats say at this point that they do not expect to 
unseat gingrich they hope to keep him at home and on the defensive 
about his proposal to replace social security with a voluntary 
system and his ties to his district in light of his role as a 
national conservative spokesman 
connolly denied that there is any element of retribution in the 
focus on gingrich but added we want to tie him down hes a 
republican rabblerouser who we would like to contain in his 
congressional district 
women and blacks with 23 members each in the house stand to 
make incremental gains this year no black incumbents appear to be 
imperiled and a new black lawmaker is sure to be elected from the 
newark seat being vacated by rep peter rodino dnj 
in washington which holds a sept 20 primary king county 
assessor ruthe ridder is competing with black seattle councilman 
norm rice for the democratic nomination in an open heavily 
democratic district 
the democrats are fielding a number of strong women candidates 
for open seats and against incumbents among them are consumer 
activist rosemary pooler trying for an upstate new york seat she 
almost won in 1986 from retiring republican george wortley and san 
mateo county supervisor anna eshoo battling law professor tom 
campbell for konnyus seat south of san francisco

as the town meeting in the high school 
auditorium dragged into its third hour with townspeople shifting 
on their metal folding chairs a biologist droning on about the 
effects of forest fires on endangered species in yellowstone 
national park was curtly interrupted 
i think the people here are primarily interested in another 
endangered species the local businessman boomed ken dixon 
we are also in a survival situation ourselves 
in gardiner perched just yards from the gateway to yellowstone 
the lucrative summer season has disappeared in a cloud of 
forestfire smoke stores offered endoftheseason sales and 
switched to winter hours before labor day hotels have lost guests 
workers have lost wages in all merchants reckon theyll lose 
millions 
but townspeople like dixon the owner of cecils restaurant 
dont blame the gigantic fires they blame the national park 
service which let the fires burn naturally until they got out of 
control 
theyve killed our business said donald laubach whose son 
owns the town cafe and motel 
we all feel anger toward the park service added cashier 
jackie thompson 
when lightning touched off wildfires in june yellowstones 
management followed national park policy and let them burn 
firefighting efforts were launched immediately on manmade fires 
but blazes started by lightning strikes were considered part of the 
natural ecosystem and beneficial to the overgrown forest 
by midjuly with fires burning in all corners of yellowstone 
allout containment efforts began park officials say by the end 
of august nearly onequarter of yellowstones 22 million acres 
had been engulfed at least one of the fires charring yellowstone 
was believed started by chainsaw sparks outside park boundaries 
but it has defied efforts at control 
the fires the worst in more than 200 years fed on 
droughtdried timber and scattered on recordbreaking winds today 
they threaten towns buildings and even the old faithful geyser 
long after heavy rains or early snows smother the infernos 
debate over the letitburn policy will rage townspeople and park 
officials agree 
congressional hearings are expected and application of the 
policy will be reevaluated said yellowstone superintendent robert 
barbee the official at whom dixon and others in the region have 
directed their attacks 
it is shaping up as a classic confrontation a clash between 
businessmen and nature with its roots sunk deep in the very 
mission of national parks which officials insist are intended to 
preserve nature not cater to tourists 
where do you draw the line barbee asked in an interview 
with the associated press we say when push comes to shove 
nature wins in the national parks but it isnt pure and simple 
forestry officials say the fires prompt rebirth in the 
wilderness clearing away the old dead and overgrown while making 
way for new vegetation and new wildlife habitats 
national parks they say are intended to be laboratories of 
nature not tree museums 
are we to promote these lovely pastoral scenes people are used 
to seeing on postcards and in coffee table books or is a national 
park a repository for naturalness barbee asked everything 
doesnt have to be picture postcard scenes thats not what were 
trying to accomplish 
to ronnie wright the national park fire policy is good in 
theory but poor in practice like others living on the edge of the 
nations oldest national park wright makes his living from nature 
his company beartooth plateau outfitters offers tours and hunting 
trips 
but the only guiding he did in august was getting firefighters 
through the forest his horses carried firefighting gear not 
tourists when cooke city mont was under an evacuation warning 
wright packed up his animals including his pet bear and shipped 
them out 
they definitely made a mistake of course thats easy to say 
with hindsight wright said the trouble with their policy is 
theres no common sense involved its so darn dry here the fires 
should have been doused right away 
their theory is right but when theyve got the means to 
control it they should use their heads a little bit 
barbee says experts studied the fires closely as the early 
decisions were made they relied on 16 years experience with the 
policy he said and 100 years of weather data 
over the last decade 140 fires have been allowed to burn each 
consuming an average of only 250 acres early this summer about 20 
lightning fires were allowed to burn 11 died out nine did not 
never before has a summer been so dry the winds so extreme he 
said and the fires have done things never seen before changing 
direction leaping miles growing by thousands of acres a day one 
day two sidebyside fires grew in opposite directions one north 
and one south 
the conditions here are absolutely unprecedented barbee 
said obviously if you knew you were going to be in a situation 
like this youd jump on it 
if there has been any saving grace for the merchants its that 
many are profiting from the firefighting efforts some are renting 
vehicles and horses to the crews fire camps offered cleaning and 
clerical jobs at 6 an hour some firefighters have filled a few 
of the hotel rooms and restaurant tables 
but the tension between the two camps only seems to grow 
heightened by the perception that this firefighting effort has not 
been as effective as others there have been problems lack of 
radios lack of manpower lack of helicopters to make water drops 
and the primary goal of the effort has been to steer fire away 
from buildings the blazes have been too ferocious for crews to get 
in front of and extinguish 
i think theres definitely going to have to be a change not 
only in the fire policy but also in how yellowstone park is 
managed said laubach yellowstone park has always been treated 
as a showcase for the world now well never see it as it was in 
our lifetime 
but park officials are trying now to convince the businesses 
they can profit from the summers transformation when the town 
meeting became heated barbee told the 100 assembled people the 
park service would help them by promoting new interest in the grand 
dame of the national parks which is visited by about 2 million 
tourists a year 
were going to encourage people to come see the aftermath to 
see how the forest reacts barbee said the park will certainly 
have a different face 
i hope the public will find yellowstone even more interesting 
now not less

oil futures prices finished weaker in light

delivery of west texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us 
crude oil fell 9 cents per barrel wednesday to close at 1518

nearterm contracts for refined petroleum products declined 
contracts for september delivery of wholesale unleaded gasoline 
fell 149 cents to finish at 4654 cents a gallon after rising 
sharply on tuesday other contracts also slipped 
analysts attributed the drop in gasoline futures partly to a 
selloff by speculators wanting lower prices in advance of the 
contracts expiration the gasoline contract for september delivery 
expired wednesday 
september gasoline had been a steadying force in the market 
said richard kane a trader with merrill lynch energy futures 
but after todays activity it turned around it was a function of 
liquidating long positions 
wholesale heating oil for september fell 019 cent to 4295 
cents a gallon while other contract months also fell 
analysts said there was little fresh news to stimulate the 
market other than a brief spark early in the day brought on by the 
weekly api report released late tuesday 
the statistics showed a 4234 millionbarrel drawdown in crude 
oil stocks for the week ending aug 26 
it ostensibly was a good api number for crude it helped the 
market open higher said fred demler an analyst at drexel 
burnham lambert inc but the collapse of the gasoline market and 
the sheer weight of the crude market brought it down 
after the brief move upward prices began deteriorating 
steadily led by the drop in gasoline prices later in the day

financial analysts believe delta air lines inc 
has built up enough good will in 60 years to withstand any damage 
to its reputation caused by its second fatal crash at dallas in 
three years 
a boeing 727 crashed on takeoff wednesday from dallasfort worth 
international airport killing 13 people on aug 5 1985 a delta 
lockheed l1011 crashed in a thunderstorm while trying to land at 
the airport killing 137 people 
the airline also was beset by a series of unrelated highly 
publicized and embarassing incidents last year pilots landed at 
the wrong airport or on the wrong runway one plane plummeted 
toward the ocean because the pilot mistakenly shut off the engines 
another plane was involved in a near collision over the atlantic 
nevertheless delta has maintained its reputation in the 
financial community as a sound company and among consumers as a 
safe airline 
i dont think the reputation is undeserved and it probably 
wont change said robert decker an airline industry analyst with 
duff amp phelps inc in chicago 
delta spokesman bill berry said the airline expects little 
longterm damage to its reputation 
the passengers who fly with us we think they feel very 
comfortable berry said wednesday the traveling public stayed 
with us during last years problems those passengers who know 
delta dont feel delta is doing something wrong if there is 
anything that delta can do we will do it 
berry noted the airline had flown 1193 billion passenger miles 
since the 1985 accident without a fatality 
if you ask people in airline maintenance who they think does 
the best job deltas almost always the name mentioned first 
said john pincavage an analyst with painewebber inc in new york 
deltas common stock dropped 1 when news of the crash hit but 
recovered half of that by the close to finish at 4650 per share 
in new york stock exchange trading 
analysts attributed the stock drop as much to a round of fare 
reductions touched off tuesday by continental airlines as to the 
crash itself in addition transportation issues generally declined 
in big board trading 
anthony hatch an analyst in new york with argus research 
called delta a terrifically wellrun airline 
he said delta survived last years incidents because it had so 
much good will in the bank and i dont think they really lost 
it 
these things arent good for a company but its hard to 
measure right now the final impact he said adding that people 
arent going to fly eastern all of a sudden 
eastern airlines deltas chief competitor has been rocked by 
safety investigations of its aircraft and by labor troubles 
eastern has cut back its routes although a federal judge this week 
blocked its plan to lay off 4000 employees 
delta originated in the south in the 1920s as huff daland 
dusters the worlds first cropdusting service a division of huff 
daland manufacturing co of ogdensburg ny 
led by collett woolman the service broke away from the parent 
company in 1928 to form delta air service with headquarters in 
monroe la the first passenger flights took place in 1929 
ironically from dallas to jackson miss 
woolman who ran the company until his death in 1966 is 
credited with setting the tone for delta including its unique 
tradition of having pilots greet passengers as they disembark

eastern airlines as expected has asked a federal 
appellate court to overturn an injunction stopping it from laying 
off 4000 employees 
eastern in an appeal filed wednesday with the us court of 
appeals in washington said the proposed layoffs were an integral 
part of the overall decision to undertake schedule changes and 
redeploy other flights 
the miamibased carrier said it was losing several million 
dollars per month on employees it does not need eastern also noted 
the order prohibits the company from transferring what it called 
surplus employees to where work is available 
spokesman robin matell said the 4000 employees hundreds of 
them in cities where eastern sharply reduced operations or ended 
all flights wednesday still were being paid 
but no decision had been made on whether to assign them new 
duties while eastern is fighting for the right to dismiss them 
they are being retained on the payroll the whole thing is 
being interpreted and evaluated and we just dont have the answers 
now matell said 
eastern argues that a federal judge should not be able to 
restrict managements ability to make costcutting moves it deems 
necessary us district judge barrington parker in washington on 
tuesday ruled eastern could reduce its flight schedule by 12 
percent to save money but could not make mass layoffs without 
negotiating them with its unions 
among those being retained are 1500 nonunion employees adding 
to confusion over parkers order he invoked the railway labor act 
which prevents major changes in contract status quo 
the opinion did not spell out what should happen to the 
employees union attorneys suggested they could be transferred and 
leaders of easterns three unions said they would like to meet with 
management to discuss ways to cut costs without layoffs 
union leaders hailed parkers ruling but agreed it was just 
another in a long series of court decisions as the costcutting 
texas air corp management with a carrier 25 billion in debt 
goes against combative unions that contend the houstonbased 
corporation is cannibalizing its eastern subsidiary 
the company and its unions still have myriad court battles under 
way ranging from a union effort to reverse the texas air sale and 
allow employees to buy eastern to a company lawsuit charging the 
unions have conspired to intentionally damage the airline 
financially 
still unresolved are contract talks with the machinists and 
pilots the machinists in federal mediation since january will 
vote sept 15 on a company call for 161 million in annual wage 
concessions 
eastern lost 182 million in 1987 and reported 149 million in 
losses for the first half of 1988 
eastern had announced elimination of 140 flights on july 22 so 
no passengers were booked on routes cut wednesday including all 
service from 14 cities mostly in the western united states and 
caribbean 
eastern was losing more than 50 million a year at its kansas 
city hub where lowcost braniff airlines has been increasing 
business the hub was eliminated and eastern cut its kansas city 
daily flights from 53 to six 
in kansas city most of 400 eastern employees spent wednesday 
catching up on busy work 
we were averaging about 4800 passengers a day said walt 
green easterns director of airport services in kansas city 
weve got about 500 today 
the company had asked employees not to report to work wednesday 
but to take compensation time or stay home without pay while 
receiving full company benefits he said however green said only 
about 35 people stayed home wednesday 
most employees spent the day cleaning equipment and storing 
supplies he said

increasing poverty among blacks but not 
whites shows that the nations economic recovery is not being 
evenly shared the head of a private antipoverty group said today 
but an official of a conservative group challenged census bureau 
figures on the extent of black poverty 
it seems that this is a very uneven economic recovery the 
gains are not being evenly sharedthe gap between rich families 
and poor families is now wider in this country than at any point in 
the past 40 years robert greenstein said on nbcs today show 
greenstein head of the center on budget and policy priorities 
commented in the wake of a new census bureau report showing that 
nearly onethird of all black americans live in poverty 
poverty among blacks climbed 2 percentage points to 331 percent 
last year according to the census bureaus annual study of income 
and poverty released on wednesday that means that there were an 
estimated 9683000 poor blacks as of 1987 which was 700000 more 
than a year earlier 
we do have a great deal of unevenness in our economy and the 
people at the bottom many of them are being left farther 
behind greenstein said 
but stuart butler of the conservative heritage foundation who 
joined greenstein on the broadcast challenged the figures 
if such benefits as food stamps and subsidized housing were 
counted he said youll find that the poverty level among blacks 
is almost half of what the published data suggest 
another point thats important to recognizeis that this 
socalled expansion of poverty at the lowest end and among blacks 
is very largely attributed to the breakup of families butler 
said 
among the black community about half the families are headed 
by women and of course that means that you have families with 
one earner or no earners and that heavily pulls down the average 
for that whole community 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the increase in 
black poverty obviously is disappointing but maintained that 
the report had good news overall reporting rising incomes for most 
americans 
benjamin hooks head of the national association for the 
advancement of colored people said he was not surprised at the 
findings on black americans 
we have been saying that this is happening the poverty rate 
among blacks is sliding upward and family income is sliding down 
hooks said 
greenstein on wednesday termed the figures most disturbing 
the economic recovery is leaving many poor americans behind 
the news was even worse for black children noted greenstein 
whose organization studies the effects of government programs on 
the poor 
the poverty rate for black children aged 18 and under was 456 
percent last year up from 43 percent in 1986 the census report 
showed 
nearly half 491 percent of blacks under age 3 lived below the 
poverty level in 1987 the study found 
these new data confirm that the 1980s have been a terrible 
decade for the poor in america despite overall progress in 
unemployment and the economy said robert j fersh executive 
director of the food research and action center a nonprofit 
organization seeking to alleviate hunger and poverty 
for americans overall the census study said the poverty rate 
was down slightly even though the actual number of poor people 
increased that divergence occurred because the population overall 
increased faster than the number of poor 
the number of persons in poverty totaled 325 million in 1987 
slightly higher than the 324 million reported for 1986 at the 
same time the nations poverty rate was reported at 135 percent 
down from 136 percent a year earlier 
neither change is considered statistically significant because 
they are both within the margin of error of the survey said 
william p butz associate director of the census bureau the 
results were based on a sample of about 60000 households across 
the nation and had an error margin of less than one percentage 
point 
the poverty level varies by the size of the family for 1987 it 
was 11611 for a family of four up from 11203 a year earlier 
median family income for 1987 the bureau added was 30850 up 
from 30534 the year before

bondholders who had pursued the washington public 
power supply system through the courts for five years have let 
wppss off the hook just before trial claiming you cant get 
blood out of a turnip 
plaintiff attorneys said the deal with the supply system 
announced wednesday will gain the cooperation of wppss employees 
who will be leading witnesses when the securities fraud trial 
starts sept 7 in tucson ariz 
wppss agreed this week to settle litigation against it over the 
systems 225 billion bond default in 1983 the bonds were sold to 
finance construction of two nuclear power plants which were never 
completed 
the trial was moved to tucson after judges in seattle excused 
themselves because of possible perceived conflicts of interest and 
because some feared it would be impossible to get an impartial jury 
to hear the case 
thousands of people in washington lost money because of the 
default 
bondholders agreed to drop claims against wppss in return for 
access to accounts for the terminated power plants nos 4 and 5 
containing millions of dollars 
remaining defendants include 20 public utilities in washington 
and one in oregon that participated in building the plants three 
engineering firms and a firm that had provided wppss with financial 
advice 
the abrupt pullout of wppss caught other defendants by surprise 
and one acknowledged consideration was being given to requesting a 
trial delay 
were surprised they wppss didnt stay and defend their 
actions said chuck shigley administrator for the snohomish 
county public utility district 
wppss paid no money in the tentative settlement but agreed that 
it has an obligation to pay the face value and interest on the 
bonds which total about 3 billion 
since you cant get blood out of a turnip why not get all the 
other benefits you can said mel weiss representing class action 
plaintiffs in the giant lawsuit 
however the agreement noted that because of limited assets 
pledged to secure the bonds there was no expectation the money 
would ever be paid 
the wppss executive board was expected to approve the agreement 
when it meets friday in richland wash in a special meeting said 
carl halvorson board chairman 
its a very favorable settlement for the supply system he 
said 
the tentative settlement which also requires the approval of 
presiding us district judge william d browning protects wppss 
other assets against any further judgments in the case 
in the legal action bondholders sued the supply system 88 
utilities bond underwriters various directors and managers 
engineering firms and advisors after wppss defaulted on 225 
billion worth of bonds 
many defendants have settled over the past year including bond 
underwriters and more than 60 utilities they have agreed to pay a 
total of 331 million and may face further liabilities 
the terminated plants are located at the hanford nuclear 
reservation and satsop west of olympia 
meanwhile browning ruled wednesday in tucson that bondholders 
are permitted to try to prove they should be fully refunded for the 
bonds they bought common law and state law permit rescission or 
refund damages browning said in his ninepage order 
claims under the federal securities act allow only for 
outofpocket losses browning said that means the difference 
between what the bondholder paid and what the value of the bonds 
were 
in both instances the bondholders will be allowed to try to 
prove that because of misrepresentations they bought bonds that 
otherwise would not have been put on the market and therefore 
should get full refunds plus interest

the state attorney general asked the georgia 
public service commission to delay action on georgia power cos 
request for a 735 million rate hike while auditors probe evidence 
of possible wrongdoing by the utility 
the commission on wednesday ordered a special team to 
investigate allegations that utility officials concealed important 
information during rate hearings last year the utility has 
requested the rate hike to help finance its share of a big nuclear 
generation facility plant vogtle 
attorney general michael bowers said the public service 
commission should take no further action in settling the rate case 
until investigators complete their probe 
the allegations surfaced tuesday when federal officials released 
documents on their investigation of possible tax fraud by the 
utility the documents indicated georgia powers parent company 
the southern co and the big eight accounting firm of arthur 
andersen amp co also are objects of federal scrutiny 
among the documents were transcripts of taped conversations 
indicating that georgia power financial officers may have hidden 
records from the commission during hearings the rate increase 
at one point in the transcript gary givens georgia powers 
corporate tax manager said company officials had taken home 
floppy discs and things like that related to rate case 
information 
were concerned about the statement said commissioner billy 
lovett obviously we dont know what records may have been 
taken home we have a team of auditors and examiners that will 
look into every possibility that the commission did not get 
complete information in rate cases 
georgia power chairman robert w scherer said he was shocked by 
the allegations and promised he would get to the bottom of this 
matter he also vowed he would not tolerate the coverup of 
wrongdoing at georgia power co 
a statement issued by arthur andersen from the companys chicago 
headquarters denied wrongdoing 
the federal investigation dating back to 1982 involves charges 
that the companies and their accountants sought to hide about 61 
million in spare parts to avoid paying 50 million in federal 
taxes interest and penalties 
an account in the the wall street journal today suggested the 
federal probe has widened significantly and is focusing on arthur 
andersens accounting advice to clients 
the journal said the agriculture departments inspector general 
has subpoenaed documents from 11 major electric cooperatives all 
of which use arthur andersen as their auditor 
the newspaper quoted bob bergland former agriculture secretary 
and now general manager of the national rural electric cooperative 
association as saying the subpoenas were issued because of 
questions surrounding arthur andersens opinion on the tax 
implications of certain leasing arrangements

virtually smokeless cigarette being tested by rj reynolds tobacco 
co a newspaper reported today 
the atlanta constitution quoting unidentified sources within 
the agency said fda legal counsel thomas scarlett had sent a 
confidential report agreeing with the tobacco companys contention 
that the cigarette should not be regulated as a drug 
it was a pretty negative report the source told the 
constitution general counsel didnt offer much precedent for our 
regulating the product 
the decision would be a setback for antismoking groups that 
have been urging the fda to treat the cigarette as a drug because 
of its nicotine content 
two separate petitions were filed in april by the 
washingtonbased coalition on smoking or health which represents 
the american heart association american lung association american 
cancer society and the american medical association 
just because you dont see smoke doesnt mean the harmful

congress has voted to fix 
inflationadjusted interest rates at 12 percent a year under the 
countrys new constitution despite protests from bankers and 
businessmen that the measure wont work 
the 559member congress passed the limit late wednesday in 
vaguely worded legislation regarding real interest rates which 
was interpreted to mean the level of interest charged above the 
inflation rate 
inflation in the past 12 months totaled 496 percent but some 
banks and financial institutions currently charge more than 1000 
percent annually 
the measure was sharply criticized by the government and the 
business community 
the notion is archaic and obsolete said rep francisco 
dornelles a former minister of finance who voted against the 
measure 
planning minister joao batista de abreu said thursday of 
course i didnt like it its an unfortunate decision and hurts the 
governments monetary policy 
sen albano franco a prominent businessman and also an opponent 
of the measure called it absurd in no other country in the world 
are interest rates fixed by the constitution 
the financial press also expressed disapproval of the 
congressional decision 
fixing of interest rates creates crisis read the headline 
of the rio de janeiro newspaper o globo on thursday 
the folha de sao paulo newspaper said in an editorial the 
decision was a product of the worst in brazilian politics 
demagogery ignorance and unreality 
the twochamber congress has been working since february 1987 on 
the new constitution brazils eighth to replace an authoritarian 
charter handed down 19 years ago during the 19641985 military 
regime the new charter is expected to be ready this year

the productivity of nonfarm businesses fell 14 percent in the 
second quarter the first drop since 1986 but less than previously 
estimated the labor department said today 
the government had initially put the drop at 17 percent but 
revised it downward after deciding that the nations economic 
output in the apriljune period had been greater than previously 
estimated 
in another report the commerce department said construction 
spending jumped 12 percent in july as strength in government 
building projects and offices and apartments offset declines in 
singlefamily housing factories and shopping centers 
productivity is a measure of the number of hours of labor 
required to achieve a certain output of goods and services in the 
period employees hours rose 66 percent greater than the 52 
percent increase in output 
analysts said the increase in hours and conseqent decrease in 
productivity reflects a hiring boom in which employers are having 
to compete for lessskilled workers because of decadelow 
unemployment 
measured in dollars us factories have outperformed the rest 
of the world in the past year in reducing labor costs partly 
through the smallest wage increases of any industrial country last 
year 
on wednesday the census bureau said the proportion of black 
americans living in poverty rose last year to nearly a third it 
said the overall poverty rate was fairly steady 
the report wednesday said a survey based on a sample of 60000 
families found that in the nation as a whole incomes rose 1 
percent and the poverty rate edged down the changes were not 
considered statistically significant because they fell within the 
surveys margin of possible error 
the poverty rate for blacks increased to 331 percent from 311 
percent in 1986 the study said meaning the number of blacks 
living in poverty rose from 89 million to 97 million 
the economic recovery is leaving many poor americans behind 
said robert greenstein of the center on budget and policy 
priorities a private research group 
in the financial markets wednesday the stock market posted 
scattered losses the dow jones average of 30 industrials finished 
with a 658point loss at 203165 
the dollar rose strongly especially against the japanese yen 
while interest rates dipped in the bond market 
according to the census bureau report median family income for 
blacks fell to 18098 from 18247 while the median income for 
white families rose to 32274 from 31935 
the poverty rate for whites dipped to 105 percent from 11 
percent for hispanics the poverty rate rose to 282 percent from 
273 percent 
the government defined the poverty income level as 11611 for a 
family of four in 1987 up from 11203 the previous year 
william p butz the census bureaus associate director for 
demographic programs said the nations economic performance in 
terms of income and poverty has been mixed as usual 
the number of americans living in poverty last year totaled 325 
million slightly higher than the 324 million reported for 1986 
the poverty rate was 135 percent down from 136 percent 
it is possible for the poverty rate to decline even when more 
people are poor because the size of the population is growing 
faster than the number of people living in poverty 
the study found womens incomes continue to trail those of men 
it said women receive about 65 percent of males takehome pay a 
percentage that has remained unchanged since 1984

theres a good chance that the plane you took on 
your last flight doesnt belong to the airline whose brightly 
colored logo adorns the fuselage 
odds are nearly oneintwo in fact that the airline leases the 
plane from a specialized company or a bank aircraft leasing has 
taken off in a big way in the past few years propelled by the 
tough economics of airline competition the aging of the nations 
fleet tax changes and other factors 
almost half of the 2700 jets operated by us commercial 
airlines are leased rather than owned compared with only 30 
percent in 1983 according to industry estimates much of that 
growth has come in the last two or three years 
theres no real reason that an airline would want to own an 
aircraft right now said david butterworth a financial analyst 
for wedbush securities inc in los angeles airlines want the 
flexibility of leasing and are willing to pay for it 
jet aircraft dont come cheap a commercial liner made by boeing 
co mcdonnell douglas corp or lockheed corp costs anywhere from 
25 million to 100 million big airlines buffeted by the tailwinds 
of competition and squeezed by high labor and advertising costs may 
well balk at the investment 
there are plenty of reasons on the other hand for carriers to 
lease planes 
the competition sparked by the deregulation of the us airline 
industry in 1978 means that carriers have to move nimbly to 
establish new hubs shift their routes and make other changes 
requiring new aircraft 
but the big aircraft manufacturers have a much longer time 
horizon they need many months to design and build new models and 
produce existing ones 
thats where the leasing companies come in they fill the gap 
between the slowmoving aircraft makers and the pressed airlines by 
buying up batches of different kinds of planes and leasing them to 
carriers in a pinch 
were offering airlines flexibility said steven udvarhazy 
president of international lease finance corp a major aircraft 
leasing company based in beverly hills calif 
tax changes also have played a role as part of the mammoth 
federal tax reform of 1986 the investment tax credit was 
eliminated for most aircraft purchases removing an incentive for 
many airlines to own a jet 
and the recent sprouting of scores of new smaller airlines in 
western europe with flashy names like air 2000 and hispania has 
created a new market for jet lessors around the world 
leasing companies have been quick to capitalize on the airlines 
hunger for shortorder planes 
international lease finance is widely considered the most 
aggressive of the aircraft lessors it boasts a jet portfolio 
of about 60 aircraft worth 2 billion with another 197 on order 
among its 70 customers are several major us airlines as well as 
foreign carriers including british airways lufthansa of west 
germany scandinavian airlines system singapore airlines garuda 
indonesia and varig of brazil 
another big us lessor is san franciscobased gatx air a 
subsidiary of financial services company gatx corp in europe the 
industry leader is gpa group ltd one of the largest companies in 
ireland which describes itself as a sort of investment banker 
for the aviation industry 
ansett transport industries ltd a huge australian company that 
is halfowned by media tycoon rupert murdoch owns eight different 
airlines and has an active jet leasing subsidiary 
these companies specialize in shortterm operating leases 
running for an average three to seven years after which the 
aircraft are returned to the lessors 
major banks and companies like ge capital a subsidiary of 
general electric co deal mainly in longerterm capital leases 
that work like installment plans airlines often end up owning the 
planes at the end of the capital lease period 
leasing costs vary widely depending on the age and condition of 
the aircraft how desirable the model is at the time the contract 
is signed and other factors a 100 million boeing 747 jumbo jet 
for example would cost roughly 12 million to 15 million a year 
to lease 
the airlines need for new planes has been intensified recently 
by the aging of the nations commercial fleet caused largely by 
lower fuel prices that allowed the carriers to postpone purchases 
of more fuelefficient aircraft 
the average age of us jetliners is 1253 years up 21 percent 
from 1979 more than half the jets operated by major carriers are 
16 years old or older according to avmark inc an aviation 
consulting firm in arlington va 
the delta air lines jetliner that crashed wednesday at the 
dallasfort worth airport was a 15yearold boeing 727 delta 
which bought that plane in 1973 but now leases 45 percent of its 
fleet says the average age of its aircraft is 84 years 
while the cause of the aug 31 crash remains under 
investigation aging aircraft have stirred debate in the industry 
since last april when a 19yearold boeing 737 operated by aloha 
airlines partially disintegrated during a flight over hawaii the 
pilots managed to land the plane safely but the accident swept a 
flight attendant to her death and injured 61 passengers 
the airlines are realizing now that you pay a price for 
hanging on to an aircraft too long said udvarhazy 
some big airlines and leasing companies have been snapping 
up new planes voraciously in recent months on may 16 
international lease finance announced that it had made the biggest 
commercial aircraft order in history 504 billion for 100 boeing 
jets and 30 airbus industrie planes in addition the leasing 
company took options to purchase another 24 boeings and 16 jets 
made by airbus a rival european manufacturer 
united airlines and american airlines the nations two largest 
carriers weighed in shortly afterward with big orders of their 
own and a fierce competition reportedly is raging between boeing 
and mcdonnell douglas over an imminent delta order that could be 
worth up to 6 billion 
to keep on the cutting edge international lease finance and 
gatx air both have placed orders for the ultramodern airbus a320 
the first fully computerized commercial plane only a handful of 
the planes are in commercial service all of them in europe 
while the airline industry clearly is in a replacement cycle 
what one executive calls a feeding frenzy cycles have a way 
of turning round jet leasing can be risky and lessors sometimes 
have to weather weak markets and avoid the temptation to sell their 
planes 
aircraft leasing can be a very good business if youre patient 
and dont panic said jim robertson the president of gatx air in 
san francisco its a game for professionals its not a game for 
dabblers 
robertson speaks from experience gatx air has sometimes 
acquired stock in airlines and other companies that failed to make 
their leasing payments

a record 154 million foreign tourists visited 
britain last year including many more japanese europeans and 
north americans the governmentfunded tourist authority said 
thursday 
the tourists an 11 percent increase from the year earlier 
spent 62 billion pounds equivalent to 104 billion during the 
year said the british tourist authority 
while the authority did not expect another such record year in 
1988 because of a drop in north american tourists they expected 
increased european visits to partly offset the fall 
the authority said in 1987 visits by japanese increased 45 
percent from 1986 those by greeks and italians rose 38 percent 
and spaniards 24 percent visits by danes and latin americans fell 
3 percent and 11 percent respectively 
north american tourists in 1987 increased by 19 percent from the 
year before said the authority which said britain was the 
fifthhighest tourismearning nation in the world 
but the north american influx fell sharply this year according 
to separate figures released wednesday by the department of 
employment the number of north american tourists dropped 3 percent 
in the first six months of the year compared with the same period 
in 1987 the department said 
still tourist authority officials remained cautiously confident 
the north american market is now expected to show only a small 
increase on last year but visits from the rest of the world 
continue to grow so that overall 1988 will be at least as good as 
1987 said michael medlicott the authoritys chief executive 
travel from north america from january through june 1988 fell 3 
percent but western europeans increased their trips to britain by 
3 percent said the employment department 
the tourist authority said britain remained fifth in tourism 
earnings for a second consecutive year last year after the united 
states italy spain and france in that order

chinese banks are facing runs on savings deposits 
as customers withdraw large amounts of money in panic buying caused 
by rising prices and empty stockrooms the chinese press reported 
today 
in the southern province of fujian savings deposits in 
industrial and commercial banks dropped by 578 million yuan 156 
million between aug 18 and 24 the official xinhua news agency 
said 
in shanghai 100 million yuan 27 million was withdrawn in the 
past two weeks the englishlanguage china daily reported in a 
frontpage story wednesday 
people have formed long queues in front of many savings banks 
to withdraw their deposits because they fear further devaluation in 
the value of their money the paper said 
peoples bank of china officials in shanghai called a news 
conference this week to refute rumors that a limit had been imposed 
on savings withdrawals and assured the public that the bank has a 
sufficient reserve of money to pay off deposits no matter how 
great the amount the report said 
if a depositor wants to withdraw 10000 yuan 2702 at once 
we will pay him immediately zhou zhishi vice president of the 
shanghai branch of the peoples bank of china chinas central 
bank said 
in fujian one customer took out 70000 yuan 18919 in one 
shot xinhua reported 
the average urban workers monthly salary is about 130 yuan 
35 
meanwhile the daily sales volume of household electric 
appliances such as televisions refrigerators and washing machines 
has doubled or tripled in fujian the news agency said 
the panic buying has caused shortages in previously overstocked 
goods such as cassette recorders electric fans bicycles and 
pressure cookers the report said 
the bank runs and panic buying are caused by growing alarm among 
chinese consumers over dramatic price hikes and fears of 
devaluation of their money 
in the past year prices have increased 19 percent in a country 
that once boasted zero inflation 
the interest rate which was raised today from 72 percent for 
oneyear deposits to 864 percent still falls far short of 
inflation 
the result is the popular concept that buying goods is better 
than depositing money xinhua reported 
the state council chinas cabinet issued a statement this week 
promising to slow down the pace of the reforms that have caused 
runaway inflation 
the state council agreed to hold prices in check for the rest of 
the year and decided there will be no radical reforms in prices 
next year 
in midaugust the communist party politburo called for rapid 
decontrol of stateset prices that would allow the value of goods 
to be determined by market forces the state council also suggested 
that interest rates would be raised next year to meet or even 
surpass the inflation rate

hershey foods corp trying to use its well 
known name to capture the no 2 position in the powdered chocolate 
mix market announced a new product thursday that the company is 
shipping to stores 
anthony pingitore general manager of hersheys grocery products 
group said hersheys chocolate milk mix scored highly in consumer 
trials during its 3 years of development 
earlier this summer hershey withdrew its 32yearold entry in 
the 200 million a year powdered chocolate market hersheys 
instant 
pingitore said the company set out in 1985 to find a mix that 
would taste better and dissolve more easily in milk 
this has plagued consumers for years although they were 
really satisfied with the market leaders product he said of 
flavor and solubility we decided we would tackle the problem 
we think we have it 
hershey plans a massive television and direct mail advertising 
campaign although pingitore would not say how much will be spent 
nearly 50 million discount coupons for the mix will be distributed 
in sunday newspapers across the nation on sept 18 
pingitore said the company will be happy if the new mix becomes 
a solid no 2 behind industry leader nestles quik he said 
consumer trials indicated hersheys name was a significant element 
in sales the hershey container will have a wider mouth and a 
recloseable lid he said 
the leading competitor has obviously a very strong brand 
franchise which is not easy to overcome pingitore said its 
akin to the franchise we have with the hershey bar 
nestle dominates the socalled milk modifier industry with a 23 
percent share said john mcmillin a food industry analyst for 
prudentialbache securities inc in new york hershey has about 12 
percent of the market and its volume was down about 2 percent last 
year while nestles was up about 2 percent mcmillin said 
hershey has some catching up to do he said 
he added that hershey with 1987 earnings of 1482 million on 
sales of 24 billion has been more aggressive within the last 
year 
pingitore said the companys three pillars for growth are its 
established products acquisitions and new product development 
including a heavy emphasis on gauging what consumers want in snacks 
hershey announced on aug 8 the sale of its friendly ice cream 
restaurant chain to tennessee restaurant co for 375 million 
hershey also recently said it was buying the us confectionery 
operations of cadburyschweppes plc of england for 270 million 
plus the assumption of 30 million in debt 
its been a back to basics year for hershey mcmillin said 
theyve made a number of confectionery acquisitions theyre 
focusing more on what they do best and that is tied closely to 
chocolate

when it comes to keeping tabs on 
personal calls made from the office albert montevecchio has no 
problem with the privacy issue 
when its my money youre spending i have every right in the 
world to know how youre spending it said the founder and 
president of moscom inc the worlds leading supplier of call 
accounting computer systems 
if someone is calling a friend who works across town five times 
a day or making longdistance calls to relatives the company will 
be able to find out the systems wont let anyone listen in on 
calls 
all it does is tell the boss who you called how long you 
spoke and how much it cost which seems like its fair 
information said rob boxer the companys corporate counsel 
one guy we sold a system to said you know before i bought 
your product every time i looked at a phone on someones desk it 
looked like a blank check said boxer 
the systems consist of software for personal computers and a 
cable connecting the pc to the phone system an older less 
flexible version uses a printer instead of a personal computer 
many companies that install the systems dont use them to check 
up on employees and others may only track calls that exceed 10 
boxer said but he acknowledged the potential for going 
overboard does exist 
thats exactly what most workers fear according to elaine 
eisenman an industrial psychologist and a consultant for the 
chicago management consulting firm of rohrer hibler and replogle 
what it really comes down to is what is the definition of 
personal privacy in the work place and can there be any she 
said how many rights are you expected to give up when you show 
up for work 
the answer is pretty simple for montevecchio who believes too 
much fuss is being made over employee privacy 
we use it here and we dont have people revolting he said 
the real appeal of a call accounting system is that it gives 
executives a comprehensive look at their telephone bill which in 
some companies could be 300000 a month montevecchio said 
are workers using ordinary phone lines instead of lowcost wats 
lines are there a number of charges for hangups indicating bad 
connections should more trunk lines be added to avoid repeated 
busy signals 
when deregulation hit it forced a lot of major corporations 
and even mediumsized companies to become their own telephone 
company montevecchio said this is the biggest noncontrolled 
expense they have and theyre crying for tools to help them manage 
their telecommunications 
last year moscom sold more than 5000 call accounting systems 
in this country and in europe mostly as a supplier to big names in 
the telephone industry like american telephone amp telegraph co and 
siemens ag of west germany 
moscom estimates about 15000 of its call accounting systems are 
in use around the world the ones for pcs cost 1300 to 4500 
depending on the number of phone lines covered the older versions 
are 2500 to 7500 
the 5yearold telecommunications company based in east 
rochester has enjoyed two years of growing sales and profits after 
nearly being forced out of business by a sudden development in the 
rapidly changing telephone industry 
everything looked rosy when moscom successfully courted atampt as 
a customer and was shipping hundreds of call accounting systems a 
month to the telephone giant 
but then in 1985 moscom learned that atampt planned to offer a 
line of personal computers and hoped to sell software for them that 
would perform an array of services including call accounting 
moscom had no computer software that would do call accounting 
all it had was the computerized hardware unit 
we saw the handwriting on the wall said boxer 
in a wildly frantic six months while sales were dropping by 
nearly 50 percent the company and a consulting firm came up with a 
computer software product that could run on virtually any personal 
computer 
there were a lot of times when all of us had doubts whether we 
were going to be able to make it or not said montevecchio 
because going from where we were to where we had to be was a 
chore that a lot of us didnt relish but we had to do it 
today 60 percent of the companys sales are in computer 
software and growing most of the hardware sales are made in 
europe said boxer where the companys initial products are still 
popular 
moscom which lost 7 million in its first four years of 
business finally turned a profit of nearly 1 million in 1987 
business continues to improve in its most recent fiscal 
quarter which ended june 30 the companys profits were up 171 
percent at 480000 on sales of 25 million the overthecounter 
stock is up to 3 or 4 a share from 187 at the end of 1987 
this year the company has also started to market its first 
product using the moscom name the moscom maxnet not only does 
call accounting but also keeps track of billing and outofservice 
alarms and provides directory assistance

san diego gas amp electric co on thursday 
rejected an unsolicited 2 billion takeover offer from the parent 
of southern california edison saying it preferred to merge with 
tucson ariz electric power co 
tom paige a senior executive of the san diego utility said its 
longterm interests and its customers would be better served by the 
tucson deal which would match the tucson companys excess 
generating capacity with sdgampes burgeoning customer base 
paige vowed that san diego customers whose electric bills are 
among the highest in the nation would see rate cuts as a result of 
the proposed tucson merger 
the board has decided sdgampe should remain an independent 
company pursuing its strategic goals and controlling its own 
destiny paige said in a news release following a meeting with 
officials of sce corp parent of the huge southern california 
edison co 
edison boosted its bid by 50 million just wednesday bringing 
the value of the stockswap proposal to approximately 215 
billion and edison officals angrily denounced the rejection 
saying their offer would remain in effect 
it is unbelievable that sdgampes management and board of 
directors turned down scecorps offer said howard p allen 
chairman and chief executive officer 
he suggested sce would continue to press its offer when state 
regulators are asked to approve the tucson merger 
an acquisition by edison which serves most of southern 
california and parts of central california would have created the 
nations biggest electrical utility with 48 million customers and 
a 54000squaremile territory 
edison maintained the acquisition made more sense than the 
tucson deal because the companys service areas adjoin and because 
edison has access to vast amounts of power generated throughout the 
west 
edison also vowed to cut sdgampe customers rates by 10 percent 
paige said he was skeptical that could be done 
the tucson deal would involve an exchange of some 19 billion 
worth of stock and leave sdgampe the surviving company 
sdgampe officials have said previously the deal made sense because 
of tucson electrics excess generating capcity sdgampe produces 
relatively little power choosing instead to buy it from other 
utilities 
sdgampe serves one of the states fastestgrowing areas northern 
san diego county and would provide a ready market for tucson 
electrics power 
edisons latest offer would give sdgampe shareholders 1225 shares 
of stock instead of the 12 shares of edison made in an offer aug 
19 and the 115 shares in the initial bid

jack ransom thinks his new big blue wine 
is user friendly but his old employer international business 
machines corp isnt so sure 
ransoms product has everything and nothing to do with ibm 
which has long borne the corporate nickname big blue 
ransom who left ibm in 1969 takes obvious delight in what he 
calls a joking marketing strategy for wines now available in 
several parts of new york state where there are large 
concentrations of ibm workers 
to have the audacity to put their name on a wine label gives 
us an enormous amount of pleasure said ransom who worked for 16 
years at ibm starting in 1953 
but ibm doesnt seem too pleased the company first tried to 
ignore it by saying it had no formal connection to the name big 
blue this week the giant changed its tune 
we have some concerns mainly because of infringement on a 
trademark said ibm spokeswoman rita black at the armonk ny 
headquarters its conceivable that there may be some 
infringement because ibm has a product itself called big blue its 
a typewriter ribbon 
the second area of concern centers around the big blue label 
which uses bar lettering similar to the letter style used in ibms 
corporate logo black said that logo and its design we want to 
protect 
at this moment basically were looking at it if its 
necessary well take some appropriate actions black said 
frankly im surprised said ransom who said he found the 
inspiration for the new label in a club of exibmers that goes by 
the same name big blue 
the club was incorporated in texas last year by thomas spain of 
stamford conn ransom said he got the idea after a call from spain 
asking him to join the club a small percentage of the sales is 
donated to the club 
a little controversy doesnt hurt as long as it doesnt come 
to anything ransom said its hard for me to believe that ibm 
could do anything 
both ransom and spain are emphatic about their love for their 
former employer 
there is a strong respect and deep abiding almost love for 
ibm in the club spain said ibm is a culture and we are all 
products of this culture 
while ibm isnt impressed with ransoms marketing strategy his 
tactics have been viewed as genius by others who say the biggest 
problem with new york wines is that nobody knows about them 
i think its terrific said james trezise of the new york 
wine grape association its an ideal example of niche 
marketing 
ransom two years ago bought the chateau georges winery about 80 
miles north of new york city in the hudson valley so it was a 
perfect fit for the club to have its own wine 
it went on sale this july and what began as tongueincheek fun 
surpassed ransoms wildest expectations he sold 800 cases in one 
month a supply he had thought would last six months 
while he created and started a number of businesses with his own 
firm capital structures inc ransom says the only one he ever 
wanted to run himself is the winery which produced 25000 gallons 
of wine last year ransom hopes to double output this year 
big blue offers compatible white at 675 interface blush 6 
and homestead red at 750 are among 13 other premium wines 
ransoms wine company rivendell is selling this year

a plunge in stock prices on the tokyo market 
rippled through london and new york on thursday as investors 
worried about inflation and rising global interest rates 
the decline in tokyos highflying market was the third biggest 
of 1988 and contributed to a 2934point decline in the dow jones 
average of 30 industrial stocks to 200231 
drops in key market indexes amounted to 16 percent in tokyo 
13 percent in london and 14 percent in new york meanwhile the 
dollar leveled off from its recent rise and bond prices were little 
changed 
the worlds central banks have been raising interest rates to 
keep their economies from overheating the higher rates tend to 
siphon money away from stocks into interestbearing investments 
such as government bonds 
economists are divided over whether the world economy is running 
so hard that there is a risk of runaway prices 
i dont see the inflation pressure and the wage pressure that 
the markets are worried about aubrey h zaffuto an economist at 
ibj schroder bank amp trust co in new york said thursday 
the bond market is usually the canary in the coal mine when it 
comes to reacting to whiffs of inflation and rising rates but in a 
switch bonds held up fairly well while stocks were sliding 
the bond market seems to be holding in like a rock so why the 
equity market is jittery i dont know ms zaffuto said 
the japanese yen fell against the dollar to its lowest point in 
nine months on wednesday after the bank of japan said it did not 
intend to raise its discount rate a key rate charged on loans to 
banks 
when japanese stocks plunged thursday some analysts said it was 
partly because investors decided after the yens drop that the bank 
of japan would be forced to raise the discount rate after all 
higher rates could prick the bubble of high japanese stock 
prices which would be particularly unwelcome at a time when the 
government is trying to ensure a high sales price for its huge 
offering of shares in nippon telegraph and telephone corp 
japans low inflation rate takes off pressure to raise rates 
for one thing it means the central bank can tolerate a decline in 
the yen without worrying that it will raise import prices and push 
up the general price level 
however japan is supposed to help keep currency rates roughly 
stable as part of the agreement of the group of seven major 
industrial democracies 
the bank of japan might intervene to sell dollars or raise 
domestic rates if the dollar climbs to 138 or 140 yen from its 
current level of a little more than 136 yen said david resler 
chief financial economist of nomura securities international inc 
in new york 
theyre not ready to use their ammunition yet he said 
us officials have seemed willing to tolerate a rise in the 
dollar because dollar strength helps hold down inflation and 
interest rates but in the long run after the november elections 
the strength of the dollar could worsen the trade deficit by 
making american products more expensive in world markets 
some traders and analysts expressed anxiety that the government 
would report on friday a drop in the unemployment rate a sign that 
the economy could be growing too rapidly 
in that case the federal reserve might be convinced to take the 
politically unpopular step of raising rates again before the 
election to cool off a boom stage economy said edward j 
campbell a senior economist for brown brothers harriman amp co 
but ms zaffuto said that seemed unlikely or at least 
unjustified 
i dont think rates in the united states have to go up any 
more for domestic considerations she said

thursday in quiet us trading reflecting reluctance by money 
brokers to speculate ahead of a marketmoving unemployment report 
and the long labor day weekend 
gold prices fell slightly in new york after rising abroad 
republic national bank quoted bullion at 42975 a troy ounce as of 
4 pm edt vs 43030 late wednesday 
the dollars mild decline in the united states came after it 
steadied in europe and rose sharply in japan a carryover from the 
us currencys large advance on wednesday when the bank of japan 
suggested it would limit domestic interest rate increases that 
news had sent the japanese yen plunging 
foreign exchange analysts attributed the dollars behavior 
thursday to money traders who sold the currency to reduce their 
speculative positions given the uncertainty over the impact of a 
government report scheduled for friday on august unemployment

critics of the suzuki samurai have failed to 
demonstrate the sportutility vehicle has an excessive tendency to 
roll over federal regulators said thursday in denying a recall 
petition 
the national highway traffic safety administration did however 
begin proceedings to establish standards to protect drivers of all 
lightduty vehicles against unreasonable risk of rollover 
consumers union the publisher of consumer reports magazine 
called for a ban on the samurai in june saying the vehicle 
literally trips over its own feet 
more than 150000 of the vehicles have been sold in th united 
states 
nhtsa rejected a petition by the center for auto safety a 
publicinterest group often at odds with the auto industry and its 
regulators asking for a safety recall of the samurai 
the rollover crash involvement of the samurai appears to be 
within the range of most other light utility vehicles the agency 
said rollovers where they have occurred often appear to have 
been influenced by adverse driver and environmental factors such 
as highrisk driving maneuvers drinking low ambient light and 
lack of driver familiarity with either the vehicle or the road 
the samurais rollover rate based on a study of 1986 and 
1987model vehicles was six per 100000 vehicles nhtsa said the 
ford bronco ii by comparison had a rollover rate of about 19 per 
100000 vehicles the general motors s10 blazer and s15 jimmy had 
a rollover rate identical to the samurais 
american suzuki motor corp the japanese automakers us 
subsidiary said it claimed victory in its defense of the 
4wheeldrive suzuki samurai 
nhtsas decision supports claims the samurai is safe and 
should put to rest the inaccurate and misleading attacks on the 
vehicle suzuki said in brea calif it said it was pleased 
that the unfounded and inaccurate accusations about the samurai 
made by socalled consumer groups did not color nhtsas judgement 
on this matter 
the center for auto safety said it would file a petition asking 
nhtsa to reconsider its decision 
despite 113 rollovers 120 injuries and 25 deaths nhtsa 
refuses to order a recall because it finds other utility vehicles 
are also hazardous the center said if this were the law 
then the justice department would refuse to prosecute one mass 
murderer because there are other mass murderers 
a telephone recording said consumer unions offices in mount 
vernon ny were closed 
the highway safety agency granted a petition by the consumers 
union to start research aimed at drafting regulations to guard 
against rollovers 
the petition does not purport to isolate a single cause of 
rollover nhtsa said in fact it acknowledges that there are 
factors other than a vehicles stability factor which play a 
role in rollover causation 
the agency listed 10 research projects into vehicle stability it 
had completed or planned to complete 
nhtsa cautioned that granting the consumers unions petition 
does not necessarily mean that a rule will be issued

zenith electronics corp the last usowned 
television manufacturer on thursday proposed a standard for 
futuristic television it said would deliver the full promise of the 
technology 
zenith engineers submitted their proposal to the federal 
communications commissions advisory committee on advanced 
television services the action came thursday as the fcc took 
several steps to allow work on highdefinition television to 
proceed 
zenith said its proposal meets all the criteria laid out by the 
fcc in particular it will not spoil the signal received by people 
who stick with their current models of televisions 
zenith based in glenview ill has stayed in tv manufacturing 
even after the market has been largely taken over by japanese 
south korean and european companies the company is reportedly 
mulling the sale of the business to a foreign company or a group 
representing unionized employees 
about 20 proposed standards have been submitted to the fcc but 
zenith said its proposal is the best because it is less susceptible 
to problems 
the audio signals and lowfrequency portion of the video signals 
would be sent in digital form cutting down on the amount of power 
required to transmit them and thus reducing the problems of 
interference 
the format would make it possible to use channels that are now 
kept empty to avoid interference from neighboring channels it 
would make available about twice as many vhf channels and six times 
as many uhf channels making it possible to offer the 
magazinequality pictures and compact diskquality sound of the new 
generation of television zenith said
