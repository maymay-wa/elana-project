firefighters put out a fire in a tanker car 
monday night and authorities allowed 2000 evacuees to return home 
for the first time since two freight trains crashed headon and 
derailed 
police chief britt adair said the fire was extinguished about 5 
pm and the residents of northeast altoona were allowed back in 
their homes about a half hour later 
the two iowa interstate railroad trains one of which included 
two tanker cars carrying as much as 20000 gallons each of volatile 
denatured alcohol collided shortly before noon saturday two 
crewmen were killed and their bodies were recovered monday after 
the last fire was out 
the chief investigator said monday the probe was centering on 
whether one of the trains was off schedule 
fire coming from one of the cars had burned out by monday but 
authorities waited to allow residents to return because of the 
danger of explosion from the second tanker 
flames shot up to 20 feet over the weekend but had shrunk to 
about 1 feet by monday morning 
if it fireballed it would kill anything within its path for a 
quarter mile with devastating effects up to a half mile and the 
capability of throwing shrapnel from the cars a mile and a half 
thats why we evacuated a mile and a half surrounding it said 
adair thats with one of them exploding and we had two burning 
at one time 
bulldozers and cranes were picking through the debris and 
clearing the tracks of the 86 derailed cars 
its a situation where one of the engines rode up over the 
other one in a headon collision went clear up in the air and 
it just completely annihilated two engines the police chief 
said there is metal and twisted debris and wheels thrown all 
over the place 
he said workers had removed about 16 hopper cars by 
midafternoon monday and that the rail line could be open to 
traffic by midnight if the two tankers could be removed without 
problems 
investigators were trying to determine how the two trains came 
to be on the same track edward dobranetski who heads the national 
transportation safety board investigating team said the two 
surviving crewmen and other rail workers were interviewed monday 
dobranetski said his inquiry has not determined whether one 
train left early or whether the other was running late the 
westbound train was to have cleared the track by 1156 am while 
the eastbound train wasnt scheduled to leave altoona until 1201 
pm he said 
investigators examined the controls of the wrecked eastbound 
train and found nothing out of order said dobranetski the 
emergency brake was being applied he added 
the crash killed william peers 54 of des moines and larry 
buckingham jr 35 of winterset both longtime employees of the 
railroad their bodies were located under the two derailed tankers 
but had not been recovered earlier because of the danger of 
explosion 
rail officials said the eastbound council bluffschicago train 
was pulling 78 cars while the westbound train was pulling eight 
cars from newton to des moines 
the two employees on the eastbound train jumped to safety before 
the trains collided both victims were on the westbound train 
he had an obviously dangerous job he left home thousands of 
times and came back thousands of times said peers son dan 
this time he didnt 
they all worry about something like this happening said 
buckinghams widow la voy but he was always more worried about 
someone else getting hurt at the crossings in a car or truck

amish farmer elam swartzentruber 
believes he has something better than electricity and technology to 
help him through the worst drought in more than 50 years faith and 
brotherhood 
swartzentruber better known by his amish neighbors as elam 
e is one of approximately 30000 amish residents in ohio 
15000 of them involved in farming 
the amish a protestant group formed in a split with the 
mennonites in 17th century switzerland believe in simplicity they 
dress plainly are forbidden to have electricity in their homes and 
do not use motorized equipment on their farms 
it is that difference from the way the english work the land 
that has protected the amish and mennonites from financial ruin 
during the drought that is plaguing the midwest the mennonites 
also follow simple ways but are permitted to use some modern 
technology 
amish and mennonite farmers in eastern ohio say they have lost 
about half of this years hay crop and have seen a marked decrease 
in the quality and size of their oat and corn crops 
but swartzentruber 52 of millersburg in holmes county said he 
expects no longterm financial problems because he does not have 
the debt other farmers must repay and he said he always pays cash 
for grain and seed 
i dont talk too good but i farm good swartzentruber said 
in his thick german accent this is the worst ive seen it ever 
but i think it wont get any worse 
he said the drought has not hurt his dairy cattle or feeder hogs 
and he expects to make a profit selling milk but next years feed 
prices likely will rise making it tougher to make ends meet 
the amish have been hurt by the drought but not as much as 
you would think said lloyd miller a local expert on the people 
and their customs 
miller left the old order amish years ago but is considered a 
close friend and liaison by the amish and mennonites 
they often do things in addition to farming such as 
woodworking and because they are so thrifty they have money put 
away for emergencies miller said 
they may look poor but that does not necessarily mean they 
are he said 
jonas miller a mennonite who farms 100 acres near 
fredericksburg also is an auctioneer at the weekly mount hope farm 
supply sale raises registered european haflinger horses and sells 
deer hides 
he said he attended a recent auction that did not end until 10 
hours later than normal 
people including the amish and mennonites were panicking 
selling everything that doesnt make them money jonas miller 
said but not me my father always told me when everybody runs 
just walk 
i was lucky i bought a lot of hay in april it wasnt 
foresight it was just luck but you can be sure im hanging on to 
it 
jonas miller who is not related to lloyd miller grows corn 
hay and oats and raises dairy cows and hogs he said only half of 
his oats and hay crops have come in he does not hold much hope for 
his corn 
i will lose a lot of money but i as we all do have tried 
to operate as sharply as i could said the 52yearold farmer 
abraham yoder an old order farmer who works 95 acres near mount 
hope with his five young sons said the situation there is not as 
bad as he first thought 
at first it looked like we werent getting any corn now it is 
looking like were going to get half a crop he said 
he said his second hay cutting which normally yields 3500 
bales this year produced 2600 his milk production is down as is 
his profit from the sale of pigs 
the three farmers all said the drought will not take too large a 
toll on the community because they take care of each other 
an amish farmer lost his barn two weeks ago when it was hit by 
lightning but jonas miller said area mennonite and amish farmers 
were organizing a barnraising that would not end until the barn is 
reconstructed

the flame of a white candle is blown out and 
over a background of rhythmic black chanting an announcer tells 
viewers dont let south africa keep the world in the dark 
the television spot paid for by the canadian government is the 
only statesponsored message of its kind ever used to fight 
apartheid 
its being broadcast in toronto as part of a rekindle the 
light festival surrounding a meeting of eight commonwealth 
foreign ministers that starts today and will examine ways to combat 
white rule in south africa 
theres a public forum film premiere and exhibition of photos 
and posters banned in south africa tonight during a jazz concert 
on the shores of lake ontario thousands will be asked to light an 
antiapartheid candle those at home are invited to put a candle in 
their window 
we think we can make a difference said foreign minister joe 
clark referring to the dominance canada gives to the south african 
issue in its foreign policy 
the twoday meeting of the special committee of foreign 
ministers will consider 
canadian proposals for countering south african censorship and 
propaganda through measures including the beaming of shortwave 
radio broadcasts into the country from neighboring states 
a review of the effectiveness of economic sanctions against 
south africa and ways to broaden them 
a study of pretorias international financial links including 
gold sales continued access to loans and the effects of corporate 
divestment from south africa 
and a report by nigerias former head of state maj gen 
olusegun obasanjo on the military needs of black frontline states 
there will not be dramatic progress on any question here 
its not that kind of a meeting clark said monday explaining 
that any recommendations must go to the entire 49nation 
commonwealth which meets again in malaysia next year 
the foreign ministers committee was established at the last 
commonwealth summit in vancouver in october 1987 and envoys taking 
part come from australia canada guyana india nigeria tanzania 
zambia and zimbabwe 
britain whose colonial past links all member countries is 
conspicuously absent because prime minister margaret thatcher 
opposes sanctions against south africa 
the british are on board however when it comes to military 
training to neighboring mozambique and zimbabwe noted commonwealth 
secretary general shridath ramphal 
ramphal said he hoped the meeting establishes the machinery 
for more military training canada ruled out anything but 
nonlethal aid 
ramphal had reservations about canadian proposals for countering 
south african news censorship he said it was too 
onedimensional to beam more news into the country when getting 
news out is more urgent 
we have not been as energetic in getting the truth out by 
nonconventional means and sources as the western media has been in 
afghanistan he said 
south african stateofemergency regulations in effect since 
1986 restrict reporting about unrest security force actions 
treatment of detainees some forms of protest and a broad range of 
statements the government considers subversive enforcement of the 
regulations has not been comprehensive 
under apartheid south africas 5 million whites control the 
economy and government and live apart from the 26 million blacks 
who have no vote in national affairs

the shadow of unemployment hangs over the 
lenin shipyard in gdansk birthplace of the solidarity trade union 
and once a showpiece of polish industry 
the trouble this time is not labor unrest but whether the 
stateowned yard will keep operating in the face of mounting money 
problems and a government that says it is ready to begin shutting 
down financially ailing plants 
solidarity activists discount the possibility that the yard will 
shut down but management and representatives of official worker 
organizations believe it is a real possiblity 
a strike at the yard may 210 led by solidarity leader lech 
walesa ended without a settlement workers were demanding free 
trade unions and higher wages 
during the strike management announced that it was unable to 
qualify for new state subsidies or credits from the national bank 
and it said the yards future would have to be decided by the 
ministry of industry 
we are going on with production without a single zloty less 
than a penny in the cash box the weekly newspaper zycie 
gospodarcze recently quoted shipyard director czeslaw tolwinski as 
saying the newspaper described the yard as a giant on partly 
rotten legs 
the shipyard is a jumbled heap of docks aging buildings and 
huge cranes towering over a series of vistula river tributaries and 
canals near the heart of this centuriesold baltic port city 
it will produce only 11 ships this year down from the annual 
high of 27 that it made in the late 1970s 
the number of workers too has dropped with only about 5000 
involved in direct production 
ironically says yard foreign trade manager ireneusz kubiczek 
the yard could produce more ships and has customers clamoring for 
them but a lack of manpower is preventing it from exploiting its 
physical capacity 
whether the yard makes or loses money is a debatable question 
because so much depends on arbitrarily set tax regulations 
material costs and credit rates which fluctuate widely and are 
beyond the shipyards control said jerzy bukowicz president of 
the workers selfmanagement council the councils job is to help 
run the shipyard along with management 
but in a sign of confidence 11 hulls were launched this year in 
order to have work for next year he said 
officials say the strike cost 500000 hours of labor which must 
be made up by overtime and higher productivity workers got pay 
increases june 1 but management says the increases were planned 
before the strike 
the increases were slightly higher than the 40 percent raise the 
government said could be allowed in response to price increases 
imposed this year pay now averages about 50000 zlotys 111 a 
month and is structured to provide incentive for harder workers 
said waldemar langer a leader of the yards official trade union 
despite the improvement the yards main trouble is that it 
cannot attract a sufficient work force said kubiczek 
we have lost 5000 workers from the early 1980s until now 
he said it is our own neartragedy we have survived the most 
difficult years of the crisis in shipbuilding and now the market 
is reviving and we have clients willing to place orders 
as an example kubiczek cited a timbercarrying ship ordered by 
the soviet union the yard has been able to contract to produce 
only 12 of the vessels while the soviets need 150 he said 
the soviet union is by far the yards biggest customer a sign 
inside the 343acre facility says 575 out of 881 ships produced 
there have been for the soviets 
with more workers the yard could nearly double production 
kubiczek said 
but instead workers are going to smaller private companies or 
cooperatives where they can make more money and work indoors 
as a stateowned company said kubiczek the shipyard is unable 
to raise wages dramatically because it would be hit with a punitive 
tax designed to fight wage inflation it is one example of how 
national economic policies have hurt the yard he said 
polands frequently changing strategies to deal with its ailing 
economy have taken a toll in other ways he said 
at least once a year every year we are confronted with a new 
set of regulations and modifications of these rules for economic 
reform while our commitments extend out many years ahead 
it makes it practically impossible to predict whether the 
contract we sign today which seems to be profitable will in fact 
be practical he said 
one of the people who does not believe the yard will close is 
longtime gdansk solidarity activist bogdan borusewicz 
first of all someone has to build ships for the russians 
secondly nobody really knows whether the gdansk shipyard is making 
profit or losing money because the prices for materials and 
components such as steel plating and engines are not market 
prices really he said 
the yard has a history of worker militancy in december 1970 
protests over food prices an unknown number of employees were 
fatally shot by security forces a towering monument to them 
erected outside the main gate was one result of the august 1980 
strike at the yard that catapulted solidarity and walesa to 
worldwide fame 
the inconclusive may strike showed that tensions persist 
especially among younger workers 
indeed a decision to close the yard would likely set off a new 
round of unrest 
it is my firm belief that the workers themselves would not 
allow it said grzegorz szrejder a 27yearold welder active in 
solidarity

us and soviet diplomats opened talks sunday on 
southern africa and its racial conflicts in preparation for a new 
round of fournation negotiations aimed at bringing peace to the 
region 
cuban angolan south african and us delegations are to resume 
talks here tuesday on the future of angola and southwest africa a 
territory controlled by south africas whiteminority governmet 
that session is scheduled to last three days and is the fifth 
publicly announced round since negotiations were started in london 
last april 
chester crocker us assistant secretary of state for african 
affairs conferred with soviet deputy foreign minister anatoly 
adamishin for 3 hours sunday at the soviet mission no details 
were given of their their talks that are set to end monday 
the fournation conference will attempt to build on a set of 
principles initialed by cuba angola and south africa at a meeting 
july 13 in new york 
that accord commits the parties to seek a timetable for south 
africa to relinquish control over southwest africa also known as 
namibia under a un plan for the territory to gain its 
independence 
south africa has been battling guerrillas of the southwest 
african peoples organization for control of the territory for more 
than a decade south africa accuses angolas marxist governmment of 
harboring and supporing the guerrillas and has frequently sent its 
troops into southern angola 
south africa and the united states support anticommunist 
guerrillas of the national union for the total independence of 
angola unita who have been fighting the government since they 
were defeated in a civil war by the marxists after angola won 
independence from portugal in november 1975 
cuba is participating in the talks because it has more than 
40000 military personnel in angola helping the government fight 
the rebels 
south africa has said it would not grant independence to namibia 
until the cuban forces are withdrawn south africa has administered 
namibia a former german territory since the end of world war i 
under a mandate by the defunct league of nations the united 
nations repudiated that mandate and south africa rejected un 
resolutions calling for indpendence and free elections in the 
territory 
crocker on july 20 called the agreement on principles an 
important step but said there are a great many hard and difficult 
compromises to be achieved 
previous rounds in the talks included sessions in london cairo 
and new york and a meeting of top military officers from the four 
sides in the cape verde islands

with a few minutes to spare in a long 
campaign day michael dukakis stopped by the harmony early learning 
center to shake a few hands with preschoolers 
looking to campaign on a tight preconvention budget george bush 
a day later rode out to tysons corner va in the washington 
suburbs to do the same thing tossing a foam ball and pushing 
youngsters on a tire swing 
for both it was time well spent dukakis was rewarded with 
prominent photographs in newspapers and the television networks 
and bush reaped similar coverage 
the twin events on the presidential campaign trail last week 
underscored what already has become apparent to both campaigns 
child care is a hot issue in the 1988 race for the white house 
its politics dictated by demographics the census bureau says 
more than half of new mothers go back to work before their children 
are a year old 
neither party wants to find itself outmaneuvered on the issue 
dukakis the democratic nominee and bush who will become the 
republican nominee in less than three weeks have introduced 
competing proposals on day care 
the proposals reflect their differing philosophies on government 
involvement yet importantly both candidates support in principle 
some form of government initiatives to assist parents in providing 
care for their young children 
we can ignore the fact that most women with small children now 
hold jobs or we can work to make quality affordable child care 
available to every family that needs it dukakis said 
you have to have choice parental choice family choice and 
you have to have diversity bush said 
the vice presidents plan is basically a 1000perchild tax 
break for lowincome parents of children 4 and under 
it would cost an estimated 22 billion a year and in its first 
stages would benefit only families earning less than 12000 a 
year according to bush domestic affairs adviser deborah steelman 
eventually families earning up to 20000 would benefit 
bushs plan generally would exclude the middleclass families 
that pay 100 a week or so to put a child in the centers the two 
presidential candidates visited last week in new jersey and 
virginia 
dukakis plan according to his aides largely is embodied in 
legislation now before congress that is similar to day care 
assistance being provided in his own state of massachusetts it is 
aimed at helping low and moderateincome families afford child 
care and would reserve 75 percent of its money for that aid 
states could use the rest to encourage developing and upgrading 
centers through grants it would establish standards for care and 
states would have to match a portion of the federal money 
it isnt just that day care isnt affordable its that it 
isnt available said dukakis aide victoria rideout 
the legislation would cost an estimated 25 billion but 
dukakis has stopped short of committing himself to paying that full 
amount instead saying that would be only a goal 
until i walk into the office and take a good hard look at the 
books its impossible to put an exact dollar figure on it he 
said 
dukakis aides fault the bush plan because it provides money with 
the filing of tax returns not when money is spent paying day care 
bills 
dukakis also objects to permitting the tax credit for all who 
are eligible even if the family keeps the child at home and he 
says bush would pile a tax break on top of his proposed cut in 
capital gains 
bush contends however that offering the tax break to all 
families who qualify would help parents who chose to have one 
spouse stay at home 
i am absolutely convinced he problem is so big and so diverse 
that the federal government alone cannot have a bricks and mortar 
child care program thats going to be effective bush said

michael dukakis has drawn some large 
crowds in the two campaign swings hes taken since leaving atlanta 
as the democratic presidential nominee invariably he has 
attracted protesters too 
at virtually every stop in his campaign travels dukakis has 
been confronted by demonstrators sometimes numbering no more than 
a dozen but always vocal most carry signs and chant slogans 
objecting to the right of women to have abortions 
often mixed with them are signs supporting republican george 
bush and there are occasional signs attacking dukakis record in 
massachusetts such as the one in sturtevant wis last week that 
said michael dukakis the criminals choice go home it 
referred to the program since modified allowing prison furloughs 
for some convicted murderers in massachusetts 
the presence of antiabortion protesters recalls the campaign in 
1984 of vice presidential nominee geraldine ferraro who faced 
similar demonstrations at many speeches dukakis campaign staffers 
many of whom are veterans of the mondaleferraro effort say they 
and their candidate are not bothered or surprised by the protesters 
we expect them at every event said jim steinberg dukakis 
senior issues adviser who travels with the candidate 
the largest gathering numbering 100 or more confronted dukakis 
as he went to church on sunday a week ago in st louis in 
secaucus nj last week the dozen or so protesters positioned 
themselves so close behind the stage that their chants were picked 
up by the public address system and dukakis had to walk right by 
them as he left 
in sturtevant a day later a larger group chanted slogans 
throughout his speech and dukakis appeared to have been put off 
his stride by the distraction 
was he rattled 
rattled i didnt feel rattled did i look rattled i didnt 
feel rattled did i look rattled terribly rattled 
let me tell you if you went through the kind of governorship 
i went through in the first four years as governor of 
massachusetts thats a day at the beach added dukakis he was 
turned out of office after that turbulent first term in 1978 then 
regained it four years later

the republican national convention should help 
george bush cut into michael dukakis advantage in the public 
opinion polls if historical trends hold up political analysts say 
several national political pollsters said they expected dukakis 
would enjoy a surge in the polls coming out of the democratic 
national convention and they said that would be in keeping with 
past postconvention poll trends 
but these experts also said that because of this tendency for 
candidates to get a public opinion lift from all of the exposure 
bush should be able to use the gop extravaganza in new orleans aug 
1518 to help his standing 
while bush could take some solace from such a boost analysts 
noted that history often has shown these postconvention spurts to 
be shortlived 
for the moment dukakis has a commanding lead he was ahead by 
17 percentage points in two polls last week 18 points in two 
others survey results just before the july 1822 convention had 
ranged from a dead heat to a slim dukakis lead 
but what would have been a remarkable surge any other week was 
routine by postconvention standards conventions traditionally 
boost the nominee by 10 or more points mainly because of the 
intense positive exposure they provide 
the bounce dukakis got seems to be pretty typical of what 
weve seen in the past three elections said larry hugick 
political poll chief for the gallup organization it would be 
remarkable if he didnt get a bounce 
the polls are accurate the question is are they predictive 
of what will happen on election day said harrison hickman a 
democratic pollster there is no question that the race will 
tighten up 
if getting the bounce is easy keeping it is not gallup polls 
in recent elections showed convention surges settling as the 
campaigns progressed and voters began paying more attention to the 
issues 
jimmy carter went from a 17percentagepoint lead over 
president ford before the 1976 democratic convention to a 33point 
lead after it but within a month his lead was down to 13 points 
and he won in november by just 21 points 
in 1980 ronald reagan went from a 3point lead over carter 
before the republican convention to a 16point lead after it a 
month later it was a tie though reagan went on to win by 97 
percentage points 
in 1984 walter mondale moved up from a 14point deficit before 
the convention to a 2point deficit just after it but ronald 
reagan soon made it back and won the election by a landslide 182 
points 
with that history in mind dukakis pollster irwin harrison said 
he viewed the bounce more as an opportunity than an accomplishment 
the idea is to work as hard as you can to solidify what you got 
from the convention he said 
conversely the bounce puts pressure on the bush campaign to 
counterpunch effectively at the republican national convention this 
month 
if bush cannot match dukakis postconvention poll bounce it 
certainly does not augur well for an election success said lance 
tarrance a republican pollster based in houston 
if they dont bring enough back to cancel out that bounce from 
the democrats then theyre digging themselves into a deeper 
hole tarrance said theyll have to rely on a more negative 
campaign a risky fall strategy that could alienate voters 
the republicans task could be tough hickman the democratic 
pollster said the nominee of the party in power often gains less 
of a convention boost because he generally is well known and has 
fewer voters to persuade 
hickman also noted another historical pattern in eight of the 
past 10 presidential elections the summertime leader went on to 
win 
youre better off if youre the candidate whos made the 
first good impression he said

two former republican congressmen 
including one who says that if aids isnt the wrath of god it 
should be are battling for a chance to topple liberal democratic 
sen donald riegle 
but neither jim dunn nor robert huber has managed to generate 
much enthusiasm and both are financing their campaigns largely with 
their own money 
in contrast riegle michigans senior senator has 4 million 
in campaign funds wide backing and a 22year record in washington 
as he faces tuesdays democratic primary unopposed 
dunn and huber want to make riegles liberal voting record the 
issue a strategy the 50yearold riegle likes because he sees that 
as one of his strong points as he seeks a third sixyear term 
i think the experience that ive developed in the congress and 
some of the things weve helped accomplish helping the farmers 
hurt by floods two years ago and saving chrysler and saving 
social security these are all things where i took a leadership 
role and we got things done he said 
he also emphasizes that hes expected to become chairman of the 
senate banking housing and urban affairs committee if he is 
reelected nov 8 
dunn and huber contend riegles record including a 100 percent 
score in a recent voting survey by the liberal public policy group 
americans for democratic action means his views arent in line 
with those of most michigan voters 
hes a big spender hes voted for cutting defense and for 
giving up the panama canal and that turned out to be a big 
disaster said huber hes been taking campaign funds from all 
over the united states those are things i think people are going 
to be pretty fed up with 
a detroit free presswxyztv poll released july 18 showed that 
of the likely republican voters 55 percent hadnt decided which 
candidate they would support in the primary 
that is reflected in the financing for the two campaigns 
contributions to hubers campaign between april 1 and july 13 
totaled 846 he has loaned his campaign 221000 
dunn reported contributions of 39283 and has loaned his 
campaign more than 224000 some of which has been paid back 
huber a conservative making his fourth try for the nomination 
has portrayed himself as a staunch reagan republican specifically 
hes for preserving federal income tax cuts a strong defense 
using more federal muscle in the war on drugs and against abortion 
aids came to the fore after dunn mentioned it in a radio 
interview last week as a subject about which he and his opponent 
differed 
i take a reasonable rational i think very responsible 
approach to the problems that face this nation dunn said mr 
huber has said that the reason people have aids is the wrath of 
god punishment from god of homosexuals and drug users 
jim dunn does not think aids is the wrath of god he said 
later 
huber asked about dunns remarks said i dont know whether 
its the wrath of god but if it isnt it should be 
huber 65 has been the mayor of the detroit suburb of troy a 
state senator and a congressman he was defeated in a reelection 
bid in 1974 by nowgov james blanchard 
dunn 44 an east lansing homebuilder holds more moderate 
views during his term in congress 198182 dunn supported most of 
reagans tax cut and budget reduction policies but often opposed 
the administration on social issues and cuts in aid to college 
students 
observers favor dunn in the primary because he has the support 
of most of the gop regulars and moderates 
the free presswxyz poll found huber ahead of dunn 26 percent 
to 19 percent but dunns lead was within the polls margin of 
error of 84 percentage points and both trailed the number 
undecided this portion of the july 1113 telephone survey was 
conducted among 137 people who described themselves as likely 
republican primary voters 
another portion of the poll found riegle had a 51 percent to 19 
percent lead over either dunn or huber with 30 percent of the 
voters undecided that survey of 598 people who described 
themselves as likely primary voters had a margin of error of 4 
percentage points

congress is poised this week to give final 
approval to legislation providing more than 1 billion to 
japaneseamericans who were forced from their homes and sent to 
internment camps during world war ii 
the house is expected to approve the bill on wednesday sending 
it to the white house where president reagan is likely to sign it 
into law 
if all goes according to that schedule japaneseamericans who 
qualify should start getting individual 20000 taxfree payments 
in about a year the most elderly will be given priority for the 
first payments 
enactment of the reparations bill will help end the nearly 
halfcenturyold controversy over how the united states treated its 
japaneseamerican population after japan attacked pearl harbor 
hawaii on dec 7 1941 
about 120000 us citizens and resident aliens of japanese 
descent were singled out unlike americans of german or italian 
descent and sent to internment camps for the duration of the war 
in addition to losing their freedom some of the internees lost 
jobs and possessions and were forced to sell homes at belowmarket 
prices in the years immediately after the war some were 
reimbursed for direct losses such as impounded property but 
efforts to provide an acrosstheboard payment were delayed for 
decades 
in 1980 congress authorized a federal commission on wartime 
relocation and internment of civilians to study the issue in 
december 1982 it released the results of its investigation 
including a recommendation that each camp survivor be given a 
20000 taxfree payment providing they agree to drop all related 
claims against the government 
earlier this year the house and senate accepted the 
recommendations and passed separate but slightly different bills 
providing for the money the differences were reconciled and the 
senate last week approved the compromise version without dissent 
the house should do the same this week 
once approved by the house the reparations package will go to 
the president for his signature b jay cooper deputy white house 
press secretary said following senate approval that they have 
improved the bill a lot a lot of our concerns have been taken care 
of 
one of those concerns was over how many years the government 
would take to make the payments the senate approved a fiveyear 
payout the white house objected claiming it would cost too much 
too soon as part of the compromise the government now can take up 
to 10 years to make the payments starting in about a year 
the housesenate proposal also authorizes payments of up to 
12000 for surviving members of the aleut indian tribes who were 
removed from the aleutian islands during the japanese attack on 
those islands in 1942 
it is most gratifying to me personally to see this long battle 
for personal justice come to an end at last said sen spark m 
matsunaga dhawaii sponsor of the senate bill 
the internment camps arose from a 1942 order by president 
franklin d roosevelt that said the war department could designate 
military areas from which people could be excluded 
later military orders resulted in the exclusion of all people of 
japanese ancestry from california washington and oregon and some 
in hawaii the orders affected 77000 us citizens and 43000 
legal and illegal resident aliens all were taken to prison camps 
in the western states 
the last camp was closed in january 1946 
in all about 120000 people of japanese ancestry were detained 
in the camps including 77000 american citizens 
an estimated 60000 are still alive and the bill would allow 
them to claim the individual 20000 payments in return for waiving 
any further wartime claims against the government 
congress already has awarded about 38 million in restitution 
payments since the passage of a 1948 evacuation claims law five 
years ago however a federal commission estimated that 
japaneseamericans had suffered losses of up to 2 billion that had 
never been compensated 
about 900 aleuts were moved from their homes and forced to live 
in abandoned mines canneries and camps about 2000 miles away 
lack of medical care and adequate food contributed to disease and 
death and many of their homes were destroyed or vandalized in 
their absence 
about 450 aleuts survive and would be eligible for the 12000 
payments another 20 million would benefit aleut villages and 
provide for scholarships and the general welfare of the tribe

although he cited age and declining health 
when he retired from the us supreme court one year ago lewis f 
powell jr shows little sign of slowing says one associate 
his idea of retirement is to stop working at 4 oclock on 
saturday afternoon said us district judge robert r merhige 
jr a longtime friend 
powell who was a richmond lawyer when he was tapped for the 
supreme court in 1972 by thenpresident richard nixon has returned 
to his hometown and now maintains a modest office in the same 
building as merhige 
powell who also keeps office hours in washington has sat with 
appellate panels on three occasions since his retirement and has 
taught at the university of virginia this spring he delivered 
commencement addresses at george mason university and washington amp 
lee his alma mater 
the only sign marking powells office at the us courthouse is 
a room number scratched above a door frame and the interior of his 
office contains no plaques citations or personal photographs 
people wonder why i have such a spartan office i love it 
powell said last week very few people find me over here which i 
regard as a plus 
powell who turns 81 this fall said he has no regrets about 
stepping down from the nations highest court even though he 
admits missing the intellectual challenge and the close association 
with other justices 
when you reach my ancient age family is far more important 
than any of the less personal things that happen to one over a long 
lifetime he said 
powell and his wife josephine have four children and seven 
grandchildren powell also describes his health as not 
vigorous since 1979 he has undergone several operations 
including removal of a cancerous prostate in 1985 
in june he was hospitalized for almost a week for treatment of 
a blood infection although his cancer has been in remission 
powell said his health prevents him and his wife of 52 years from 
extensive travel 
powell also takes a modest view of his role on the court 
although he was often seen during the 1980s as the moderate justice 
who kept the rest of the court from drifting too far in either 
direction and last year he was described by the new york times as 
a more powerful influence on the law than president reagan or chief 
justice william h rehnquist 
if i got into a footnote id be surprised powell said 
after powell retired last august he avoided comment as robert 
h bork and douglas h ginsburg failed to win senate approval as 
his successor eight months later anthony kennedy finally won 
approval 
powell refuses to pinpoint blame but strongly denounced the 
delays in replacing him 
the disappointment to me was that for the first time in many 
years the process was prolonged to the point where it was a 
disservice to the supreme court itself he said

the tourist complex at old faithful geyser had worked as planned 
and flames headed north away from the geyser sunday dillon said 
firefighters completed a containment line around 30 percent of 
the fire and hoped for full containment by wednesday he added 
because the fire was caused by man rather than lightning 
firefighters will attempt to control it 
the largest fire in the park the 68035acre clover mist did 
not grow significantly during the weekend dillon said 
elsewhere in wyoming two new fires in the bighorn national 
forest kept firefighters busy and crews in the targhee national

patches 
mary sue waxler a fire information officer said about 584 
firefighters were at the fire sunday morning about half the number 
there 24 hours earlier 
the remaining firefighters worked from the fire line to the 
center of the burned area with hand tools and other equipment 
waxler said 
basically theyre doing things like extinguishing embers and 
turning over logs to make sure that things are out she said 
the rock creek fire in the selwaybitterroot wilderness area of 
southwestern montana jumped fire lines and covered about 3000 
acres sunday said jack kendley fire information officer at the 
interagency dispatch center in helena although it was in a 
wilderness area the fire was being fought because it was 
mancaused late saturday smoke from the fire could be seen in 
helena more than 100 miles away he said 
in northwestern montana 10 to 15 people were evacuated from a 
remote ranger station in the bob marshall wilderness area when the 
gates fire spread to about 8000 acres kendley said 
that fire increased 2000 to 3000 acres in size on 
saturday kendley said the buildings at the station have been 
covered with fireproof tarps a gravityfeed sprinkler system has 
been installed on a nearby ridge and personnel and livestock have 
been evacuated from the station 
also in the bob marshall the canyon creek blaze had grown to 
15000 acres sunday he said 
in idaho ground crews cleared landing areas for helicopters 
around the 5000acre willis gulch fire so weary firefighters can 
be flown back and forth from the remote fire line in the boise 
national forest the heliports cut the walk for firefighters from 
four miles to about a half mile 
containment was expected monday evening and by late sunday a 
containment line had been thrown around 90 percent of the fires 
10mile perimeter forest officials said 
firefighters in washington continued work sunday on the 
3600acre falls creek fire along the crest of the cascades about 
12 miles northeast of mount rainier national park and a smaller 
burn in the cascade foothills 
a 75acre fire broke out late saturday in the mount hood 
national forest in oregon and and a lightning storm sparked nearly 
70 small fires in southern oregon forest spokeswomen said

lt tony rossano one of 13 city sanitation 
cops sifts through syringes blood vials and other disgusting 
debris hunting for the culprit whos dumping the infectious 
medical waste tainting beaches in five states 
its like the detective work on a murder case rossano said 
were doing interviews surveillance followup just good 
oldfashioned police work we trace every marked item we can 
these gumshoes of garbage look for names dates and places so 
they can zero in on the offending source but most of the seaborne 
slop carried by the whims of tides currents and winds either has 
no markings or waterlogged labels are unreadable 
more than 1000 items of medical waste most of it syringes used 
to inject insulin or illegal drugs have been bagged in an evidence 
trailer under particular scrutiny are people who were caught 
dumping before 
theres reason to believe we can identify the bad actors who 
are illegally dumping said brendan sexton head of the citys 
sanitation department 
it looks like repeated dumping by a smaller user said 
marlene gold who heads the sanitation departments enforcement 
team of five lawyers 13 environmental sleuths and 10 extra 
officers 
i dont think were looking at large hospitals theres no 
indication of wholesale dumping she said its just very hard 
to reconstruct what must have happened its very hard to trace 
this material were looking for people who have no regard for the 
way they handle waste 
state and federal authorities are also part of the investigation 
this summers floating filth first came ashore july 6 on a long 
island beach also contaminated are beaches in new jersey 
connecticut rhode island and massachusetts 
the refuse is mostly unmarked needles and vials several of 
which tested positive for aids antibodies and hepatitis b virus 
other items included stained bandages catheter bags colostomy 
bags respirator parts prescription bottles plastic tubing for 
intravenous drugs rubber gloves and nine dead rats 
infectious medical wastes treated like industrial trash are 
supposed to be placed in red bags to alert handlers of the 
contents no red bags have washed ashore 
state investigators believe the rubbish may have come from 
several sources illegal dumpers runoff from city storm sewers 
windswept garbage barges or sloppy handling of trash at city 
landfills 
the evidence does not point to a single incident or a single 
event as a smoking gun said rw groneman spokesman for the 
state department of environmental conservation which has 10 
environmental police on the case 
its a big ocean groneman said the midnight dumpers the 
people who might deliberately dump this stuff dont necessarily 
leave calling cards or identifying marks 
new york generates 18 million pounds of red bag waste each 
week 45 percent of which comes from new york city most of it is 
incinerated on the spot or taken out of state for disposal 
groneman said the items scoured from hundreds of miles of 
beaches would fill six shopping bags were not talking about 
wave upon wave of red bag waste he said 
groneman says that needles flushed down toilets by diabetics and 
junkies may have been carried out to sea during a heavy rain that 
overloaded the citys sewers 
other officials say beach debris may be inevitable 
from this whole episode we now understand that needles on the 
beach are part of the ecology of new york said dr stephen 
joseph the new york city health commissioner 
some seemingly promising clues have washed out 
a prescription bottle was traced to an upstate new york man and 
hopeful authorities thought they could find who handled his trash 
but the man said he lost his pills on a fishing trip at sea 
you get very excited when you see something with markings on 
it you figure you can trace it and get to the bottom of this 
thing but there are a lot of false leads said gold 
in new jersey james lyko heads a team of 13 lawyers and 25 
investigators who drive along back roads trailing garbage trucks 
videotaping work at garbage transfer stations and combing through 
litter 
we are going to nail people for deliberate dumping said 
lyko head of the states task force on environmental protection 
ocean experts say the trash may have washed out to sea from any 
number of inlets then sloshed back to a different shore 
the tides along the eastern seaboard carry things in and out 
once it goes out it mixes you dont know which inlet it came 
from said coast guard lt cmdr lawrence brooks winds 
currents rain and tide all impact on whats moving in and out 
in rhode island authorities say they have no doubt where 
unwelcome litter originated they had 75 pieces of trash including 
a prescription bottle from a woman in brooklyn and a sign they 
believe belongs to new york citys emergency medical services 
a university of rhode island computer model of winds currents 
and tides during the last 30 days indicated the garbage came from 
new york according to ronald diorio an aide to gov edward 
diprete 
it is all leading us back to the same general area new york 
city said diorio head of the states task force on medical 
wastes this is a great warning to all of us we better be 
aggressive in protecting our shoreline

gazing up at the sheer limestone 
north face of the eiger mountaineer heinrich harrer reminisced 
about the climb 50 years ago that changed his life 
in july 1938 he and three other climbers became the first to 
scale the daunting 5940foot wall in the heart of the swiss alps 
that is considered europes greatest challenge to mountaineers 
we were never afraid we never had any idea of returning or 
giving up despite difficulties during the fourday adventure the 
76yearold harrer told the associated press in a recent interview 
nine people had already died on the wall before harrer and fritz 
kasparek both austrians and andreas heckmair and ludwig voerg 
both germans set out before dawn one morning to conquer the last 
virgin face of the alps 
because of the danger authorities had outlawed attempts to 
climb the north face but the four defied the ban 
we climbed the wall secretly said harrer sitting in an 
alpine meadow with a dramatic view of the north face when we 
came down after four days we were surprised to find out that the 
whole world knew about it 
it turned out that observers had spotted them 
harrer recently returned to grindelwald a village at the base 
of the eiger for a weekend celebration with hundreds of other 
mountaineers and fans on the anniversary of the climb another 
guest of honor was 82yearold heckmair kasparek and voerg are 
both dead 
the eiger north face which juts up almost vertically above 
grindelwald lived up to its reputation that celebration weekend 
an english climber trying to scale it fell and sustained serious 
head injuries but was rescued alive by helicopter 
just saturday a 26yearold south korean was killed in a 
3300foot fall as he tried to scale the eigers north face the 
swiss air rescue service said 
the recent helicopter rescue recalled the most dramatic rescue 
from the eiger the first time a climber was rescued alive 
in 1957 before helicopters were used italian claudio corti was 
saved at an icy patch threequarters of the way up the wall but 
his countryman stefano longhi froze to death and his body hung from 
his rope out of reach of rescuers for two years 
it was only when winches were put in place in 1959 that the 
corpse could be retrieved 
harrer said that after 50 years public interest in the eiger 
and the historic first climb has actually increased 
this wall has developed a certain kind of charisma a mythical 
attraction he says 
since the 1938 climb about 700 mountaineers have successfully 
ascended the wall using various routes to get to the peak 13101 
feet above sea level 
harrer said the fact that so many have climbed the north face 
does not diminish the challenge 
fifty people have died on that wall which proves that the 
wall hasnt become easier he said 
but he added it has become easier provided you are an expert 
provided you are equipped properly provided you have prepared this 
climb and chosen the proper time to do it 
in a book he wrote about his ascent harrer tells how he and his 
partners waited for days watching the weather around the eiger 
before picking the best moment to begin their climb 
the climbers nourished themselves mostly with hot tea and cocoa 
harrer said his only solid food during the climb was a slice of 
bread and butter that his mother had given him 14 days earlier as 
he left home after taking his university exams 
i didnt tell her where i was going just that i was going 
climbing he said 
the most tense moments of the 1938 climb came on the third day 
when the mountaineers clung to the nearly vertical face to 
withstand avalanches hailstorms and snowstorms 
this is part of the eiger north wall harrer said 
he said he was not afraid once you start action you are on 
the wall you never think of any danger 
yet he said that before reaching the wall one always has some 
thoughts that you could return now it is not too late 
but its very simple if you dont overcome fear you will 
never be prepared to do something exceptional

heavy weekend rains sent a river over 
its banks and triggered a mudslide that destroyed nearly 100 houses 
in a coastal resort and left two people dead and 12 missing 
officials said 
the chichiriviche river overflowed after a downpour saturday 
night causing a mudslide that covered several of the houses up 
to their roofs civilian defense director freddy paris told the 
official news agency venpres 
there is mud up to five meters yards high it is likely 
there are more victims in there and we are working to find those 
missing he said sunday 
paris said the houses belonged to people vacationing in the 
caribbean resort 25 miles north of caracas near la guaira port 
the flooding was the worst since last september when a mudslide 
caused by a downpour in another coastal area killed hundreds of 
vacationers

forest fires even the big ones that hit 
yellowstone national park last week are an essential part of 
natures cycle of death and renewal humans unwittingly rearranged 
a lot of natures handiwork before realizing that 
we almost lost the loblolly pine in the southeast in the 
1920s and 1930s because of the insistence of the forest service in 
suppressing all fires says gene wood a wildlife ecologists at 
auburn university 
such a nofire policy lets hardwood species get established and 
once established the hardwoods can outcompete the pine wood said 
traditionally lightning or indians who set fires for hunting 
or farming would always start enough fires to keep hardwoods down 
he said 
when wisconsin was settled around 1830 twothirds of the state 
was prairie onethird forest humans fought prairie fires now the 
state is twothirds forest with special organizations trying to 
save the prairie chicken and setting fires to keep the prairie 
vigorous 
though specifics differ according to soils weather and species 
fire has been far more important in forest evolution in the arid 
west than elsewhere natural fires caused by lightning are usually 
small without harming trees very much they prevent litter from 
leaves dead limbs twigs and other organic matter from building up 
fire recycles the nutrients and you get a diversity of 
wildlife species said jim gillette deputy regional director of 
the fish and wildlife service in boston 
his agency probably sets 400 fires a year ranging from 100 
acres to 2000 acres on its 443 refuges and other installations 
in some ecosystems rigid suppression of natural fires means 
enormous amounts of fuel can accumulate on the forest floor when 
the inevitable lightning does strike the fire can be impossible to 
suppress and more destructive than anything that would have 
happened naturally 
in some areas like the great lakes damp soils kept fires from 
getting started on the forest floor when a fire would start in a 
dry cycle maybe once a century it would spread to the crowns and 
sweep all before it you have selection for species that can 
recover said wood it takes a long long time 
a fire in california sequoia tree crowns in 1955 where the 
floor normally would burn every decade or so prompted a 
reexamination of the fight every fire policy by the national 
park service 
by 1968 the service was igniting the undercover in the sequoia 
national park trying to return the forest to its natural state in 
1972 it adopted what has been called a let burn policy 
we were almost killing the trees with kindness before that 
said chief ranger walt dabney 
the new policy had been long germinating from research dating to 
the 1930s said wood some of whose research helped spread the 
gospel a lot of the old foresters and game wardens could have 
tarred and feathered me he said 
strictly speaking let burn is a misnomer dabney said the 
policy always contemplated casebycase decisions fires that 
threaten structures are always fought fires that might be left 
alone would be fought if they could spread outside the park into 
commercial timbering for example 
the use of fire by humans is exactly analogous to the use of 
human hunters to replace a predator and maintain natures balance 
gillette said 
last weeks fires in yellowstone national park which involved 
about 5 percent of the parks acreage were of a severity seen only 
once every 200 years to 400 years or so instead of fighting only 
blazes threatening park installations firefighters turned to 
attacking almost every outbreak before waiting to see what it might 
threaten it might be too late to put down the fire when its 
course became clear and it takes far fewer fighters to do that 
early 
a big fire does more than clear the floor it opens the forest 
sunlight reaches the ground creatures like owls appear living in 
forest but doing their hunting in the open area 
some tree species need fire to burst cones and scatter seeds 
seeds germinate into fledgling trees in yellowstone elk have 
nothing to eat in the mature forest but will graze on the growth 
in the open area 
in a couple of years youll see a green situation with food 
for the elk cutler said 
examples could be multiplied in northern michigan blueberry 
bushes appear after fires bears like blueberries so more bears 
appear eventually something else succeeds the blueberry bushes 
and the bears decline 
the difficulty with a letburn policy is the exceptions 
wood noted someone will always say i realize the policy but 
we cant let this one burn it would be nice if these things 
all started twothirds of the way up to the mountain and just 
burned their way to the top but they dont

a 4yearold us policy of giving trade 
preference to small caribbean nations has helped turn american 
supermarket produce counters into exotic garden spots where 
pineapples melons and other fruit are in abundant supply 
the caribbean basin economic recovery act of 1983 gave 27 
countries dutyfree access to us markets for 12 years beginning 
in 1984 
an agriculture department report takes a look at the caribbean 
basin initiative or cbi and concludes that its impact on us 
imports of 75 horticultural products has been mixed with some 
notable successes and some failures 
the report said cbi improved the competitive position of all 
but a few products that were specifically excluded such as 
selected textiles leather goods canned tuna crude and refined 
petroleum products and watch parts 
after congress passed the law in 1983 the report said there 
was a wave of optimism that led to a search for new us market 
opportunities with producers looking specifically at growth 
potential for horticultural products 
the value of horticultural products imported from cbi countries 
rose to 666 million in 1987 from 459 million in 1983 a 45 
percent increase when bananas beer and ale are excluded the 
imports of remaining products more than doubled to 1912 million 
from 911 million 
fresh pineapples accounted for about 12 percent of the 1912 
million in import value over the four years the report said other 
commodities included frozen concentrated orange juice 51 
percent cantaloupes 43 percent other melons mostly honeydews 
71 percent mangoes 25 percent and frozen broccoli 48 percent 
the 75 products reviewed accounted for about half the 1912 
million the report said products not among the 75 but still 
important as cbi exports to the united states included live 
plants peas yams sweet potatoes and dasheens or taro 
the analysis was prepared by economists boyd buxton and richard 
brown of the departments economic research service and was 
included in the august issue of agricultural outlook magazine 
nine products from the cbi countries showed strong gains after 
1983 exports to the united states of pineapples cantaloupes and 
other melons increased to more than 6000 metric tons per through 
1987 
the cbi share of us pineapple imports for example increased 
to 97 percent in 1987 from 57 percent in 1983 other melons 
increased to 45 percent from 24 percent and cantaloupes to 21 
percent from 7 percent 
costa rica and honduras were the principal sources of fresh 
pineapples while guatemala the dominican republic and panama were 
the big gainers for cantaloupe and honeydew exports the report 
said also showing strong gains were frozen broccoli fresh 
celery onions and roses largely from guatemala frozen 
concentrated orange juice mostly from belize and fresh okra from 
the dominican republic 
a category of medium gainers among 198387 imports from cbi 
countries included watermelons frozen strawberries and fresh 
strawberries from guatemala grapefruit from the bahamas mangos 
from haiti and coconut meat from the dominican republic 
the bahamas now account for 99 percent of the grapefruit 
imported from cbi countries the report said even so total 
imports account for less than 1 percent of the annual us 
grapefruit supply 
products said to show weak gains since 1983 included 
tomatoes which increased almost 1800 metric tons annually but 
were only about 1 percent of the total volume of tomatoes imported 
by the united states last year nearly all the cbi tomatoes came 
from the dominican republic 
lemon imports from the bahamas grew about 600 tons annually and 
accounted for 16 percent of total us lemon imports in 1987 up 
from only 1 percent in 1983 the report said other products 
showing weak gains were pineapple juice concentrate frozen peas 
squash garlic and peppers 
the report said products in the loser category meaning 
imports from the cbi countries declined included green beans 
cucumbers eggplant frozen cauliflower and frozen okra 
dutyfree status does not ensure success for cbi products in 
us markets the report said strong competition exists from 
mexico for many fresh vegetables and from chile and other southern 
hemisphere countries for fresh fruits and juices 
the report added competing with other regions by delivering 
fresh highquality fruits and vegetables to us markets involves 
developing a closely coordinated production processing 
transportation and distribution network 
much time and relatively large investments are needed to plan 
develop and carry out new ventures in regions such as the caribbean 
where social political and geographic handicaps as well as 
years of colonial neglect have hindered the development of dynamic 
and selfsustaining market economies the report said 
but growth in the export capability of cbi countries has begun 
and probably will continue the report said adding that congress 
has already hinted it might extend the cbi beyond the first 12year 
period to provide a longer planning horizon and investment recovery 
period

waiters cashiers and others with little control 
over demanding jobs face an added heart attack risk about as big as 
that from smoking or high cholesterol a study of nearly 5000 men 
suggests 
the study found that male workers in the top 10 percent for such 
job strain had 38 to 48 times the heart attack risk of men in 
the bottom 10 percent 
a second analysis found that men in the top 20 percent for job 
strain a list that included cooks gas station attendants and 
firemen had 25 to 33 times the risk of the rest of the workers 
studied 
each analysis gave two numbers because it was performed on two 
groups of men the true answer probably lies about halfway in 
between said robert karasek associate professor in the industrial 
and systems engineering department at the university of southern 
california 
employers may be able to redesign highstrain jobs to lower 
heart attack risk and improve productivity said karasek 
karasek reports the study in augusts american journal of public 
health along with coauthors from sweden the state university of 
new york at stony brook cornell university medical school and 
columbia university 
the results are impressive said david krantz professor of 
medical psychology at the uniformed services university of the 
health sciences in bethesda md 
job strain was defined as the result of having too little 
control over ones work to deal satisfactorily with its 
psychological demands such as having to work quickly and facing 
heavy workloads 
executives were not considered under heavy strain because they 
have control to deal with demands karasek said 
the study was based on heart attacks as reported by men in two 
federal surveys too few women with heart attacks appeared in those 
surveys for a meaningful analysis of them karasek said 
the health examination survey done in 196061 found 39 heart 
attacks among 2409 employed men the health and nutrition 
examination survey done from 1971 to 1975 uncovered 30 heart 
attacks among 2424 employed men 
to assess job characteristics for all 4833 men researchers 
used federal studies of the conditions faced by workers of various 
kinds of jobs measurements for various job traits such as control 
over the work were computed for 221 occupations 
these measurements were then adjusted for each worker based on 
his age race education geographic region and whether or not he 
was selfemployed or worked in a city 
the comparison of heart attacks in men with the most versus the 
least job strain took into account the heart attack risk factors of 
age race cigarette use education blood pressure and cholesterol 
levels 
jobs in the top 10 percent for strain included cashiers and 
waiters while those in the bottom 10 percent included foresters 
natural scientists and civil engineers 
the other analysis of men in the top 20 percent versus the 
other 80 percent took into account only the worker ages which 
karasek said was the most important influence on heart attack risk 
job strain appeared to account for between a fourth and a third 
of heart attacks in an analysis that took only age into account 
karasek said the results were similar when the other risk factors 
also were considered 
the study does not prove that job strain raises the risk of 
heart attacks karasek said but the idea is supported by other 
research 
in the new study researchers did not know whether workers were 
in their reported jobs when the heart attack occurred but it is 
unlikely that a worker would have a heart attack in a lowstrain 
job and later move into a highstrain one karasek said 
it may take 10 to 15 years of high job strain before a heart 
attack would occur he said 
giving workers more control has long been advocated to increase 
productivity he said it may also reduce job strain along with 
letting workers use underutilized skills and making their jobs 
platforms for learning new skills he said 
karasek said overall job strain probably includes factors the 
study overlooked such as job insecurity and psychological support 
from other people 
krantz said the very promising job strain hypothesis should 
be tested by research that measures each workers job strain 
directly follows him over time and takes the various risk factors 
into account

blacks are underrepresented in the cockpits 
and corporate offices of the nations airlines according to a 
congressional report that says air carriers actually may be going 
backwards in their affirmative action efforts 
blacks hold about 5 percent of the managerial jobs at the 
airlines and no more than 200 of the 45000 pilots in the industry 
are black said the report released sunday by the house government 
operations committee 
blacks are making little progress in the airline industry 
overall and at certain airlines have actually regressed rep 
cardiss collins dill chairwoman of the panels subcommittee on 
transportation said 
the report said blacks represent 30 percent of the industrys 
unskilled workers however they constitute less than 2 percent of 
all airline professionals it said 
the report caps an investigation by the subcommittee that 
included three hearings and a review of records maintained by 
federal agencies as well as company documents on minority hiring 
and promotion 
the panel said the report in particular discusses equal 
employment opportunity and affirmative action policies and 
practices at trans world airlines united airlines and american 
airlines 
the testimony and documents received by the subcommittee 
suggest that the airline industry has downgraded affirmative action 
efforts particularly with respect to black pilots managers and 
other professionals the report said 
it said civil rights laws court rulings and other factors had 
brought a measure of integration to the airlines 
but it added that the industry pattern is one in which blacks 
continue to be overrepresented in lowwage semiskilled and 
unskilled positions and continue to be underrepresented in 
positions requiring advanced education specialized training and 
skill 
bob jackson a spokesman for the air transport association an 
industry trade group said in an interview sunday all of the 
major airlines have positive minority hiring programs there has a 
lot of considerable progress made in the last 10 years since 1978 
the number of blacks and hispanics has increased 30 percent and 
women constitute 40 percent of all airline employees 
the report said one problem appeared to be an old boy network 
wherein whites white males in particular are favored in hiring 
and promotion decisions it said another was that black employees 
are often placed in jobs outside the mainstream and thus are among 
the first to go when there are layoffs 
it also acknowledged that flux within the industry caused by 
mergers and deregulation have played a part and it said some of 
the problem is traceable to union seniority rules competition with 
other industries for skilled black workers and lack of equal 
educational opportunities 
the report recommended that the federal aviation administration 
take a more active role in monitoring the industry for affirmative 
action compliance it also called for an indepth review of hiring 
practices by the equal employment opportunity commission 
nine of the committees 15 republicans however said in 
dissenting views attached to the report it was neither necessary 
nor advisable that the faa once again be given a role in overseeing 
affirmative action within the commercial airline industry 
it said there were many reasons for the low percentages of 
minority employees in top airline jobs and added that failure to 
give those causes due weight while stressing affirmative action 
problems potentially distorts rather than clarifies the airlines 
record 
in addition and perhaps most importantly the equal 
employment opportunity commission the agency charged with 
enforcing our most important antidiscrimination laws has found no 
evidence nor indication that the airline industrys record on 
affirmative action is unique or different from any other 
industry the nine said

secretary of state george p shultz says hes 
willing to meet with his iranian counterpart to discuss an end to 
the iraniraq war terrorism and hostagetaking but not the return 
of iranian assets 
us officials are trying to find an authoritative channel 
for direct talks with iran but he has not sought a meeting with 
iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati during the iranian 
officials visit to the united nations for peace talks shultz said 
we dont have to go running around after people shultz said 
sunday on cbstvs face the nation but he added its 
important to iran to have a relationship with the united states and 
that will emerge in due time 
asked if he would meet with velayati if such a meeting were 
requested shultz replied sure adding i dont know that 
its necessarily the right way to start to have the foreign 
ministers meet but at any rate we have stated our policy 
he indicated the united states continues to make contacts with 
iran through third countries and said us officials have 
repeatedly expressed a willingness to hold direct talks on what 
it takes for them to become part of the civilized community 
he said if iran will stop the war stop being involved in 
terrorism and stop promoting the taking of hostages then there 
is a prospect of more normal relations with us 
shultz said the issue of releasing nine americans held by 
proiranian groups in lebanon would have to be separate from 
financial and other considerations 
he noted that the issue of releasing iranian assets held by the 
united states is being handled by a claims tribunal court in the 
hague and there is no reason to disrupt it iranian officials 
have suggested they might work for release of the hostages if the 
assets are returned but reagan administration officials have said 
they will make no such deal

insisting lt col william higgins used 
his united nations post as a cover to spy for the united states a 
proiranian extremist group rejected a un appeal for the american 
hostages release 
abbas mousawi a senior leader of the shiite moslem hezbollah 
or party of god said sunday that the group considers the un 
resolution part of a plot against the moslems and mujahedeen 
holy warriors of this area 
we consider the arrest of this agent by the sons of this 
nation as part of its defense of its dignity and existence 
mousawi said at a rally in the southeastern town of mashgara 
hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella group for shiite 
factions holding most of the 18 foreign hostages including nine 
americans in lebanon 
mousawis speech was the first hezbollah reply to resolution 
passed unanimously friday by the 15nation security council 
condemning the us marines abduction and pleading for his 
immediate release 
higgins 43 of danville ky was chief of a 76member observer 
group attached to the un interim force in lebanon when he was 
abducted feb 17 the vietnam veteran also served as an aide to 
former defense secretary caspar weinberger 
hezbollah has publicly defended the organization of the 
oppressed on earth which claimed responsibility for higgins 
abduction 
everyone knows that when higgins was seized by the oppressed 
in south lebanon he wasnt on a humanitarian mission but 
according to even the american press and president reagan he was 
engaged in a spying mission on hezbollah in south lebanon said 
mousawi 
there is no record of reagan making such a statement 
so it is within our right to say that the presence of higgins 
under the security council umbrella in south lebanon is part of a 
war waged by this arrogant body and america the great satan 
against our oppressed people mousawi said 
his oration drew thunderous chants of death to the great 
satan and no to the security council from thousands of 
fistshaking shiite moslem zealots attending the rally 
the organization of the oppressed on earth has repeatedly 
charged that higgins was a spy for the cia but us and un 
officials deny it 
also sunday a church of england bishop said he visited lebanon 
last week to inquire into the fate of four missing iranians in 
hopes his efforts might hasten the release of western hostages who 
include anglican envoy terry waite 
christian militiamen kidnapped the iranians in july 1982 there 
have been reports that they were killed and iran has been seeking 
word on them 
after arriving in britain on sunday the rev john brown told 
reporters he hoped his mission to lebanon had made a contribution 
towards the overall picture which i hope will lead towards the 
release of all the hostages 
brown anglican bishop in cyprus and the persian gulf region 
went at the request of his churchs head archbishop of canterbury 
robert runcie 
he said he spoke in lebanon to leaders of the maronite church 
and the armenian church who promised to make inquiries 
its very important to us when we are talking to the iranians 
to show them that we are concerned about their missing people 
as well as ours brown told reporters 
runcie aide john lyttle said brown was well guarded during 
his visit and did not venture out of the christian part of lebanon 
waite disappeared jan 20 1987 while seeking the release of 
american hostages in lebanon the longestheld hostage is terry 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated press 
who was abducted march 16 1985

a leak developed sunday in 
discoverys fuel lines halting the loading of fuel and raising the 
possibility of another postponement of a test firing of the space 
shuttles engines nasa said 
the leak occurred as crews were filling the external fuel tanks 
with liquid hydrogen and oxygen said nasa spokeswoman cindy buck 
were troubleshooting the liquid hydrogen leak and looking to 
see if we will be able to continue filling the tank to completion 
right now she said early monday 
earlier sunday a twopart countdown resumed for the testfiring 
of discoverys engines after engineers repaired a hydrogen leak and 
a balky oxygen pump 
the problems that cropped up friday had caused the fourth 
postponement in 10 days for the test which is considered critical 
to certifying discovery for the first shuttle flight since the 
challenger disaster 
the leak and pump were repaired saturday and the testfiring is 
now scheduled to take place thursday 
officials believe the delays combined with an unresolved leak 
in discoverys steering engine system will slip the launch date 
from midseptember into october 
the leak and pump problems developed friday soon after 
technicians began pouring more than half a million gallons of 
liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellant into the spaceships 
external fuel tank on launch pad 39b 
it was the first attempt to fuel a space shuttle since 
challenger exploded on jan 28 1986 killing the crew of seven 
the exercise leading to the firing of the three main engines 
with discovery bolted firmly on the launch pad is divided into two 
parts 
the first part involved fully fueling the tank and simulating a 
problem that forces a postponement with the countdown at 10 seconds 
before a mock liftoff that was to take place monday 
the launch team then was to empty the tank restart the 
countdown refill the tank and aim for a 20second ignition of the 
engines at 730 am thursday 
the purpose of the overall test is to check several 
modifications made to the engines and launch pad since the 
challenger accident and to provide countdown practice for the 
launch team 
when the test is completed nasa still must cope with the small 
gas leak in a steering engine system that is separate from the main 
engines 
engineers have come up with a plan to reach and repair the leak 
by entering discoverys cargo bay and cutting a hole through the 
rear bulkhead into the steering engine compartment 
another option with a decision to be made after the 
testfiring is to take discovery off the launch pad and back to a 
hangar for repair a move that could postpone the launch until 
november

the reagan administrations record on ethics was very tasteless 
and offensive 
ill tell you what bothered me a little bit about what he 
said yesterday was that very offensive and very tasteless attack on 
the president where he made a comparison to a dead fish bush 
said and i think the american people will reject that kind of 
campaign tactic 
you dont make tasteless offensive analogies to the president 
of the united states thats what i think bush told cable news

a congressional committee is charging that 
millions of substandard bolts and nuts are being used in everything 
from military equipment and weapons to the space shuttle and 
commercial trucks 
the millions and perhaps billions of substandard fasteners 
used by our military and sensitive industries make it a wonder that 
we havent had a major catastrophe said rep john dingell 
dmich chairman of the house energy and commerce committee and 
its investigations subcommittee 
the panel issued its report this weekend after a twoyear 
investigation that uncovered millions of substandard bolts nuts 
and screws many of them imported from japan 
dingell said the problem could have wideranging effects and 
along with 50 other house members has introduced legislation to 
try to correct the problem the bill would require laboratory 
testing and greater documentation of fasteners to make it more 
difficult to substitute cheaper and less effective parts

talks to end the 22week scriptwriters strike 
have hit a brick wall according to the producers top 
negotiator who is urging strikers to cross picket lines and end the 
industrys secondlongest walkout 
we will get our production on schedule any way we can 
nicholas counter iii president the alliance of motion picture and 
television producers said at a news conference sunday what 
individual writers choose to do is up to them 
a union spokeswoman predicted that strikers would remain 
steadfast 
to encourage writers to come back to work is an unfortunate 
retrenchment at a time when both sides should resume negotiation 
and settle this dispute said spokeswoman cheryl rhoden 
the negotiations deadlocked saturday after an 11hour session 
weve simply gotten to the end of the road and weve hit a 
brick wall counter said of the 217member alliance we will 
redouble our efforts to produce as many programs as possible 
the major unresolved issue is how much the writers should get 
from sale of tv shows and movies abroad and from domestic tv reruns 
the strike which began march 7 has left the fall television 
season in chaos and has led to financial hardship for many of the 
writers guild of americas 9000 members as well as 
entertainmentrelated industries 
counter said production companies belonging to the alliance 
would welcome strikebreaking union members and likely would offer 
financial protection against any union reprisal guild officials 
have said writers who go back to work risk fines of up to 110 
percent of their compensation from the producers and expulsion from 
the union 
about 50 guild members meanwhile singled out walt disney 
studios on sunday by picketing movie theaters in hollywood and 
westwood showing the hit disney film who framed roger rabbit 
the demonstrators blamed disney for blocking a tentative 
settlement with the alliance and held signs and passed out fliers 
saying who framed the writers guild and mickey mouse is 
stealing from our kids 
rhoden called the demonstrations public outrage pickets and 
said more would be planned this week here and in other parts of the 
country 
she called prospects of a fall tv season doubtful and 
improbable they may put a few shows on the air but it will not be 
a full schedule 
the strike is only a week short of the entertainments 
industrys longest a 23week walkout by the guild in 1960 that 
strike won writers payments for television reruns 
also sunday counter and earl bush chairman of the basic crafts 
unions issued a joint statement sunday saying the alliance and 
behindthescenes workers agreed to extend their contracts on a 
daytoday basis those contracts were to have expired at midnight 
the parties will resume discussions on wednesday with the 
expectation of negotiating to conclusion the statement said

a new president should move quickly to fill 
foreign policy posts and make clear immediately that his secretary 
of state is his one principal lieutenant in foreign affairs a 
report on presidential transition recommends 
the report noted that presidents nixon carter and reagan all 
found their administrations involved early in internal disputes 
between the national security adviser and the state department 
the report never mentioned the irancontra affair which came to 
light in president reagans second term but it said recent 
events have demonstrated the need for a new president to tell his 
national security adviser at the start precisely what role and 
responsibilities he and his staff should assume including 
their relations with the secretary of state 
coherence and consistency in foreign policy are best served if 
the president has only one principal lieutenant in that area the 
secretary of state 
the report entitled transferring responsibility the dangers 
of transition was released by the white burkett miller center of 
public affairs at the university of virginia 
the study was the work of a commission on presidential 
transitions and foreign policy headed by former secretaries of 
state cyrus r vance and william p rogers 
the commission included members of every postwar presidential 
transition from the franklin d rooseveltharry truman changeover 
to that of jimmy carter and ronald reagan 
the rogersvance commission recommended 
key foreign policy officials should be selected promptly by a 
new administration with cabinet officers chosen within four weeks 
of the election and subcabinet positions filled within 10 weeks 
the process often takes longer the report said because of 
political considerations in the white house and the senate 
key presidential foreign policy documents should be reproduced 
for the incoming president we know of no large institution other 
than the white house in which when a change of leadership occurs 
many of the files relevant to continuing policy decisions are 
packed up and taken away by the departing top official the 
report said 
the office of management and budget should be restored as the 
institutional memory of the presidents office and the number 
of political appointees at the top of omb should be reduced 
preinaugural meetings between representatives of the incoming 
administration and foreign diplomats and leaders should be sharply 
limited 
each presidential candidate should begin building a pool of 
potential foreign policy appointees immediately after the political 
party conventions and use small task forces rather than large 
transition teams 
the report said that during a presidential campaign candidates 
should be careful in the number and scope of promises they make 
in the foreign policy field some political promises which bring 
success in the election may produce failure in office 
once in office a new president should be careful not to 
politicize the career services the report said 
new administrations are often distrustful of bureaucrats and 
only slowly do they learn how heavily they can rely on the 
professionalism of foreign service officers and members of the 
other career services the report said

a pack of runners darted through the 
woods bushwhacked up and down thicketchoked slopes dashed along 
railroad tracks and abandoned roads forded kneedeep streams and 
slogged through thighhigh mud 
they closed out the day with beer a barbecue and good 
fellowship 
born in the rubber plantations and jungles of east asia in an 
era when the sun never set on the british empire the sport known 
as hashing has made its way halfway around the world to maine 
where one devotee is writing a book about it 
hashing a noncompetitive form of crosscountry running that 
traces its roots to the game of hare and hounds is enjoyed by 
roughly 50000 participants in more than 700 clubs in 124 countries 
from andorra to zimbabwe 
its a way to get a little exercise and a little 
sociability said freelance writer alice johnson of hallowell 
founder of the hallowell hash house harriers one of about 80 clubs 
in the united states 
california leads with 16 
for her research on her forthcoming book johnson was recently 
in bali site of the 1988 interhash known as the biennial olympics 
of hashing and in malaysia for the the 50th anniversary 
celebration of the founding of the original hash house harriers 
known affectionately as the mother hash 
the group was founded at a kuala lumpur club by british soldiers 
and expatriate businessmen who ran through the jungle to work up a 
thirst it selected the name from the institutional quality of the 
clubs food 
at a midsummer hash that began at her lakefront cottage here 
johnson briefed newcomers on the rules runners designated as hares 
set the course in advance marking it with flour they are the only 
ones who know where it will lead 
at various points hares draw circles indicating checkpoints 
from which several possible routes fan out in different directions 
all but one are false trails that end with a marker telling the 
runner to return to the checkpoint and try again 
the runner who finally discovers the right trail shouts im 
on or onon the hares who follow the pack to keep track of 
stragglers sound a horn and all run toward the next checkpoint to 
restart the process 
the search for the correct trail provides time for slower 
runners to catch up with those up front 
it takes away a lot of the ego trip involved with track and 
other competitive racing said noel mount an irishborn former 
rugby player who was one of the two dozen hallowell hashers to run 
the nearly sixmile course 
you get ahead but then you take the wrong trail and that 
brings you back with everyone else 
johnsons husband wick along with summer neighbors oliver 
greeves and andrew engelman reconnoitered the area the previous 
evening and spent three hours that morning laying out the route and 
marking it with 10 pounds of flour in the tropics hares use paper 
rather than flour to leave their marks 
greeves a resident of hong kong introduced the johnsons to 
hashing two years ago while on a visit to hong kong wick johnson 
was invited by greeves to participate in an allmale hash he 
returned exhausted but enthusiastic telling his wife a 
recreational runner that this was a sport she would love 
upon her return home that summer alice johnson rounded up a 
group of friends and neighbors from hallowell just outside 
augusta and organized the areas first hash 
the trick is getting the right people at the beginning it has 
to be people who dont take themselves too seriously she said 
most are runners but it is definitely not a requirement you 
just have to be fit enough to run approximately six miles with 
stops

secretary of state george p shultz says his 
visit to latin america this week is not intended to force leaders 
there into a confrontation with nicaragua over democratic reforms 
shultzs 10day journey to nine countries begins today in 
guatemala where he will meet with the foreign ministers of four 
central american countries in an attempt to come up with a common 
strategy on the leftist sandinista government 
shultz on sunday said a statement which he said was drafted 
mostly by the foreign ministers of guatemala el salvador costa 
rica and honduras is still open to discussion 
were not trying to ram anything down anyones throat he 
said on the cbstv program face the nation having drafted 
it they are not so sure they want to issue it 
honduras meanwhile harshly criticized guatemala and costa rica 
for insisting that the joint communique on nicaragua to be issued 
following todays meeting be softened calling their action 
incomprehensible and strange 
the hondurans in a statement issued to reporters sunday night 
said the guatemalans and costa ricans had made a number of changes 
in the document that was first agreed to a month ago including 
many provisions aimed at nicaragua 
a senior reagan administration official who briefed reporters on 
friday said it was unclear whether the guatemala meeting will 
result in a joint statement of principles designed to prod 
nicaragua into complying with its stated commitment to move toward 
democratic reforms 
the official who spoke only on condition of anonymity said a 
consensus on a common policy toward nicaragua has been difficult to 
reach 
the special us envoy to central america morris busby has 
been consulting on that issue with officials from the four central 
american nations 
in managua nicaraguan president daniel ortega urged the four 
central american countries to reject any us attempt to condemn or 
isolate nicaragua 
ortega told reporters sunday he hoped the central american 
governments will respond with dignity and firmness and reject the 
proposal of the united states 
he said the united states is trying to escalate the war 
with consequences for all the central american countries not just 
for nicaragua 
a guatemalan legislator meanwhile accused the state department 
of trying to pressure the countries into signing a virtual 
declaration of war against nicaragua 
the legislator edmund mulet lesiur representing a political 
party known as the union of the national center said president 
vinicio cerezo rejected a demand by busby to abandon guatemalas 
policy of active neutrality by agreeing to the document 
mulet said honduras and el salvador had agreed to sign it while 
guatemala and costa rica turned it down 
the us embassy in guatemala city issued a statement sunday 
categorically denying mulets statements made in an interview with 
a guatemala city newspaper 
the united states has not pressured guatemala or any other 
country the united states has not asked guatemala to abandon 
active neutrality the embassy said 
a fragile ceasefire remains in place in nicaragua but there 
has been no progress on a final settlement between the sandinistas 
and the contra rebels the impasse has produced calls by 
conservative members of congress for a renewal of military aid to 
the rebels 
in public statements this past week rebel leaders have 
maintained the truce has helped the sandinistas by enabling them to 
strengthen their overall military position while the contras have 
been denied lethal aid from the united states 
the administration has contended the sandinistas also have 
stepped up internal repression since the truce went into effect 
four months ago 
in a commentary this past week in the new york times assistant 
secretary of state elliott abrams said the situation in nicaragua 
deteriorated after congress rejected a contra military aid request 
in february 
much of shultzs trip will be devoted to highlighting the 
democratic trend in the hemisphere all of the nations on his 
itinerary have elected governments and all with the exception of 
costa rica became democratic over the past nine years 
after guatemala shultz will travel to argentina uruguay 
brazil and bolivia before a return trip lasting 24 hours to 
central america on aug 8 for talks in costa rica el salvador and 
honduras 
the trip ends on aug 10 when shultz will attend the inaugural 
ceremony of ecuadoran presidentelect rodrigo borja while in 
quito shultz also will confer with president jaime lucinchi of 
venezuela and president virgilio barco of colombia

this old us 
navy mine sweeper and five others like it may remain in the persian 
gulf until an estimated couple of hundred mines still lurking 
in the waters are found and destroyed us officers say 
while a ceasefire in the iraqiran war would probably keep new 
mines from being laid those already deployed could pose a danger 
to shipping for years to come unless cleaned up 
the task falls to ships like the creaky 800ton conquest whose 
crew works these days in 130degree deck temperatures using a 
submersible robot to locate mines and trailing gear to cut the 
cables that moor them to the seabed 
when a submerged mine shows up on the sonar screen divers are 
guided to the spot and attach explosives which are detonated by 
time fuse or remote control 
capt jim miller commodore of the us minesweeping force 
would not predict how long the tedious and dangerous job of 
clearing the gulf of mines might require 
were not going to do it in a week or two weeks he said in 
an interview its going to take a lot longer than that 
miller said this could mean some or all of the six us mine 
sweepers in the gulf might be excluded from a force cutback 
promised by us officials when and if tehran and baghdad formally 
agree to a truce in their 8yearold war 
iran which is blamed for laying most of the mines in the gulf 
announced july 18 that it would join iraq in accepting a yearold 
un ceasefire resolution 
the woodenhulled us mine sweepers all built in the early 
1950s but updated for gulf duty with modern sonar navigation and 
minehunting gear comprise about a third of the us naval force 
now in the gulf 
their mothership is the amphibious landing ship dubuque 
which also carries about 400 marines and eight helicopters 
us military sources in washington say the six aging mine 
sweepers might possibly be given to a gulf arab state rather than 
returned to the united states the navy has 15 other mine sweepers 
of similar vintage and is building 31 new stateoftheart ships 
for hunting mines 
miller said he had no firsthand knowledge of such a plan 
but noted that scores of former us warships are now sailing with 
other navies 
he conceded it could take years before the gulf is free of 
mines if ever mines laid in the north sea during world war ii 
were still being recovered as recently as 1980 he said 
the mine threat had a major role in prompting the naval buildup 
by the united states and five european navies in the gulf a year 
ago 
in addition to the six us craft which arrived in november 
britain france italy belgium and the netherlands sent antimine 
forces the soviet union also has ships capable of minesweeping in 
the waterway 
european forces were later cut back and two remaining belgian 
and dutch minehunters combined with three british ships under 
royal navy command 
us navy records indicate at least 10 vessels have hit mines in 
the gulf since the soviet tanker marshal chuikov was damaged off 
kuwait on may 16 1987 
among later victims were the usflagged kuwaiti supertanker 
bridgeton the american frigate samuel b roberts an offshore 
supply vessel sunk with six killed and an ocean survey ship with 
four lost 
after the samuel b roberts narrowly escaped destruction in the 
central gulf on april 14 us searchers found three more mines in 
those waters 
officers said all were clean of marine growth indicating they 
were newly laid and one bore the letters usa in white paint 
the mines of a 1908 russian type were identical with those 
found aboard the captured iranian minelayer iran ajr in september 
they said 
overall some 80 mines have been found in the past year 
according to available records 
miller said everybody has found some the us navy found 
52 the latest in may the british and french each have found more 
than a dozen 
miller said the estimated couple of hundred mines still in 
the gulf are concentrated in certain areas including waters just 
south of iraq and an area of the northern gulf near iranianheld 
farsi island 
the mines off iraq believed laid by both sides are a special 
threat because they break lose in rough weather and drift to the 
arab side of the gulf several vessels have struck these renegade 
floaters off kuwait saudi arabia and bahrain

seventeen advocates for the homeless are arrested 
after seizing a vacant seattle hotel activists take over two 
abandoned public housing units in chicago during a day of 
nationwide protests 18 people are arrested in boston as they try 
to commandeer a boardedup building 
new more aggressive tactics to get housing for americas 
homeless have led to repeated assaults on vacant buildings for 
takeover and restoration 
abandoned buildings are a very powerful symbol said 
activist mitch snyder theres no reason for them to lie fallow 
while millions of people are homeless except for lack of funding 
snyder and his washingtonbased community for creative 
nonviolence have organized sitins and monthlong hunger strikes in 
their push for shelters and housing for the homeless 
creating shelters is no alternative to affordable housing 
snyder said i went to 48 cities in two weeks last month meeting 
with people and encouraging them to plan occupations of buildings 
said robert hayes a former wall street lawyer and founder of 
the national coalition for the homeless tactics that dont make 
explicit that the solution to homelessness is housing dont make 
sense 
hayes said most important is legislation to provide affordable 
housing but building occupations highlight the importance of 
legislation 
that kind of work is only strengthened by voices coming from 
the streets he said 
more than 100 activists were arrested during protests in about 
50 cities july 14 a day of coordinated building occupations to 
promote affordable housing legislation introduced in congress 
in boston homeless action day protests turned to violence when 
about 80 activists used crow bars to tear boards from doors and 
windows of an abandoned building 
eighteen protesters were charged with breaking and entering and 
assaulting a police officer one woman was injured when she was 
struck by a mounted officers horse as it galloped through the 
crowd 
i consider myself one of the lucky 18 to be able to make a 
statement about the plight of the homeless said jim stewart of 
the cambridge committee on human shelter emergency who was 
arrested in the fracas 
stewart said advocates are willing to risk arrest and injury 
because sitins and marches have not been effective 
in northampton activists commandeered a vacant house on the 
grounds of a state mental hospital july 14 hospital officials 
watched as the activists began converting the building into a 
shelter but had them arrested three days later for trespassing 
we called it a workin said george markham a spokesman for 
the group 
markham said their aim was to place constructive 
nonviolent pressure on state officials to turn vacant public 
buildings into housing 
while more than 100 people were arrested nationwide during the 
july 14 action tim hager of the national coalition for the 
homeless said occupations in some cities led to new housing 
the mayors of cincinnati and new orleans allowed protesters to 
keep the abandoned buildings they had begun renovating he said 
activity has not been limited to july 14 the chicago and 
seattle incidents occurred in early january as did the arrest of 
17 activists in oakland calif who occupied three vacant 
victorian homes the city hopes to restore 
on march 16 one woman was arrested and several protesters 
fought with police as 35 squatters were evicted from a berkeley 
calif house owned by the university of california 
other actions included a threemonth sitin by homeless people 
on the steps of boston city hall the group ended its protest july 
21 when city officials promised an office and a crisis hotline for 
the homeless 
in november 1987 massachusetts institute of technology police 
evicted 15 homeless people who set up a tent city on university 
property for about a month hoping for an offer of housing 
homeless action day was planned to call attention to a bill 
introduced by rep barney frank dmass two days earlier franks 
bill would provide 15 billion a year for the next five years to 
build 75 million affordable housing units 
frank denounced the protests saying they would not help his 
legislation it was all very stupid very unfair he said 
the bills been out for only two days 
theres so much to be done hayes said that almost every 
tactic has to be employed

authorities in bejing are refusing to allow 
former cambodia ruler pol pot to leave china where the leader of 
the murderous khmer rouge regime is hospitalized for unspecified 
treatment a magazine reported 
the august edition of the chineselanguage cheng ming magazine 
seen today also said china will offer political asylum to pol pot 
while pol pots khmer rouge ruled cambodia from 197578 
hundreds of thousands of people died in vast slavelabor camps and 
execution chambers as the government attempted to turn the country 
into a primitive agrarian society 
vietnamese forces drove the khmer rouge into the mountain 
jungles of western cambodia and installed the current phnom penh 
government in early 1979 
pol pot has not been seen by outsiders in recent years and has 
been reported to suffer from various ailments that sent him for 
treatment to bangkok thailand and beijing 
cheng ming in a brief report about pol pot said he was being 
treated at an unidentified beijing hospital 
the chinawatching magazine said china had reached a tacit 
agreement with the united states to stop supplying military aid to 
pol pot and not to allow him to return to power in cambodia 
the khmer rouge is the strongest member in a coalition of three 
guerrilla groups opposed to vietnams occupation of cambodia 
coalition leaders and the prime minister of the 
vietnaminstalled phnom penh government met last week in indonesia 
at unprecedented peace talks 
the possible role of the khmer rouge in any future government 
was a major stumbling block 
vietnam says it plans to withdraw its troops from cambodia by 
1991 
pol pot officially retired in september 1985 as commander in 
chief of the khmer rouge army and was named director of the partys 
institute for national defense the move was widely seen as an 
attempt by the khmer rouge to clean up its international image

after being plagued for years by the 
annoying buzz of the lusty humming toadfish hundreds of houseboat 
residents here decided to turn the other gill er cheek 
the humming toadfish season usually marks a time when sleepy 
houseboat dwellers put pillows over their heads to escape the 
irritating nighttime sound of thousands of sexstarved male fish 
but this year houseboaters threw the sausalito humming toadfish 
festival instead 
theyre just out looking for a mate just like everybody else 
in sausalito said john mccosker the steinhart aquarium 
ichthyologist and oceanographer who identified the humming toadfish 
as the cause of the mysterious buzz in 1985 
in its courtship ritual the fish sidles up to a concrete 
structure a cave or houseboat will do and blows air through its 
bladder the noise apparently drives female toadfish crazy with 
desire the hum usually begins in june and stops when the mating 
season ends in august 
about 5000 people turned out for sundays fish festival in 
which mccosker was crowned king of the festivities 
it was overwhelming mccosker said who would have thought 
as an ichthyologist i would have risen to such heights or in 
sausalito such depths

americas palate apparently is honed to where 
the buffalo roam says duane helland who specializes in bison 
cuisine 
helland who owns and operates hellands food and locker service 
with his wife sue decided to expand his menu to include the great 
american bison in reaction to a changing society he said 
people want to eat meat thats low in calories fat and 
cholesterol and high in protein said helland who has filled 
orders for almost 5000 pounds of buffalo meat 
the average serving of beef contains 24 percent protein and 28 
percent fat buffalo has 35 percent protein and 3 percent fat 
according to the us department of agriculture 
there is about half the amount of cholesterol in a buffalo roast 
than in a similar cut of beef said mary duvall executive director 
of the national buffalo association in fort pierre sd 
if its not overcooked its a little sweeter than beef 
theres no wild flavor helland said its real smooth texture 
of the meat is very silky 
theres a catch though its twice the price of beef 
helland said 
in 1850 about 20 million buffalo thundered on the western 
plains in the late 1800s hunters slaughtered millions of bison 
until their numbers dwindled by 1889 only 551 bison were found 
alive in the united states 
today as many as 100000 exist mostly in the hands of private 
individuals duvall said

as the nations top mafia investigator giovanni 
falcone symbolized a new generation of brave activist judges 
dedicated to ending the reign of organized crime in sicily 
now he and eight fellow investigating magistrates have 
resigned spurring questions about the depth of the governments 
commitment to fighting the mafia all nine had played a prominent 
role in italys largest mafia trial 
in stepping down with the others on saturday falcone said he 
wanted to be able to freely testify before a judicial panel looking 
into the governments antimafia effort he also suggested there 
was something profoundly wrong with the war on organized crime 
following reports that members of italys dominant political 
party had in an unrelated case arranged payment of a ransom to 
underworld figures the resignations shocked italians and prompted 
criticism of the government 
the judges and all the others that have risked their lives 
fighting the mafia have felt increasingly abandoned by the state 
the newspaper corriere della sera said in a frontpage editorial on 
sunday 
falcone 48 and the other eight resigning investigators had 
together comprised a special antimafia pool which was formed 
after the 1983 assassination of the chief investigating magistrate 
in palermo sicilys capital 
the team led by falcone pushed italian law to its limit 
examining bank records of alleged mafiosi and ordering sweeping 
arrests 
it was the dapper mustachioed falcone who persuaded mob figure 
tommaso buscetta to detail the structure of the mafia and how it 
shipped heroin from sicily to the united states a breakthrough 
that led to the nations huge organized crime trial 
the socalled maxitrial ended in december with convictions of 
338 mafiosi including 19 reputed members of the cosa nostras 
leadership commission 
since the trial however the antimafia pool has been stymied 
by its new director chaos in the police force and government 
indifference according to prominent sicilian prosecutor paolo 
borsellino 
borsellinos declarations to journalists two weeks ago prompted 
president francesco cossiga to order investigations by the 
ministries of justice and interior and the superior council of 
magistrates which oversees judges 
as the judges body began hearings in rome on saturday falcone 
and his colleagues submitted their resignations and asked for 
transfers 
that which i had feared could happen unfortunately happened 
falcone wrote the investigations into the mafia have been 
obstructed and the antimafia pool is now stalled 
another investigator who resigned giuseppe di lello charged 
the inattention of the government is palpable in the 
disorganization of the investigating offices 
falcone did not elaborate on how or why the investigations may 
have slowed but he said his views on prosecuting the mafia 
diverge radically from those of the chief investigating 
magistrate antonino meli 
meli was appointed in february over the objections of falcone 
and others who said he had no experience in mafia probes 
borsellino a former member of the antimafia pool told 
reporters that meli had removed falcone as chief of major 
antimafia cases 
meli also divided the antimafia work load among all 
investigators regardless of whether they were specialists 
borsellino said reverting to the system followed before the pool 
was created 
there have been serious attempts by the office of 
investigations and the prosecutor of the republic of palermo to 
definitively dismantle the antimafia pool he said 
meli responded the pool has not been destroyed as borsellino 
says and if anything it has been enlarged with the addition of 
other judges 
saturdays resignations prompted expressions of concern from 
italian politicians about the state of the war on the mafia 
there is a problem of management and administration of men of 
the types of judges and it is more than a guess to think that the 
difficulties have been exacerbated by the inopportune handling of 
this government said virginio rognoni of the dominant christian 
democratic party who heads the justice commission in the chamber of 
deputies 
last thursday an investigating judge released a report saying 
some christian democrats helped gain the release of a kidnapped 
colleague in 1981 by arranging ransoms for the neopolitan mafia and 
red brigade leftist terrorists 
among those who may have been involved was antonio gava the 
current interior minister the report said gava denied the charge 
today we expected the resignation of interior minister 
antonio gava the communist newspaper lunita said in a 
frontpage editorial sunday headlined honest men and an arrogant 
government 
gava stays and falcone leaves it is not a good day for 
italy

violent crime in the soviet capital is down 
overall but murders assaults and juvenile crime are on the rise 
and authorities probing police corruption have fired about 1200 
people an official said 
we dont hide that fact that in our ranks there are 
bribetakers moneygrubbers common criminals in police uniform 
said lt gen ps bogdanov chief of moscows administration of 
internal affairs which controls police affairs

in relinquishing any claim to the west 
bank king hussein has also decided to abandon responsibility for 
all government services in the israelioccupied territory a senior 
government official said today 
it is a complete divorce of this kingdom from the west bank 
the official said commenting on husseins address sunday 
in a televised speech also seen in israel and the occupied 
lands the king challenged the plo to try to make a palestinian 
state of the territory his family ruled until it was seized by 
israel 21 years ago 
it was the latest in a flurry of moves by hussein that appeared 
to rule out the possibility of jordan representing palestinians in 
any peace talks 
the move also acknowledged that the 8monthold uprising in 
israels occupied lands has largely looked for leadership to the 
plo reducing jordanian influence in the west bank 
hussein said that since there is a general conviction that the 
struggle to liberate the occupied palestinian land could be 
enhanced by dismantling the legal and administrative links between 
the two banks we have to fulfill our duty and do what is required 
of us 
the government official who spoke on conditon of anonymity 
said that means we will not be responsible for any services in 
the west bank that land is palestine and this is a separate 
country 
he explained that jordan is no longer responsible for 
municipalities health social educational religious or cultural 
sectors in the west bank 
but he told the associated press we will continue to pay 
pensions to civil servants and teachers who have been appointed by 
the jordanian government and served our kingdom during the past 35 
years 
the late king abdullah husseins grandfather united both sides 
of the river jordan and merged all institutions and services with 
the west bank when he annexed the area after the 1948 arabisrael 
war 
jordan administered the west bank until israel seized it in the 
1967 middle east war and set up a military government that shared 
services with local authorities 
jordan has since been paying teachers lawyers and other 
employees who work in arab institutions in the territory 
on saturday hussein dissolved the lower house of parliament 
half of whose members represented the west bank on thursday he 
canceled a 13 billion development project for israels occupied 
lands 
jordan is not palestine the king said sunday in his 
17minute address the independent palestinian state will be 
established on occupied palestinian land after its liberation god 
willing 
it was the first time hussein who has previously backed the 
idea of an independent palestinian state told palestinians in the 
west bank to take affairs into their own hands 
the move could make the plo israels only potential negotiating 
partner in talks to resolve the issue dashing hopes for secretary 
of state george p shultzs peace initiative 
under the shultz plan jordan would have been partially 
responsible for representing the palestinians in proposed middle 
east peace talks israel refuses to talk to the plo calling it a 
terrorist organization 
shultz speaking sunday on cbstvs face the nation denied 
husseins moves would pressure the united states and israel to find 
a way to talk to the plo 
we will stay right where we are were ready to talk to them 
plo when they take certain steps which are very clear and as 
far as i can see not too onerous he said 
hussein said sunday that jordans links to the west bank 
hamper the palestinian struggle to gain international support for 
the palestinian cause as the national cause of a people struggling 
against foreign occupation 
the uprising in the west bank and gaza strip which has claimed 
the lives of 235 arabs and four israelis has given greater 
international prominence to the palestinian cause and increased 
calls for an independent state 
hussein said sunday that his moves were in response to the 
wish of the palestine liberation organization and the 
prevailing arab conviction that such measures would contribute to 
the struggle of the palestinian people 
today the senior jordanian official said it is up to the new 
jordanian government to decide on measures to handle the break of 
administrative and legal ties with the west bank and gaza strip 
he was referring to an expected cabinet reshuffle the magnitude 
of which was not made clear the official also said he interpreted 
the kings speech to indicate jordan would not issue new 
jordanian passports to residents of the west bank and gaza strip 
two thirds of jordans 35 million people are of palestinian 
origin and carry the jordanian passport all west bank residents 
and some from the gaza strip hold the jordanian passport 
in his speech the king called for national unity and said his 
west bank policy would not affect palestinians living in the rest 
of jordan 
hussein was nearly toppled in 1970 during a war with the plo in 
1951 he witnessed a palestinian extremist assassinate king 
abdullah 
in 1970 hussein cracked down on the plos growing independence 
and moved to halt plo raids that were resulting in damaging israeli 
reprisal attacks in jordan 
the ensuing black september fighting with the plo came close 
to toppling hussein who then forced the guerrillas into lebanon 
hussein and arafat reached a reconciliation in the mid1970s

the chinese military celebrated its 61st 
anniversary today by restoring a ranking system in a move seen as 
critical to its efforts to develop a modern fighting force 
in related developments saturday the peoples liberation army 
bestowed medals on thousands of veterans and announced more than 
100000 soldiers would be transferred to a new civilian staff 
western military analysts in beijing and the official chinese 
media said the moves were connected to reforms aimed at modernizing 
chinas armed forces and ridding it of the leftist influences 
the analysts who spoke on condition of anonymity also said the 
ranking system was designed to raise the morale of the army which 
since 1978 has seen many of its factories converted to civilian use 
and its troop strength and share of the state budget slashed 
mao tsetung abolished military ranks 23 years ago as part of 
his attempt to create a classless society china then ascribed to a 
fighting philosophy called peoples war which envisaged an 
allout war fought by a huge peasant army 
since china began its economic reforms in 1978 it has moved to 
create a professional army with topnotch military equipment 
western analysts today said chinas poor showing in its brief 
war with vietnam in 1979 also did much to convince military leaders 
of the necessity of a strict ranking system 
in addition the trouble with vietnam on the border and over 
islands in the south pacific has led the chinese to believe future 
conflicts will not be an allout war but geographically contained 
battles that necessitate a rapid deployment force of highly trained 
soldiers said one diplomat 
these kinds of units need a strict command structure with a 
clear delineation as to who is giving and who is receiving the 
orders he said before today they didnt have that 
fridays issue of the peoples daily renmin ribao said the 
move to transfer 100000 soldiers to civilian status was part of a 
program to cut the number of officials in the army 
the ratio of officials to soldiers is lopsided it said 
they are too many officers and many of them are too old 
apart from strategic issues analysts said the ranking system 
and the awarding of medals were undertaken to raise morale in the 
peoples liberation army 
since 1978 china had reduced the army from 4 million to 3 
million men cut the armys share of the state budget from 175 
percent to less than 10 percent and turned military industry 
factories to consumer production 
in addition the army has all but been shut out of politics 
finally a program to acquire advanced weapons systems has been 
slowed because of budget constraints 
if the army is not getting weapons the least the government 
can give them is ranks said one analyst 
analysts said china had to award medals and ranks to its 
veterans some of whom maintain a strong influence over the 
military because it would have been an insult to award ranks only 
to those currently in service 
part of the reason all this took so long is that the veterans 
were bickering about who was to get which medal or which rank 
one analyst said citing chinese sources they are evidently very 
concerned with status 
on saturday four classes of medals were awarded to about 80000 
veterans 
according to the official xinhua news agency military officers 
in the army will be divided into three grades with 11 ranks four 
ranks of generals four ranks of field officer senior colonel 
colonel lieutenant colonel and major and three ranks of company 
officer captain lieutenant and second lieutenant 
previously officers were given commands of groups such as 
platoons and divisions or were assigned to regional command posts 
but there was no clear ranking hierarchy

michael dukakis begins an expanded effort 
this week to win over the black voters he largely ignored in the 
primaries and who have yet to respond in any big way to an 
endorsement by jesse jackson 
the democratic presidential nominee travels to detroit tonight 
to address an urban league convention and according to an aide 
his campaign this week will begin distributing literature 
highlighting his gubernatorial record on issues such as affirmative 
action and judicial appointments 
michael dukakis is not a known quantity to black americans but 
this should help change that said donna brazile the dukakis 
campaigns deputy national field director 
dukakis also plans to invest in black media advertising and will 
schedule campaign events in inner city neighborhoods and other 
predominantly black areas brazile said he rarely ventured into 
black communities during the primaries and still draws relatively 
few blacks to campaign events 
brazile and other top dukakis advisers conceded in interviews 
during last weeks sevenstate campaign trip that jacksons 
endorsement of dukakis at the democratic national convention in 
atlanta has yet to translate into visible support for dukakis among 
blacks 
one assessment of dukakis problem came from sam riddle field 
director for jacksons winning effort in the michigan caucuses 
all you got in atlanta was that jesse got a little prime time 
a credit card and an airplane he said black america is still 
not sure whats in it for them and until that gap is bridged i 
dont think youll see them being too enthusiastic about dukakis 
dukakis and his staff are trying to erase such sentiments 
in newark cleveland milwaukee louisville ky raleigh nc 
and here in flint last week he met with jackson backers all of 
whom according to dukakis aides pledged their support 
shortly after riddle spoke to reporters during a dukakis rally 
in flint he was approached by boston attorney fletcher wiley a 
senior dukakis adviser who is among the campaigns ranking black 
officials 
sure weve got a problem right now wiley said later but 
were meeting with the jackson leaders this trip to start the 
process of taking care of it 
well get to his people at the grassroots level but you 
cant go to the people without first coming together with the 
leadership 
leaders who met with dukakis last week gave positive reviews 
others already have begun helping the nominee 
dukakis was greeted at the louisville airport by georgia davis 
powers a longtime state senator who was a jackson backer 
ernest james a jackson supporter in the primary who was at the 
airport to help with the greeting said the areas black community 
is ready to go for dukakis the jackson people have been 
spreading the word and i think blacks will go with dukakis 
complicating dukakis outreach efforts aides concede is 
jacksons still unclear role in the fall campaign and uneasiness 
among senior dukakis advisers over the outspoken jackson 
dukakis moved quickly to distance himself from jacksons effort 
to get involved in talks to free american hostages believed to be 
held captive by proiranian groups in lebanon but was careful not 
to criticize jackson himself 
hes an american citizen dukakis said we agree on a lot 
of things and we dont agree on some things 
paul brountas the dukakis campaign chairman and its chief 
liaison with jackson said he expected jackson to campaign with 
dukakis soon but said no schedule has been made 
he promised greater black involvement in dukakis campaign events 
once the jacks

sea world officials put a 1400pound baby 
sperm whale that beached itself near sanibel island into a special

critical condition said jerie jones spokeswoman for the marine 
attraction for an animal like this research scientists will

water with depths in excess of 600 feet 
the whale was found by two fishermen saturday beached on a 
shoal just south of sanibel island and mired in ankle deep mud 
florida marine patrol officials contacted mote marine experts 
we checked him and found his heart rate to be erratic and 
rapid about 60 beats per minute gorzelany said 
it took 14 people to lift him and carry him about 100 yards to 
the truck gorzelany said we could only move him about 10 
yards at a time 
officials dont know why whales beach themselves

vandals damaged the concrete tomb of 
president corazon aquinos husband but did not disturb the body a 
military official said today 
maj hernando patawaran spokesman for the presidential security 
group said the damage apparently was done late friday at the 
manila memorial park cemetery and was discovered saturday 
patawaran said the vandals pried loose a concrete slab from the 
top of the tomb of sen benigno aquino jr who was murdered aug 
21 1983 
patawaran said park authorities received a telephone call 
saturday saying a bomb had been planted in the tomb bomb experts 
inspected the site but found nothing he said 
soldiers guarded the tomb today and workers said they 
reinforced it with steel sheets 
a witness who visited the nearby grave of a relative saturday 
said presidential guards surrounded aquinos grave 
patawaran said officials did not know who vandalized the grave 
or why 
aquino was shot dead at manila international airport moments 
after he returned from three years of selfimposed exile in the 
united states 
the slaying fueled opposition to thenpresident ferdinand marcos 
that culminated in a militarycivilian uprising which toppled his 
administration in february 1986 and brought mrs aquino to power 
opposition leaders at the time blamed the marcos administration 
for the killing 
forty people most of them soldiers are on trial in the 
assassination

former us rep barbara jordan was listed 
in serious condition this morning recovering from a near drowning 
in her backyard pool and a doctor says she could be out of the 
hospital within a week 
right now i think things look very good that shell get 
totally back to normal said dr james little a neurologist 
shes very close to normal right now i think she will continue 
to improve as best as i can tell right now she probably will 
regain full mental functions 
ms jordans condition was upgraded sunday afternoon from 
critical to serious but stable and she continued to improve sunday 
night 
she started her liquid diet tonight she is breathing on her 
own she is receiving supplemental oxygen though hospital 
spokeswoman kari larsen said 
ms jordan 52 gave the thumbsup sign sunday to her intensive 
care unit nurse and was able to talk 
shes in good spirits now because she knows shes going to get 
well said dr william j deaton a pulmonary specialist 
shes emotional about that and a little bit tearyeyed some of 
the time knowing what shes been through and how close she came to 
a real catastrophic event but she still also has her jovial 
personality she was joking a little bit this morning deaton 
said sunday she is vastly improved 
ms jordan who gained national attention during the 1974 
watergate impeachment hearings was flown by emergency helicopter 
to brackenridge hospital on saturday after being found floating 
facedown in her pool 
ms jordans livein companion nancy earl called paramedics 
who restored her pulse and breathing 
deaton said she came within four to five minutes 10 minutes 
at most of suffering severe brain damage and possibly death 
she does not know what happened and was clearly concerned 
about it and had indicated that she didnt think she would go 
swimming alone again deaton said 
ms jordan was breathing saturday night only with the help of a 
ventilator but sunday the device was gone and she was responding 
to questions and talking doctors said 
sen lloyd bentsen the democratic vice presidential candidate 
telephoned a message for ms jordan hospital spokeswoman carolyn 
hinckley boyle said ms jordan made a seconding speech for 
bentsens nomination at the recent democratic national convention 
doctors said it isnt known what caused ms jordan to lose 
consciousness in the pool but the lack of oxygen caused cardiac 
arrest 
deaton said he expected ms jordan to remain in intensive care 
for 48 hours and to be hospitalized for about a week 
the doctors said ms jordan who has been confined to a 
wheelchair for several years suffers from multiple sclerosis she 
swims as therapy 
she has muscle weakness and it would be difficult for her to 
rescue herself from the swimming pool if she had any warning of any 
event i doubt though based on the suddenness of the event 
that she had any warning deaton said 
doctors were uncertain how long she was in the pool before being 
discovered ms earl said she returned from a short errand to find 
ms jordan unconscious in the pool 
ms jordan in 1966 became the first black state senator in texas 
history in 1972 she was the first southern black elected to 
congress since reconstruction serving until 1978 when she left 
politics after three terms in the house to teach at the university 
of texas

an explosion and fire ripped through a twostory 
army barracks in north london early today killing a soldier and 
injuring nine people authorities said the ira claimed 
reponsibility 
in a message to the northern ireland bureau of the british news 
agency press association the outlawed irish republican army said 
its guerrillas laid a bomb in the inglis barracks in the wooded 
mill hill neighborhood 
police had said there was no immediate indication the 7 am 
explosion was caused by a bomb 
the barracks border the finchley parliamentary constituency of 
prime minister margaret thatcher a prime ira target 
two major hospitals in the area barnet general and edgware 
reported admitting a total of nine injured including one who was 
in an intensive care unit 
london ambulance spokesman chris webb had said initially that 10 
people were injured he said the dead man was a soldier 
antiterrorist police rushed to the barracks and sealed off the 
area after the explosion which could be heard more than two miles 
away ripped through a brick single mens dormitory block the army 
said 
soldiers dug through rubble to rescue several of the injured who 
were trapped by falling masonry 
one soldier was rescued after being trapped for more than 30 
minutes col william butt commander of the postal section of the 
barracks said the solider was saved by a radiator that shielded 
him from falling bricks and debris 
butt said most of the injured had burns or neck and back 
injuries 
the blaze was under control two hours after the explosion 
although pockets of flames remained late in the morning said 
london fire brigade spokesman michael whitty 
construction worker frank mcparland who was working at the 
barracks told reporters the middle section of the living 
quarters is missing it must have been a very big explosion 
the building is where the single soldiers live that was 
where we were working in the middle it just demolished it like a 
pack of cards i guess about threequarters of it is still 
standing 
the ministry of defense said the barracks housed members of the 
womens royal army corps and also was used by the postal and 
courier depot which is run by 250 staff from the corps the royal 
engineers and the royal navy 
all mail for british servicemen and women using the british 
forces post office system passes through the depot 
scotland yard superintendent anthony robertson said 15 single 
men were housed in the barracks where the explosion occurred 
there was an explosion at inglis barracks in or near to the 
living quarters of army personnel he said in a statement 
there is one fatality two seriously injured and several other 
injuries 
it has been shattered robertson said of the building 
the predominantly roman catholic ira which is fighting to end 
british rule in mainly protestant northern ireland frequently 
attacks british military personnel 
mrs thatcher was deeply distressed to hear of the explosion 
when she arrived in perth australia on an official visit her 
london office said she is anxiously waiting for news of the 
people concerned and she sends deep sympathy for all the relatives 
concerned 
in an interiew last week jackie donnelly spokesman for the 
iras legal political wing sinn fein said the ira recognized that 
killing british soldiers made more impact in britain than killing 
policemen or soldiers from northern ireland 
so from that perspective the ira certainly would like to 
target more british soldiers he said 
in may after a 14month lull the ira resumed attacks on 
british army bases on the european continent in the most recent 
attack nine soldiers were injured on july 13 at duisburg west 
germany 
among the most serious ira attacks on the army in mainland 
britain were the july 20 1982 double bombings in londons hyde 
park and regents park killing 11 soldiers and seven of their 
horses

joint usvietnam efforts to account for 
1761 americans still listed as missing from the vietnam war could 
begin soon a state department official said today 
david lambertson assistant secretary of state for east asian 
and pacific affairs made that assessment following four days of 
meetings in hanoi last week between vietnamese officials and 
technical experts from the united states 
while there are certain arrangments that will need to be 
worked out we anticipate that joint activities surveys 
investigations and excavations could begin quite soon lambertson 
said on abctvs good morning america program 
we anticipate a substantially higher level of activity over 
the next three months said lambertson who termed the talks 
quite productive 
he said the sites that will be examined remain to be determined 
in the talks last week the united states agreed to consider 
vietnams humanitarian problems in exchange for vietnamese 
cooperation on the mia matter 
a leader of the effort to resolve the cases of those still 
listed as missing in action said on the same program that her group 
views last weeks meeting as a sign the vietnamese hope to put the 
issue to rest 
we hope the vietnamese are serious said ann mills 
griffiths executive director of the national league of prisoners 
of war missing in southeast asia 
i believe this time they are serious and i think theyve 
recognized its in their own national interest to cooperate in 
resolving this she said 
despite the increased cooperation lambertson said vietnams 
continued occupation of cambodia remains as a barrier to 
normalization of relations between the two countries 
i believe the vietnamese understand quite clearly that 
normalization is something the united states would be prepared to 
enter into in the context of a cambodian settlement that involves 
the complete withdrawal of vietnamese forces from that country 
lambertson said 
we also want one which contains very effective guarantees 
against a return to power of the khmer rouge he said 
representatives from vietnam laos the cambodian resistance and 
other southeast asian nations met in indonesia last week to discuss 
an end to the nineyearold conflict vietnam has pledged to 
withdraw its 120000 troops by 1990 
the vietnamese withdrawal plan is a hopeful sign but we also 
look at it with due skepticism said lambertson 
mrs griffiths said talks are quickening with other southeast 
asian nations over mias 
we have ongoing efforts with the laos goverment there are 
encouraging signs there as well that the pace and level of 
cooperation is improving she said i think well shortly see 
consultations again between lao and us officials 
vietnam has denied allegations by some american private citizens 
that it is holding americans captured in the war as prisoners

raised the possibility of another postponment of a critical test 
firing of discoverys engines 
the leak halted fueling of the shuttles hydrogen tank after it 
had been loaded with 254000 gallons 67 percent of capacity 
after assessing the situation launch director bob sieck ordered 
the countdown to proceed to obtain data on other aspects of the 
count the liquid oxygen tank received a full load of 143000 
gallons and other procedures were rehearsed 
the countdown was stopped as planned at 11 seconds before a mock 
liftoff by a simulated problem and the launch team began 
practicing steps it would take to recover from a postponement 
making the shuttle safe draining the propellants and turning the 
vehicle around for another countdown and launch attempt 
a second countdown is to end with the test firing of discoverys 
three main engines with the shuttle bolted to the pad the firing 
had been scheduled for thursday but nasa officials said it might 
have to be delayed another day or so because of the leak 
a decision on when to schedule the firing probably would not be 
made before tuesday sieck said 
he said the launch team had done an excellent job in 
completing the countdown despite the difficulty we must now 
evaluate the results and schedule the work that needs to be done 
before the firing he added 
the firing already had been postponed four times in 10 days 
a threeday delay was announced friday because of a hydrogen 
leak and a balky oxygen pump 
the newest leak was in the same launch pad service mast as the 
earlier one but officials would not know if it was in the same 
line until technicians traced it they will not have access to the 
pad until after the launch team completes draining the hydrogen and 
oxygen tuesday 
nasa said that despite sundays leak it was satisfied that most 
requirements of the first part of the countdown had been met 
objectives missed were to be picked up during a second fueling and 
countdown for the test firing 
officials believe the practice countdown delays combined with 
an unresolved leak in discoverys steering engine system will slip 
discoverys launch date from midseptember into october 
the purpose of the dual countdown test is to check modifications 
made to the engines and launch pad and to provide countdown 
practice for the launch team 
the 20second engine ignition is considered critical to 
certifying discovery for the first shuttle flight since challenger 
exploded shortly after liftoff on jan 28 1986 killing the crew 
of seven 
when the test is completed officials of the national 
aeronautics and space administration still must cope with the small 
gas leak in a steering engine system that is separate from 
discoverys main engines 
engineers have come up with a plan to reach and repair the leak 
by entering the shuttles cargo bay and cutting a hole through the 
rear bulkhead into the steering engine compartment 
another option with a decision to be made after the 
testfiring is to take discovery off the pad and back to a hangar 
for repair a move that could postpone the launch until november

receiving threats 
except for law officers district of columbia law generally bans 
posession of handguns and ammunition not owned prior to 1976

construction spending edged up 01 percent in 
june as continued strength in nonresidential building offset 
declines in housing and government projects the government said 
today 
the commerce department said building activity rose to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4028 billion in june 
following a 08 percent increase in may in april construction 
plunged 11 percent after soaring 28 percent in march the june 
level was 26 percent higher than a year ago 
the strength came from a 25 percent increase in spending on 
nonresidential construction which climbed to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 992 billion led by big jumps in both 
factory and hotelmotel construction it was the fourth consecutive 
monthly increase 
factory construction rose 57 percent and now stands 21 percent 
higher than it was a year ago us manufacturers have boosted 
investment on new factories because of a surge in export sales 
caused by the weaker dollar 
hotel and motel construction increased 194 percent after 
falling for two months 
construction of office buildings in june was off by 04 percent 
from the may level however the small decline followed increases 
in may april and march and the june rate was still 12 percent 
higher than a year ago something of a puzzle to analysts because 
of lingering high vacancy rates in that sector caused by widespread 
overbuilding in previous years 
residential construction fell 09 percent in june to an annual 
rate of 1881 billion the third decline in a row that sector has 
been hurt by an increase in mortgage interest rates since the 
spring a 07 percent drop in construction of singlefamily homes 
more than offset a 23 percent increase in apartment construction 
government construction projects fell 14 percent in june to an 
annual rate of 786 billion with highway construction the biggest 
segment of the government sector suffering a 16 percent decline

four soviet missiles were blown apart today at a 
test range on the steppes of central asia as the soviet union began 
destroying more than 1700 missiles banned by a superpower treaty 
tass said 
defense secretary frank carlucci who today arrived for a 
fourday visit to the soviet union hailed the destruction of the 
missiles as a great event 
tass said that at noon moscow time four soviet shortrange 
missiles known in the west as ss12s were destroyed in the presence 
of us inspectors at the saryozek test range in soviet kazakhstan 
about 1800 miles southeast of moscow 
western reporters watched from a distance of about two miles as 
a single explosion tore apart the four missiles 
the blast dug a crater about 65 feet wide and spread debris 
from the missiles over several hundred yards they said the 
explosion sent a huge cloud of smoke into the blue sky over the 
steppe the western reporters said 
col stanislav petrenko chief of operations told reporters the 
nuclear warheads mounted on the ss12s had been removed before the 
rockets were destroyed and that the charges would be used for 
peaceful purposes 
the soviet union has used nuclear explosions for oil 
prospecting largescale construction projects and other purposes 
petrenko told western reporters that an explosion would take 
place at the saryozek site every day for the next 18 months tass 
the official soviet news agency said other soviet missiles banned 
by the superpower treaty would be destroyed over the next three 
years 
the superpowers signed a treaty in december banning their 
medium and shorterrange nuclear missiles it is the first arms 
agreement between the two nations that calls for the destruction of 
an entire class of weaponry 
under the treaty the soviets must eliminate 1752 missiles with 
a range of between 310 miles and 3410 miles that have been 
deployed or are in storage tass said 
the united states has said it will scrap 859 pershing 2 and 
cruise missiles now stationed in western europe 
the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty signed by 
president reagan and soviet communist party general secretary 
mikhail s gorbachev calls for each country to allow inspectors 
from the other side to verify that the rockets have been eliminated 
on april 11 the soviet union said it blew up six ss12 missiles 
in a test designed to develop a method to destroy missiles under 
the treaty the united states also conducted such tests 
carlucci when asked by reporters how he evaluated the 
destruction of the missiles said i think its a great event 
im very pleased to see it 
his host soviet defense minister dmitri t yazov added it 
means that we are starting to carry out the obligations which were 
achieved earlier especially as a result of the four summit 
meetings in geneva reykjavik washington and moscow 
tass said the destruction of the missiles will lead to a 
substantial lowering of the level of military confrontation in 
europe and to the lessening of the risk of global nuclear 
conflict

israel deported eight palestinians today the 
military said as fellow palestinians in the occupied territories 
held a commercial strike to protest the israeli policy of 
expulsions 
the deportations came a day after jordans king hussein 
announced he was severing ties with the 850000 arabs in the 
occupied west bank he once ruled 
the eight palestinians were visited by their families at jneid 
prison in the west bank before being driven away relatives said 
a military spokesman said they were taken to israels northern 
border with lebanon 
among the deportees was a journalist with jerusalems arabic 
language al fajr newspaper loui abdo who was accused of leading a 
palestine liberation organizationlinked youth group in the west 
bank city of nablus security sources said 
other deportees included a lecturer from the bir zeit university 
near ramallah and a labor leader from nearby el bireh they said 
the expulsions brought to 29 the number of palestinians deported 
since the beginning of the eightmonth arab uprising 
some palestinians denounced hussein today as a traitor for 
severing ties with them but others praised the monarch for ceding 
to the plo as their sole representative 
prime minister yitzhak shamir said husseins decision to divorce 
himself from the occupied west bank dealt a blow to the idea of a 
united palestinian nation 
hussein said in his speech he intended to cut legal and 
administrative ties with the west bank which he ruled before 
losing the area to israel during the 1967 middle east war 
the decision was a setback for foreign minister shimon peres 
labor party which had proposed resolving the dispute with the 
palestinians by negotiations with jordan a government official 
today disclosed that peres had tried through foreign intermediaries 
to persuade hussein not to break ties 
in at least two west bank cities arabs scribbled slogans on 
walls denouncing hussein down with hussein the traitor one 
said in the city of tulkarm 
other palestinians disagreed 
its a good gesture for the palestinians and it should start 
the ball rolling in the direction of working out strategic 
relationships between the plo and jordan on the future 
palestinian journalist daoud kuttab of the nazareth daily asinara 
told israel radio 
shamir speaking to new zealands new ambassador said hussein 
had dealt a blow to the idea of a palestinian state by 
differentiating between palestinians living on the east bank of the 
jordan river and those in the west bank 
if as hussein says one part of them has to set up a 
palestinian state and another part is jordanian where then is 
the one palestinian people an aide quoted shamir as saying 
it is possible to draw the conclusion that the whole idea of a 
palestinian people is an invention for the sake of propaganda 
shamir added 
shamirs rightwing likud bloc opposes territorial concessions 
to the arabs and believes the west bank and gaza strip are integral 
parts of the historic land of israel 
peres said the effect of husseins announcement was still not 
known because he had not said how he would carry out his decision 
but analysts said husseins speech may hurt the labor party in 
november elections 
the likud can exploit this and claim peres concept of 
negotiations with jordan has collapsed said middle east expert 
aryeh shalev 
hussein while not ruling out the likelihood that jordan would 
take part in negotiations made it clear the palestinians must 
speak for themselves 
a government official close to peres speaking on condition of 
anonymity said peres had tried through foreign diplomats to 
dissuade hussein from making his speech telling them israel 
still believes in a need for peace talks with jordan 
the israeli daily haaretz said one of the intermediaries was 
british prime minister margaret thatcher who it said passed a 
message from peres to hussein last month 
editorials in palestinianowned newspapers voiced confusion over 
jordans plans 
some were fearful hussein could cancel jordanian passports held 
by many of the 850000 palestinians in the west bank or even close 
bridges connecting the west bank to jordan a vital economic link 
to the arab world

jesse jackson and new york mayor edward i koch 
said today they are willing to meet and try to heal or at least set 
aside the differences that have simmered since kochs strong 
criticism of jackson before the new york primary 
jackson who lost the april primary and later the democratic 
presidential nomination to michael dukakis said koch called him at 
his chicago home early today and said he would like to meet 
i have always kept open the door to communications i believe 
that people should talk jackson said in a telephone interview 
from his home 
he said he was concerned that in new york because of kochs 
attacks we missed a great opportunity to discuss urban policy in 
this country 
kochs criticism last april included a statement that jews would 
be crazy to vote for jackson who supports palestinian 
selfdetermination 
my feelings toward the mayor are always open and respectful 
jackson said his toward me were very hostile 
jackson said koch used race and religion as litmus test and 
divided the city and helped to lower the moral tone of the 
campaign 
he said he told koch that if they are to meet it should be 
arranged through david dinkins manhattan borough president and 
rep charles rangel and the meeting should include black leaders 
such as those two both of whom are jackson supporters 
the leaders ought to meet and work out a common agenda 
jackson said 
in new york koch said he would call dinkins to arrange a 
meeting with jackson as soon as possible so we could get behind 
dukakis 
koch said he was not trying to line up support among blacks 
through jackson for his own reelection campaign next year 
im not in contention this year he said and if you 
really believe as i do that its important to have a democrat in 
the white house you set aside those differences 
the mayor said he told jackson i would want to meet with him 
as soon as possible we had the same goal the election of 
dukakis 
because of kochs statements before the new york primary 
there was no focus on the crisis of homelesses nad the 
relationship between drugs and aids as a growing killer epidemic 
jackson said 
i would think the democratic leadership must come together 
from various walks of life he said 
jackson said sunday he had accepted new york gov mario cuomos 
request to smooth over differences with koch the new york times 
reported today 
governor cuomo has expressed interest in the relationship 
being healed jackson told the times i think thats good 
koch said in a statement i agree that in the interest of 
party unity and the election of michael dukakis it would be good 
to meet with jesse jackson 
cuomo said sunday he talked with jackson on friday and that he 
had told jackson and koch how important i thought it was to put 
things together again 
koch and cuomo said a first meeting should be attended by only 
the three koch added sunday that he would have no hesitancy in 
sitting down with jesse jackson and any black leaders he would like 
to bring 
on the wcbstv sunday program newsmakers koch said its 
hardly likely that jesse jackson and his intimate supporters you 
know the ones closest to him are ever going to support me we 
have fundamental differences 
but he said they could work together noting that there are 
probably wider differences between jesse jackson and democratic 
vicepresidential nominee lloyd bentsen than between jesse jackson 
and me

defense secretary frank carlucci told a toplevel 
soviet military class today he has difficulty reconciling kremlin 
claims of a defensive strategy with its excessive military spending 
and offensive weapons stocks 
on the first day of a visit expected to offer a closeup view of 
some soviet bases and hardware carlucci and his host defense 
minister dmitri t yazov both called for straight talk on the 
issues that divide their nations 
speaking at moscows voroshilov military academy carlucci said 
questions remain by and large open on the sincerity of soviet 
claims to be rethinking defense strategy 
we have difficulty in reconciling a defensive doctrine with 
what we see in soviet force structure and operational strategy as 
an emphasis on the offensive he told the academy class 
we also have difficulty reconciling the ussrs pledge not 
to be the first to use nuclear weapons with your continuing 
emphasis on heavy icbms intercontinental ballistic missiles such 
as the ss18 carlucci said 
he said he found yazov and other senior kremlin military men 
articulate and willing but deemed the signs of actual change 
in the system ambiguous 
carlucci said the strategic defense initiative known as star 
wars would remain part of the us military plan as long as 
washington sees on the soviet side a capability more compatible 
with a military doctrine that emphasizes preemptive nuclear 
strikes 
at the opening of his talks with yazov carlucci called for 
talk in direct terms about the superpowers divergent views on 
defense 
yes we are soldiers yazov agreed with a decisive nod of 
the head the first session between the superpower defense chiefs 
included soviet chief of staff marshal sergei f akhromeyev who 
last month completed a tour of us defense installations that set 
the tone of openness being accorded to carlucci here 
the us defense chief said he was totally satisfied with 
the access he will be given to military bases and equipment during 
his fourday visit 
at the beginning of july akhromeyev saw flight operations on 
the aircraft carrier uss theodore roosevelt the inside of a b1 
bomber and toured a minuteman missile training facility 
in return us officials let it be known that they wanted to 
see the soviets topsecret blackjack bomber and visit soviet ships 
at sea 
yazov said he believed carluccis program will include a look at 
the blackjack bomber among other military hardware 
the moscow meetings will be the third session between the 
defense chiefs of the superpowers carlucci and yazov first met in 
berne switzerland in march and they also held talks during the 
moscow summit in late may 
carlucci is accompanied by assistant secretary of defense ron 
lehman and representatives of the joint chiefs of staff and the 
state department 
soviet media have focused much attention on carluccis visit 
promising a closeup look at the kremlins military installations 
and declaring the exchange a good chance to ease tensions between 
the superpowers 
in the soviet union they attach much importance to contacts 
between the military of the soviet union and the us since those 
contacts aim at improving mutual understanding of military aspects 
of sovietamerican relations at solving the most important problem 
of today the prevention of a nuclear war and cessation of the 
arms race the official soviet news agency tass said today 
carlucci is to go tuesday to the taman base outside the capital 
and to the kubinka airfield both in closed zones normally 
offlimits to foreigners 
on wednesday the delegation flies to the crimean peninsula for 
the american sides first official look at the black sea fleet 
headquartered in sevastopol 
carlucci leaves the soviet union on thursday for turkey

vietnam on monday blamed us 
negotiators for a lack of progress on the proposed emigration to 
the united states of thousands of former political prisoners and 
their relatives 
talks were held july 1415 by us and vietnamese negotiators in 
hanoi on resettlement of people who were put into reeducation 
camps because of ties to the united states during the vietnam 
war and a joint communique issued at the time indicated an 
agreement had been reached 
the official vietnam news agency reported monday that vietnam 
showed its goodwill and readiness to cooperate with the us side 
in solving the question as soon as possible however the 
discussions brought about no result due to the us sides negative 
attitude 
the two sides are continuing to discuss the us sides 
guarantee that it shall not tolerate any hostile activities 
against vietnam by the released reeducation camp inmates when they 
are resettled in the united states said the report monitored in 
bangkok 
the biggest obstacle lies in the us sides refusal to set up 
a working group to organize the emigration to the united states of 
about 500000 people including relatives of the released inmates 
and to oversee the execution of this commitment 
previous western news reports from hanoi have said that the 
emigration of 50000 people not 500000 was discussed 
details on the working group proposal were not available the 
united states does not extend diplomatic recognition to vietnam and 
has resisted vietnamese attempts to establish official contact 
washington says it wont consider relations until vietnam pulls its 
more than 100000 troops from cambodia 
after the talks in hanoi the vietnam news agency released the 
text of a joint communique that suggested an agreement had been 
reached 
the communique said vietnam was allowing the former detainees to 
leave after the us government gave assurances it wont encourage 
them to engage in antivietnam activities it said both sides hoped 
that processing of the former detainees can begin within the next 
several months it said they discussed ways to expedite 
applications 
the talks were conducted by teams led by vietnams deputy 
foreign minister tran quang co and robert l funseth senior deputy 
assistant secretary of state for refugee programs 
the united states first offered to resettle the former prisoners 
in 1984 us interest was renewed after vietnams new leadership 
freed hundreds of former south vietnam officials in 1987 and this 
year 
the north vietnamese established the camps which usually 
combined manual labor with ideological study after defeating 
usbacked south vietnam in 1975 the us state department 
estimates that 900000 former us government employees or south 
vietnam officials have spent time in the camps

civil rights activist and city councilman hosea 
williams was arrested at city hall today on a weapons possession 
indictment from neighboring clayton county 
stanley tuggle chief of administrative operations for the 
clayton county sheriffs department said williams was arrested by 
sheriffs officers who went to atlanta after williams held a news 
conference to deny he had been notified of the charges 
williams was taken away in handcuffs 
at the news conference about two hours before his arrest 
williams said he never was notified about the indictment and denied 
reports that he had promised to surrender over the weekend 
the racist white press of atlanta is again out to destroy my 
image as a black leader who is unbought and unbossed he said 
tuggle was quoted over the weekend as saying we have been in 
contact with mr williams and he has indicated he will turn himself 
in 
the indictment stems from an incident at hartsfield atlanta 
international airport in march 
tuggle said today that clayton county authorities contacted 
williams indirectly last week through the fulton county sheriffs 
department and that williams told those officers he would handle 
the matter over the weekend 
he is being truthful when he says he didnt talk directly with 
us but hes not being truthful when he says he didnt know 
anything about it tuggle said 
williams was stopped march 6 at a security checkpoint at the 
airport as he tried to board a plane police said they found a 
38caliber handgun and five bullets in his briefcase 
the civil rights activist told reporters he placed the gun in 
his briefcase while cleaning his car and forgot it was there when 
he dashed to the airport 
williams was given a copy of the charges and was allowed to 
board the plane after the pistol and bullets were confiscated 
he initially was charged with two misdemeanor counts of carrying 
a weapon without a license and carrying a concealed weapon the 
charge was upgraded to a single felony count after a review of 
williams criminal record according to tuggle 
williams was arrested numerous times during his work for civil 
rights but also has faced a string of trafficrelated charges

a federal judge today ruled 
unconstitutional the school dance ban that has been in effect in 
tiny prudy for at least a century 
us district judge russell clark stopped short however of 
ordering the school board to hold dances for students 
it would be inappropriate for this court to order the district 
to sponsor school dances however a district rule prohibiting 
students from holding dances on school property infringes on the 
first amendment rights of the students and must be invalidated 
clark said in the decision that followed four days of testimony in 
june 
he awarded the plaintiffs 21 students and their parents 1 
in nominal damages and attorney fees and ordered the school board 
not to enforce its ban on dancing 
william fleischaker an american civil liberties union lawyer 
from joplin who represented those who favored dances said the 
school board could still ban dancing if it could present reasons 
other than the written rule and religious reasons but he said he 
felt it would be foolish of the school board to try to stop 
dances on school property 
nancy fox 16 student body president for the upcoming school 
year said she would try to organize a dance for the start of the 
school term next month 
i think the only change will be well have some dances and 
well have some fun i hope there wont be any bad attitudes she 
said after clarks ruling 
school officials could not immediately be reached for comment 
the school board lawyer was with a client and members of the 
school board did not answer their telephones 
clark said he found the testimony of school board members 
incredible 
the entire board candidly admits that they followed the will 
of the majority but they were not candid in their opinions of the 
religious reasoning of the majority clark wrote 
this court is skeptical that it heard the complete story 
concerning the board members deliberations of the rule and the 
religious significance of the opposition to dancing in purdy his 
order said 
the prodancers sued the school board in 1986 maintaining the 
dance ban was inspired by a religious bias against dancing 
but school board members testified that the community of 900 
people southwest of springfield opposed dancing for a number of 
reasons that had little to do with religion including the belief 
that dancing leads to drinking and other discipline problems 
the school board handbook states simply school dances are not 
authorized and school premises shall not be used for purposes of 
conducting a dance 
purdy high school proms have been held in neighboring 
communities prompting some parents to complain that their children 
were put into danger by being forced to drive 30 miles or more to 
dance 
in recent decades senior classes have made a ritual of asking 
the school to allow a dance and being refused but the class of 
1986 proved more persistent 
students that year signed a petition in support of a school 
dance to publicize a local chapter of students against drunk 
driving they asked their parents help and sought media attention 
when they took the request before the school board 
they were met with resistance organized in local churches so 
many people were drawn to the meeting at which the ban was 
challenged that it had to be moved to the high school gymnasium 
the school board lobbied by antidancing ministers voted 
unanimously to uphold the ban 
dance supporters followed with a rally to which they invited 
stars of the movie footloose a movie about a fictional texas 
town where dancing was banned actors kevin bacon and lori singer 
were unable to attend

senate majority leader robert byrd said today 
he hopes to reach bipartisan agreement this week on a new aid 
package for nicaraguas contra rebels but it remained unclear 
whether the measure would include new weapons 
byrd dwva said the matter could come before the senate by 
midweek when lawmakers will take up a supplemental money bill or 
late in the week when they begin work on a pentagon funding measure 
the democrats have not finalized a plan yet byrd told 
reporters i hope we can reach consensus among democrats and then 
go to the republican leader and see if we can get bipartisan 
agreement 
meanwhile white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said it was an 
encouraging sign that the democrats are working on a proposal to 
give military aid to the contras if the sandinista government does 
not honor its peace pledges 
it certainly does seem to signal that the democrats and others 
are concerned about the recent actions of president daniel 
ortega that they recognize the fact ortega has turned his back on 
the peace process and has started clamping down on all these 
various freedoms said fitzwater 
he said the administration would work with democrats and others 
to get an acceptable plan 
minority leader bob dole rkan has proposed a 47 million aid 
package for the antisandinista rebels including 20 million in 
standby military aid that could be triggered by a later 
congressional vote the package has been endorsed by president 
reagan for whom the contras have been a top foreign policy 
priority 
dole today pronounced himself eager to hear what the 
democrats have in mind and urged democratic drafters to include 
a reliable delivery system in their aid plan 
while diplomatic negotiations are the key to peace in the 
region dole said sustaining the rebels as a credible presence 
at the bargaining table is essential to the success of any talks 
costa rican president oscar arias is at work on a plan to bring 
the two sides back together following the breakdown of negotiations 
in june 
sen david boren dokla chairman of the senate intelligence 
committee and a consistent supporter of the rebel military effort 
said sunday democrats are at work on a proposal to give military 
aid to the contras if the leftist managua government does not honor 
the peace pledges it has made 
theres an effort right now going on among senate democrats to 
come forward with our own proposal boren said sunday on nbctvs 
meet the press 
as i said one that would be balanced that would hold out the 
stick the possibility of a resumption of military aid if the 
sandinistas continue to violate the peace pledges theyve made 
the washington post said in mondays editions that the 
democratic plan calls for a release of 18 million in frozen 
military aid to the contras if the sandinistas violate provisions 
of the regional peace plan reached almost exactly a year ago 
but prospects for ultimate passage of any new aid remained 
clouded house speaker jim wright dtexas said today the house 
would wait to see what senators agree on before taking any action 
he added i still tend to doubt there will be votes in the house 
to resume the war 
the prospects for renewed aid in congress generally reflect the 
increased polarization in the region where the sandinistas have 
cracked down harshly on opponents and a newly reconstituted contra 
leadership has taken a harder line 
boren told the post the democratic plan would prohibit further 
votes on the contraaid issue this year that would in large part 
remove the controversial issue from the presidential campaign 
under the proposal being drafted by the senate democrats 
according to the post 18 million in lethal aid already 
appropriated but frozen would be released if the sandinista 
government made an unprovoked attack on the contras 
dole said the 18 million figure did not square with information 
he has received from the administration and that actual residual 
weapons stores were less the exact figure is classified 
the paper quoted boren as saying the lethal aid already exists 
in warehouses outside the united states the president would 
determine when an unprovoked attack is made 
congress voted 100 million in military aid to the contras in 
late 1986 60 million to be delivered beginning in february 1987 
the rest in 1988 congress froze delivery on feb 29 to ensure the 
united states did not subvert the regional peace plan signed by all 
five central american presidents including ortega

iraq is continuing to use mustard and 
nerve gas on an intensive scale in its eightyear war with iran 
despite frequent pleas that it cease according to a report by a 
team of un experts released today 
the secretarygeneral cannot but express his deep regret at 
the missions conclusion that chemical weapons continue to be used 
against iranian forces and positions un chief javier perez de 
cuellar said in a statement 
there was no immediate reaction from iraq and the iraqi mission 
said officials were not available foreign minister tariq aziz of 
iraq in new york for un talks on ending the iraniraq war last 
month acknowledged that iraqi soldiers used chemical weapons 
ambassador mohammad jaafar mahallati of iran said today that 
the report only refers to allegations against iran only cites 
nine soldiers 
he added he hoped the report will only further motivate the 
security council to exert all pressure and leverage against iraq to 
accept a ceasefire and comprehensive settlement 
the secretarygeneral is conducting talks with both sides on 
ending their war and implementing a ceasefire 
the un inquiry was requested by iran which charged that iraq 
had used the weapons frequently and on a massive scale killing 
thousands of people in the spring at iraqs request the team 
later went to baghdad 
the team said it examined iraqi soldiers who had been injured by 
mustard gas but did not conclude that iran used chemical weapons 
earlier un reports also have documented use of the weapons by 
iraq and the baghdad government has admitted using chemical 
weapons iranian officials had denied using the weapons 
the danger of continuing escalation involving the use of those 
weapons of mass destruction in violation of the geneva protocol 
and in spite of repeated findings and numerous appeals is a 
frightening possibility which must be fully faced by all concerned 
and the international community as a whole the 
secretarygenerals statement said 
in may the security council condemned the increasing use of 
chemical weapons in the iraniraq war and urged restraint by both 
sides 
we deeply regret to say that in spite of repeated appeals 
by the united nations chemical weapons continue to be used on an 
intensive scale against iranian forces the report by chemical 
warfare specialists said 
the 53page report consists of two parts based on visits to both 
iran and iraq at the requests of the two government 
it said clinical examinations of nine iraqi soldiers showed 
their injuries had been produced by mustard gas the iraqis 
displayed mortar grenades that showed evidence of mustard gas and 
said they had been used by the iranians the team said 
the section on iraqs use of the weapons is more detailed 
involving more patients and locations and studies of chemical bomb 
fragments the report describes numerous injuries caused by mustard 
gas but said the investigators could not confirm reports of nerve 
gas use because it disappears quickly 
the medical chief and others in an iranian war zone told the 
investigators that because it dissipates quickly and allows 
attackers to advance the nerve gas was used against front line 
troops they said mustard gas was used against rear areas to 
disrupt possible counterattacks because of its lasting effects 
the team visited iran from july 1 to 5 went to hospitals in 
bakhtaran and ahvas and traveled to the war zone in the southwest 
it visited iraq on july 10 and 11 and visited hospitals in as 
sulaymaniyah and baghdad 
the team consisted of two chemical weapons specialists dr erik 
dahlgren of the swedish defense research institute in umea sweden 
and dr manuel dominguez carmona of universidad complutense de 
madrid in spain they were accompanied by a un secretariat 
official

detroit voters are being asked tuesday whether they want to bet 
on casino gambling as a ticket to prosperity while missourians 
decide whether to bail out their state lottery by enriching the 
jackpot 
in other primary voting in three states two republican 
excongressmen compete for the right to challenge michigans 
liberal democratic sen donald riegle and a former missouri first 
lady betty hearnes bids for a chance to become that states first 
woman governor 
kansas also has primaries with contests in three of five 
congressional districts the only incumbent challenged in a primary 
is gop rep jan meyers who is seeking a third term in the 3rd 
district she is favored over charles b bat masterson 73 a 
retired school administrator 
two wellknown names appear on missouri primary ballots 
rep richard gephardt filed at the last minute for a seventh 
term after dropping his presidential bid most of the democrats who 
had entered the 3rd district race then withdrew but three 
littleknown contenders remained on the ballot 
and in the 8th district farm activist wayne cryts who gained 
national attention in 1981 taking soybeans out of a padlocked 
bankrupt grain elevator will seek the democratic nomination to 
oppose republican rep bill emerson cryts lost to emerson by 8000 
out of 150000 votes cast in 1986 
missouris 2yearold lottery suffered a 24 million drop in 
sales during the last fiscal year and officials are blaming 
restrictions specifying that exactly 45 percent of lottery proceeds 
go for prizes and 10 percent for administrative costs including 
advertising 
a measure on the ballot would amend the rules making prize 
money a minimum of 45 percent of proceeds and allowing the state to 
spend more on advertising proponents say that would make the 
lottery more appealing and increase sales

funds and faces no opposition in the democratic primary as he seeks 
a third term he also emphasizes that hes expected to become

in favor of preserving federal income tax cuts a strong defense 
using more federal muscle in the war on drugs and opposing 
abortion 
dunn 44 holds more moderate views during his term in 
congress 198182 he supported most of reagans tax cut and budget 
reduction policies but often opposed the administration on social 
issues and cuts in college aid 
aids became an issue in the race last week when dunn said in a 
radio interview that he took a reasonable rational i think very 
responsible approach to the problems that face this nation mr 
huber has said that the reason people have aids is the wrath of 
god punishment from god of homosexuals and drug users

its the wrath of god but if it isnt it should be

the iranian government replied officially to a 
us suggestion of working toward improved relations but imposed 
unacceptable conditions for such a move a white house spokesman 
said today 
marlin fitzwater said the message repeated demands the iranians 
have publicly made particularly the release of their assets held 
by us financial institutions 
id say that it didnt offer any new information the 
spokesman told reporters at the daily white house news briefing 
we have received a response to our earlier message and the 
thrust of it was that they said the same thing in private that they 
had been saying in public the spokesman said 
fitzwater said this included an insistence by iran the united 
states must release iranian assets frozen in this country to 
demonstrate americas interest in warming relations with the 
revolutionary government of the ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said the iranian 
message came in late friday through a third party the us 
official said there was nothing new in it beyond what has been 
said publicly 
she decined to provide any details im not offering any 
further characterization of it we simply said that we had sent a 
message we had a response 
asked if the united states had replied to iran the spokeswoman 
said no 
fitzwater said that the communication from iran contained a 
quid pro quo adding that dealmaking with tehran is 
something we have said we wont do 
the spokesman had said repeatedly last week that the united 
states received no response from iran to a letter that the 
administration sent congratulating tehran on its acceptance of un 
security council resolution 598 seeking a ceasefire to the 
iraniraq war and expressing an interest in an improvement of 
relations 
he also said at the time that the united states would deal only 
with an authoritative representative of the ayatollahs 
government 
the spokesman refused today to identify the source of the 
communication although he said that it had been accepted by the 
administration as official and genuine 
we considered it a serious response fitzwater said but 
i dont think were willing to give it any signficance 
us officials had privately confirmed two weeks ago that the 
main us feeler directed toward tehran had been sent through the 
auspices of un secretary general javier perez de cuellar a 
delegation of highranking iranian officials has been at the united 
nations to discuss implementation of the ceasefire resolution 
secretary of state george p shultz had said sunday that he 
would be willing to meet with his iranian counterpart if there were 
interest in such a session 
but us officials have steadfastly ruled out negotiating with 
the iranians to gain the release of nine americans held hostage by 
proiranian elements in lebanon

a prosecutor told jurors today the case 
involving a lutheran minister and a freelance journalist is not 
about the sanctuary movement or freedom of the press 
instead said assistant us attorney rhonda backinoff it is a 
case involving the exploitation of two pregnant salvadoran women 
who came to the united states seeking a better life the issues of 
sanctuary or the first amendment were only smokescreens raised by 
the defendants to protect themselves she said 
ms backinoff outlined the prosections evidence today as she 
presented her final arguments defense attorneys were to give 
closing statements later today 
why the defendants did what they did is really not an issue 
here she said the bottom line is the immigration law was 
avoided 
us district judge john conway on friday denied defense motions 
to dismiss the case against the rev glen remerthamert 44 and 
demetria martinez 28 
ms martinez faces one count of conspiracy to violate 
immigration laws and one count each of transporting and inducing 
ines camposanzora and cecelia eliasalegria to enter the united 
states remerthamert faces one count of conspiracy and two counts 
each of transporting harboring and inducing the women to enter the 
united states 
ms backinoff told the jurors that remerthamert and ms 
martinez conspired to bring the women into the united states 
illegally in august 1986 
she said remerthamert bought the womens tickets to chihuahua 
mexico by airplane and to ciudad juarez mexico by train she 
said both remerthamert and ms martinez met them in juarez and 
both were present when remerthamert arranged for the women to be 
taken illegally into el paso texas 
ms backinoff also said both defendants were present on the trip 
by car from el paso to albuquerque 
remerthamert has testified he believed former gov toney 
anayas proclamation declaring new mexico a sanctuary state would 
allow him to bring the women into the country without visas 
the prosecutor said ms martinez never wrote about the case 
ms martinez who writes religion articles for the albuquerque 
journal and other publications has said she was present as a 
reporter she said she never wrote about the women because she 
began to fear that could jeopardize the safety of the women or of 
their families in el salvador 
ms backinoff said the women were used as props by the 
defendants to support their own beliefs about central america 
she also said the defendants never intended for the women to 
remain in the united states she said a contract between the women 
and a salvadoran attorney called for them to give up their children 
for adoption and return to el salvador

south korea on monday proposed 
preliminary contacts with north korea to set up a joint 
parliamentary session that would draft a nonaggression pact and 
other tensioneasing measures 
national assembly speaker kim chaesun said in a letter 
addressed to his north korean counterpart yang hyungsup that the 
working talks be held next week in panmunjom a border village 
about 35 miles north of seoul 
also on monday radical students tried unsuccessfully to deliver 
another letter to north korea as part of their plan to march to the 
border aug 15 for separate talks with northern students on 
national unification 
in his letter sent to north korea through panmunjom kim said 
we hope you will respond affirmatively to our proposal for 
holding representatives talks as soon as possible north korea 
has not responded 
the south korean letter came after two north korean proposals 
last month calling for a joint session of the two countries 
legislatures to draft a nonaggression pact and to discuss north 
koreas possible participation in the sept 17oct 2 olympic games 
in seoul 
in a letter delivered july 21 north korea proposed that the 
parliaments hold the joint session by the end of this month in a 
second letter sent five days later north korea said the joint 
session should also discuss pyongyangs bid to be a cohost of the 
olympics 
north korea suggested that both sides skip the working sessions 
and convene a full parliamentary session in the capital of 
pyongyang but seoul officials said preliminary talks are needed to 
set an agenda and discuss other details 
south korean officials said north koreas demand to be a cohost 
of the olympics could be a stumbling block but said they want to 
open contact 
officials in seoul who have expressed concern that north korea 
might resort to terrorism to disrupt the olympics said privately 
that resumption of contacts between the two sides would help ensure 
the safety of the olympics 
north korea has said it would boycott the olympics unless it is 
allowed to be a cohost the international olympic committee has 
rejected the north korean demand saying the olympics are awarded 
to one city and cannot be shared 
an unknown number of students left seoul on monday for panmunjom 
to deliver a letter to their north korean counterparts concerning 
the proposed aug 15 talks 
a spokesman for the group said in seoul the students were 
determined to deliver the letter in the village which is 
offlimits to civilians 
authorities deployed about 2000 police around bus and train 
stations on the seoulpanmunjom route and checked travelers going 
to the border area no arrests were made 
an attempt by students to march to the border june 10 also was 
blocked by police 
communist north korea and south korea have remained bitter 
rivals since the country was partitioned by the united states and 
the soviet union at the end of world war ii the division was 
followed by the korean war of 195053

the decision by king hussein of jordan to cut 
ties with the israelioccupied west bank has alarmed palestinians 
and damaged the election hopes of israeli foreign minister shimon 
peres 
the jordanian monarch made it clear he was giving up his claim 
to the west bank which his grandfather king abdullah annexed in 
1950 and which he lost to israel in the 1967 middle east war 
in deference to arab and palestinian demands he said jordan 
would dissolve legal and administrative links to palestinians 
in the occupied territories 
that remark prompted widespread concern among palestinians much 
of it voiced privately about how far hussein will go in breaking 
his ties with palestinians in the occupied territories 
jordanian influence is pervasive jordanian dinars are the main 
currency in the west bank jordanian law is used in the courts and 
jordanian textbooks are used in the schools 
more importantly nearly 1 million palestinians from the west 
bank and jerusalem carry jordanian passports and the king 
distributes about 70 million to 100 million a year in salaries 
scholarships and stipends 
diplomatic observers believe hussein will be cautious in 
carrying out such steps so as not to stir unrest among palestinians 
who account for about twothirds of jordans 24 million population 
but many palestinians fear hussein may limit the validity of 
passports or refuse to issue new ones he also has the power to 
restrict visits across the jordan river bridges 
jordan can delay reduce or cancel altogether stipends paid to 
13000 teachers lawyers exjordanian government workers and 
officials of islamic institutions 
the expectation was that hussein would gradually introduce new 
measures defining jordans new relationship with palestinians in 
the occupied territories hussein supporters warned the change 
would be dramatic 
nobody appreciates the magnitude of what is happening said 
othman hallak editor of the projordan arabic daily an nahar 
newspaper in jerusalem 
he said there were serious questions about whether israel would 
allow the plo to take over jordans behindthescenes role in 
supporting agriculture education and moslem charities 
it was even more doubtful whether israel was willing to engage 
in any form of dialogue with the plo 
palestine liberation organization leader yasser arafat is viewed 
by both major israeli political blocs as an unacceptable partner 
for negotiations because of his reliance on terrorism and the plos 
commitment to destroying the jewish state 
peres the head of the leftofcenter labor party invested a 
great deal of credibility in promoting hussein as a standin 
negotiator for the plo 
husseins spurning of a leading role was therefore a serious 
embarrassment for peres who already is trailing rightwing prime 
minister yitzhak shamir in polls conducted in advance of israels 
nov 1 election 
peres had dueled repeatedly with shamir in public over the need 
for an international conference on middle east peace peres said 
such a conference would give hussein a cover to talk directly to 
israel about the future of the west bank and gaza strip something 
the monarch could not do otherwise 
peres said he worked out a framework for negotiations with 
hussein at an april 11 1987 meeting in london he said the 
monarch agreed that palestinians negotiators in a joint delegation 
with jordan would not be affiliated with the plo 
israeli officials especially those close to peres have sought 
to play down the importance of husseins measures they argued that 
the moves were tactical and hussein was waiting to be called on for 
help if the plo was unable to meet the challenge 
it is a signal to the palestinian inhabitants of the 
territories not to forget who they depend on said ephraim sneh 
a former west bank military governor who belongs to the labor party 
he predicted hussein would resume a more active role after the 
israeli and us elections in november 
israeli officials also stressed there has been little tangible 
impact from the two concrete steps hussein has taken dissolving 
parliament or halting a fiveyear development program that came 
nowhere near raising a promised 13 billion 
but the 60member lower house of parliament which included 30 
west bankers and the development scheme were symbols started when 
hussein wanted to signal his desire to broaden jordans influence 
and take an active role in peace negotiations 
in his televised speech sunday night hussein said he would 
continue to play a role in peace efforts but made it clear that his 
position would be more in tune with the policies of other arab 
states and the plo 
to underscore commitment to arab unity for west bankers who are 
able to view jordan television hussein sat in front of a large 
portrait of emir hussein bin aly his greatgrandfather and the 
first modern leader to mobilize panarab forces for a 1916 revolt 
against ottoman turkey 
jordan will play a role as an arab country and a confrontation 
state but the role of representing the palestinians falls to the 
plo said hanna siniora editor of the proplo daily al fajr

five years ago a boy 
vacationing with his family on an island near nassau stuffed a note 
into a champagne bottle and dropped it in the atlantic ocean 
last week nick biddle got a reply to his message from a 
60yearold briton who found the broken bottle on a beach in 
southern wales 
nicks bottle had had his name and address inside and this 
message for the finder please when you find this could you 
write me back 
alan bennett was vacationing near the mumbles a coastal town in 
southern wales about 60 miles west of bristol england when he 
found the bottle in a straight line thats a distance of more 
than 4400 miles 
i was very surprised to find the bottle had traveled such a 
long way the retired british airways employee said in a 
telephone interview sunday i thought the least that i could do 
was write this gentleman back 
dear sir nick his letter began whilst walking on the 
beach one morning i saw in a rock pool an old champagne bottle 
which i imagine must have been five or six years old judging by 
the marine growth it had collected 
i can only assume that it was possibly a young boys treasure 
bottle so i am writing to let you know it has been found after all 
this time even though sadly it had to be broken 
yours truly a bennett 
nick now 10 said he never forgot about the bottle and was 
thrilled to get a response 
i always had it on my mind but when i heard about the letter 
i got really excited said nick a fifthgrader at gulf beaches 
elementary school 
nick plans to write back to his new pen pal who lives in the

nasa detected a new liquid hydrogen 
leak monday as it put space shuttle discovery through a fullscale 
countdown rehearsal and officials said the problem could further 
delay a crucial engine test firing beyond thursday 
had the leak been found during an actual count the launch would 
have been scrubbed but because it was a test the launch director 
bypassed the problem to gather as much data and experience as 
possible from the first such rehearsal since the challenger 
disaster 2 years ago 
the launch team did a superb job on the wet countdown 
demonstration test and accomplished most of the objectives said 
robert crippen deputy director of shuttle operations 
objectives missed during the wet test in which the liquid 
propellants were pumped to the shuttles tanks will be sought 
during a second countdown leading to the 20second firing of 
discoverys three main engines on the launch pad 
launch director bob sieck said a firm schedule for the 
testfiring would not be set until at least tuesday after 
technicians have had a chance to trace the source of the latest 
leak in a launch pad service mast 
the firing already has been delayed four times by various 
problems including another hydrogen leak in the same service mast 
last friday 
the test is considered mandatory before discovery is certified 
ready for the first shuttle flight since the loss of challenger and 
its crew of seven in an explosion shortly after liftoff on jan 28 
1986 
officials believe the practice countdown delays combined with 
an unresolved leak in the spaceships steering thruster system 
could push the launch date back from midseptember into october 
the new leak halted fueling of the shuttles liquid hydrogen 
tank early monday after it had been loaded with 254000 gallons 67 
percent of capacity 
launch director sieck assessed the situation and ordered the 
clock to continue to obtain data on other aspects of the count a 
full load of 143000 gallons was pumped into the liquid oxygen tank 
the clock was stopped as planned by a simulated problem at 11 
seconds before a mock liftoff and the launch team practiced steps 
it would take to recover from a postponement making the shuttle 
safe draining the propellants and getting the vehicle ready for 
another countdown and launch attempt 
the second countdown is to end with the engine test firing with 
discovery bolted to the pad 
the purpose of the dual countdown test is to check modifications 
made to the engines and launch pad since the challenger accident 
and to give the launch team practice 
when the firing is completed nasa still must cope with the 
small gas leak in a steering engine system that is separate from 
discoverys main engines 
engineers have a plan to reach the leak by cutting a hole 
through the rear bulkhead of the shuttles cargo bay 
another option with a decision to be made after the 
testfiring is to take discovery off the pad and back to a hangar 
for repair a move that could postpone the launch until november

theyre making a new woman out of carol 
wright 
wright is the fictional character whose cameo picture appears on 
packets of manufacturers coupons mailed to millions of us 
households each year 
a consumer survey found that she appeared outdated so donnelly 
marketing inc the direct marketing agency that created her is 
gradually transforming her 19yearold look into something more 
contemporary 
they consumers said she looked like beaver cleavers mother 
that she was too perfect in every way and that she probably did 
windows while wearing an apron and pearls said joe fenton 
director of marketing for the carol wright coupon program 
fenton said consumers thought wright looked oldfashioned her 
hairstyle was outdated for example and the wide collar of her 
blouse gave away her age 
donnelly marketing has commissioned a series of new portraits to 
bring her into the 1980s 
the portraits to be phased in between now and november will 
make gradual changes in wrights appearance including darker hair 
a new hairstyle and slight variations in her eyes earrings and

syndicated columnist carl t rowan calling 
himself a pawn in a larger guncontrol debate pleaded innocent 
monday to charges he used an unregistered weapon to shoot a 
teenager who took an uninvited dip in his backyard pool 
rowan has been charged with one count each of possessing an 
unregistered weapon and possessing ammunition for the gun in 
connection with the june 14 shooting both are misdemeanors 
district of columbia superior court hearing commissioner kaye 
christian scheduled trial for sept 22 and released rowan on his 
own recognizance rowan requested a jury trial 
if he is convicted on both charges the columnist could face a 
maximum penalty of two years in prison and a 2000 fine 
the districts 1976 handgun ordinance essentially bans posession 
of handguns and ammunition not owned at the time the law was 
passed except for law officers 
after his court appearance rowan lashed out at those who say he 
is hypocritical for using a handgun 
i am aware that i am the pawn in a brutal game between those 
who favor and those who oppose handgun control rowan said 
reading a prepared statement to dozens of reporters and television 
camera crews i want to make it clear that i still favor a strict 
national law to control the availability of handguns 
there is no hypocrisy in advocating a national policy that no 
one seems to be able to get through congress he said 
the columnist also asserted that he has received additional 
death threats since the shooting incident he had previously told 
police that he obtained the weapon used in the shooting after 
receiving similar threats in 1982 
rowan has said that the gun and ammunition were originally owned 
by his son carl jr who was told that he did not need to register 
them because he was serving as an fbi agent at the time 
outside the courthouse a halfdozen handgun advocates rallied 
in support of the columnists right to bear arms 
we think that carl rowan may be guilty of raving hypocrisy 
but he shouldnt be charged in a court of law today for protecting 
his home with a gun said lee bellinger the leader of action for 
america a conservative activist group that champions the right to 
private handgun ownership we welcome him into the family of 
people protecting their home with guns 
other supporters carried posters reading warning this home 
protected by carl rowan coupled with a rambolike drawing of 
rowans head atop a musclebound guntoting torso still others 
displayed signs reading leave carl rowan alone 
it the rowan shooting shows what can happen in a moment of 
panic said sarah brady wife of james brady president reagans 
press secretary 
she was not at the rally but said in a telephone interview 
with the handgun in most cases you see more cases of misuse than 
you do anything else 
brady became president of handgun control an antihandgun 
group after her husband suffered permanent brain damage when he 
was wounded during john hinckley jrs attempt to assassinate 
reagan in 1981 
rowan 62 was cleared last month of assault charges in the 
shooting incident after an investigation by federal prosecutors 
us attorney jay stephens said at the time that he thought rowan 
should be prosecuted on the weapons charges but deferred that 
decision to district of columbia officials who normally decide 
whether to prosecute such cases 
the shooting occurred rowan said when he heard noises in his 
backyard called police and discovered benjamin smith 18 of 
suburban chevy chase md and three other youths by his pool 
rowan shot smith in the wrist when he said the youth lunged at 
him 
smith and a companion laura bachman 19 were charged with 
unlawful entry but prosecutors dropped the misdemeanor charges in 
exchange for 40 hours of community service work

if as andy warhol said everyone will be famous 
for 15 minutes theyll be able to time their moments in the sun 
with a warholdesigned watch record the event in a 
warholdecorated diary and wear clothes inspired by the late pop 
artist 
a line of warhol products ranging from business planning 
calendars to watches costing several thousand dollars should appear 
in retail stores early next year said roger schlaifer president 
of atlantabased schlaifer nance amp co which owns the marketing 
rights to warhol and his work 
schlaifer whose company until earlier this year marketed 
cabbage patch kids dolls said the warhol products are still being 
developed but he said they would include clothing bedding 
jewelry and paper products such as calendars posters and diaries 
were targeting a young thinking audience where the warhol 
attitude and image is reflected schlaifer said 
some of the items will bear warhols likeness or that of his 
work while others will aim to capture the spirit of the artist 
schlaifer said 
moderately priced items will be sold in better department and 
specialty stores schlaifer said while the expensive products 
will be availble only through more exclusive outlets 
schlaifer who commissioned warhol to do a series of portraits 
of the cabbage patch kids said he proposed to the artist a massive 
marketing effort in 1985 and made a formal presentation a year 
later 
the talks slowed down but were revived only a week before warhol 
died on feb 22 1987 at the age of 58 schlaifer said the deal 
giving schlaifer the marketing rights was finalized later with the 
warhol estate he said 
schlaifer said warhol a former ad man who well known for his 
silverwigged celebrity status as well as for his works of art was 
enthusiastic about the idea 
with his sense of commerce and what we outlined in terms of 
exposure he was very excited schlaifer said andy warhol was 
unique in how he designed himself in a way he made himself as 
unique as his art 
despite warhols flair for publicity and his unconventional 
approach to art schlaifer acknowledged there may be criticism of 
such blatant commercial use of the artists work 
but he defended his plans saying warhol was not averse to 
commercialism and noting that even the most respected museums have 
gift shops 
virtually anything anyone does is subject to criticism he 
said the question is is it appropriate andy had a strong 
commercial instinct 
all museums have huge product enterprises that help support 
the museum and educate the public im not sure where that 
criticism has validity other than the position that art should 
only be in the museums or in books 
schlaifer said warhol did not limit himself to creating museum 
pieces warhol also made movies started interview magazine and 
designed album covers for a number of rock and roll bands 
he was commercial in a noncommercial way that was the 
inherent irony in everything warhol did schlaifer said 
schlaifer is banking on continuing fascination with warhol and 
his work 
theres sort of an automatic excitement with anything 
connected with the warhol name he said 
he noted that an auction earlier this year of artwork and other 
items owned by warhol drew crowds and large sums of money and said 
displays of warhol art particularly a traveling exhibit planned 
next year by new yorks museum of modern art should heighten 
interest 
if anything the acceptance is higher now than when we 
originally proposed this schlaifer said hes a major artist 
by any definition he gets more press dead than most celebrities do 
alive

at the end of the day carlucci told reporters his talks with 
yazov went very well he praised the academy staff for showing 
him the classrooms and laboratories where soviet military strategy 
is developed 
the tone of his speech to the officers was one of doubt about 
the extent to which the soviet military machine has been redirected 
toward defense 
marshal sergei f akhromeyev the soviet chief of staff and 
other senior officers say soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev is 
switching to defense as a military doctrine from the traditional 
predominance of offensive weapons 
we have difficulty in reconciling a defensive doctrine with 
what we see in soviet force structure and operational strategy as 
an emphasis on the offensive carlucci said in his speech we 
see no shift of emphasis to the kind of forces traditionally 
associated with defense 
we also have difficulty reconciling the ussrs pledge not 
to be the first to use nuclear weapons with your continuing 
emphasis on heavy icbms such as the ss18 he said carlucci 
described the soviet armory as a capability more compatible with 
a military doctrine that emphasizes preemptive nuclear strikes 
he criticized the soviet government for not making military 
spending public and said western analysts estimate 15 percent to 17 
percent of the nations wealth goes to defense the current us 
military budget is 59 percent of the gross national product 
no one begrudges you the need for a strong and capable army 
carlucci said what troubles us is when the ussr continues to 
develop forces far in excess of what it needs for purposes of its 
own defense 
he said the us spacebased defense project formally named the 
strategic defense initiative and popularly called star wars is 
a step toward greater stability that does not represent the 
slightest threat to the ussr 
in a 20minute questionandanswer session after the speech 
carlucci defended the size of the us navy and the pentagons 
doctrine of deterrence through adequate armed forces and weaponry 
to reporters he expressed pleasure that his schedule would 
include access to soviet defense installations and equipment such 
as the secret blackjack bomber and the sevastopol naval base on the 
crimean peninsula 
its a unique experience for a us defense secretary he 
said on arrival in moscow the american people through me can see 
what the soviet military is doing and can learn about their 
attitudes and doctrine 
carlucci said he believed he and yazov could be more candid with 
each other than other highlevel officials because we are 
soldiers 
they first met in bern switzerland in march and renewed the 
acquaintance during the reagangorbachev summit at the end of may 
both have called their active schedule of meetings as an 
opportunity to ease tensions and solve problems 
among those traveling with carlucci are ron lehman assistant 
secretary of defense and representatives of the joint chiefs of 
staff and state department 
the americans will see the taman army base and kubinka air 
field both near moscow on tuesday they are to visit the crimea 
on wednesday and leave for turkey the next day after touring a ship 
of the black sea fleet at sevastopol

south africa badly bungled its handling of the 
movie cry freedom turning it into a propaganda victory for 
those fighting apartheid according to donald woods one of the 
subjects of the film 
woods a white south african journalist forced to flee the 
country in 1978 also said on monday that he suspected 
rightwingers close to the government planted three bombs in 
cinemas to disrupt screenings friday 
there are people on the fringes of the security police who can 
be relied upon to do this sort of thing if they get the nod 
woods told the associated press in an interview 
no one was hurt in the three bombings and many white south 
africans saw the film before the government seized all copies 
several hours after it began showing at 30 cinemas 
here for a commonwealth foreign ministers meeting on countering 
south african censorship and propaganda woods said he never 
expected cry freedom to be shown in south africa 
the movie tells the story of his friendship with black activist 
steve biko who died in police custody in 1977 
the fact it was shown even for two showings was a bungle they 
had been counting on the censorship people reversing their 
decision when that failed they were counting on the cinema 
managers to chicken out when they refused the government decided 
to send in the police said woods im surprised at the 
ineptitude 
south africans are normally unaware of the extent to which 
their media are censored but when theres all kinds of controversy 
about a film and they see the government crudely taking the films 
away thats the most blatant form of censorship and even 
nonpoliticized people might be politicized by that 
he said south africans who have seen the movie were staggered 
its the truth of it that hits them to actually see things 
theyve known in their gut were going on woods said 
he hoped the eight commonwealth ministers who meet tuesday and 
wednesday under the chairmanship of canadian foreign minister joe 
clark would decide to finance an underground press in south africa 
and set up a radio service outside the country to disseminate 
uncensored news 
woods said unsigned news reports could be carried out by 
couriers to london or paris and distributed provided they are 
monitored by credible experts 
asked if he had been asked to play such a role woods 54 said 
id rather not say at this stage 
he will moderate a public forum on south african propaganda on 
tuesday 
calling on canada to take the political lead woods said he 
wants western nations to sever diplomatic relations with pretoria 
but to maintain indirect links through the black frontline states 
such as lesotho botswana zimbabwe and swaziland 
theres a myth that white south africans only get tougher if 
you lean on them woods said if every south african traveler 
abroad had to go to lesotho or botswana that would concentrate 
their minds 
the commonwealth summit in vancouver in october asked the 
foreign ministers panel to review the fight against apartheid the 
ministers are from australia canada guyana india nigeria 
tanzania zambia and zimbabwe britain declined because prime 
minister margaret thatcher opposes tougher sanctions against 
pretoria 
woods said mrs thatcher cannot indefinitely defy commonwealth 
european community and postelection us pressure shell end up 
uturning just as she did in 1978 over rhodesia becoming zimbabwe 
canada has organized an arts festival a city hall exhibition of 
photos and posters banned in south africa and a lakefront 
candlelighting ceremony in conjunction with the meeting toronto 
residents were asked to show their opposition to apartheid by 
lighting candles in their windows

jesse jackson and new york mayor edward i koch 
spoke by telephone monday and agreed to meet in an effort to 
resolve their differences and unite the democratic party behind 
michael dukakis in the fall election 
i have always kept open the door to communications i believe 
that people should talk said jackson who lost new yorks 
democratic primary in april and subsequently lost the nomination 
manhattan borough president david dinkins a jackson supporter 
and now cochair of the dukakis campaign in new york state said 
the meeting would be sometime in august but is not likely to 
be this week 
dinkins said the meeting would involve himself jackson koch 
new york gov mario cuomo rep charles rangel and stanley hill a 
black labor leader in new york he said it likely would take place 
in cuomos manhattan office 
koch criticized jackson during the primary race saying jews 
would be crazy to vote for jackson who supports palestinian 
selfdetermination 
jackson said koch called him at his chicago home early monday 
and said he would like to meet 
koch later issued a statement saying i agree that in the 
interest of party unity and the election of michael dukakis it 
would be good to meet with jesse jackson 
the democratic party is built on the premise that people with 
different ideologies can come together under one tent thats what 
gets us elected 
but koch added i dont in any way recant my policy 
differences with jesse jackson they are there i hope to work 
in support of dukakis and then well continue the ideological 
battle at another time 
my feelings toward the mayor are always open and respectful 
jackson said of koch his toward me were very hostile 
jackson said koch used race and religion as a litmus test and 
divided the city and helped to lower the moral tone of the 
campaign 
both dinkins and rangel have been mentioned as possible 
opponents to koch in his reelection bid next year 
koch said he was not trying to use jackson to gain support among 
blacks for his own mayoral campaign 
im not in contention this year koch said and if you 
really believe as i do that its important to have a democrat in 
the white house you set aside those differences 
while dinkins said he welcomed the meeting he questioned its 
impact on the dukakis campaign 
the dukakis campaign and the jackson camp have come together 
pretty well in forging an integrated policy and campaign staff in 
new york state dinkins said 
the new yorkbased american jewish committee said it hoped the 
meeting would help heal the rift between blacks and jews 
we are in favor of anything which would dampen tensions and 
heighten communications between the two communities said ajc 
program director gary rubin 
the meeting will make a step toward doing that and the degree 
to which it would reduce tension we would welcome it he said 
cuomo who helped arrange the meeting said i think it is a 
commendable thing for jesse jackson who feels insulted and who was 
insulted by what was said to say ok you insulted me you hurt 
me but in the interests of a truth greater than me or you i will 
sit down with you because we have urgent problems because 
dukakis and bentsen are the only ones committed to dealing with 
those urgent problems

here are excerpts from the official 
englishlanguage text of the un report on chemical weapons use in 
iran and iraq 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
we deeply regret to say that on the basis of evidence gathered 
during the present mission and in spite of repeated appeals by the 
united nations chemical weapons continue to be used on an 
intensive scale against iranian forces as highlighted by 
previous missions to iran the continued use of such weapons in the 
present conflict increases the risk of their use in future 
conflicts 
it is also clear from accumulated evidence that the use of 
chemical weapons in the present conflict has been intensifying and 
has also become more frequent if such trends continue it may have 
even more serious consequences than those that have already been 
experienced 
the use yperite mustard gas was again confirmed both 
medically and by chemical analysis 
the use of nerve gas or cyanide was not confirmed by chemical 
analysis in the field no doubt owing to their rapid disappearance 
 
according to patients as well as reports of doctors 2000 
people had been affected on the majnoon islands 
the chief of the medical service of the region further said 
that on june 25 there had been a massive attack by iraqi 
forces which had begun with artillery fire using chemical 
ammunition and lasted for approximately two hours later airplanes 
and helicopters had joined the attack 
according to the same source the frontline had been attacked 
with cyanide and organophospherous compounds logistic units 
command posts and reserves had also been attacked but with mustard 
gas four emergency medical centers and one hospital in the zone 
had been attacked with chemical weapons although there had not 
been victims owing to protective measures 
the typical casualty could be described as a male soldier 18 to 
48 years of age mostly in his 20s the average being 24 who 
suffered the effects of chemical agents contained in artillery 
shells or in bombs which exploded on the ground between 4 and 200 
yards away seventyseven percent used a gas mask 
it has been possible to determine without any doubt that in the 
course of june 1988 iranian soldiers were affected by yperite 
mustard gas the 36 cases which were examined displayed typical 
symptoms including lesions of erythema darkening of the skin 
blisters like seconddegree burns and respiratory lesions in a 
few instances 
from the examination of weapon fragments it can be concluded 
that bombs similar in 1984 1986 and 1987 have again been used 
against iranian forces on iranian territory indicating their 
repeated utilization by iraqi forces 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the presence of yperite mustard gas was again confirmed both 
medically and by chemical analysis 
however it is clear that the evidence resulting from this and 
previous missions points to an everincreasing presence of 
different types of weapons associated with aggressive chemical 
agents in the iraniraq conflict which has been leading 
unavoidably to the repeated use of chemical weapons in violation of 
the geneva protocol of 1925 
the patients examined suffered according to their statements 
the effects of chemical agents in a few mortar grenades 
launched against them during two separate attacks with conventional 
mortar munition at two locations near the front 
on july 11 the team visited the camp outside baghdad after 
donning protective equipment supplied by the military authorities 
as some grenades in the stockpile were leaking and were in bad 
condition we went into a bunker containing 81mm mortar grenades 
the number of grenades was stated to be 141 and they were claimed 
to be chemical munition captured from iranian forces in salamcha 
east of basra 
unopened grenades still in wooden crates were tested a 
positive response was obtained suggestive of the presence of a 
blister agent 
by visual examination the alleged chemical grenades were 
compared with a conventional high explosive grenade shown to us and 
were found to be identical 
it has been possible to determine without any doubt that 
between the end of june and the beginning of july nine iraqi 
soldiers were affected by yperite mustard gas four of them in a 
military position named peak 660 near as sulaymaniyah and the 
other five in the military sector of basra 
all of them had at least one of the following types of injury 
typical to exposure to yperite erythema darkening of the skin 
conjunctivitis blisters and injuries common to those found in 
seconddegree burns

maria desillers was cleared monday of any 
connection with fingerprints found at the scene of a yearold 
burglary at an elementary school in which 4000 in donations for 
her late sons liver transplant were stolen 
the still unsolved theft generated an avalanche of publicity and 
prompted president reagan and others to donate a total of 689000 
for her sons three unsuccessful operations after her sons death 
ms desillers was accused of misusing the funds 
fort lauderdale police said last week they had received 
unspecified information linking mrs desillers to the breakin and 
issued a search warrant for her fingerprints 
she submitted to fingerprinting under protest monday and fort 
lauderdale police quickly cleared her of any connection with a 
print left in the school closet where the money was held said 
police spokesman ott cefkin 
she is not a suspect and we have no physical evidence linking 
her to the burglary cefkin said but we would have been remiss 
if we had not pursued it 
he refused to reveal what information led to the demand for 
fingerprints and said the investigation was continuing 
ms desillers was not at home but her attorney roy black said 
he spoke to her after the police announcement 
she was mad said black she feels that shes been 
humiliated and held up to scorn once again theres a lot of people 
out there now who think she stole that money 
earlier monday a dade county circuit court judge refused ms 
desillers request to block the police search warrant seeking her 
fingerprints 
we found enough probable cause to have a judge approve a 
warrant assistant dade state attorney richard shiffrin said 
after the hearing theres probable cause to suspect her in 
criminal activity 
the burglary at st anthons roman catholic school in fort 
lauderdale prompted people across the country to donate money for 
the operations on her son ronnie 
among the 689000 raised for the boy was a 1000 donation from 
president reagan and his wife nancy and a 200000 gift from miami 
beach millionaire victor posner 
fort lauderdale police said a thief broke into a closet at the 
accounting office of the school and took the money which was 
raised by ronnies classmates through bake sales flower sales and 
other fundraisers most of the money was in change and small bills 
ronnie desillers died in april 1987 while awaiting a fourth 
liver transplant at pittsburghs childrens hospital ms desillers 
has refused to pay 262000 in medical bills to childrens hospital 
in pittsburgh saying her son received improper care 
a courtappointed caretaker of the donated funds said ms 
desillers improperly used 200000 of the money on luxury items 
ranging from jewelry to a bmw sports car 
on thursday a dade circuit judge ruled that she is not entitled 
to the remaining 240000 of the donated money and that it should 
instead pay medical bills debts and help other needy ill children

defrocked preacher jimmy 
swaggart visited the birthplace of jesus in the occupied west bank 
on monday and said the palestinian uprising was the work of the 
devil 
swaggart who also toured a jewish settlement told the 
associated press nothing could destroy israel because the prophets 
predicted its establishment 
the prophets foretold of the nation of israel once 
becoming a state and the people coming back to israel swaggart 
said in bethlehem where he videotaped two 20minute tv programs 
gods arch enemy satan does not want these prophecies to be 
fulfilled and will do everything he can to end it and to cause 
difficulties 
thats how the political unrest enters in it today he said 
referring to the nearly eightmonth uprising in the occupied lands 
swaggart and his entourage then proceeded to tekoa a jewish 
settlement about nine miles south of jerusalem and got a taste of 
the uprising when their black mercedes limousine drove around a 
burning tire that blocked the road 
jewish settler bobby brown received swaggart and his wife 
frances on a vinecovered patio typical of the flourishing lush 
settlement 
quoting from the old testaments book of amos brown told 
swaggart the jewish settlers were reviving a land that had laid 
barren and empty for thousands of years 
do you think this is a fulfillment of the prophecy swaggart 
asked 
i believe that brown saidthe work were doing is gods 
work 
swaggart who brought 350 followers to israel at a time when 
many tourists are shunning the country has been welcomed with open 
arms but a columnist in the hebrew davar newspaper warned monday 
that swaggarts support of israel was a doubleedged sword 
according to swaggarts theory the state of israel is merely a 
vehicle to the coming of the second kingdom when all jews will 
have to convert to christianity wrote columnist yoram perry 
no jimmy swaggart does not love us perry wrote 
certainly not love for its own sake 
swaggart who runs a television ministry that reaches 2 million 
viewers from its base in baton rouge la stepped down from the 
pulpit in february after admitting he sinned against his wife 
a prostitute said he paid her to strip and perform lewd acts for 
him during visits to a motel 
the lousiana assemblies of god denomination revoked his ministry 
credentials after he returned to the pulpit against their wishes in 
may

thousands of poles marking the 44th 
anniversary of the warsaw uprising against the nazis demanded 
monday that the soviet union end its silence over alleged 
atrocities against poles during world war ii 
speakers also called for less interference from moscow and 
demanded the right to hold free elections 
moscow has to realize that we fought on all fronts of the war 
but we still have not regained our freedom said wojciech 
ziembinski an independent opposition activist 
crowds filled warsaws powazki military cemetery to pay homage 
to those who fell during the 63day revolt against nazi occupation 
the nazis crushed the uprising more than 245000 people were 
killed and 85 percent of the city was destroyed 
while scores of poles lighted candles and laid flowers on the 
graves of friends and family members hundreds of others gathered 
around a granite monument to polish officers murdered in the katyn 
forest near the soviet city of smolensk 
the massacre remains one of polands most bitter wartime 
memories and a sore spot in its relations with the soviet union 
the soviets have never acknowledged responsibility for the 
incident in which 4300 polish military officers were shot to 
death and left in a mass grave 
western historical sources indicate the poles were murdered on 
the orders of soviet dictator josef stalin in the spring of 1940 
but official soviet and polish histories claim that the nazis 
killed them in 1941 
a banner draped across the monument monday read give us 
truth katyn 1940 later a group of youths raised a banner which 
read solidarity will prove the truth about katyn 
last year an official commission was established by the polish 
and soviet governments to investigate the incident 
to the disappointment of many poles soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev did not mention katyn during a speech to the polish 
parliament in july however he did make a general pledge to 
continue to pursue the elimination of gaps in official histories 
although the katyn memorial was the emotional focus of mondays 
tribute the gathering quickly turned political in tone 
we want the renewal of poland but not for communism said 
seweryn jaworski an activist of the outlawed solidarity trade 
union in a reference to the governments reform plans 
while none of the solidarity leadership was visible at the katyn 
monument the crowd repeatedly flashed the unions twofingered

the chief of police detectives in this 
sicilian capital resigned monday deepening a crisis in italys 
battle against the mafia 
the resignation of antonio nicchi came two days after italys 
top investigator of organized crime giovanni falcone and eight 
fellow magistrates resigned from the antimafia pool in sicily 
asking to be transferred 
a prominent sicilian prosecutor paolo borsellino two weeks ago 
charged that mafia investigations were being blocked by top 
judicial officials an inefficient and chaotic police department 
and an indifferent state 
in palermo you cant work in peace any more nicchi told 
journalists monday 
borsellino said detectives had not produced any significant 
reports on the mafia since 1982 
but nicchi told the palermo newspaper lora ive been in this 
office since 1985 and i have presented a dozen reports on the 
mafia on drugs on homicides even on the new balance of power 
between the crime families 
borsellinos declarations to journalists prompted president 
francesco cossiga to order the ministries of justice and interior 
and the superior council of magistrates which oversees judges to 
investigate problems in the antimafia unit in sicily 
on monday politicians and newspapers called on the state to pay 
more attention to the war on organized crime 
people ought to know that judges alone cannot fight the mafia 
phenomenon and that the battle against the mafia will never be won 
without an adequate commitment from political forces and in first 
place those of the government said the president of the national 
association of judges raffaele bertoni

after years of personnel cuts and tight budgets 
the move came on the 61st anniversary of the peoples liberation 
army and 23 years after mao tsetung banned ranks as inappropriate 
to his classless peasant army 
on oct 1 chinas national day soldiers are to don new 
uniforms with insignia designating their military positions 
the government also issued regulations spelling out awards to be 
given to servicemen and their families so as to encourage their 
dedicated spirit in defending and building the motherland 
the new regulations guarantee servicemen that they will not lose 
their farmland when they are conscripted as well offer pensions to 
those disabled in combat and pay damages to the families of those 
who died in combat 
on saturday communist party secretary general zhao ziyang and 
other senior leaders gathered at the great hall of the people to 
bestow medals on more than 80000 veterans 
western military analysts in beijing who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the ranking system was designed to raise the morale 
of the army after troop strength and state funding were slashed in 
the past decade and many military factories were converted to 
civilian use 
the analysts said a need for reinstating ranks became evident 
after the chinese armys embarrassing showing in a brief 1979 
border war with vietnam 
these kinds of units need a strict command structure with a 
clear delineation as to who is giving and who is receiving the 
orders said a diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity 
before today they didnt have that 
the analysts said mondays move is also aimed at ridding the 
army of leftist influences 
in 1965 mao abolished military ranks as part of his attempt to 
create a radically egalitarian society in which a massive peasant 
army would would be called on to fight a peoples war 
deng xiaoping who rose to power in 1978 has rejected maos 
concept and has tried to create a professional army today 70 
percent of military commanders have college educations compared to 
16 percent in 1982 
deng who controls the military as head of the central military 
commission has reduced the size of chinas armed forces to 3 
million from 4 million in 1985 and has introduced modern 
technology 
he has also shaved the militarys share of the government budget 
from 175 percent in 1978 to less than 10 percent 
deng has also supported the transfer of cadres or officers 
to civilian duty as part of an effort to cut the oversized corps 
many of whom were either aging or poorly trained 
among the 1 million soldiers demobilized in the past few years 
450000 were cadres the government announced that an additional 
100000 officers would be transferred to a civilian staff of 
educators and specialists

the atlanta journal and the atlanta constitution 
bucking recent trends in newspaper style have restored the use of 
courtesy titles for men and women in their news columns 
under the new rules the first reference to individuals will 
include full proper names along with the use of public military 
professional and ecclesiastical titles the newspapers said in a 
frontpage note announcing the policy in their combined editions 
sunday 
on second reference names will be preceded by the earned 
title or the courtesy title for all individuals and not just for 
women as is now the case 
for example when the newspaper writes about the citys top 
elected official it will be mayor andrew young on first reference 
and mayor young on subsequent references or in stories about one 
of the citys top businessmen it will be ted turner followed by 
mr turner 
the decision is in contrast to many newspapers which have moved 
closer to dropping courtesy titles such as mr mrs miss or ms 
only a few newspapers notably the new york times and the wall 
street journal use the courtesy title mr 
for some time we have been troubled by the limited use of 
courtesy titles in our news columns editor bill kovach said in 
the frontpage note 
we hope the sense of dignity and respect that the consistent 
use of courtesy titles implies will more adequately reflect the 
relationship we believe exists between us and our readers said 
kovach who came to the newspapers from the new york times 
washington bureau 
the newspapers left unchanged their policy for sports stories 
which do not include courtesy titles for men or women

officials at city hall had reason to blush 
a little monday a radio reporter caught them watering the lawn on 
the wrong day 
for several months the city has restricted lawn sprinkling 
because of problems in the water distribution system evennumbered 
addresses are allowed to water on evennumbered days while those 
with oddnumbered addresses can do so on the opposite days 
well city hall is located at 200 n walker ave an 
evennumbered address 
and monday was aug 1 an odd number 
but for much of the morning a sprinkler was running on the city 
hall lawn 
city spokeswoman karen farney acknowledged the mistake 
she told radio station komaam the sprinkler will be left off 
tuesday to make up for the error 
and she acknowledged that the city was not setting the best of 
examples

droughtstricken farmers may get some 
federal aid by the october harvest but only if congress passes a 
relief bill in the next two weeks and gets it past president 
reagan agriculture secretary richard lyng said monday 
separate versions of the bill which will cost between 4 
billion and 6 billion to implement have passed in both houses of 
congress but lyng warned that the senate version contains some 
provisions he considers extravagant 
i am hopeful they will be able to reconcile their differences 
and take out some of the more extravagant provisions that do not 
really apply to those farmers that have suffered in the drought 
lyng said at a news conference before addressing the annual meeting 
of the soil and water conservation society 
if that reconciliation comes in the next two weeks financial 
assistance could be on its way to farmers close to the first of 
october i would hope that we could do it around the time that 
would coincide with the normal harvest he said 
lyng said a joint conference committee is to meet wednesday to 
discuss both versions of the bill 
he said he considers amendments in the house version alloting 
assistance to farmers who produce their own feed for their 
livestock more feasible than the senate version which broadens aid 
to include livestock and poultry farmers who do not grow their own 
feed 
lyng said he would not disclose what his own recommendations to 
reagan will be nor would he predict if the measure will be vetoed 
lyng also said recent rain has helped the cornbelt but not 
enough 
the economic damage is very severe in the cornbelt unlike 
anything we have ever seen he said

roadblocks to check drivers for signs of 
intoxication are ineffective and unconstitutional the michigan 
court of appeals ruled monday in upholding a lower courts ruling 
against the state 
while the goals of the sobriety checkpoint program are 
laudable the program fails to qualify as a reasonable seizure 
under the fourth amendment the threejudge appeals panel wrote 
in a unanimous opinion 
the state attorney generals office did not immediately have a 
comment about the ruling or any plans for further appeals the 
michigan supreme court in 1975 refused to rule on the 
constitutionality of systematic roadblock stops 
mondays ruling upholds the conclusions of wayne county circuit 
judge michael stacey who issued a permanent injunction stopping 
the roadblocks on the grounds that they violated both the federal 
and state constitutions 
howard simon executive director of the aclus michigan chapter 
praised staceys 60page opinion as the most extensive 
definitive bestreasoned analysis in the country of the alleged 
effectiveness of sobriety roadblocks and the extent to which they 
intrude upon the civil liberties of innocent motorists 
im glad it was upheld he said now the state should do 
what we suggested all the time namely get down to the business of 
cracking down on drunken driving without violating the rights of 
innocent motorists 
the program devised by state police followed a blueprint drafted 
from check lane laws in 37 other states and the district of 
columbia its prime model was marylands program and the opinion 
noted the testimony of a maryland state police lieutenant who said 
checkpoints there yielded few drunken driving arrests 
gov james blanchard who pushed through the program and made it 
one of his top priorities in 1986 would not comment until his 
staff had time to review the decision spokesman tom scott said 
the issue of antidrunk checkpoints has come up in courts in 
about half of the states with mixed results according to the 
michigan appellate opinion 
state courts in virginia illinois florida and massachusetts 
have upheld the roadblocks while they have been struck down in 
oregon washington and new hampshire 
the us supreme court hasnt ruled on antidrunk roadblocks but 
implied in a 1979 case that they are acceptable the high court 
said police may not selectively stop drivers who are not suspected 
of breaking any law but mentioned roadblocks among possible 
acceptable alternatives 
in 1986 the high court refused to hear arguments in a case 
challenging virginias roadblocks that decision had the effect of 
letting virginia continue the checkpoints

most of 181 local prosecutors interviewed by a 
weekly legal affairs newspaper said they are having little or no 
impact in the war against drugs despite higher spending the paper 
reported monday 
the prosecutors called for more money for their efforts and 
rated some federal drugfighting policies as little help the 
national law journal said 
it said a quarter of the prosecutors favored decriminalizing 
marijuana 
sixtyfive percent of the prosecutors who were interviewed said 
their resources were inadequate to fight drugs as well as more 
money most called for laws making it easier to seize property from 
drug offenders 
but more than seven in 10 of those interviewed called the 
federal governments zero tolerance program not very 
important or not important the journal said that program 
includes moves to seize property in which federal agents find even 
a minuscule amount of illegal drugs 
dean st dennis a justice department spokesman said monday he 
believed prosecutors would favor the zerotolerance program if they 
knew fully about it he also said the department strongly opposed 
marijuana decriminalization 
the journal said it interviewed the chief prosecutors or their 
top drug deputies in 181 of the 250 largest local jurisdictions in 
the country this month the local prosecutors were promised 
confidentiality statewide and federal prosecutors were not 
interviewed 
when asked about the effect of their work six in 10 of those 
interviewed said they had very little or no impact in reducing the 
illegal drug supply about as many said they had little or no 
impact raising the price of drugs and 57 percent said they had 
little or no impact deterring drug use

the worlds anglican bishops on 
monday rejected a call to refrain from consecrating women bishops 
and accepted a compromise resolution that such elevation of women 
should not divide the anglican communion 
on a show of hands the bishops voted 42328 with 19 abstentions 
to maintain links with any of their 27 selfgoverning churches 
which consecrate a woman bishop even if they disagree 
the us episcopalians and the canadian and new zealand 
anglicans say they may consecrate a woman bishop by the end of this 
year 
the resolution preserving the unity of the 70 millionmember 
anglican communion was drafted by conference participants who 
considered it for most of the first two weeks of the threeweek 
lambeth conference 
it is the bishops first gathering in 10 years 
on a secret ballot the bishops voted 277187 against a 
resolution proposed by archbishop of sydney donald robinson that 
the churches should refrain from consecrating a woman as bishop 
to avoid further damage over the issue of women priests and bishops 
archbishop of canterbury robert runcie spiritual leader of the 
church of england and leader of the anglican communion said after 
the two votes that despite differences of opinion the conference 
acted in a spirit of unity 
runcie said before the vote that however the count went he 
agreed with its recommendation that he appoint a commission to 
prepare guidelines for relations among the churches once women 
bishops are appointed he said his commission would start 
meetings well before the end of this year 
runcie said of the compromise resolution it wasnt a fudge 
it was very carefully worked out respecting of differences and the 
determination to live together tell me what other way you hold 
a communion together when it is deeply divided about something 
which is of great importance to some people and of little 
importance to others in the mission of the church 
robinson metropolitan of new south wales said his resolution 
simply invited the conference to express its mind 
it is contrary to the explicit teaching of the new testament 
that women be given responsibility for the authority of the 
scriptures in the congregation he said 
but presiding bishop edmond l browning of the us episcopal 
church which has ordained hundreds of women priests in the past 11 
years differed 
restraint is not a true option browning said when we 
heard or read that it is only a matter of time before women will be 
elected bishops in us episcopal church this is not a statement 
of defiance it is simply looking into our future as a province 
church based on our past and our present 
ordained women are already a feature of our church life our 
people have been blessed by the priestly ministry of ordained women 
for more than a decade therefore the people of our diocese move 
ahead toward calling women to be bishops in a way that is authentic 
to our experience 
many of the anglican bishops clergy and laity oppose ordaining 
women about 1200 women priests have been ordained by a minority 
of the churches mostly by the us episcopalians opponents call 
the practice contrary to scripture and tradition they say they 
could not accept a woman bishop though they might eventually accept 
women priests 
bishops are regarded as the successors of the apostles of jesus 
christ all were men 
bishop william pwaisiho of malaita in the pacific territory of 
melanesia denounced ordaining women as satanic 
i think you are not listening to us and my color doesnt 
help either said pwaisiho who is black 
no woman should be consecrated for the sake of the unity we 
seek appealed another african prelate bishop benjamin nwankiti 
of owerri nigeria 
but a black prelate from washington dc bishop john t 
walker said white men who had long prevented blacks from becoming 
bishops were now using the same arguments against women 
in christ there is neither male nor female walker said

income for families record numbers of jobs low inflation and 
interest rates steady growth and respect not just lipservice for 
families reagan asked 
the american people may have a thing or two to say about 
that 
reagan said that same candidate claims he has balanced 10 
budgets in a row 
but the president said that the dukakis budget for massachusetts 
includes almost a half a billion dollars of new borrowing 
drawing reserves and tapping pension funds and the kind of 
creative accounting that nearly sent new york city to the poor 
house a few years ago 
america this year has come to a divide in the road reagan 
said take one fork and we continue in the direction that bill 
roth has helped chart 
take the other and in four years all of us may be picking up 
the pieces today america has peace and prosperity growth and

drunkendriving experts and bus safety 
officials will join witnesses to a bus crash that killed 27 people 
when testimony gets under way tuesday in a national transportation 
safety board hearing 
the may 17 accident occurred when a pickup truck going the wrong 
way on interstate 71 slammed into a bus owned by the radcliff first 
assembly of god church authorities contend the driver of the 
pickup was drunk at the time 
ntsb spokesman allan pollock said accident survivors probably 
will not testify because the agency doesnt want to traumatize them 
the pickup driver larry mahoney 35 has been indicted on 27 
counts of murder 13 counts of firstdegree assault 44 counts of 
firstdegree wanton endangerment and one count of drunken driving 
it will be the worst drunkendriving accident in us history if he 
is convicted on the final charge according to the ntbs and mothers 
against drunk driving 
the board will hear testimony on six issues five of which 
concern drunken driving pollack said the sixth involves bus 
safety 
pollock said testimony will be taken on the performance and 
capabilities of drivers under the influence of alcohol the extent 
of the drunkendriving problem and the effectiveness of alcohol 
education and treatment programs 
he said the witnesses also will address the adequacy of 
sanctions kentuckys courts impose on drunken drivers and the 
development of effective alcohol countermeasure programs like jail 
terms fines and license revocation 
the accident has raised questions about bus safety because all 
67 passengers on board survived the impact but the victims died 
when the buss gas tank was punctured causing a fire that quickly 
engulfed the vehicle the fire blocked the front door leaving the 
rear emergency door as the only escape route 
the safety issues to be discussed include emergency exits the 
upgrading of buses built before april 1977 when stricter federal 
safety rules became effective the flammability of seats and the 
placement and protection of the fuel tank 
the board will draft a report on the probable causes of the 
crash and make recommendations for avoiding similar accidents the 
recommendations could be directed toward federal state and local 
officials as well as bus manufacturers but the safety board has 
no power to require that any of them be implemented

a deliveryman who foiled a robbery by 
ramming his truck into a getaway car says he just wanted to get the 
thieves license number but he was angry too 
i was a little mad that i walked in for a delivery and i was 
getting robbed while i was at work said tom swartz 30 a 
driver for united parcel service 
at a preliminary hearing last friday swartz identified the 
suspects gillie garcia 50 and edmund herrera 31 as the men who 
were robbing city surplus paint co when swartz made a delivery to 
the store in the denver suburb of mountain view on june 16 
the intruders had bound three employees in a back office 
emptied the cash register and robbed several customers when the ups 
driver walked in authorities said swartz said he too was robbed 
as the men fled with about 400 swartz followed them out i 
decided to go get the license number he said 
he got into his ups truck and drove around to the side of the 
store where he saw a cadillac coming at him with one robber 
inside he rammed his truck into the car swartz said 
police arrested herrera at the scene and later took garcia into 
custody in nearby lakewood 
the episode received national attention because an initial 
report quoted witnesses as saying swartzs ups supervisor had 
cursed him for damaging the company truck and threatened to 
take away his good driving record a basis for promotions 
swartz and the company later said the supervisor had not cursed 
swartz and ups praised the drivers actions saying the collision 
would not be charged against his record the company honored swartz 
for heroism at a reception june 24 
in fridays hearing jefferson county judge robert morris 
concluded there was sufficient evidence to try both suspects on six 
counts each of aggravated robbery and one count each of felony 
menacing 
the men both held on 100000 bonds are to be arraigned aug 
15 in jefferson county district court

returned to central america in hopes of retrieving his airplane 
his brother said monday 
william denby said his brother james is trying to clear a lien 
that was placed on the plane to ensure payment of fees to the 
lawyer who represented him in nicaraguan courts

denby who said his brother had been in central america for a 
couple of weeks 
on dec 6 james denby was flying to a farm he owns in costa 
rica when his singleengine cessna was hit by rifle fire and he was 
forced to land on the nicaraguan coast 
nicaraguan officials said they found documents linking denby to 
usbacked contra rebels fighting the countrys leftist sandinista

denby denied the allegations although he said in a 1987 
interview with the associated press that he had ferried wounded 
contras to hospitals in his plane 
he was acquitted by a nicaraguan court in early february 
at the time denby said in news interviews he would be very

his brother apparently has gotten or is getting his aircraft back 
from the government

the mental hospital where john w hinckley jr 
is being held was ordered monday to justify its plan to allow the 
presidential assailant to join a daylong field trip outside the 
hospital with other patients 
us district judge barrington d parker granted a request by 
federal prosecutors for a court hearing on the proposal by st 
elizabeths hospital to let hinckley go on a supervised 
recreational day trip away from the guarded facility 
parker gave the hospital until friday to file with him all 
treatment records and other documents to support its conclusion 
that hinckley would benefit therapeutically from the trip and 
that he could participate without posing a danger to himself or 
to others 
hinckley who shot and wounded president reagan and three others 
on march 31 1981 has been held at st elizabeths since 1982 when 
he was acquitted of criminal charges by reason of insanity 
last year the government successfully opposed an attempt by 
hospital authorities to allow hinckley to visit his parents over

church of england envoy terry waite and the other 
foreign hostages held in lebanon may be released by the end of the 
year an anglican archbishop back from discussions in iran 
predicted monday 
britain meanwhile said it is reviewing its strained relations 
with iran further fueling hopes of freedom for hostages believed 
held by proiranian extremists in lebanon 
the news followed a weekend in which prime minister margaret 
thatcher spoke of improving britishiranian relations and the 
church of england announced it had sent a church official on a 
hostage mission to lebanon 
david penman the archbishop for melbourne australia and an 
expert on islam said after his trip to tehran that intuition 
leads him to believe the hostages will be released from lebanon 
after israels nov 1 elections and us elections a week later 
i would not be surprised if terry waite and the others were 
released before the end of the year penman told a news 
conference in canterbury where he is attending an international 
conference of anglican bishops he visited tehran on his way to 
england last month 
penman said he had discussions about waite in tehran with some 
of my hosts but i cannot talk about them 
waite disappeared in beirut jan 20 1987 while seeking the 
release of american hostages no one has claimed to hold him 
seventeen other foreigners including nine americans are believed 
held in lebanon 
the longest held is terry anderson 40 chief middle east 
correspondent of the associated press he was abducted march 16 
1985 
waites brother david said he hoped penman was right about the 
hostages release but warned the moment you start talking about 
it being over by such and such a date and that date passes it is 
a big anticlimax 
mrs thatcher expressed hope for improved relations in a letter 
to david waite which was made public saturday 
two london newspapers the independent and daily telegraph 
reported monday that penman was on a mission for runcie but penman 
said he was invited by the iranians and the trips primary purpose 
was to discuss iranianaustralian relations 
bishop john brown whose diocese includes cyprus and all persian 
gulf nations except iran went to lebanon at runcies request last 
week to speak to lbanese christian leaders about four iranians who 
disappeared while traveling in a christiancontrolled zone outside 
beirut in july 1982 
they were presumed kidnapped but no one claimed responsibility 
there have been unconfirmed reports that they were killed 
brown said sunday that he hoped his mission contributed 
towards the overall picture which i hope will lead towards the 
release of all the hostages 
the foreign office said britains review of relations with 
tehran follows irans acceptance of a un resolution calling for a 
ceasefire in irans 8yearold war with iraq 
british ministers are reviewing the whole gamut of 
angloiranian relations including the possibility of sending a 
diplomat to tehran for a short period of time said a foreign 
office spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity 
britain and iran all but broke off diplomatic relations last 
summer after an iranian envoy was arrested for shoplifting in 
england and a british diplomat was arrested and beaten in tehran 
britain left its mission in tehran vacant but iran has kept its 
charge daffairs akunzadeh basti in london 
basti said monday following an hourlong meeting at the foreign 
office that a better atmosphere is developing

passengers said the pilot went on the 
intercom to brag about the advanced electronic wizardry aboard 
their 2weekold delta air lines jetliner minutes later the plane 
overshot a runway and wound up mired in the mud 
none of the 87 passengers and six crew members was injured when 
flight 278 from atlanta ran out of runway during the monday morning 
landing at pensacola regional airport said airline and aviation 
officials the flight was to have continued to baton rouge la 
passenger kenneth h laraway of atlanta said those aboard 
remained calm when the plane came to a halt and many laughed when a 
flight attendant said welcome to pensacola 
a half hour later we are standing in line out here to book 
new flights to baton rouge saying yeah its got all these 
digital readouts and whatnot but the brakes still work the same 
way youve got to put your foot on the brake pedal laraway 
said 
federal aviation administration spokesman jack barker in atlanta 
said there was no immediate indication what caused the 
mcdonnelldouglas twinjet aircraft an updated version of the 
dc9 to roll off the end of the runway but he said the plane 
appeared to have landed late 
passenger cyril j turner of atlanta who said he usually flies 
at least a couple of times every week said the jetliner appeared 
to be coming down faster than normal and the braking was sudden 
when it touched down 
i could feel that the pilot was trying to exert the brakes 
with some urgency turner said when i looked out the window 
again we were approaching a grassy area we didnt finally stop 
until we hit that grass area 
the rear 15 or 20 feet of the plane remained over the end of the 
runway said airport director frank miller the faa and delta were 
investigating 
delta officials were interviewing the pilots monday afternoon 
but the airline does not disclose identities of crew members said 
jackie pate a delta spokeswoman in atlanta 
she said she was unable to respond to comments by passengers 
because the investigation was still under way 
a lot of times passengers perceive things differently than 
what actually has gone on ms pate said 
the main runway was closed for nearly five hours while crews 
removed the jetliner but airport operations were unaffected as 
aircraft were able to use another runway miller said he said 
there was no apparent damage and delta was preparing to ferry the 
plane back to atlanta

saudi arabia wants to keep buying weapons from 
the united states although it also will build its stock with 
purchases from elsewhere the saudi embassy said monday 
seeking to dispel any notion of a ussaudi rift the embassy 
released a statement on the saudi decision to buy 17 billion worth 
of military equipment including 50 tornado jet fighters from 
britain 
the kingdom would like to reiterate its desire to obtain its 
military requirements including advanced aircraft and defense 
arms from american plants with the full conviction of our 
peaceful intentions the statement said it was attributed to 
an unnamed source who was quoted by the saudi press agency 
the state department has complained that the deal was not in the 
interest of the united states 
for decades the saudis relied mainly on the united states to 
supply weapons but supporters of israel in washington have blocked 
the sale of some sophisticated weapons claiming they could be used 
against the jewish state 
the statement said the british sale will not affect either in 
the shortterm or longterm the strength of ties between 
washington and riyadh 
although the saudis will continue trying to secure weapons from 
the united states they will buy from any country as long as there 
are no restrictions the statement said 
last week king fahd said saudi arabia will not hesitate to 
purchase weapons from communist suppliers

the 1984 presidential campaign committee of 
sen john glenn dohio has agreed to pay a 30000 civil penalty 
to settle alleged violations of federal election law officials 
said monday 
the federal election commission said it had found probable cause 
to believe that the glenn committee and its treasurer william r 
white accepted excessive campaign contributions misreported cash 
and spending levels and exceeded spending limits 
the information was made public in a voluntary conciliation 
agreement between the agency and the committee that was released 
by the fec 
the fec charged that the glenn committee accepted a total of 
81326 in excessive campaign contributions and exceeded 
presidential primary spending limits in iowa by 149439 and in new 
hampshire by 219348 
the agency said the committee apparently accepted excess 
contributions from 126 individuals seven partnerships and four 
political committees it said that while the committee issued 
51676 in refunds and legally reattributed 30025 to other 
donors the actions were not taken in a timely manner 
the committee had argued that the law allows it to determine 
whether a contribution is legal and gives it a reasonable time 
to refund any amounts exceeding the limit it said it proceeded 
with reasonable diligence in making that determination and 
issued the refunds in a reasonable time 
the fec also charged that the committee understated spending and 
overstated its cash on hand between april 1983 and march 1984 in 
its reports to the fec

a florida turnpike toll booth 
manager who opened her own lanes allegedly kept as much as 15000 
paid by motorists a state transportation official said 
lorna j hoff 33 was arrested april 2 after a stakeout by 
department of transportation and state attorneys office 
investigators at the palm beach gardens interchange she had 844 
and 750 toll tickets with her when she was stopped authorities 
said 
according to tim valentine a state attorneys investigator who 
headed the operation ms hoff subsequently admitted to having 
pilfered several hundred dollars worth of tolls on two or 
three occasions following her promotion to manager march 4 
ms hoffs admission led to dismissal from her 17394ayear 
job and she was charged with grand theft 
her 10year tenure with the dot coupled with the fact that she 
had no prior record led prosecutors to agree to drop the charge 
when she agreed to pay back the 844 and take part in a pretrial 
intervention program 
but the dot refused to consent to the pretrial deal leaving 
the grand theft charge standing and dot chief of toll facilities 
john berry now says she may have stolen as much as 15000 
subsequent investigation into hoffs activities has led the 
state to believe the former toll manager may have milked a single 
toll lane about 14 times he said 
weve been working reconstructing certain reports and 
determined its a lot more than 844 berry said 
berry said evidence indicated that hoff who as manager was not 
actually supposed to work a toll booth had kept toll funds on days 
she took regular attendants off the work schedule and put herself 
on an operating lane 
he said this was noticed because the regular attendants were 
logged in for the days work but their endofday receipts were 
not reported

president reagan heard arguments monday for 
and against us participation in a treaty aimed at freezing 
emissions of an important precursor of acid rain 
the pollutant in question oxides of nitrogen accounts for 
about onethird of the acidity in rainfall in the eastern united 
states and canada 
the cabinets domestic policy council with reagan presiding 
was briefed on a proposal coming from a united nationssponsored 
negotiation that would freeze emissions until 1996 pending further 
research on the effects of nitrogen oxides and how to reduce them 
reagan made no decision but participants expect one soon 
oxides of nitrogen are formed in the combustion of fossil fuels 
in industry utilities and motor vehicles in the air they may be 
transformed into nitric acid in urban areas they are an essential 
raw material for making smog 
us emissions have been roughly steady since 1980 and according 
to epa projections should remain that way until about 1995 when 
slow increases should start the 213 million tons emitted in 1986 
the most recent year available were 85 percent below the peak 
year of 1978 
according to two participants in discussions over the issue 
both of whom spoke on condition of anonymity the environmental 
protection agency supports joining the treaty while the energy 
department supported by the interior and commerce departments and 
the office of management and budget opposes it 
epa spokesmen declined to discuss their agencys participation 
in the meeting the telephone of an energy department official to 
whom questions were referred did not answer 
the united states in 1985 declined to join a similar 
international agreement calling for a 30 percent reduction in 
emissions of the other major precursor of acid rain sulfur dioxide

cambodian prince norodom sihanouk went to north 
korea monday after informing chinese officials of the unfruitful 
efforts to end the war in cambodia 
and a magazine said authorities in bejing are refusing to allow 
former cambodia ruler pol pot to leave china where the leader of 
the khmer rouge regime is hospitalized for unspecified treatment 
sihanouk who resigned last month as head of the cambodian 
resistance coalition flew to north korea for a short visit 
the korean central news agency reported in pyongyang north koreas 
capital sihanouk is to go to tokyo monday for a week 
during his twoday visit to beijing sihanouk told chinese 
leaders the prospects for peace in cambodia were very slim 
he advised the chinese about last weeks talks in indonesia that 
involved cambodia vietnam and the threemember cambodian 
resistance alliance made up of the radical communist khmer rouge 
anticommunist forces and sihanouks followers 
sihanouk did not participate in the talks but was represented by 
his son 
vietnam invaded cambodia in december 1978 ousted the khmer 
rouge and installed another communist regime the khmer rouge then 
began guerrilla warfare against the estimated 100000 vietnamese 
troops in cambodia 
the khmer rouge under pol pot gained power in the spring of 
1975 with the collapse of the usbacked government hundreds of 
thousands of cambodians perished during the khmer rouges harsh 
efforts to turn cambodia into a communist agrarian society 
china backed the khmer rouge while the soviet union supports the 
vietnamese 
sihanouk met sunday with vice premier wu xueqian who said the 
indonesian meeting marked the beginning of a search for a political 
settlement in cambodia but accused vietnam of being insincere 
upon his arrival in beijing saturday night sihanouk criticized 
both vietnam and the khmer rouge the strongest member of the 
resistance coalition 
vietnam has insisted that the khmer rouge must not be allowed to 
return to power china although it had supported the pol pot 
regime has said sihanouk should lead a future cambodia government 
that should not be dominated by the khmer rouge 
in hong kong the chineselanguage magazine cheng ming said 
chinese authorities will not allow pol pot to leave china it said 
pol pot is being treated at a beijing hospital for unspecified 
ailments 
the magazine said china will offer political asylum to pol pot 
it reported there was a tacit agreement between china and the 
united states that china would stop supplying military aid to 
groups loyal to pol pot and would not allow him to regain power in 
cambodia 
pol pot officially retired in september 1985 as commander in 
chief of the khmer rouge army and was named director of the partys 
institute for national defense the move was seen as an attempt by 
the khmer rouge to improve its international image 
sihanouk was deposed by the military as cambodias head of state 
in march 1970 and the monarchy was abolished that october

a federal appeals court monday upheld the 1987 
conviction of rep mario biaggi dny while a jury deliberated 
racketeering charges against him in the wedtech corruption trial 
us district judge constance baker motley immediately 
sequestered the jury in the wedtech case at the request of biaggis 
lawyer who called the appeals court ruling a great problem for 
us 
motley had planned to sequester the jury beginning tuesday night 
after late arriving jurors on monday were confronted by 
demonstrators outside the courthouse chanting down with 
political corruption and compensate wedtech workers 
the jury ended its third day of deliberations monday without a 
verdict 
mondays ruling by the 2nd us circuit court of appeals upheld 
biaggis sept 22 1987 conviction for obstructing justice and 
accepting an unlawful gratuity biaggi was convicted of accepting 
free florida vacations with a female companion from former brooklyn 
democratic leader meade esposito 
the appeals panel also upheld the conviction of the 80yearold 
esposito 
biaggi 71 a 10term congressman from the bronx was convicted 
by a us district court jury in brooklyn on three felony counts 
accepting an illegal gratuity traveling across state lines to 
accept the gratuity and obstruction of justice 
us district judge jack b weinstein sentenced biaggi to 30 
months in prison and a 500000 fine biaggi has been free pending 
appeal and his attorney james larossa said biaggi would try to 
pursue his appeal to the us supreme court 
the original jury acquitted biaggi and esposito of the more 
serious charges of bribery and conspiracy 
prosecutors said esposito paid for one vacation and arranged to 
pay for another in exchange for the congressmans efforts on behalf 
of a brooklyn ship repair company that was a major client of 
espositos insurance brokerage 
in the current trial biaggi and six defendants are charged with 
turning the nowdefunct wedtech corp into a racketeering 
enterprise that paid out millions of dollars in bribes to obtain 
nobid government contracts 
the house ethics committee recommended in february 1988 that 
biaggi be expelled for criminal conduct going to the heart of 
his representational responsibilities in an unusual maneuver 
however congressional leaders decided to delay action while biaggi 
defended himself in the wedtech trial 
john davison a spokesman for the ethics committee declined to 
comment on what effect the appeals court ruling would have

a british surgeon involved in a plan to use pigs 
organs for human transplants abruptly quit the project monday in a 
dispute with colleagues but said research would continue 
dr michael bewick said fellow researchers at dulwich hospital 
in south london told him to shut up or get out following a day 
where battle lines were drawn between scientists and animal rights 
activists 
bewick 52 a kidney transplant specialist said the research 
team was furious that without their consent he had announced the 
hospital intended to study the feasibility of transplanting 
kidneys livers and hearts from pigs into people 
animal rights groups responded to the press coverage by labeling 
the idea a horror fantasy and gross abuse of animal life 
they asked the government to ban the project 
bewick said the research team feared the controversy might harm 
its chances of obtaining facilities to carry out the work 
for the sake of the group and the work they are doing i 
decided it would be right for me to leave bewick said he 
stressed the group had the brains and technical skills to 
proceed without him 
a hospital spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity said 
he would meet with bewick and the research team tuesday to assess 
the situation 
bewick was quoted in the independent newspaper monday as saying 
in earlier comments that the program posed no ethical problem 
animal kidneys could save the lives of thousands of people who 
die because we do not have an offtheshelf kidney 
before withdrawing from the project bewick had offered to meet 
with animal rights groups to discuss their concerns he said he 
feared attacks on his personal property and the hospital 
attempts to transplant animal organs into humans including 
sheep baboon and chimpanzee hearts have failed 
in what was probably the most publicized case dr leonard 
bailey transplanted a baboon heart into a 12dayold infant dubbed 
baby fae at the loma linda medical facility in california in 1984 
she died 20 days later 
a year after the california babys death bailey said she died 
not from rejection of heart tissue but from another form of 
rejection which he said he believes is possible to avoid 
bewick said over the weekend that the hospital research team 
found a way to filter out antibodies that cause humans to reject 
donor organs he said the new technique had helped 20 patients 
accept human kidneys more easily 
researchers had planned experiments this fall to see whether the 
technique worked between different species of animals pigs and 
sheep if successful bewick had estimated pigtohuman transplants 
could begin within three years 
but the british union for the abolition of vivisection condemned 
the research program as a gross abuse of animal life and waste of 
health care resources 
the experimental animals will undoubtedly suffer greatly both 
physically and mentally despite the fact that anesthetics will be 
used an unidentified spokesman said 
bewick had said pigs were the most suitable animals because 
their organs physiologically most resemble those of humans 
another pressure group animal concern scotland said animal 
research would be unnecessary if more people agreed to donate their 
organs after death 
the idea of breeding pigs as living organ banks owes more to 
sick horror fantasy than medical science said a spokesman who 
refused to be identified i hope the government will use some 
common sense and ban this approach 
the sunday times quoted bewick as saying he had obtained 
approval for the experiments from the hospitals ethics committee 
a spokeswoman for the british medical association speaking on 
condition of anonymity said that panels approval made the project 
acceptable if it seemed likely to yield some benefit 
she said society ultimately would decide the future of 
animaltohuman transplants the controversy highlighted the need 
for a national ethics committee she said

defunct religious academy the site had been discussed informally 
for a prison or other state institution beginning in 1984 
prison opponents largely residents of the rural town of 800 
people complained that the inmate and staff population would 
overrun their farming community later some opponents alleged that 
the dukakis administration unable to buy the land directly because 
the church that owned it had agreed with town officials not to sell 
it for projects including a prison leaked its interest in the site 
to two developers who bought it and then offered it to the state 
the allegations have been cited by dukakis critics to attack the 
goodgovernment pledges that are a major theme of his presidential 
campaign national publicity followed the fbis confirmation june 
23 that a preliminary inquiry was under way at that time the 
agency said dukakis himself was not a target of any investigation 
the developers daniel striar and gary jacobson offered the 
land to the state for 95 million but the state has offered only 
5 million citing three appraisals commissioned by the state 
that listed its value at or just below 5 million 
striar and jacobson have rejected the states offer as too low 
but the state notified new braintree officials in a letter mailed 
last week that the purchase would go forward 
jack bradshaw associate deputy commissioner of the state 
division of capital planning and operations said the state will 
take the land by eminent domain if the owners do not change their 
stance the seizure likely will take place in midoctober or 
november he said monday 
bradshaw said his agency had not been informed that the inquiry 
had ended 
none of my people were questioned as part of it and we havent 
talked to them today either he said we didnt feel it was 
necessary for any investigation however the fbi has a role to 
complete and if they have done that and feel there is no evidence 
of wrongdoing then im certainly happy

the marine corps has punished two 
female marines because they testified at a courtmartial on behalf 
of a female sergeant who was accused of lesbianism at parris island 
and a specialist in military legal affairs said the action may 
have damaged future efforts to prosecute female marines accused of 
lesbianism 
staff sgts gloria h gurule and christine r hilinski who 
testified as character witnesses at sgt cheryl jamesons 
courtmartial july 14 were removed from the drill field july 18 
and reassigned to other areas 
also their military occupational specialities were voided 
which means their permanent records will show they had an 
unsuccessful tour of duty on the drill field ms hilsinki wasnt 
actually assigned to the drill field when she was removed but was 
on a routine sixmonth quota in this case serving as a depot 
inspector 
jameson pleaded guilty to engaging in indecent acts and charges 
of sodomy and obstruction of justice were dropped she was 
sentenced to a year in prison reduced to private and dishonorably 
discharged 
air force maj carol dibattiste said military judges could throw 
out any more cases that go to trial if they believe the corps tried 
to frighten potential defense witnesses ms dibattiste is an 
instructor in the military justice division at the air force judge 
advocate generals schools at maxwell air force base 
the problem is when you start trying to scare witnesses 
said ms dibattiste if they can prove it the accused might 
have a successful claim 
attorneys charge that by removing the two women from their jobs 
and by holding informational briefings with other female 
marines to explain the actions corps officials have frightened 
others from coming forward to testify for their clients 
the word is out you dont testify for women accused of being 
a homosexual said vaughan taylor an attorney for several women 
accused in the investigation 
the uniform code of military justice which governs all branches 
of the military prohibits illegal command influence which 
involves anyone in a position of command who tries to influence 
the outcome of a courtmartial 
that section of the code has been interpreted by the us court 
of military appeals to mean for example that commanders cant try 
to persuade potential witnesses not to testify according to court 
opinions 
but parris island officials who acknowledge punishing the women 
for their testimony but dont acknowledge holding the briefings 
said theyve done nothing improper or illegal 
a spokesman for the marine corps recruit training depot at 
parris island 1st lt aj kozloski said the women were relieved 
of their duties as drill instructors because of their testimony 
they were relieved as a result of loss of confidence by thir 
superiors based on the content of their testimony under oath in the 
jameson case kozloski said this is purely an administrative 
action no one is being punished merely for testifying 
gurule and hilinski testified they would be willing to work with 
ms jameson 
the fact is that if a marine in a position of high 
responsibility such as a drill instructor makes a statement under 
oath that shows he or she doesnt understand or support an order 
directly governing his or her duties it is within the discretion 
of the commander to consider removing that individual from that 
specific postion 
ms dibattiste said that although officers could be 
courtmartialed if found guilty of engaging in illegal command 
influence such charges are usually dropped 
all i can tell you is i think thats an appropriate allegation 
for defense council to make ms dibattiste said i would not 
render an opinion to you whether they would win or lose

the federal election commission on monday 
asked a federal appeals court to reject a republican claim that 
full funding for the democratic presidential campaign should be 
blocked because sen lloyd bentsen was benefiting unfairly 
the republicans fail to show there is anything illegal about 
bentsens decision to run for both the vice presidency and 
reelection to his senate seat as allowed under texas law the fec 
said 
blocking the democrats from spending their federal money would 
irreparably harm their campaign the fec said 
bentsens senate campaign opponent republican rep beau 
boulter and the national republican senatorial committee which 
helps gop senate candidates win election complained that the dual 
campaign gave bentsen an unfair financial advantage 
because of the dual campaign bentsen would be able to spend the 
4 million in private money raised for his senate contest on top of 
the federal money for his vice presidential campaign which is 
limited for both parties 
the committee asked the fec to withhold the 46 million in 
federal funding due the michael dukakisbentsen ticket but the 
commission two weeks ago voted 60 to reject that request the 
money was then transferred from the treasury to the campaign 
the gop is now asking the us court of appeals for the district 
of columbia to block the democrats from spending the money 
bentsens attorneys also filed a brief on monday asking that the 
gop request be rejected

a federal judge has ordered the government to 
change or delete unconstitutionally vague language in pledges 
signed by 17 million government workers not to disclose topsecret 
information 
us district judge oliver gasch ordered the modification in the 
nondisclosure pledges signed by government workers with access to 
topsecret information must sign to retain their security 
clearances 
in an order signed friday and made public monday the judge said 
the government must provide a more specific definition of the term 
classifiable information 
in signing the various pledges government employees promise not 
to make unauthorized disclosures of topsecret information or 
classifiable information 
gasch gave the information security oversight office 60 days to 
notify the federal employees of the governments definition or 
classifiable information or to declare the term inoperative 
until that notification is made the government cannot penalize 
employees who disclose classifiable information the judge said 
a more specific definition must also be included in forms 
presented to federal employees who have not yet signed the pledge 
or the term must be deleted the judge said 
the ruling was made in a lawsuit by two federal employees unions 
that contended the pledges use throughout the executive branch 
empowered government agencies to penalize whistleblowers by 
classifying information after it was disclosed to the press or 
members of congress 
gasch suggested that the security agency headed by steven 
garfinkel could adopt a definition published late last year in the 
federal register 
that regulation defined classifiable information as any 
unstamped material or oral conversations that an employee has a 
good reason to know should be classified 
such information would include material that was in the process 
of being reviewed for classification according to the regulatory 
definition published dec 21 1987 
gasch upheld the validity of that definition saying much 
classified information is not marked as such because it has not 
been examined by a classification authority the govenrment 
nevertheless has a substantial interest in safeguarding that 
information 
the 1987 definition simply requires that employees consider 
whether they have reason to believe that unmarked information is 
classified or should be classified and is in the process of 
becoming so gasch said 
the regulation was offered to allay concerns raised by the 
plaintiffs who brought the lawsuit 
but gasch said that until an employee becomes aware of the 
regulatory definition he cannot know what classifiable 
information does not include for example information that only 
speculation suggests will become classified 
notice of the definition is essential the judge said 
the decision was hailed by both sides of the dispute 
garfinkel noted that gasch had upheld the general principle that 
federal employees can be required to sign secrecy pledges 
i think essentially its a victory for the broader principle 
it will require us to do something more as far as the forms that 
hae already been signed is concerned garfinkel said we will 
have to decide which option to take 
patti goldman an attorney for public citizen litigation group 
a consumer lobby that filed a friendofthecourt brief for several 
members of congress said the order teaches a lesson to the 
government that they have to be more careful when they are crafting 
these agreements

the army on monday deported to lebanon eight 
palestinians accused of inciting the 8monthold uprising in the 
occupied lands where a twoday general strike was launched to 
protest israels policy of expulsions 
security sources said six more palestinians were handed 
deportation orders under emergency regulations enacted by israel in 
august 1985 but defense officials denied the report 
in the west bank city of nablus troops wounded two palestinian 
youths including a 12yearold boy shot in the neck after masked 
protesters stoned the soldiers jeep officials at al ittihad 
hospital said 
the hospital and defense officials spoke on condition of 
anonymity as did the security sources 
the deportations brought to 29 the number of palestinians 
banished since the insurrection began on dec 8 in the west bank 
and gaza strip which israel seized from jordan and egypt in the 
1967 middle east war the insurrection has killed 235 palestinians 
and four israelis 
the deportees were visited by their families at jneid prison 
near nablus hours before being expelled relatives said they 
watched the men being driven away in unmarked cars the windows 
blocked by newspapers and plastic bags 
israel television said an army helicopter took the deportees to 
southern lebanon where they were placed in waiting taxis after 
being giving a medical checkup and offered 50 each only three 
accepted the money the report said 
television segments showed one man flashing a victory sign as he 
climbed into the taxi 
an army spokesman said the eight were senior activists in 
guerrilla organizations and accused them of inciteful and 
subversive activities 
among the deportees was a journalist with jerusalems 
arabiclanguage al fajr newspaper loui ali nafeh abdu who was 
accused of being a senior activist in the palestine liberation 
organization in nablus 
others included a bir zeit university lecturer and a labor 
leader from el bireh 
al fajr managing editor maher abukhater denounced the 
deportations as an extreme form of punishment and obvious 
violation of basic human rights the us administration also has 
criticized the policy 
a leaflet circulated on july 21 called for a mondaytuesday 
strike to protest such deportations 
palestinians meanwhile painted graffiti on walls denouncing 
jordans king hussein for announcing plans to sever ties with the 
850000 palestinians in the west bank down with hussein the 
traitor read one slogan in tulkarem 
other palestinians praised the move 
it should start the ball rolling in the direction of working 
out strategic relationships between the plo and jordan on the 
future palestinian journalist daoud kuttab of the nazareth daily 
asinara told israel radio 
prime minister yitzhak shamir said hussein dealt a blow to 
the idea of a palestinian state by differentiating between 
palestinians living on the east bank of the jordan river and those 
in the west bank 
if as hussein says one part of them has to set up a 
palestinian state and another part is jordanian where then is 
the one palestinian people an aide quoted shamir as saying in a 
meeting with new zealands new ambassador 
it is possible to draw the conclusion that the whole idea of a 
palestinian people is an invention for the sake of propaganda 
shamirs rightwing likud bloc opposes territorial concessions 
to the arabs 
a government official disclosed monday that foreign minister 
shimon peres tried through foreign intermediaries to persuade 
hussein not to cut legal and administrative links with the west 
bank 
the decision was a setback for peres labor party which 
proposed resolving the dispute with the palestinians by negotiating 
with jordan 
peres told israel television on monday that israeli elections 
here this november will determine if the jordanian option is dead 
or not 
also monday the israeli peace now movement appealed to the 
united states and three other western countries to obtain the 
release of faisal husseini a prominent proplo activist jailed 
sunday for six months without trial 
the only chance to make peace is with the palestinian 
leadership when one appears they israeli authorities cut him 
down said peace now spokesman avishai margalit 
attorney general yosef harish decided on monday to put jewish 
settler leader pinhas wallerstein on trial in the jan 11 shooting 
death of a west bank palestinian israel television said 
according to initial army reports wallerstein fired in 
selfdefense after being stoned by palestinians but palestinian 
witnesses said 17yearold nasser ghanem hammad was killed without 
provocation

a soviet official said monday there is a good 
chance fourway talks that resume tuesday will produce a peace 
settlement soon in southern africa 
anatoly adamyshin soviet deputy foreign minister made the 
comments after two days of consultations with chester crocker us 
assistant secretary of state for african affairs 
crocker is mediating the talks among south africa angola and 
cuba which began three months ago and resume tuesday agreement on 
guidelines for a settlement was reached during last months round 
in new york 
we think there are chances of success in these negotiations 
adamyshin told a news conference it appears that all sides are 
serious about seeking a settlement it is possible that there 
will be a settlement in the nearest future 
asked to be more specific he said a target date of sept 29 had 
been mentioned that is the 10th anniversary of un security 
council resolution 435 on independence for namibia also known as 
southwest africa which south africa has controlled since world 
war i 
all negotiators accepted the resolution as a basis of the 
principles for a peaceful settlement in southwestern africa 
agreed upon july 20 
the list of 14 principles the first document to which the three 
countries have agreed link independence for namibia to withdrawal 
of the estimated 50000 cuban troops in angola 
cuban soldiers have helped the marxist government against rebels 
of the national union for the total independence of angola or 
unita who have fought since angola became independent of portugal 
in 1975 the movement led by jonas savimbi is supported by south 
africa and the united states 
the agreement on principles emerged from three rounds of talks 
held since may in london cairo and new york military commanders 
of south africa angola and cuba met in cape verde and were said to 
have made progress on disengaging cuban and south african soldiers 
who face each other along the angolanamibia frontier 
crocker has called the list of principles an important step 
but says hard bargaining remains the soviet union has assigned a 
special observer although it is not a participant in the 
negotiations 
adamyshin was asked about a us officials statement that the 
superpowers find increasing common ground on southern africa and 
acknowledged there is more understanding 
he added however that us military aid to unita is unlawful 
and must be stopped on that point we differ with the united 
states 
later in the news conference he said the aid issue must be 
settled between the united states and angola it is not covered in 
the list of principles 
according to adamyshin the soviet union will be satisfied 
with whatever satisfies angola cuba and swapo 
swapo or the southwest africa peoples organization has 
fought a guerrilla war in namibia since 1966 when the united 
nations abrogated a league of nations mandate under which south 
africa governed the former german colony 
it has welcomed the agreement on principles and a swapo 
spokesman described prospects for a settlement as reasonably 
brighter 
president fidel castro of cuba said last week the parties were 
on the threshhold of a political solution 
south africa has been more cautious its government radio said 
monday recent cuban reinforcements and deployment of angolan and 
cuban soldiers on the namibian border place a question mark over 
the real intentions of the two governments

the plo foreign relations chief was quoted 
as calling on monday for maintaining palestinian rights in jordan 
following king husseins decision to cut administrative ties with 
palestinians in the west bank 
farouk kaddoumi made his comments monday at a closed meeting of 
the central council of the palestine liberation organization 
according to other plo officials who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the council is the upper branch of the plos bicameral 
legislature the palestine national council 
kaddoumi praised jordans distinguished relations with the 
worlds 5 million palestinians and the plo and said these 
relations will remain the plo officials reported 
but they said kaddoumi emphasized the importance of maintaining 
all the rights acquired by the palestinian people in jordan 
hussein over the past week suspended jordans parliament half 
of whose members were palestinians and canceled a development plan 
for the israelioccupied west bank to dramatize plo responsibility 
for the occupied lands 
israel seized the west bank from jordan and the gaza strip from 
egypt in the 1967 middle east war 
plo officials said chairman yasser arafat ordered a muzzle on 
all public comments by his organization about husseins move until 
the plo executive committee the equivalent of a cabinet has 
time to study it 
husseins actions appeared to please several of the central 
council members who spoke to reporters but plo officials said 
arafat canceled a trip planned to the jordanian capital next week 
the trip had never been formally announced 
jordan is a lifeline for the 850000 palestinians in the west 
bank most of whom carry jordanian passports use jordanian money 
and worship in jordaniansupported mosques more than half of 
jordans own people are refugees or immigrants from palestine and 
the kings action has fueled rumors about a posible loss of some 
rights 
kaddoumi also was quoted as saying that support for the 
palestinian uprising in the occupied territories by some arab 
governments was below required levels he also accused syria of 
undermining the insurrection by sponsoring attacks by plo dissident 
factions on beirut refugee camps held by arafat loyalists plo 
officials reported 
syrias role in the attacks against palestinian camps is clear 
as the sun itself kaddoumi was quoted as saying 
if they are really after strategic parity with israel they 
should have dropped their antiplo policies especially during the 
uprising 
the plo officials said kaddoumi took a swipe at arafats chief 
spokesman bassam abu sharif for publishing a moderately phrased 
newspaper article urging arabisraeli coexistence 
political initiatives should not flout the resolutions and 
declared policy of the plo kaddoumi was quoted as saying 
all personal interpretations or judgments by any of the 
organizations officials or responsible cadres should adhere to the 
declared national objectives 
the central council extended its sessions into tuesday it had 
been scheduled to end its meetings monday night

the environmental protection agency said 
monday it wants the government to capture expected windfall 
corporate profits that could reach 7 billion during future cuts in 
production of chemicals that destroy the earths protective ozone 
layer 
but the agency said it had not decided how to do that and one 
major producer said it doubts that there will be major windfalls as 
the chemicals chlorofluorocarbon or cfc compounds are cut back 
under epas expectations the shortage of cfc compounds will 
enable producers to raise prices with no increase in production 
costs 
epa disclosed that it was considering regulations that could 
require manufacturers to pay fees to the government equal to their 
extra profits could require recycling or other controls on 
manufacturing processes or could require companies to buy 
manufacturing rights from the government at auctions open to anyone 
the agency announced final adoption of detailed regulations 
including production quotas to carry out last years treaty 
obliging major nations to cut cfc production 50 percent by 1998 
epa expects enough countries to ratify the treaty for it to take 
effect next jan 1 eleven nations accounting for twothirds of 
world production must ratify six including the united states have 
done so 
eileen claussen acting deputy epa administrator for air 
programs said the agency leans toward fees perhaps supplemented 
by direct controls as a way of capturing windfall profits the 
presidents office of management and budget on the other hand 
favors auctioning the production rights 
epas authority to proceed without legislation is cloudy ms 
claussen said 
an auction she said could be administratively unworkable if 
10000 small companies participate if it was judged to be 
illegal we would have nothing we wouldnt be in compliance with 
the montreal protocol she said 
and she said theres a lot of concern about hoarding in 
which large companies like auto manufacturers would keep smaller 
concerns such as those making plastic foams for furniture 
cushions from getting production rights 
epa wants to the government to get the increased profits because 
our concern is the incentive producers might have for keeping an 
existing product in production delaying the switch to 
environmentally harmless alternatives said john hoffman project 
officer for the regulations 
the largest producer of cfcs du pont co said it believed no 
action was needed to take extra profits away from the producers 
because they would be small or nonexistent 
one producer after another is announcing progress with 
substitutes said joe steed environmental manager for cfcs for 
du pont substitution is the driving force were going to see 
if we can fund development at the rate we think we need well be 
doing well 
epa said the increase in profits over the 1986 level could range 
from 18 billion if user companies rapidly find alternatives to 
72 billion if cfc compounds are kept on the market as long as 
possible 
the montreal treaty binds participating countries to a reduction 
of 20 percent in cfc production in 1993 and a further 30 percent 
cut in 1998 all calculated from a 1986 base 
the longlived cfc compounds ascend to the ozone layer 15 to 25 
miles high where since about 1960 they have destroyed about 25 
percent of the ozone protecting humans from skin cancer from the 
suns ultraviolet rays normally blocked by ozone 
epa estimates that every percent decrease in ozone results on 
43000 additional skin cancer cases in the united states currently 
there are about 500000 cases a year 
the regulation will prevent about 37 million early deaths among 
people now alive in the united states or to be born by the year 
2075 epa estimated 
financially the impact on the consumer will be very small 
because cfc use is such a small part of the cost of production and 
large price increases will be easily absorbed even if the increase 
is five or sixfold epas hoffman said 
cfcs are widely used as refrigeration fluids solvents and 
plastic foam blowing agents they are banned as us aerosol 
propellants but still used as propellants abroad a new car 
typically contains 25 pounds of a cfc compound used as air 
conditioning fluid costing about 150 
epas regulations if triggered by the treaty going into effect 
mean that in the 12 months beginning july 1 1989 the five us 
manufacturers will be bound by these manufacturing quotas to the 
nearest million pounds du pont co 336 million pounds 
alliedsignal corp 171 million pennwalt corp 86 million 
kaiser chemicals co 62 million and racon inc 30 million 
similar quotas apply separately to the sum of production plus 
imports minus exports du pont 308 million pounds alliedsignal 
163 million pennwalt 84 million kaiser 61 million racon 30 
million and 10 companies whose imports totaled almost 13 million 
pounds 
related compounds called halons used in fire extinguishers will 
be subject to similar quotas starting in 1992 
the companies may transfer these quotas among themselves

a paraplegic in a wheelchair carrying fireworks 
and samurai swords lowered himself on a rope monday from the 
brooklyn bridge and dangled 75 feet above the east river for more 
than an hour 
ramond masa 40 of the bronx who called himself americas 
no 1 stuntman claimed he had dangled from the 105yearold 
landmark for seven hours 
his stunt forced traffic on the bridge to be halted as the 
morning rush hour began about 30 officers from the police harbor 
unit emergency service officers and ambulance personnel rushed to 
the bridge which connects lower manhattan and brooklyn after a 
tugboat operator spotted masa 
he was eventually persuaded to lower himself to the river where 
he was guided onto a police launch 
masa said he did it because i wanted to inspire these guys in 
wheelchairs to get up from the hospital and do something for 
their communities and their families 
he refused medical attention at new york infirmarybeekman 
downtown hospital and was taken to a police station where he was 
booked on charges of disorderly conduct unlawful carrying of a 
knife and unlawful dealing with fireworks according to police

us secretary of state george p shultz 
and four central american foreign ministers issued a joint 
declaration monday calling for peace and democracy in the region 
but without mentioning nicaragua 
shultz however used a closing news conference to take several 
verbal swipes at nicaraguas leftist sandinista government and to 
put in a plug for congressional approval of additional aid to the 
nicaraguan rebels known as contras 
nicaragua was not invited to the meeting 
the joint communique issued at the end of a threehour meeting 
was a watereddown version of an earlier declaration drafted 
shortly after shultzs last visit to costa rica honduras 
guatemala and el salvador in late june 
honduras said sunday that guatemala and costa rica had demanded 
changes in the proposed communique 
the initial draft was said to be 10 pages long and to contain a 
harsh criticism of nicaragua for its failure to live up to a 
central american peace agreement signed by it and its four 
neighbors a year ago 
but as issued the declaration contained only 10 paragraphs 
reafirming the respect of the five countries for peace 
democracy security social justice and economic development in 
all of central america while obviously aimed at nicaragua it did 
not mention the country by name 
the final version also said the united states and the four 
central american nations agreed on the need to establish 
authentic democratic governments in the entire region as 
indispensable for peace 
it said the five countries reafirmed that authentic democracy 
requires among other requisites political pluralism freedom of 
association freedom of the press an impartial justice system that 
guarantees due process an apolitical armed forces an honest and 
open electoral system and respect for human and individual rights 
at a news conference closing their meeting shultz said the 
contras are an important element expressing a strong desire for 
freedom and democracy in nicaragua and we continue to support them 
i didnt come here basically to discuss that subject and we 
didnt have very much discussion of it although i certainly hope 
that we will extend funding for the contras shultz said i 
think it is very important 
shultz said his discussions with the foreign ministers centered 
on economic development and how we might organize ourselves to 
pursue that more systematically 
upon arriving in guatemala shultz said the united states 
guatemala honduras el salvador and costa rica shared common goals 
of democracy the rule of law and economic progress but he 
acknowledged problems in reaching those objectives 
shultz spoke with reporters before meeting with guatemalan 
president vinicio cerezo and later with the four foreign ministers 
he contrasted what he described as democracy and growing 
prosperity in the four central american nations with nicaragua 
where he said nine years of sandinista rule and continuing warfare 
have virtually destroyed the economy 
the united states has backed the contras since 1981 in their 
fight to overthrow the sandinista government 
in nicaragua president daniel ortega said shultz was trying to 
escalate action against his govermment 
speaking at a ceremony marking the ninth anniversary of the 
sandinista air force monday ortega said of the meeting 
we hope that common sense might predominate because to want 
to sign a death sentence against nicaragua because the united 
states wants one would be the equivalent of signing a death 
sentence against central america 
we hope that these central american governments might be 
sufficiently reasonable and pragmatic so as not to fall in the trap 
that the united states is laying in guatemala he added 
the meetings in guatemala were part of shultzs quest for a 
united effort to isolate nicaragua politically and economically 
from its central american neighbors 
in a statement distributed to reporters in guatemala city 
sunday the honduran government said it found the demand for draft 
changes by guatemala and costa rica incomprehensible and 
strange and that the softening of its contents were at the 
insistence of those two countries 
eliminated from the original statement the hondurans said were 
sections that would have 
criticized nicaragua for not separating its army known as the 
sandinista popular army from the governing political party 
denounced subversion against democratic governments by 
nicaragua 
called for a regional security system and continued 
consultation between the united states and the four central 
american nations 
shultz said in washington sunday that the original document had 
been drafted mostly by the central american foreign 
ministers not by us having drafted it they were not so sure they 
wanted to issue it 
president oscar arias of costa rica who won the 1987 nobel 
peace prize for designing and promoting the peace plan signed last 
aug 7 has promised his own progress report soon and there was 
speculation that his government decided the guatemala declaration 
might undercut arias review 
guatemala unlike costa rica el salvador and honduras does not 
share a common border with nicaragua and pursues what it calls a 
policy of active neutrality 
shultz was to fly on to argentina monday night for his second 
stop on a 10day trip that will take him to nine latin american 
nations he will return to central america aug 89 for meetings 
with the presidents of costa rica honduras and el salvador

an explosion demolished a dormitory at a british 
army barracks while the men were sleeping monday morning killing 
one soldier and wounding nine the irish republican army claimed 
responsibility 
it was the fifth attack attributed to the ira since may on 
british military targets outside northern irland 
archie hamilton the armed forces minister said after touring 
the scene it seems very likely it was a bomb this makes it 
an extremely cowardly attack if that is what it was by the ira 
scotland yard said police had not determined whether a bomb 
caused the explosion british gas experts said they could find no 
sign of a gas leak or accidental cause 
the blast at 7 am at the inglis barracks a military mail 
depot in suburban mill hill knocked down most of the twostory 
brick dormitory and started a fire 
two men were seriously injured and one was under intensive care 
hospital spokesmen said 
soldiers and firefighters dug trapped soldiers out of the 
debris one survivor buried for half an hour was saved by a 
radiator that fell across his chest and became a shield 
the dead soldier was identified as michael robbins 23 a lance 
corporal in the royal engineers earlier his last name had been 
given as robbin 
inglis is one of hundreds of small lightly guarded army bases 
in britain and the attack raised fears of assaults on others it is 
on the edge of finchley the parliamentary constituency of prime 
minister margaret thatcher 
ira attacks have taken the lives of 16 british servicemen this 
year in britain and abroad compared with only three in all of 
1987 the apparent objective is to create public outrage that will 
pressure britain into leaving northern ireland 
an ira claim of responsibility was delivered to the british 
domestic news agency press association in belfast northern 
ireland the guerrilla movement most of whose members are roman 
catholic is trying to drive the british from the 
protestantdominated province and unite it with the irish republic 
hamilton promised a security review of military installations in 
britain and abroad 
mrs thatcher said in australia where she was on an official 
visit i have sent a message to say i am very distressed and i 
anxiously await further news 
the 15 men living in the dormitory were in bed when the 
explosion tore out the main floor an army spokesman said the 
building can accommodate 70 
in the middle it just demolished it like a pack of cards 
said frank mcparland a construction worker at the barracks 
the defense ministry said inglis housed the post and courier 
depot with a staff of 250 and personnel from the royal engineers 
royal navy and womens royal army corps 
it was the first fatal attack attributed to the ira in mainland 
britain since guerrillas planted a bomb in mrs thatchers hotel 
during a political convention in brighton south england in 
october 1984 she escaped injury but five other people were killed 
in may after a 14month lull the ira resumed attacks on 
british military targets in continental europe 
three british servicemen have been killed and 12 people wounded 
in four machine gun and bombing attacks in the three months in west 
germany and holland 
jackie donnelly of the sinn fein the iras legal political 
wing said last week attacks on british soldiers had more value 
more impact in britain than killing policemen or locally 
recruited soldiers in northern ireland 
so from that perspective the ira certainly would like to 
target more british soldiers he told the associated press 
twelve british soldiers have been killed in northern ireland 
this year britain has had soldiers in the province since sectarian 
violence began in august 1969 
civilian workers said security was lax at inglis 
mary onisiforo 23 who took over a shop in the barracks four 
months ago said she did not even have a security pass for three 
months everybody knows there is no security there she said 
in its most serious attack on the military in britain the ira 
killed 11 soldiers and seven of their horses in double bombings of 
a military band and cavalrymen in two london parks in july 1982

michael dukakis said monday the reagan 
administration with cramped ideals and limited ambitions has 
spent huge amounts of money on wasteful projects rather than 
helping blacks and poor people president reagan suggested that if 
dukakis is elected all of us may be picking up the pieces 
dukakis in a speech did not mention by name his expected 
presidential election rival republican george bush but he made it 
clear he was including the vice president in his criticism of the 
administration 
were going to have a president and a vice president who 
understand that affirmative action is an essential part of making 
the american dream come true for each and every citizen of our 
country dukakis told the national urban league 
reagan meanwhile in remarks prepared for delivery at a 
fundraiser for sen bill roth rdel took issue with dukakis 
also without naming him for declaring in his nomination 
acceptance speech that the reagan era is ending 
does he want to end the era of lower tax rates and higher real 
income for families record numbers of jobs low inflation and 
interest rates steady growth and respect not just lipservice for 
families reagan asked 
america this year has come to a divide in the road reagan 
said take one fork and we continue in the direction that bill 
roth has helped chart take the other and in four years all of us 
may be picking up the pieces 
bush was out of the public eye at the white house monday still 
weighing his choice of a running mate and dukakis whose reception 
was cordial but unenthusiastic received his only standing ovation 
when commenting on the vice presidents absence from the meeting of 
the nonpartisan group 
aides said bush couldnt appear because of a prior commitment 
bush is to travel to chicago on tuesday for a foreign policy 
speech then make a trip to texas later in the week before flying 
to his home in kennebunkport maine for the weekend he is to 
address the republican platform committee next monday in new 
orleans one week before the party opens its national convention in 
that city 
while democratic senators worked in washington to draft a 
compromise package of new aid to the nicaraguan rebels dukakis 
reiterated his opposition to us assistance to the contras 
its a failed and illegal policy and it ought to stop 
dukakis said prior to leaving boston 
right now the administration once again seems to be doing 
everything again to destroy the peace process dukakis said 
the democratic nominee said that in principle he does not 
favor humanitarian aid but would accept it if the aid was part of a 
negotiated settlement and the money was used to resettle the 
contras and end the war 
democrats in working on a new aid package are trying to defuse 
an issue that has divided dukakis who opposes contra aid from his 
running mate lloyd bentsen who has consistently supported it 
dukakis insisted he wasnt bothered by bentsens support of 
contra aid 
bentsen spent most of monday in private meetings in washington 
in preparation for expected action this week on trade and 
plantclosing notification legislation 
dukakis stepping up his efforts among the nations black voters 
who earlier backed jesse jacksons presidential bid said in his 
speech we have to transform the cycle of poverty into a ladder 
of opportunity and that ladder must be sturdy and strong for all 
our citizens 
some people say it cant be done he said i say we 
havent tried 
then using a rhetorical tool often employed by jackson dukakis 
accused the reagan administration of spending vast sums of money on 
bad policies following each contention with the refrain that at 
the same time we havent tried to help minorities and others 
fifteen billion dollars already wasted on star wars we 
havent tried dukakis said thirtysix billion dollars for two 
supercarrier task forces we dont need and cant afford my 
friends we havent tried 
hundreds of thousands of wasted lives and millions of dollars 
to overthrow the government of nicaragua my friends we havent 
tried 
an annual assault on the opportunity to go to college that has 
left us with fewer black college students today than we had seven 
years ago we havent tried 
in chicago meanwhile jackson who lost the democratic 
nomination to dukakis said monday he is willing to meet with new 
york mayor edward koch to try and iron out differences dating back 
to kochs strong crticism of jackson before new yorks april 
primary 
koch in new york said if you really believe as i do that 
its important to have a democrat in the white house you set aside 
those differences 
another former candidate republican pat robertson returned 
monday as cohost of his cable networks flagship program the 
700 club 
dukakis received good news on the homefront before traveling to 
detroit 
according to law enforcement sources who spoke only on condition 
they not be named the fbi has informed the state that a 
preliminary inquiry turned up no evidence of lawbreaking to 
support charges that the dukakis administration leaked confidential 
information on prisonsiting plans to developers who then bought 
land and offered to sell it to the state 
the allegations lodged by opponents of plans to build a 500bed 
state prison in rural new braintree mass had been cited by 
dukakis critics to attack the goodgovernment pledges at the center 
of his presidential campaign 
fbi boston spokesman john cloherty refused to characterize the 
outcome of the inquiry but said no charges had been filed 
in washington the federal election commission told a federal 
appeals court that the democratic ticket should get 46 million in 
matching funds despite a republican contention that bentsen was 
benefiting unfairly bentsen is also running for reelection to his 
senate seat and has raised money for that race

secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
said monday he will announce dday a date for a ceasefire in the 
8yearold iraniraq war after his factfinding team returns from 
those countries this week and he consults the security council 
the dday doesnt depend on the parties the un chief 
said indicating he could make a unilateral decision and go ahead 
without the agreement of iraq iran says it is ready to honor an 
immediate ceasefire 
perez de cuellar made the statement to reporters after a 
threehour meeting with iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati 
announcement of a truce date would put pressure on iraq to 
compromise and drop its insistence on direct talks with iran before 
a ceasefire 
no immediate reaction surfaced from iraq 
perez de cuellar said a un military team of experts now is in 
amman jordan preparing its report and the team leader will 
present it to him in new york wednesday 
i will study his report i will be in touch with members of 
the security council and then i will decide on a dday perez 
de cuellar said 
it is very difficult to tell you now he said when asked if 
he would announce dday this week he cautioned against the idea 
that a ceasefire could be simply or rapidly implemented 
the secretarygeneral said once dday is decided he will begin 
consulting nations which could provide about 250 military observers 
to monitor the ceasefire and troop withdrawal 
the un chief held his sixth meeting with velayati since talks 
began last week he has met three times with iraqi foreign minister 
tariq aziz but iraq said it was not prepared to enter into 
substantive talks with perez de cuellar until direct talks take 
place 
iraqi officials also have not responded to a un report on 
chemical weapons which concluded that the baghdad government has 
made frequent and largescale use of the outlawed weapons against 
iranian forces 
velayati and ambassador mohammad jaafar mahallati of iran told 
reporters monday that iran wants the secretarygeneral to go ahead 
and name the ceasefire date with or without iraqs agreement 
iran is immediately ready to implement a un peace 
resolution by a ceasefire mahallati said 
perez de cuellar said it was theoretically correct he could 
unilaterally announce a ceasefire date but i prefer to wait for 
my team be in touch with members of the council and perhaps the 
parties 
he said he hoped for the shortest possible period between 
the announcement of a dday and the beginning of a ceasefire 
the war which began in september 1980 has cost an estimated 1 
million lives 
in response to questions the un chief said that if he or the 
council declared a ceasefire and one side does not respect it 
that is for the council to decide 
velayati told reporters all major issues have been covered in 
their meetings and there is no substantial point of 
disagreement between us and the secretarygeneral 
velayati also said we think that especially after recent use 
of chemical weapons now the security council should do 
something against iraq 
the experts detailed report mentioned nine iraqi soldiers 
poisoned in a battle zone allegedly in a mustard gas attack by 
iran 
other un reports have said iraq used chemical weapons which 
are outlawed under the 1925 geneva convention and the security 
council recently condemned use of the illegal weapons in the war 
sadoun hamadi iraqi minister of state for foreign affairs 
earlier monday repeated his countrys insistence on direct talks 
before a truce during an appearance on state television in baghdad 
the 15member security council gave unanimous approval july 20 
1987 to resolution 598 which provides for a ceasefire 
withdrawal to recognized borders prisoner exchange peace 
negotiations and an investigation to determine which side started 
the war in september 1980 
iraq agreed to accept the resolution soon after it was passed 
last summer but iran had refused until two weeks ago july 18 
the chemical weapons report was prepared by two specialist 
physicians who visited both countries in early july 
we deeply regret to say that on the basis of evidence gathered 
and in spite of repeated appeals by the united nations chemical 
weapons continue to be used on an intensive scale against iranian 
forces it said 
from the examination of weapon fragements it can be concluded 
that bombs similar to those used in 1984 1986 and 1987 have again 
been used against iranian forces on iranian territory indicating 
their repeated utilization by iraqi forces 
iraq has acknowledged using chemical weapons but claims iran 
introduced them to the war

military also said vandals damaged the tomb of president corazon 
aquinos husband 
maj hernando patawaran spokesman of the presidential security 
group said vandals pried a concrete slab loose on the tomb of 
assassinated former sen benigno aquino jr but the body was not 
disturbed workers installed steel sheets to protect the body 
in bangkok thailand adm ronald j hays commanderinchief of 
the us pacific command said monday that if american bases in the 
philippines are lost there will be only one big winner the 
soviet union 
but hays told reporters he was bullish about the future of the 
bases 
the philippines broke off talks on the bases with the united 
states july 26 foreign secretary raul manglapus said differences 
over us compensation for use of the bases were so wide he doubted 
the talks could be revived the agreement on clark air base and 
subic bay naval base expires in 1991 
the official philippine news agency said troops killed nine 
communist new peoples army guerrillas and wounded three in a 
threehour battle sunday in nueva vizcaya province 130 miles north 
of manila 
it said government forces suffered no casualties 
the clash occurred one day after marines and militiamen repulsed 
two separate attacks by moslem secessionists on basilan and jolo 
islands killing nine insurgents

patawaran said officials had no idea who desecrated the tomb or 
why 
aquino was shot on aug 21 1983 upon returning from three 
years of selfimposed exile in the united states his death fueled 
opposition to president ferdinand marcos culminating in a 
civilianmilitary revolt that unseated marcos in february 1986 and 
drove him into exile after 20 years in office the revolt swept 
mrs aquino into the presidency 
patawaran said workers cemented the slab back after bomb experts 
found no explosives inside 
soldiers guarded the tomb monday

teenagers from an ozarks town responded 
with a resounding cheer monday and maybe even kicked up their 
heels a bit when a federal judge threw out a centuryold ban on 
school dances 
us district judge russell clark said the ban on 
schoolsponsored dancing in purdy has the effect of promoting 
religious values is unconstitutional and must be invalidated 
i thought wed win said nancy fox 16 who will be student 
president at the 160pupil purdy high school this fall they 
school board members never gave anything concrete a good reason 
why we shouldnt dance 
the judge stopped short of ordering the school board to schedule 
a dance miss fox said she would try to organize a schoolyear 
opening dance 
residents of purdy about 60 miles southwest of springfield say 
the ban could be 100 years old the rule states school dances are 
not authorized and school premises shall not be used for purposes 
of conducting a dance 
the judge in his ruling said even if the defendants could 
show a valid secular purpose the primary effect of this rule is to 
endorse the tenets of that particular religious group in purdy who 
believe that social dancing is sinful 
clark awarded the plaintiffs in the 1986 civil suit nearly 
everything the 21 students and their parents asked for 1 in 
nominal damages attorney fees and an order that the school board 
stop enforcing its ban on dancing 
about 20 teens and a few parents drove to the courthouse in 
springfield to hear the judges decision from their attorney 
william fleischaker 
i hope at this point they school board members will sit down 
with the students and they will come up with a plan to have a 
dance fleischaker said i think if they dont start being 
reasonable theyre likely to be dealt with harshly in the future 
we could theoretically end up back in court asking enforcement of 
the decision 
school board member art negre said he had not been advised of 
clarks ruling and had no comment repeated attempts to reach the 
other school board members by phone were unsuccessful and 
superintendent sheldon buxton was reported to be out of the state 
ransom ellis jr an attorney for the school board said the 
courts conclusions that the board was motivated by religious 
reasons in our viewpoint was not correct but no decision on an 
appeal had been made 
were deeply disappointed in the courts decision ellis 
said in our view we do not believe the board acted in an 
unconstitutional manner they were reacting to the community 
viewpoint which they as elected officials were obligated to do 
clark called unpersuasive the testimony of school board 
members during a fourday hearing in june that they did not know 
why the community opposed dancing but felt the ban was the will of 
the majority 
this court is skeptical that it heard the complete story 
concerning the board members deliberations of the rule and the 
religious significance of the opposition to dancing in purdy 
clark wrote 
although dances were banned on school property dances have been 
held at a community center in the town and purdy students have 
organized juniorsenior proms and held them in neighboring 
communities 
the controversy escalated after the class of 1986 failed to 
persuade the school board to drop the ban and dance supporters 
held a rally like the one in the movie footloose about a 
fictional texas town where dancing was banned

two film studios said monday they will pay 
any union fines incurred by striking scriptwriters who return to 
work while the unions 22week strike continues 
but a dissident group of writers which has threatened 
strikebreaking in the past announced at the same time that it 
would continue to honor the writers guild of america walkout 
on sunday the contract talks were declared hopelessly 
deadlocked by nicholas counter iii president of the alliance of 
motion picture and television producers he added that it was 
expected some union members would ignore guild warnings and return 
to work 
jeffrey katzenberg and barry diller the respective heads of 
walt disney studios and 20th century fox said that their studios 
will compensate union members who return to work in violation of 
union orders 
michael binkow a spokesman for fox confirmed dillers offer 
katzenbergs proposal was reported in tuesdays editions of the new 
york times 
union fines against strikebreaking writers are set at 110 
percent of all payment received for unauthorized strike work said 
union spokeswoman cheryl rhoden furthermore violators are subject 
to lifetime expulsion from the guild rhoden said 
rhoden said that she knew of no movement within union ranks to 
accept the indemnification proposal 
it remains to be seen if any writers will be interested in 
such protection or pseudoprotection rhoden said 
among those who have been expected to resign from the guild are 
members of the writers coalition 21 writers who have pushed for a 
strike settlement under contract terms that union members have 
strongly opposed 
the coalition after a fourhour strategy conference monday 
announced that it would remain with the guild the group was 
apparently encouraged by a discussion with brian walton executive 
director of the wga west and the guilds chief negotiator 
the coalition had threatened to leave the guild on july 28 but 
changed its plans last week when negotiations appeared to be making 
progress 
the strike by more than 9000 union members began march 7 
meanwhile walton said on a recorded union hot line message 
monday that he hoped all members will decline the invitation 
to write during the strike 
walton said too that the wga has asked the us labor 
department not to grant work visas to foreign writers coming to the 
united states to write for hollywood production companies during 
the strike 
indemnification is a matter for discussion between each studio 
and a specific writers herb steinberg a spokesman for the 
producers alliance said monday indemnification is not an 
alliance function 
rhoden said that any indemnification payments would be seen by 
the union as compensation and therefore subject to further fines 
the production companies are not concerned about the 
writers rhoden said they are looking for their own shortterm 
gain one writing assignment is not worth a whole career and 
people do not forget when people cross a picket line in the middle 
of a strike 
the union has so far handed out more than 2 million in hardship 
loans to its finacially strapped members rhoden said 
meanwhile the union was optimistic that contract talks with the 
producers might resume and placed the blame for last weekends 
negoatiating collapse on the alliance 
we are doing all that we can to continue the negotiating 
process walton said on the unions hot line message its 
regrettable that the alliance has no such commitment to the 
industry 
the producers have insisted that the union is making 
unreasonable demands and repeatedly refuses to make any contract 
compromises

a pretrial hearing monday for the 
washington public power supply system bond default trial dealt with 
such matters as witness testimony by satellite jury size and 
selection and juror notebooks 
but us district judge william d browning also said he will 
take up on friday a defense motion asking him to order the 
plaintiffs to drop assertions of conspiracy or to delay the sept 7 
trial at least 60 days 
the 1983 wppss default is the largest in municipal bond history 
on 225 billion in bonds it sold to finance construction of two 
nuclear power plants in washington state 
plaintiffs include more than 24000 bondholders who have filed 
proofs of claim and chemical bank of new york the trustee 
representing bondholders 
the bondholders suing as a class action are alleging fraud 
negligence and conspiracy said attorney paul bernstein chairman 
of a lawyers group representing the purchasers they are seeking 
more than 1 billion in damages 
chemical bank is seeking 7 billion for the value of the bonds 
plus interest 
the case which is expected to last at least a year shapes up 
as being of epic proportions reputedly one of the biggest 
securities cases ever 
ten groups representing 50 defendants remain from 104 initially 
named that included the power supply system various officers and 
88 utilities that participated in construction of the abandoned 
power plants 
the federal bonneville power administration and others 
including bond and special counsel to wppss engineers bond 
underwriters financial consultants and architects also were named 
initially but browning has ruled that bonneville cannot be sued 
and last year underwriters reached a tentative agreement that would 
let them out for 92 million 
junius hoffman acting as brownings settlement master said 
monday that settlements amounting to 100570000 have been 
approved by the judge to date with others worth another 170 
million pending 
the pretrial conference was to resume tuesday 
browning issued an order july 14 allowing the plaintiffs to 
pursue certain conspiracy allegations but defense lawyers in a 
postponement motion filed friday by attorney peter j nickles said 
the judge noted in his order that the plaintiffs had not 
indicated their intention to pursue their conspiracy allegations 
before march five years after the litigation began 
the trial was moved from seattle to tucson because of concern 
over the ability to select an impartial jury in the northwest 
where the case has received extensive publicity and where utility 
customers rates stand to be affected by the outcome of the case

a second analysis found that men in the top 20 percent for job 
strain a list that included cooks gas station attendants and 
firemen had 25 to 33 times the risk of the rest of the workers

employers may be able to redesign highstrain jobs to lower

in 1864 gen william t sherman camped there during the battle 
for atlanta before he burned the city and began his ruinous march 
to the sea 
in the late 1960s there was a plan to build a road through the 
area and the state condemned and destroyed hundreds of homes to 
make way for it before the project was dropped 
the carter presidential center occupies it now and wants to 
build a road linking the complex to downtown atlanta but the 
rightofway sits empty and overgrown as neighborhood groups 
continue a battle over whether the road should be built 
at one point when construction started workers shook 
protesters from trees today the fight is quieter 
court action has stopped construction since mid1986 
opponents of the expresway as they call it have been in 
court for years saying the noise fumes and roadwidening would 
damage historic parks and neighborhoods including some designed by 
pioneer urban landscaper frederick law olmstead the road also 
would slice through a public golf course 
road advocates argue the road was part of the presidential 
center package that no more homes would be leveled that it is 
needed for safety reasons and would lessen traffic through the 
older neighborhoods they say the project would leave some olmstead 
parks untouched and trim two only slightly 
they note that court decisions have agreed with the need and 
with the environmental impact statements they have filed 
road opponents are awaiting word on whether the us supreme 
court will hear their appeal 
terry adamson lawyer for former president carter who also does 
work for the center said that without the road part of the carter 
center could be reclaimed because the center got the use of 27 of 
the 30 acres of the library site from the state with the 
understanding that the road would be built the argument has been 
used since the controversy began 
it wasnt true then and its not true now countered rm 
ossoff a leader of the antiroad movement 
he said elected officials from us senators to city councilmen 
are overwhelmingly in favor of the carter center but that political 
support for the road is dropping 
demonstrate to me how that much assembled influence could not 
resolve in three seconds any problems the presidential center might 
have he said 
the center already has landscaped the 27 acres at a cost of 
about 4 million 
the road was meant to facilitate access to the carter 
presidential center near downtown atlanta and when carter proposed 
the library he all but made the road a condition of the center 
being in atlanta 
opponents of the proposed 22mile presidential parkway say 
traffic through the area is short of predictions and that a 
smoothly operating carter center belies the claim that the center 
needs the road to function 
plans call for the fourlane road to have hiking trails bike 
paths and other park facilities alongside it and proponents say it 
actually will enhance the area 
olmstead designed new york citys central park the grounds of 
the us capitol the emerald necklace of parks around boston 
and washingtons rock creek park in the 1890s he designed five 
parks in atlanta 
a 1985 bill requiring the national park service to make 
recommendations for preserving olmsteads work passed the house but 
died in the senate in 1984 the federal highway commissions 
advisory council on historic preservation voted 124 against 
building the road 
yard signs flourish near the proposed road save dont 
pave stop the road and build it in plains the latter 
referring to carters hometown of plains ga 
there have been attempts to put a road through the area for 20 
years and the state condemned land and destroyed over 500 houses 
and businesses with that in mind in the late 1960s and early 1970s 
then largely because of opposition from thengov jimmy carter 
the plan died 
the initial proposal for the presidential parkway was based 
heavily on a projected traffic increase of more than 200 percent 
over 20 years but road opponents say the actual increase has been 
closer to 10 percent 
carter center officials predicted 12 million visitors a year 
would come to the center the total for the first year was about 
175000 
not one presidential library in the united states is on a 
fourlane road and there is not any reason to believe that the 
jimmy carter library is going to draw any more visitors than the 
jfk library or the lbj library opposition leader sally dorn said 
at the height of the controversy 
neighborhood citizens groups formed caution citizens against 
unnecessary thoroughfares in older neighborboods in early 1982 to 
coordinate the protest efforts 
ossoff the first president of caution says the group has spent 
more than 400000 in legal fees and that donated legal services 
have come to far more than that adamson said road proponents have 
spent at least that much 
ossoff says the projected cost of the road has gone up from its 
original 22 million to as high as 47 million would use all of 
atlantas federal highway fund allotment for years and would be 
among the most expensive highways per mile ever built in georgia 
he said political support for the road seems to be on the wane 
with fewer city council members backing it and with maynard jackson 
and michael lomax the two frontrunners for mayor in the 1989 
elections on record as opposing it 
we need not revisit these issues adamson said saying that 
if the controversy were to start anew every time political opinion 
changed we would not get anything done

a split charred tree stump is a clue that 
lightning was to blame for a forest fire carbon particles indicate 
the exhaust of a passing truck was the culprit and there are other 
ways to tell a fire was accidental 
you eliminate all those causes youre down to arson said 
dale smallwood a criminal investigator for missouris mark twain 
national forest 
he comes down to arson in most of his investigations and he 
and other forest officials believe the problem is often rooted in 
some regional traditions that are as hard to quell as flames 
a psychologists study found economic and even aesthetic reasons 
why some people light woods aflame 
arsonists set 172 of the 296 mark twain fires that have broken 
out so far this year burning more than 9000 acres smallwood 
said a total of 14200 acres of the forest which covers 15 
million acres mostly in southern missouri were burned during a 
spring fire season made more volatile by drought 
on average smallwood estimates 70 percent of the forest fires 
each year in missouri are deliberately set 
its probably 90 percent higher than the national average 
said ron mcdonald mark twains fire control officer he said mark 
twain consistently is among the five forest districts with the 
worst arson problem 
its just been an ozark tradition of incendiary deliberately 
set fires mcdonald said 
the tradition seems to stretch across the southern united 
states according to smallwood fires in other areas are more 
likely to be caused by lightning or mans carelessness 
as one of the forest services 125 special law enforcement 
agents smallwood has spent most of the past 16 years investigating 
fires in the forests he loves i consider myself an ozark 
hillbilly he said 
the forest service is charged with protecting wildlands and 
balancing recreational needs with commercial interests in timber 
and mineral resources smallwoods job includes investigating 
marijuana growing in the forest timber theft and theft of other 
federal property 
his militaryneat office at the forest service headquarters in 
rolla is decorated with game bird feathers a picture of smokey 
bear and a glassdoored bookcase lined with reports and text books 
the forest service has called on psychologists sociologists and 
archaeologists to determine why fires are set 
part of it is tradition smallwood said in the 
springtime people used to burn the woods to allow grass to grow 
a policy of open grazing with cattle free to feed on any 
unfenced land was allowed in the ozarks until the 1960s longer 
than in other wooded areas smallwood said 
psychologist john p shea in the 1940s conducted one of the 
first forest service studies of arson 
subsistence farmers in the rural south who were interviewed by 
shea and his researchers claimed fire helped control ticks snakes 
and disease and controlled the encroachment of trees on land where 
they wanted to graze cattle 
their ways are those of frontiersmen living in an arrested 
frontier shea wrote 
aesthetics even played a part shea and other researchers found 
that people living in areas where arson was common enjoyed the 
smell of smoke in the spring air and believed the woods looked 
better burned clean 
the forest service has attempted to counter the lore that can 
lead to burning 
over the years timber has been touted as a cash crop that is as 
worthy of protection as grassland smokey bear and other programs 
encourage the view of the forests as a priceless national resource 
but the tradition of using fire to manage the woods dies hard 
theres no cutanddried way to prevent it mcdonald said 
we had one case in 1984 where two men went to sunday school 
and after school they started a fire with their sunday school 
literature smallwood said they just happened to be driving 
through an area they thought needed to be burned out 
still the arsonist does not always fit the profile of a simply 
misguided citizen 
part of the problem is people driving around drinking and 
shooting road signs smallwood said when they get bored with 
that they set fires its malicious mischief 
sometimes you hear that someone is angry at the forest service 
because of some administrative action because we closed a road or 
disallowed something and they dont necessarily have to be mad at 
the forest service they could be mad at government period 
then fire is used as retaliation 
its so senseless he said it just costs a lot of money 
to put these fires out and its coming right out of our tax 
dollars 
mcdonald who oversees about 125 mark twain employees trained as 
firefighters said forest fires cost 25 to 30 an acre to suppress 
in the rare case of a conviction the arsonist is likely to be 
put on probation or ordered to pay the costs of fighting the fire 
and replacing timber that was destroyed smallwood said last year 
a judge ordered two arsonists to work weekends for the forest 
service 
an arson case in the forest is very hard to make he said 
when you go out in the middle of the forest to a blackened area 
to begin an investigation its very difficult and frustrating no 
1 you usually dont have any witnesses 
he noted that in some cases people who have evidence withhold 
it for fear of being burned out themselves 
beyond the cost in dollars of forest fires theres risk to 
those who fight them 
we had an employee die of a heart attack fighting an arson 
fire smallwood said referring to a 1976 blaze 
we would have liked to have prosecuted someone in that case 
and i would have also liked to have known if the prosecutor would 
have considered a manslaughter charge against the arsonist

as developments change the the way 
people communicate from cellular phones to interactive cable tv 
some regulators and lawmakers say the constitutions protections of 
traditional speech and press need to be restated for the new media 
police can legally eavesdrop on cellular telephone 
conversations even though it would be unlawful to tap the same 
conversations over regular phone lines without a court order said 
ucla communication studies professor jeff cole 
its also legal to spy on the phone numbers dialed up by a home 
computer 
and here in cerritos people are frustrated by another 
constititional quandary they cant receive a futuristic cable 
system that would provide athome shopping and banking not to 
mention lots of television channels until its determined who has 
a right to install it 
we are going to have to figure out a way to ensure the first 
amendment survives the technological revolution said federal 
communications commission public affairs director john kamp 
in the cerritos case an official of the fcc which regulates 
broadcast media and some telephone services but not newspapers and 
magazines recently approved the laying of cable by the local 
telephone company gte which won a contract from the city last 
year 
but cable industry groups have asked the full fcc to review the 
matter and a decision is expected in the fall said michael morris 
of the california cable television association the industry cites 
federal regulations banning telephone companies from operating 
cable tv in cities where they run the phones 
the residents are frustrated said michele ogle a 
spokeswoman for this upscale los angeles suburb they would like 
to see cable television the surrounding communities have it 
some media experts are concerned for a different reason they 
think the first amendment guaranteeing free speech and press 
should keep local and federal governments from deciding who sends 
or receives information by the new media 
the phone companies like any other citizen enjoy a first 
amendment right to be speakers said patrick maines of the media 
institute in washington dc 
cable television should have little or no regulation at the 
federal or local level he said 
maines institute houses the first amendment center on the new 
media which has filed legal briefs and comments with courts and 
the fcc in eight cases it feels threaten the first amendment rights 
of new media such as cable television telephone information 
services and electronic publishing 
cole of ucla compared the state of law and the new media to 
the old west where theres no established law and order anything 
goes and the biggest guy with the most power always wins 
some argue that the first amendment is meant to ensure many 
media voices and that government rules encouraging competition 
among new media help meet that goal he said 
letting telephone companies offer electronic information on 
their wires could give them an unfair advantage over potential 
competitors according to former fcc general counsel henry geller 
now head of the washington center for public policy research 
i dont want the phone company to be in cable television and 
control 50 channels geller said 
future fiber optic transmission lines which gte would test in 
cerritos could become a highway into the home carrying 
telephone television and text messages he said 
todays new media blur the lines between categories lawmakers 
and judges have used for years 
the first amendment was written more than 200 years ago when 
print was the only mass medium the nations communication act was 
passed in 1934 when radio and telephone concerns dominated 
it used to be easy to tell the difference between newspapers 
and telephones now its not so easy said the fccs kamp some 
newspapers send electronic copies of stories to home computers over 
phone lines 
i see no difference between the washington post i pick up at 
my doorstep and the washington post that comes in on my computer 
modem except that i dont get newsprint ink on my hands said 
ken allen of the information industry association a group of 650 
companies that see information as their product 
they new media should have the same protections that the 
first amendment provides other information sources said allen 
but he cited cases where information that is put in a new media 
suddenly loses all of its first amendment protections 
californias legislature this year considered a state 
constitutional amendment extending state free speech and press 
protections to computer communications the bill passed the state 
assembly but was stalled in the senate after law enforcement and 
credit information companies voiced opposition said bob jacobson 
a consultant to the assembly committee 
i think the likelihood of all forms of communication having 
full first amendment rights is the most likely course over time 
said everette dennis of the gannett center for media studies in new 
york it may take a long time to happen but its an 
inevitability

the us economy is now in its 69th month of 
expansion and according to a very popular view three score and 
ten is time sufficient meaning the expansion should now roll over 
and die 
it is not a foolish concept since aging expansions in years 
past have always developed deteriorations similar to the organic 
muscular and osteo problems of human old age but the concept is 
perhaps overly simple 
the average postwar economic expansion has averaged 45 months 
and ever since that average was surpassed two years ago the number 
of cassandras has grown they view further growth as bad a 
recession as welcome 
the reasoning is this factories are operating at near capacity 
and cannot produce more unemployment is down to the 
scrapingthebottom level and that means job openings can be 
filled only with less productive workers 
such measurements in the past have preceded inflation thus a 
recession is inevitable and the sooner the better the pessimists 
argue 
but some elements dont seem to fit 
growth neednt be inflationary if it is based on solid 
productivity gains says prudentialbaches edward yardeni who 
believes some notions about economic expansions rather than 
expansion itself might be dated 
whereas the cassandras fear that further growth will put too 
much stress on the system yardeni and some others observe that 
growth is whats needed to narrow the federal deficit 
but what about the tight job market ask the pessimists 
to which those of more positive mind respond by calling 
attention to the billions of dollars industry is spending on more 
efficient plants and equipment thus reducing the stress 
in fact economists of a positive bent point out not all price 
increases are inflationary why they remind us a price increase 
accompanied by a bigger rise in product quality can actually be 
antiinflationary 
surprised by the persistence of economic expansion in spite of 
their dire forecasts some economists are now reviewing their basic 
notions they concede there is no better proof or disproof than the 
economy itself 
incredibly one factor that could explain the negativism is the 
neglect of the newer service sector of the economy while 
stressing the older industrial segment 
threequarters of employment 67 percent of gross national 
product and 90 percent of new jobs are in the service sector 
nevertheless they figure less strongly in most analyses than do 
older industrial measurements 
geoffrey h moore and allan p layton of columbia university 
suggest that studies of the service sector do not always fit into 
neatly constructed concepts of what the economy should be doing in 
short there might be a builtin bias toward using industrial 
rather than service indicators 
they contend that one reason for this is that many of the 
service industries have continued to grow during business cycle 
contractions as well as expansions 
therefore indicators that skip recessions do not get a good 
rating and hence tend to be rejected 
moore and layton have developed service indicators for the 
center for international business research at columbia financed by 
the coalition of service industries the first quarterly report has 
just been issued 
in that report economist allen sinai analyzed the data and 
concluded there will be continued expansion in the service sector 
but at a somewhat slackened pace than had been so earlier in the 
expansion 
his conclusion servicesector economic activity is continuing 
to expand nicely but goodssector activity is now driving the 
economy 
the pace of services economics has softened compared with 
1987 but does not pose any difficulty for the overall economy or 
job growth at this time

east harlem is a long way from madison avenue 
but annie troy has made what she calls the counterclockwise 
passage choosing sacrifice among the poor over affluence in the ad 
game 
ten years after she left ohio for the big city troy had risen 
to a 42000ayear job as creative supervisor of a large new york 
advertising agency 
she gave it up and now at 35 is executive director of emmaus 
house inc a work and counseling program for about 50 formerly 
homeless people in east harlem she lives and works with them 
subsisting on the same 25aweek allowance that they receive 
in a neighborhood where gunfire keeps her indoors at night troy 
spends much of her day running up and down stairs among walls hung 
with pictures of the rev martin luther king jr the pale slight 
redhead deals with everything from buying bathroom mirrors and 
supervising food deliveries to finding a new drug counselor 
in the 18 months shes lived at emmaus troy has come to miss 
her old neighborhood her privacy and sometimes her old career she 
misses shopping and seeing her friends 
the little things can become a real big treat now like 
getting together with a friend at a restaurant she said i 
enjoyed the freedom of being able to buy what i wanted 
but its also a freedom in saying ok i think i have 
enough 
three years ago troy lost a friend to aids searching for a way 
to cope she returned to church after a long break from her 
lutheran upbringing 
in a sermon one day at st georges episcopal church on east 
16th street the priest discussed a man who established missions 
for the poor and an integrated new york church in the 19th century 
the man stephen tyng was troys greatgreatgreatgrandfather 
her astonishment at the coincidence of hearing about her 
forebear in that church and her amazement at the breadth of his 
accomplishments sparked a change in her as she sat there she 
says my eyes were opened to faith 
most people dont need a religious experience she said 
but i guess i needed it to get my attention 
troy began to spend her free time helping with mostly 
administrative chores at a lowincome housing construction project 
on manhattans lower east side after a month they offered her a 
job as assistant director at a pay cut of more than 50 percent 
from her advertising job she accepted 
turning to the church had started my thinking going 
counterclockwise to where it had been she said it didnt seem 
like being competitive and making more money was really the thing 
to put my time on anymore i just started to think if im 
going to work this hard maybe i could work this hard on something 
that would really help people 
father david kirk founded emmaus in 1966 two years ago it moved 
from a brownstone to what had been a hotel notorious for 
prostitution and drugdealing arsonists gutted the building twice 
before emmaus could move in now troy says the dealers and 
prostitutes join the 250 people fed in emmaus soup kitchen each 
weekday 
kirk talks of how much simpler and quieter life at emmaus used 
to be before homelessness and poverty intensified before the 
advent of crack cocaine 
for a woman reared in a small town near dayton emmaus was full 
of revelations despite what troy already knew of new york 
a drug addict would come to her room for a friendly chat and 
leave with her watch she felt betrayed until she sought guidance 
from a drug counselor who taught her to look beyond the lies and 
manipulative behavior into the pain of a person bent only on 
getting their next fix 
when people go to serve the poor says troy theyre full of 
romantic visions of rescuing lives of finding a reward in 
grateful faces they soon learn that the changes take longer that 
successes are relative and that helpers like those being helped 
are only human 
if you try to live according to that dream troy said you 
get disappointed in yourself and in the others real fast 
this spring after six weeks of daily struggles to get out of 
bed she recognized signs of the burnout that had hit her 
predecessor she left for two weeks at a farm and catholic retreat 
in canada where people are trained to work with the poor and 
counseling is given to those who already do on arrival they took 
one look at her tired face and put her in the infirmary 
a month or so later troy looks weary again she says she rarely 
thinks about returning to advertising just occasionally when in a 
snit but she wont try to predict where she might be 10 years 
from now ten years ago she says i never would have dreamed 
id be here 
though she stays in touch with her family and though her 
devoutly religious mother in particular supports what she does 
one of the hardest adjustments to life at emmaus was losing touch 
with her friends 
emergencies from a resident whos upset to a potential 
knifefight in the soup kitchen often interfere with troys 
outside plans and her friends are reluctant to visit in east 
harlem when they do get together there are awkward first moments 
until they find themselves once more on equal ground 
i guess theres something kind of odd troy said about 
this friend who leaves it all to go to work with the poor and who 
becomes devout 
but as she sees it there can be as much stress in her old world 
as she has now 
at emmaus troy said her religious conviction has been 
strengthened theres so much thats beyond my ken or control or 
anybodys ability to help 
she turned to roman catholicism in october 1986 drawn by the 
churchs devotion to the virgin mary and the accessibility of its 
weekday services 
but her faith in human nature has suffered 
i see the devastation thats happening with these people 
she said and i see on the other side people who are begrudging 
even giving out that dime to somebody begging i really see 
that the problem is far more severe than i had ever thought 
then she said i have to turn to the individual for my 
hope

the columbia river rolls 
lazily through the desert of central washington nourishing crops 
and wildlife in what otherwise would be a wasteland of sagebrush 
and barren hills 
the river which once roared through deep gorges was 
immortalized in woody guthries depressionera song roll on 
columbia 
green douglas fir where the waters cut through 
down her wild mountains and canyons she flew 
canadian northwest to the ocean so blue 
its roll on columbia roll on 
but after the construction of more than a dozen dams in 51 
years the columbia has rolled nearly to a standstill for much of 
its 1214 miles the river is a series of dams and slackwater 
reservoirs providing electricity irrigation and flood control for 
washington oregon and canada 
the united states claims one last freeflowing stretch the 
55mile hanford reach and it too is facing major development 
the us army corps of engineers is proposing a 180 million 
project to open the river to barge traffic all the way to 
wenatchee so that logs wheat and apples from the states interior 
can be floated to pacific ocean ports 
the plan calls for dredging part of the river and building giant 
lifts over three dams to allow navigation between richland and 
wenatchee 
opponents say the dredging would forever ruin valuable fish and 
wildlife habitat archaeological sites and the last vestige of 
natural river flow 
washingtons congressional delegation has introduced legislation 
to protect the area 
the reach is one of the only areas where spawning habitats 
remain undisturbed nesting areas abound and majestic cliffs 
lining the river are mirrored in its quiet deep calm said sen 
dan evans rwash 
were telling them dont go ahead with these illconceived 
plans until we know the impact on spawning and recreation the most 
important use of the river said republican rep sid morrison 
whose district includes the area 
under the bill the department of the interior would protect the 
hanford reach for eight years until a study determines whether to 
permanently preserve the stretch under the wild and scenic rivers 
act 
the bill has already cleared the senate but morrison has delayed 
house action while negotiations continue to address concerns of the 
us department of energy 
that agency operates the hanford nuclear reservation a 
sprawling plutoniumproduction site that straddles the river the 
energy department is worried the study could hamper hanford 
operations said terry seeley a legislative aide to morrison 
there lies the irony of the wild and scenic designation as 
the columbia flows past nine federal nuclear reactors no one would 
call the view pastoral 
the huge eerie reactors technological marvels in their time 
produced much of the plutonium for the nations nuclear weapons 
arsenal the slowmoving river creeps past the hulking reactors 
with pumping stations razorwire fences and guard towers casting 
shadows over the water 
eight are closed permanently the newest the n reactor which 
was placed on cold standby earlier this year because the 
federal government no longer needed the plutonium stands closest 
to the river a brooding presence amid the jumping fish herons and 
deer 
much of the shore is offlimits to recreational users because 
the federal government wanted a buffer zone around its reactors 
the hanford reach runs from priest rapids dam south of mattawa 
to the reservoir of mcnary dam just north of richland 
the biggest objections to the dredging are that the movement of 
a halfmillion cubic yards of dirt would destroy some of the last 
wild runs of chinook salmon which battle their way up river to 
spawn 
thats one of the few or perhaps the only remaining natural 
spawning area in that entire river system below grand coulee dam 
that salmon and steelhead can get too said jerry neal deputy 
director the state department of wildlife 
the army corps of engineers has proposed building an artificial 
salmon spawning channel to compensate for areas lost to dredging 
but opponents say that would not work 
artificial spawning channels just dont provide the quantity 
and quality of reproduction that the natural freeflowing river 
provides neal said the technology hasnt been that 
wellperfected 
the dredging proposal has also run into stiff fiscal opposition 
the costbenefit ratio for the project currently stands at just 
80 cents in benefits for every dollar spent said george sellar 
manager of water resources for the port of chelan county in 
wenatchee which has been pushing the plan since the 1950s 
the port and the army are now studying the plan to try to make 
it economically stronger 
for instance some people feel that large quantities of apples 
could not be moved by barge because of the length of the trip but 
others say using refrigerated containers would keep them fresh 
sellar said 
the port hopes to save up to 40 percent in transportation costs 
compared to rail or trucking one barge will move the equivalent 
of 50 to 60 trucks sellar said

roll down the car window anywhere near 
the plant where louisianas most famous hot sauce still is made 
from a centuryold recipe and your head just fills up with the 
scent a little tomatoey a little spicy a lot hot 
the odor is so much a part of the place that paul cp 
mcilhenny whose family has been making tabasco sauce from the 
start doesnt even notice it unless hes up close to the pulp 
barrels 
hot sauce in southern louisiana is like that smell its 
everywhere on every table in every restaurant two dozen or so 
varieties louisiana hot sauce is a tourist attraction its on 
posters and coffee mugs and key chains and people take tours of 
hot sauce factories 
in the river parishes where the acadians first landed its 
hard not to find a bottle of louisiana hot sauce on the table 
said john folse a chef and restaurateur in donaldsonville who 
introduced cajun food to moscow during the summit meeting earlier 
this year its almost like salt pepper and louisiana hot 
there is of course the theory that people who live in such 
steamy heat eat hot foods to perspire and cool off 
my mothers people and my fathers people grew hot peppers 
because they thought they were good for you said televisions 
downhome cajun chef justin wilson 
but theres much more than science at work in a land where what 
to eat for dinner is often the focus of luncheon conversation and 
what to eat tomorrow is the dinnertable talk good food really 
matters here 
when someone asks what are you doing this afternoon you 
say oh i dont know maybe a crawfish boil they always think in 
terms of cooking said folse 
and most everything even to a bloody mary sorbet says folse 
gets a dash or two of hot sauce 
i dont think anythings worth a darn unless its seasoned 
well said wilson who is partial to cayenne peppers 
mcilhenny 44 vice president of the mcilhenny co figures he 
goes through a 2ounce bottle a month of tabasco which by the 
way is not a generic name though mcilhennys pleased if you think 
so 
hot sauce is addictive he said ive had friends use it out 
of loyalty and then say hey this is good as if it was a 
surprise they say they get addicted 
so its no surprise there are so many kinds tabasco 
trappeys tony cacheres creole hot sauce crystal hot sauce 
cajun chef louisiana gold durkee sauce panola red cajun power 
hot sauce you get the idea 
a premium sauce its agreed uses only the pepper pulp no 
seeds or skin most contain just salt vinegar and peppers 
although some labels say it fancier crystal for example lists 
fresh ripe aged peppers and cajun chef contains select 
louisiana cayenne peppers 
so can connoisseurs distinguish among them 
sure said folse noting that most chefs stock four of five 
varieties 
ive got items in my kitchen i use tabasco on however i also 
really like louisiana gold he said i dont find that its 
quite as hot as tabasco and when you have five or six chefs on 
the line you want to have a little control if they put one shot 
or two shots you dont want to change the flavor competely 
they all have a little different flavor and they all use a 
little different amounts of vinegar salt said wilson there 
are certain ones i prefer its just a question of experience 
and god knows i have a lot of that 
the mcilhenny co too has plenty of experience tabasco is 
sold in 100 countries its been on space missions 
we end up in strange places said mcilhenny i understand 
two or three sherpas in nepal will use a bottle at a single meal 
nepal is a long way from tiny avery island 18 square miles that 
are home to 700 people the tabasco plant and fields a salt mine 
and oil wells there also are 100000 snowy egrets 30000 azaleas 
and 17000 irises 
avery island is not really an island but a salt dome that rises 
from the marshes and bayous on louisianas gulf coast at 152 feet 
above sea level the island is the highest point along the gulf 
from mexico to florida it sits 150 miles from new orleans 
separated by sugar cane rice and oil fields 
in 1818 john craig marsh obtained rights to part of the island 
and later a louisiana judge daniel dudley avery bought part in 
1837 avery married marshs daughter and eventually obtained the 
entire island 
in 1859 edmund mcilhenny married an avery daughter the story 
is told though not verified that the family fled avery island in 
the civil war and returned to find everything destroyed except 
one defiant pepper plant grown from a seed or seedling given to 
edmund by a friend returning from mexico 
what is known is that edmund mcilhenny came up with a sauce to 
perk up the bland food available during reconstruction n 1868 he 
packed his invention in ladies perfume bottles and sent samples 
off to 350 wholesalers two years later he had a patent and in two 
years more a london office to handle all the european orders 
his sauce used a variety of capsicum frutescens a small 
fireenginered pepper of which the mcilhenny co today is the 
worlds largest producer tabasco is an indian word for damp earth 
which mcilhenny apparently chose because he liked the sound of it 
one hundred twenty years later little has changed mcilhenny is 
still a family company with paul mcilhenny and two cousins in 
charge and avery island is their kingdom 
this is an ideal site said mcilhenny part of the 
mystique is that only the soil only the climate only the nimble 
fingers of avery island could pick tabasco 
the peppers are harvested in summer by hand and must be 
processed the same day 
but today only 10 percent of the peppers needed are grown on 
the island to protect against disease pests hurricanes and labor 
troubles seeds for the rest of the peppers are sent to central and 
south america the mash is returned to avery island 
paul mcilhenny inspects every white oak barrel of mash for 
aroma color particle size he rejects one barrel in 100 
the pulp is mashed with salt eight pounds to 100 pounds of 
peppers and aged three years the mash is then mixed with a 
strong white vinegar and stirred mechanically for 28 days finally 
it is strained and bottled 
and even then its not just a bottle of sauce 
hot sauces in louisiana are almost a religion said folse 
you go to church on sunday hot sauce on monday through friday

editors note as the reagan administrations lease on the 
white house runs out so does george shultzs tenure as secretary 
of state he leaves behind him no foreign policy doctrine no 
ringing rhetoric but world affairs have changed significantly 
during his stewardship and now peace seems to be erupting in 
unexpected places heres a portrait of a lowkey diplomat who 
seems to have been more concerned with the process than with 
himself 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
he sometimes talked about his job as 
pickandshovel work and himself as a gardener images no 
one would have pinned to the office that henry kissinger endowed 
with jetset glitter john foster dulles with a prophetic edge and 
dean acheson with aristocratic elegance 
those three earlier secretaries of state over the past 
halfcentury performed naturally on a floodlit stage that george 
shultz just as naturally avoids 
unlike them hes never been the source of memorable quotations 
despite his years as a washington insider he much resembles what 
in fact he is a stanford university professor on leave 
theyve established a chair in my honor he has said i 
told them that when im through with this job ill need a couch 
hell be through in january along with the administration he 
serves but its twilight is seeing a remarkable splurge of 
peacemaking in us diplomacy 
peace may be coming to angola and southwestern africa where 
preliminary agreements may point to the ultimate withdrawal of up 
to 50000 cuban troops iran in a startling turnabout has 
accepted a ceasefire in its war with iraq soviet troops are 
leaving afghanistan prosoviet vietnam is accelerating a military 
withdrawal from cambodia 
peace in central america is more elusive and in the middle east 
where shultz has expended much effort negotiations between 
israelis and arabs seem as distant as ever 
shultzs interest in the mideast antedates his appointment as 
secretary of state he is former president of the bechtel group an 
international construction and engineering firm that made a fortune 
in the arab world 
when president reagan appointed shultz in july 1982 his views 
on the middle east came under intense congressional scrutiny 
against the apprehensions of some he has emerged as one of 
israels staunchest friends 
on a recent visit to amman shultz told a group of jordanian 
journalists that a total israeli withdrawal from the west bank was 
not in the cards and neither was a palestinian state 
traditionally diplomats make cooing sounds in such 
circumstances jordanian authorities never permitted the interview 
to appear in print or on the air 
shultz 67 will leave office without leaving a foreign policy 
doctrine or historic milestone associated with his name some 
see his main accomplishment as secretary of state is keeping a 
highly conservative administration on a moderate course in dealing 
with the soviet union 
his approach dovetailed with the rise to power in moscow three 
years ago of a pragmatic soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
ussoviet summit meetings are now annual occurrences 
how much credit belongs to shultz how much to gorbachev and 
how much to reagan who not so long ago called the soviet union an 
evil empire 
its anybodys guess but the fact is that the two sides signed 
a historic treaty last year to abolish all us and soviet 
intermediaterange nuclear missiles and to exchange inspectors to 
ensure the deal is kept the way was cleared in monthly meetings 
between shultz and soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
moreover there is a framework in place for the next president 
democrat or republican to make more weapons cutbacks and to 
reconcile superpower differences around the world 
so far as his recognition that theres been a fundamental 
change in the soviet union hes been a good influence in toning 
down the president said former undersecretary of state george w 
ball otherwise a critic of shultz especially on the middle east 
shultz also eased frictions with congress and strengthened us 
ties with the north atlantic treaty organization and with japan and 
other asian allies 
hes been upfront said rep dante fascell chairman of the 
house foreign affairs committee hes well liked by congress we 
dont always agree with him but the judgment on both sides of the 
aisle is hes a good secretary of state 
did shultz try hard to talk reagan out of sending american tow 
missiles to the iranians in a futile attempt to free american 
hostages in lebanon 
i wonder if there is more that i could have done shultz 
said after the irancontra scandal broke i believe there was i 
dont give myself any plus on this 
some on capitol hill are more critical rep robert g 
toricelli dnj who heard him in closed testimony before the 
house of foreign affairs committee says shultz did more than 
separate himself from white house policies on iran he built a wall 
between himself and the white house 
critics of the presidents ambitious and they say fanciful 
star wars project wonder if shultz tried to slow the project down 
and have found him ambiguous 
asked on national television whether he supported or opposed a 
socalled broad interpretation of the 1972 antiballistic 
missile treaty to allow debatable tests and early deployment 
shultz played it close to the vest 
the result was a headline in the new york times the next morning 
that shultz rules out star wars move within two years and a 
headline in the washington post shultz accepts broad view of abm 
pact 
quizzed by congress shultz was not much clearer he said the 
program should be deployed only after it was found to be effective 
and worth the enormous investment in it 
was he subtly trying to slow down the program which caspar 
weinberger then the defense secretary and a former bechtel 
colleague was eager to deploy or was he for star wars full blast 
i dont have a clear picture where he stands on star wars 
former us arms control director paul warnke says i think he 
felt this was the presidents magnificent obsession and he wasnt 
going to do anything about it 
but warnke an ardent proponent of arms control gives shultz 
high grades for vigorously promoting the missileban treaty he 
definitely had his heart in arms control warnke says 
similarly former sen j william fulbright who practices law 
in washington and still keeps an eye on foreign policy trends says 
that what pleases him most is this move toward conciliation with 
the russians

on the other hand fulbright a former chairman of the senate 
foreign relations committee calls the hardline us policy in 
central america a great mistake and in the middle east he 
says weve always been so completely supportive of israel 
theres not much chance of a compromise 
george ball who held an important state department post in the 
kennedy administration concurs he faults shultz for inepitude 
in trying to work out a deal between israel and lebanon in 1982 
without consulting syria and then ignoring president hafez assad 
for years because he didnt go along 
fascell credits shultz with toughness and willingess to lay his 
prestige on the line in central america and the middle east 
although you cant say lebanon was a success there 241 us 
servicemen were killed in october 1983 when a marine command center 
was blown up us peacekeeping forces which critics said had been 
foolishly exposed were then withdrawn 
joseph laitin a longtime government press officer who worked 
for shultz at the office and management and budget tried to 
explain shultz this way 
you have to remember the animal trainer describing how an 
elephant moves he puts one leg forward shifts his body over to 
that foot to see if it will hold him then moves the next foot 
forward he never leaves his moorings in one place without having 
another mooring hes no great risktaker 
the ringing declaration the apocalyptic pronouncement were not 
shultzs style he didnt convey the impression that the worlds 
fate hinged on his success in persuading foreign leaders to support 
his policies 
for six years plodding through ussoviet middle east arms 
control diplomacy he methodically recited to reporters you 
dont have an agreement until you have an agreement which seems 
to echo baseballs yogi berras it aint over till its over 
but if reporters found the secretary less than electrifying 
neither did he play games with them such as hiding behind 
background and notforattribution rituals in the ancient 
washington tradition he said what he had to say on the record 
even when it meant admitting the failure of a highstakes mission 
and he persevered he worked in behalf of jews and other 
minorities who were prevented from emigrating from the soviet 
union he made a point of giving human rights a pride of place 
on his agenda in all his sessions with soviet leaders he arranged 
meetings with dissidents in moscow and emigres in jerusalem to lend 
symbolic support to their cause 
lowkey team player that he was much of the time shultz could 
dissent sharply and publicly he bristled at a white house order in 
1985 to subject all government officials in sensitive positions to 
lie detector tests shultz would have none of it personally and 
threatened to resign unless the order was modified it was 
when reagan two years ago decided to sell subsidized wheat to 
the soviet union shultz called the sales ridiculous having 
led the opposition within the administration he kept up his 
criticism after he lost the soviets he said must be chortling 
over paying less for americanproduced food than american 
housewives 
there was risk in such selfassertion shultz told the house and 
senate irancontras investigating committees you must be willing 
to say goodbye and i am 
he had offered to quit on two other occasions 
one was in 1983 when he discovered that robert c mcfarlane 
then the deputy national security adviser had made a secret trip 
to several mideast states without shultzs knowledge he said he 
told reagan mr president you dont need a guy like me for 
secretary of state if this is the way things are going to be done 
the other came in august 1986 when shultz thought some 
conservatives in the white house subjected him to a kind of 
guerrilla warfare to the point of hamstringing his authority to 
use government aircraft for his state department business 
shultz served in the marines in world war ii and met his wife 
helena obrien in hawaii where she was an army nurse they have 
five children and five grandchildren 
when reagan asked shultz to succeed alexander haig jr in june 
1982 he was summoned from london where he had been on a business 
trip shultz was to meet with the president at camp david and he 
found two limousines waiting for him at the airport one was for 
him he was told the other to take his wife wherever she wanted to 
go while he had his interview with the president 
shultz waved off the second car no she will come with me 
he said we are a package deal 
he is the first man in history to have served in four cabinet 
posts state labor treasury and the office of management and 
budget 11 years in all of cabinet service a measure of his 
aptitude for conciliation and avoiding controversy is that he held 
three of these posts under richard m nixon and emerged unscathed 
by any of that administrations notoriety and scandal 
joseph laitins theory shared by others is that while shultz 
is a team player he also has a welldeveloped protective 
mechanism 
it was not that he was fighting them all the time says 
laitin there was an oldshoe relationship between shultz and 
nixon shultz will go along but at some point instinctively hell 
hunker down he will not budge because hes a man of character 
as secretary of the treasury he disregarded a nixon white house 
request to have the internal revenue service harass enemies of 
the administration provoking nixon to unflattering comments and 
when nixon complained about an irs audit of his tax return shultz 
told him that every recent president had been similarly audited 
he showed no signs of winding down as his tenure neared its end 
so far this year shultz has made four trips to the middle east 
three to the soviet union and a 17day swing through asia 
why did he keep returning to the mideast despite the refusal of 
israelis and arabs to heed his plea to negotiate shultz explained 
he didnt mind fighting long odds and if he didnt succeed 
himself he wanted to lay some groundwork for his successor 
besides he said what am i saving myself for 
end adv for sunday aug 14

editors note was there ever a golden era of sports in the dim 
past as touted by septuagenarian chroniclers maybe not but 
theres one right now its the pga senior tour where golfs 
ancient rake in the lucre in postcareer careers that lack the 
pressure and cutthroat solemnity of youthful competition but make 
up for it in sheer pleasure on the back nine of life 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
at times the senior scene seems lifted live from the frame of an 
old dutch golfing print the whimsical kind you still find hanging 
in country club corridors and locker rooms 
genial gentlemen of mellowing vintage in broadbrimmed hats and 
knickerbockers bent over long crooked sticks in studious pursuit of 
nudging a small white ball across a pleasant expanse of lawn or 
perhaps these are scottish shepherds who have lost their sheep in 
the highland heather 
weep no idle tennysonian tears for a vanished yesteryear these 
are here and now maturing millionaires some for the second time 
around playing the pga senior tour sports biggest success story 
in the past decade 
its a mulligan on life a chance for a second career at an 
age when all other athletes are over the hill exulted the 
australian bruce crampton who made a million on the regular tour 
retired to hunt oil in texas for eight years then returned at age 
50 to strike it rich again as a senior 
in golf a mulligan is a second drive off the first tee allowed 
in friendly circles to compensate for a dismal start but purely 
illegal even on the senior tour where the over50 set now competes 
in a friendly way for official prize money in excess of 10 million 
the lucre is so lucrative that last year no fewer than a dozen 
seniors made more than in their regular career at least a 
halfdozen more are poised to join crampton and seven other seniors 
who already have won a million on the back nine of life 
here indeed is a new golden age of sport beyond the most 
avaricious dreams of the actuarial tables 
the old sarge orville moody recently matriculated to the 
millionaire class is a splendid example of delayed golf growth 
moodys only win in 17 years on the regular tour was the us open 
in 1969 prior to that this partchoctaw indian spent l4 years in 
the army rising to the envious rank of noncom in charge of golf 
installations joining the seniors he tucked a 50inch long 
putter now affectionately known as the staff sergeant tight 
unto his sternum and began pendulum stroking putts that now 
guarantee a more generous pension than the pentagon had in mind 
in physical contour moody more resembles sgt snorkel in the 
beetle bailey comic strip than your supple super jock senior 
millionaires come in all sizes from the wellrounded billy casper 
and miller barber to lean and hungry exercise fanatics like 
crampton a daily visitor to the physical fitness van in the 
parking lot and gary player who still does 300 situps a night on 
the motel floor 
but even with the choice of riding in carts isnt it hot work 
for chaps their age to be flailing away with woods and irons across 
seven miles of uncooperating landscape for the better part of a 
week 
playing golf is not hot work demurs chi chi rodriguez 
cutting sugar cane for a dollar a day thats hot work hotter 
than my first wristwatch 
chi chi who took up golf at 25 cents a bag as a caddy in his 
native puerto rico managed to match in less than 30 months at 
senior play the million it took him 25 years to win on the regular 
tour anything is possible in america says this jovial 
ambassador of the friendly laidback brand of golf that has made 
the senior tour such a hit with the galleries and tv audiences 
instantly recognizable in his straw fedora chi chi finds time 
to chat with the fans behind the marshals ropes to autograph caps 
and sun visors and visit with kids and old people in wheelchairs 
after sinking a 20footer he goes into his duelist act wiping 
imaginary blood from his putter and seemingly sheathing it like a 
swordsman returning a sabre to its scabbard 
suddenly golf is fun again in an age when so many younger 
players come across as unsmiling monosyllabic computerprogrammed 
golfing machines abandoning the color and drama to foreign players 
like the fiery spaniard seve ballesteros australias great 
white shark greg norman and masters champion sandy lyle the 
slender scot who deepened golfs mystique by revealing that his 
girlfriend cured his tensions by tickling his feet

gary player the south african gold miners son who at 50 found 
a new mother lode on the fairways is convinced that in two years 
the senior tour will outshine the regular pga circuit when enduring 
idols jack nicklaus and lee trevino reach their semicentennial 
this mulligan on life enabled gene littler to put another 
million toward his hobby of collecting rolls royces after a bout 
with cancer almost ended a great career that at age 58 is still 
rolling in putts and prize money larry mowry whose best friend 
vo and coke betrayed him into dissipating early promise 
joined alcoholics anonymous and came back with white hair and a 
steadier putting hand hes become a consistent money winner among 
the seniors 
riding a golf cart has enabled charles owens the gutsy former 
paratrooper to earn a half million in the senior game after four 
operations on his right knee mangled in a jump at fort bragg 
theyre coming back from the dead this is the greatest thing 
that ever happened in any sport says robert trent jones the 
82year old golf course architect who still tees it up to test out 
his creations around the globe 
all sorts of walter mitty dreams are played out on the back nine 
of life 
walt zembriski a new jersey steel worker who used to tiptoe out 
on skyscraper girders is now walking on air in the top20 senior 
money list 
among the bornagain at 50 are ben smith who spent l5 years in 
the auto repair business and earl boles a former mortician 
ralph terry the yankee righthander voted most valuable player 
in the 1962 world series smiles out from bubblegum cards and takes 
the mound at oldtimers games at cooperstown but hes just a 
novice on the senior tour not yet in the prize money class with 
john brodie quarterback with the san francisco 49ers for l6 years 
who turned to golf as a third career after a decade in the nbctv 
sports booth 
having your intellect scrambled by the likes of big daddy 
lipscomb and rosey grier can be wonderful conditioning for golfs 
hard knocks ive been up by three touchdowns and forgotten to 
win brodie philosophized after blowing a twostroke lead to chi 
chi rodriguez at houston in april in golf you just wait until 
the end and add it up 
resilience of this sort enabled bill ezinicki former 
leftwinger with the toronto maple leafs to trade in his hockey 
stick for a persimmon wood and win the new england seniors title 
pros getting a mite long in the tooth but shorter on drives 
competed long before the pga formalized a seniors tour in 1980 in 
1937 three years after he inaugurated the masters bobby jones of 
grand slam fame gathered some friends including 23 scots eight 
englishmen two irishmen and only four americans at augusta 
national for the first pga seniors championship 
the purse totaled 2000 which was generous in an era when sam 
snead got 45 a month to represent the greenbrier resort on tour 
and walter hagen tipped his caddy his entire check for winning the 
british open 240 
dwight eisenhower promulgated golf as a sport for all ages by 
installing a putting green on the white house lawn and assigning 
the secret service to shag balls at augusta but senior tournament 
golf took off when nbctv in 1978 aired the finish of the first 
legends of golf from onion creek in austin texas the brainchild 
of producer fred raphael and jimmy demaret that unforgettable 
blithe spirit in purple saddle oxfords and polkadot slacks the 
legends had going for it a 400000 purse a team format pairing 
the best of yesteryear and a thrilling threebirdie finale by sam 
snead 
the popularity of the legends which bob hope dubbed the prune 
juice open prompted the pga to add other senior events that soon 
attracted corporate sponsors 
now there are 37 stops on the senior pga tour including the 
chrysler cup an international competition that recently 
spotlighted argentinas 65yearld roberto de vicenzo and irelands 
63yearold christy oconnor and the madza champions which pairs 
the cream of the oldsters with the best of the women pros in quest 
of a 500000 team check 
many other events outside the tour include a tv senior skins 
game which featured 76yearold snead and a growing foreign 
circuit that already stretches from rich river australia to 
narita japan 
now that a golf course is being built at nachabino outside 
moscow this capitalistic opiate of the aging masses is sure to 
spread to tbilisi capital of the soviet republic of georgia where 
the comrades reputedly live to 140 and beyond in no time at all 
pravda will be covering the first senior centenary classic

editors note not unlike the reaction in the united states 
after the soviet union launched the first sputnik in 1957 the 
soviets have suddenly discovered that their schools are falling

in uzbekistan in soviet central asia army inductees fresh out 
of school are so poorly educated that they cant understand simple 
orders in russian and even need to be taught how to brush their 
teeth 
two hours a week a class of 14yearold moscow boys dons blue 
smocks and grinds bolts on aging metal lathes their female 
classmates sew dresses using treadle machines that would have been 
familiar to their greatgrandmothers 
with surprising suddenness and unanimity reminiscent of the 
panic in the united states after the first sputnik launch in 1957 
soviets have discovered that their schools now dispense largely 
outdated and irrelevant learning and that their country is falling 
behind 
im ashamed to say it but my grandchildren study more or less 
from the textbooks i used as a child before the war one man 
wrote earlier this year in the communist party daily pravda 
ivan may know how to read but he doesnt know how to program 
a computer says a moscowbased western diplomat who specializes 
in soviet education but asked not to be identified by name 
the catalyst for the change is mikhail s gorbachevs ambitious 
drive to rebuild society and modernize and streamline the economy 
to enable his nation to compete with the developed west for 
gorbachev the soviet school is both a problem and a solution 
we pin hopes for the future largely on the work of our school 
which is only natural with its own restructuring its own 
teaching talents and the creative pursuits of the soviet teacher 
gorbachev told a meeting of party leaders who met this year to 
consider school reforms 
authorities are reexamining how the rigidly centralized 
curriculum prepares the countrys 57 million school pupils and 
university students for life they are even questioning whether 
rote learning long the mainstay of soviet education should not 
yield at least in part to free debate 
but officials say changing the system wont affect the schools 
role in bringing up children with socialist values how they will 
reconcile that task with the promotion of a freer learning 
environment is still an open question 
in january 1984 party officials announced the countrys schools 
were being revamped to stress trade skills theneducation minister 
mikhail a prokofiev said the objective was to double enrollment in 
technical institutes 
those goals were opposed by many parents who wanted their 
children to learn more than just a trade that objective has now 
been turned on its head and a sense of urgency imparted by the 
feeling that the soviet union is slipping further behind the west 
technologically intellectually and culturally 
soviet achievements in space theoretical science and hightech 
armaments are wellknown and the result of a network of state 
institutes think tanks and militaryindustrial agencies that 
enlist many of the countrys best brains but for the vast majority 
of soviets education has meant little more than vocational 
training 
the main task of the changes undertaken is to make school more 
humanitarian to give up the technocratic view that only technical 
upbringing is necessary eduard d dneprov of the soviet academy 
of pedagogical sciences said recently 
educators are debating whether a 10year general education 
course should be mandatory for all children or whether most 
youngsters should continue to be shunted into trade or vocational 
institutes after eight years of schooling 
more alarming for soviets is the realization that even the 
professional training given their children like the courses in 
boltgrinding dispensed to some moscow teens may bear no relation 
to job demands of the postindustrial age 
soviet schools now turn out 25 million skilled workers 
annually but officials say the instruction they receive often lags 
behind innovations at the workplace 
this means that the technological complexity of operations 
grows at a much faster pace than the level of workers skills 
yegor k ligachev the no 2 kremlin leader told the party meeting 
on education in february 
the inadequacy of job training extends to the most complex 
professions yevgeny i chazov minister of health has told one 
american researcher that 40 percent of soviet medical school 
graduates do not know how to read a cardiogram

the scale of the kremlins ambitions and the problems it must 
surmount are evident in computer science and information 
processing a field once scorned as a bourgeois pseudoscience 
but now seen as vital to technological progress 
by kremlin decree 98 percent of the countrys general education 
courses teach children about computers but at last count only 15 
percent had the machines 
in february school no 109 in southwest moscow received 12 
sovietmade personal computers but some of the squat black 
machines have sat on a table in yakov z voronovs classroom for 
more than three months because no one has been found to install 
them 
despite the long wait the math teacher is enthusiastic once 
the kids do their lessons with the computers the computer will 
give them their grade voronov says theyll love it 
that notion that learning should be fun is one western 
educators find conspicuously absent from the soviet system whose 
textbooks are crammed with gray type and devoid of bright 
illustrations and graphics 
a far more prevalent attitude toward learning is expressed by 
the russian maxim repetition is the mother of knowledge for 
decades memorization has been at the core of soviet education 
they know lots of facts said paul kalkstein an english 
teacher at phillips academy in andover mass who taught 
17yearold soviet exchange students last year but they are 
expected to be passive in class until their turn comes to read 
something aloud and thats not very often 
by age 15 students in moscow physics teacher gavriil a 
brazilers class are plotting the movements of electrons and 
protons through magnetic and electric fields that doesnt mean 
they understand what they are doing 
they dont know what elementary particles are but they learn 
how to solve the problems braziler says 
however many soviet educators say that the ability to 
regurgitate answers is no longer enough to meet the confusing 
demands of a changing world i dont want them to say something 
or believe something just because its me who says it says 
yevgeny a yamburg principal of school 109 
yamburg concedes that for a mass of teachers its hard to get 
used to students not all being in agreement 
the 3millionstrong corps of soviet teachers and professors 
ritually lauded but poorly paid has come in for special attention 
as well as criticism under the reforms 
to draw more qualified people to the profession wages have been 
raised a beginning teacher once paid about 150 a month now 
earns about 230 thats still well below the average factory 
workers wage of 330 
a teachers congress has been called to set tougher standards for 
the profession the partys demand for educational reform had its 
first institutional effect in march when the trio of ministries 
overseeing soviet schools was replaced by a single state committee 
on education 
in may the head of the committee gennady a yagodin canceled 
final exams for 10thgraders in history because their textbooks 
had been outdated by media revelations about the crimes of josef v 
stalin and the corrupt reign of leonid i brezhnev a new 
generation of textbooks more in tune with the spirit of 
glasnost or openness is now in the works 
the kremlin also recognizes the need to invest more in schools 
themselves 40 percent of which now lack basic plumbing ligachev 
said schools for 28 million pupils will be built by the year 2000 
and that capital expenditures in education will increase 
drastically 
despite the vast changes planned officials stress that the 
soviet school will not abandon its role as the creator of future 
citizens committed to following the communist party line 
one of the tasks of the school in the ussr is to bring up 
soviet boys and girls as dedicated champions of revolutionary ideas 
and traditions people who are striving and able to uphold and 
implement the policy of the party ligachev said 
for teens that upbringing includes a course called military 
preparation in which boys learn how to fire a rifle and maneuver 
in trenches and girls study to be field nurses 
in his speech to the communist party leadership ligachev 
sounded a note of urgency by tying the fate of gorbachevs entire 
campaign for economic and social reform to changes made in soviet 
schools 
the general educational and professional preparation of this 
generation the world outlook and moral values it will acquire on 
this to a large extent depend the future of our country and 
the fate of socialism itself he said

moscow teenager wears a badge of lenin founder of the soviet 
union 
his classmate sports a button of lennon founder of the beatles 
both are students at a school in the flatlands of southwestern 
moscow where yevgeny a yamburg is trying to encourage 
wideranging inquiry and tolerance to help children cope with the 
demands of modern soviet society 
in the threestory hshaped building were yamburg works as 
principal 1500 pupils and 76 teachers meet six days a week in 
split morning and afternoon sessions for the purpose of education 
it is a business that yamburg 37 finds tremendously exciting 
what we are trying to do is launch each child on an individual 
trajectory for his development says the communist party member 
himself a son of teachers children are like barrels some you 
can fill up with just a little bit others are bottomless each is 
different 
middle school no 109 which sits in the middle of apartment 
highrises is a synthesis of the traditional in soviet education 
and of the new possibilities now opening under kremlin reforms 
yamburg says his is just an ordinary school but soviet 
officials brought him to a moscow news conference this year to talk 
about changes needed in education nationwide 
you can go to him with any question and get a sensible 
wellthoughtout answer says tanya litvinov 15 a student at 
yamburgs school he is open to us and to our problems 
one middleaged soviet visitor found school 109 strikingly 
different from the schools he attended as a child most schools 
in this country are like military barracks this one is different 
and you see it right away 
as yamburg lopes through his schools strawberrycolored halls 
children wish him good day and he returns their greeting with a 
smile 
in one classroom 9yearold girls in brown uniforms and white 
lace collars and boys in singlebreasted blue blazers slowly repeat

of russian spelling 
above the blackboard a red sign bearing the image of vladimir i 
lenin proclaims lenin is even now more alive than the living 
up the stairs a classroom of 15yearolds openly disagree about 
the role of josef v stalin in the soviet past 
he had a lot to do with the industrialization and 
collectivization of our country says one blondhaired boy 
some consider him a criminal because he ruined our countrys 
economic system says another 
yamburg relishes the debate 
as someone who started life as a student of history i feel my 
chief task is to form nonconformist minds so that children are 
immune to mass manipulation he tells a visiting reporter as he 
puffs on a vietnamesemade cigarette 
the principal with graying temples also teaches history nine 
hours a week using recent newspaper and magazine articles because 
textbooks have been outpaced by the official criticism now leveled 
at stalin 
yamburg also assigns his students to compare historical accounts 
in pravda izvestia and other soviet newspapers and has discussed 
the strengths and weaknesses of socialism and capitalism with them 
we try to raise children to see all sides of the problem then 
to see the alternatives yamburg says thats our ideal here

the multimillionaire developing key wests 
choicest chunk of land the citys biggestever real estate 
project is beset by a dilemma having clawed his way out of 
poverty he now fears his money will corrupt him 
the habitual creation of wealth for its own sake destroys 
souls frets pritam singh a 35yearold 
hippieturnedcapitalist as he recounts king midas bitter lesson 
i dont want that to happen to me 
singh first dreamed up the 200 million small town hes 
building years ago at a commune where he converted to the sikh 
faith 
the 102acre truman annex property the site of president harry 
trumans beloved little white house winter retreat became a 
ghost town after the navy retired it in 1974 the defunct navy base 
went to public auction in september 1986 
singh paid 17 million for a chance to fulfill his dream of a 
19th centurystyle village of houses and condos where neighbors are 
neighborly 
but thats not all hes accomplishing in this overbuilt city 
where soaring real estate prices have made outoftown developers 
as welcome as hurricanes 
when the annex went to auction city officials feared slick 
outsiders concerned strictly with cash flow would replace historic 
buildings with glitzy condos instead they got singh oddlooking 
with his turban and trademark blue jeans but with a reputation for 
doing highquality historic renovations in new england 
now the former poor boy is on his way to hero status among the 
crusty locals here known as conchs 
singh cultivated the conchs last year by asking them how he 
should develop his land hundreds obliged packing town meetings to 
tell him he used some of the ideas and celebrated his 
developments official opening last year by tossing a 35000 party 
for the locals 
in april 1987 the mayor was among 300 guests at his traditional 
sikh wedding on the little white house lawn this easter he and 
his wife invited local kids for an egg hunt singh dressed as the 
easter bunny and passed out goodies 
singh is building at least 125 affordable housing condos 
priced at under 100000 well below the 225000 to 700000 of 
the 126 other condos resale profits on affordable housing units 
meant for his employees will be capped to keep out speculators 
the first residents should start moving in at the end of this 
year 
besides condos and 61 singlefamily lots singh is also building 
a yacht club marina and artists retreat on sunset island a 
short ferry ride across from his mainland property hes building a 
lagoon and 154room hotel and is importing bahamian sand for a 
beach 
some of the projects of singhs great bay co which was founded 
in 1978 and has offices in portland maine boston and now key 
west include the 11 million inn by the sea in cape elizabeth

the fast sales at the annex dont surprise key west real estate 
agent anthony yaniz who says prices there are par for this city 
about the size of miami international airport 
weve been discovered yaniz says ernest hemingway called 
this place the st tropez of the poor thats no longer true 
condos sell for 60000 to at least 500000 and a concrete block 
house downtown in need of repairs brings about 150000 he says 
ambiance is more important than squeezing in lots of condos say 
singh and his buddy from his commune days stephen josephs now a 
truman annex co vice president 
i knew it was going to be an adventure josephs says and 
pritam and i never gave up this dream of creating a community 
this will be the last major project hell undertake says singh 
whose son was born at home here on his last birthday december 22 
but he says he wont retire 
religion and his terror of being poor are his driving 
factors says john cole a maine writer whose children were 
friends with the developer before his conversion to sikhism whose 
followers all take the surname singh 
in those days singh was paul labombard a french canadian the 
fitchburg mass native is the oldest of four sons his parents 
divorced and remarried each other four times his mother worked at 
a shoe factory 
my family was extremely poor thursday was mustard 
sandwiches for dinner singh says college was not even an 
option 
later the family moved to maine where he attended brunswick 
high school he sometimes stayed with friends such as author 
coles family 
he wasnt a hellraiser in an evil sense says retired vice 
principal jack caldwell who remembers singh well i had to drive 
him home quite often because we often had to suspend him for 
skipping school he hung around with a group that did quite a bit 
of rebelling but he was quite likable 
after graduation singh briefly bummed around in key west and 
then moved to the commune where he met his first wife and converted 
to sikhism 
singh lived for about a year 16 years ago at a sikh commune in 
amherst mass called guru ram dass ashram the sikhs are 
vegetarians and neither smoke nor drink 
singh was reared a catholic but i had a problem with the 
ambiguities of religion i never separated moral justice from 
social justice he rejected buddism as atheistic but liked the 
sikh religion from the start 
sikhism has one god women and men are equal he said in 
1975 he traveled to the sects golden temple in india to see if 
it was real i had a tremendous trip sikhs are real interesting 
people i felt justified in my belief 
what impressed him most in india was the sikhs offering him food 
and lodging no questions asked they didnt ask me for anything 
i couldnt believe it his conversion was sealed 
in 1979 he scraped up 7500 to buy and renovate an apartment 
house from there he developed a shopping center and soon he was 
trying his midas touch on restoring historic buildings now his 
specialty by 1983 his marriage had disintegrated but his thriving 
business had made him a millionaire 
his family lives simply in a renovated conch house on his land 
here diapers dry on the line outside inside hardwood floors are 
covered with scatter rugs and much of the furniture is white 
wicker 
there are no televisions in singhs home because he cant keep 
his hands off them 
everytime i stay in a hotel i turn on the tv theyre like 
voodoo machines 
instead he spends about 1000 a year on books and relaxes at 
his farm in vermont which has a temple waterfall maple sugar 
grove and japanese and english gardens he keeps sheep and llamas 
its the place i do things i dreamed about doing 
key west singh says will be his home even after his 
development is finished probably in two years then the man with 
the midas touch will think about relaxing 
im at a cusp there has to be a balance the question of 
ethical livelihood is the thing im most interested in singh 
says id like to be involved in a way that i dont get eaten

editors note theres no denying that willie bosket showed 
early promise by the time he was 15 he had killed two men for 
the experience as he put it in his postgraduate work bosket 
compiled a record of such violence that hell probably spend the 
rest of his life in prison which is not the best of news to the 
men who staff it 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
willie boskets meals are slipped into 
his box of a prison cell through a slot cut into iron bars 
video cameras monitor his every move 24 hours a day 
when bosket leaves his cell for any reason he must first stick 
his feet through a slot to be manacled and then his hands to be 
cuffed 
three prison guards watch him when he gets his daily hour of 
exercise alone in a small fencedin area the prisoners hands 
and feet remain tied the woodbourne state prison guards keep 
silent under orders not even to talk to bosket 
many people whove come into contact with the 25yearold killer 
think that treatment isnt rigorous enough 
while there may be more infamous inmates in other prisons and 
even in new york state where mark david chapman the murderer of 
john lennon and son of sam killer david berkowitz are doing their 
time no one is feared more within the system than willie bosket 
im a monster the system created bosket told an oneida 
county courtroom last year when sentenced to 25 years to life as a 
persistent felon im a monster thats come back to haunt this 
system and i will dog this system until it is in its grave 
to dick bischert president of the state prison guards union 
bosket is a prime argument for the death penalty that new york 
state does not have 
he probably will kill somebody in the system bischert says 
hopefully it wont be an employee 
the state went to extraordinary lengths to create a special cell 
for bosket after he attacked a security guard on april 16 bosket 
walked up behind earl porter in a shawangunk state prison waiting 
room and wordlessly plunged a homemade knife into the rookie 
guards back says prison system spokesman james flateau a 
newspaper reporter interviewing bosket was watching porter 
survived and bosket faces an attempted murder charge 
it was only the latest entry in a long and violent criminal 
dossier 
bosket grew up in harlem the product of a broken home in a 
perverse twist on an old tradition he began following in the 
footsteps of a father he never knew willie bosket sr graduated 
phi beta kappa from the university of kansas while a federal prison 
inmate and eventually died in an escape attempt 
willie bosket was 10 when first sent to a detention home by the 
time he was 15 he had killed two men in new york city subway 
robberies shooting one in the face after he put up his hands in 
surrender and another in the head when he had only pennies 
bosket said he killed for the experience tried as a 
juvenile for the 1978 killings he was sentenced to five years he 
gloated then that he knew he could have killed 100 people and his 
sentence would have been the same 
amid public outcry the new york legislature changed state law 
to allow juveniles as young as 13 to be tried as adults for murder 
bosket served his time in youth detention facilities where he 
set some kind of a record for ferocity he cracked a guards skull 
with a pipe assaulted two othger employees with a hammer stabbed 
a fellow inmate with a fork despite this he was back on the 
streets in 1983 
the next year he shot and robbed a nearly blind elderly man in 
the subway and was sent to prison for a 3 to 7year term he 
became more intractable than ever before stabbing porter he was 
cited for 26 incidents including nine assaults on the prison 
staff seven times he set his cell on fire 
like most prison guards jeff bowers had already heard the 
stories about willie bosket when he learned bosket was being moved 
to woodbourne 
my family was worried says bowers married and the father 
of three i imagine every family would be worried if you had to 
sit there oneonone and deal with him 
at woodbourne bosket is never left with just one guard 
in november 1986 bosket began kicking and punching a prison 
guard while being taken to court despite shackles at his hands and 
feet he attacked a second guard who came to the aid of his 
colleague bosket had to be carried into the courtroom and later 
that day tried to attack another guard with a razor blade he had 
hidden in his pants 
bosket thrives on attention prison officials say and its 
probably no coincidence that porter was stabbed in full view of 
matthew worth a newspaper reporter who was interviewing bosket for 
a book he planned to write about him 
it was worths last of at least 25 interviews he says he 
conducted after bosket approached him at his trial and suggested 
the book worth said the biography is now on hold 
bosket is intelligent and can be articulate worth says and 
talks a lot about his father and how he wound up in prison the same 
way 
he says he believes the system is largely responsible for his 
behavior and hes now responding to the system the best way he 
knows how and thats through violence worth says 
since porters stabbing authorities have barred any interviews 
with the prisoner bosket wrote to social worker sylvia honig 
asking to circulate a statement that described his condition as 
horrendous 
honig says she worked with bosket at a juvenile detention camp 
after his subway attacks and now is like family to him 
as soon as willie gets to relate to someone hes very nice to 
them she says hes very nice to children hes very 
affectionate hes charming he only hurts people he doesnt know 
bosket was put in his special security cell both to protect 
those around him and the prisoner from himself flateau says 
three adjoining cells were renovated to make boskets quarters one 
was emptied of furniture and equipped with a steel wall with a 
plexiglass window he speaks with the few visitors hes allowed 
through a microphone 
its probably the most secure cell ever made for an inmate 
says bowers

editors note more and more americans keep tabs on their 
health through a great variety of home testing kits they can be 
fine medical authorities say to call attention to symptoms but 
diagnosis finding the root of the problem should be left to 
physicians 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
when an italian known to posterity as sanctorius 
invented the fever thermometer it was a cumbersome waterbased 
device that didnt find much of a market but it was the first step 
toward the inhome testing kit 
the thermometer made its debut in 1626 a few hundred years and 
several eons of technology later its descendants are on the way to 
becoming a billiondollar industry in the united states where 
staying healthy is a leading preoccupation 
today from store shelves across the nation consumers buy kits 
to find their most fertile time of the month check their blood 
pressure or blood sugar levels and screen themselves for possible 
cancer of the colon or rectum 
americans are expected to spend some 616 million this year on 
home testing kits some forecasters believe the figure will rise to 
more than 1 billion a year in the 1990s driven by new 
technologies a doityourself philosophy among consumers and 
cost pressures on hospitals and physicians 
but the government has closed the door at least for now on 
home testing for aids and regulators and medical authorities worry 
about any home test that claims to diagnose a particular disease 
especially an infectious one rather than just detect possible 
symptoms 
since 1977 the food and drug administration has approved more 
than 100 home test kits for sale 
among the most popular kits used in 1 percent of the nations 
homes are those that let diabetics monitor blood sugar in urine or 
blood americans will spend more than 200 million this year for 
those kits or similar tests for urinary tract infection according 
to the new york market research firm of findsvp 
other kits and their expected sales this year include 
devices for testing blood pressure 128 million 
pregnancy and ovulation detection kits 97 million in 1986 
consumers bought 61 million pregnancy test kits and about 500000 
ovulation kits 
tests that indicate blood in the stool a sign of possible 
colon or rectum cancer 43 million 
and the thermometer americans are expected to spend 57 million 
this year on them findsvp says 
medical authorities say home health testing is fine but they 
have some reservations 
the american medical association believes the kits can help by 
involving people in decisions about their own health and getting 
them to doctors sooner if there is trouble says william mcgivney 
the amas director of technology assessment 
but there is concern about diagnostic kits which would be used 
by people who have a symptom and are trying to find out what the 
problem is in this case a false negative result in which the 
test fails to detect the disease could make things worse by 
encouraging the patient to ignore his condition mcgivney says 
tests must be especially accurate if a false negative result 
presents a substantial risk to the user or other people in the 
case of infectious diseases mcgivney says 
the fda shares the concern about such kits said thomas 
tsakeris deputy director of fdas division of clinical and 
laboratory devices in the office of device evaluation 
fda is now reviewing a kit for strep throat that illustrates the 
dilemma he says 
naturally you want to get at that condition and perhaps reach 
a population of infecteds you wouldnt normally reach he says 
but if you have a high incidence of false negatives and the 
condition persists theres a public health risk there because 
the strep bacteria could spread 
fda assesses candidate test kits casebycase looking for a 
clear benefit that overcomes any reasonable risk he says 
no test is always accurate and few tests in the home or 
laboratory are sufficient to diagnose diseases by themselves even 
when they produce an accurate result he says 
if you were to have a test performed in a doctors office 
that test would probably be orderedin light of other medical 
information that the physician would use it would be part of a 
diagnostic examination he says 
those tests are now being offered directly to the public 
without the availability of the other diagnostic information the 
physician would have 
the fda blocked home kits for acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome in april when it essentially forbade kit developers from 
collecting the data necessary for marketing approval fda officials 
had expressed skepticism about home testing for aids because it is 
fatal and because federal guidelines say testing should be 
accompanied by counseling 
in general tsakeris said the fda wants test kits to work as 
accurately in the hands of consumers as they do in the lab almost 
all home use kits are based on tests originally used in clinical 
laboratories he says 
a manufacturer might be able to justify approving a kit with 
lesser performance if it is exquisitely simple deals with a 
substantial health concern and promises to encourage more people to 
seek medical care tsakeris said no approvals have been granted 
yet on that basis 
several factors can reduce the accuracy of home test kits the 
test for blood in the stool for example has so much potential for 
wrong results that a doctor should supervise its use says joann 
schellenbach spokeswoman for the american cancer society 
inaccurate positive or negative readings can occur if a persons 
diet is not adjusted for two days before the test it can give a 
false positive reading if the person has taken a lot of aspirin 
had his teeth cleaned or just eaten a rare steak she said 
such cautions are explained in material accompanying the kits 
but people tend to ignore them she says the instructions are more 
likely to be followed on a doctors advice she says 
in all the cancer society considers the kits of only limited 
use she says and physician exams are the best way to detect early 
colon or rectum cancer 
but the test kits may be valuable when people just wont go to 
the doctor unless the home test gives them reason to she says

new york ap here are some suggestions for using home health 
testing kits 
do not buy or use a kit after its expiration date 
look for and follow any directions on storage such as 
protection from heat cold and sunlight 
read instructions through once to learn what the test can do 
and cannot do then reread them to understand each step 
follow precautions carefully such as those about avoiding 
certain foods drugs or activities 
do not omit any steps in the test procedure if a step must be 
timed use a stopwatch or at least a watch with a second hand 
if any instructions are unclear check the labeling for a 
telephone number to call to get answers or ask a doctor or 
pharmacist 
bloodpressure devices with a dial reading or a digital readout 
should be checked for accuracy by a trained technician at least 
once a year 
before measuring your blood pressure choose a quiet room 
refrain from smoking for at least 30 minutes and rest comfortably 
for about 10 minutes

the first time david selby kissed a girl on 
the stage his schoolmates teased him so relentlessly he almost quit 
acting 
that was in the ninth grade 
it took me a while to get over it says selby who stars in 
the fourhour miniseries king of the olympics the lives and 
loves of avery brundage 
while selby temporarily gave up the theater his faculty adviser 
at the university of west virginia suggested that he enroll in an 
acting course 
i took it and ive never looked back he says it was a 
lifesaver it gave me such an outlook 
selby who has spent a large part of his career on broadway is 
probably best known as richard channing the charming cad on the 
cbs primetime soap opera falcon crest 
in the new miniseries which will be televised on the harmony 
premiere network in two parts between aug 15 and sept 15 on 85 
stations selby has the title role as avery brundage 
brundage devoted more than 50 years to his dream of an olympics 
that was free of political and economic influences he was a 
controversial figure who made some enemies with his combative style 
and autocratic rule as president of the international olympic 
committee 
he participated in the 1912 summer games at stockholm but lost 
in every event to jim thorpe he hoped to participate again in 
1916 but the games were canceled by world war i in 1952 brundage 
became president of the olympics 
the miniseries also reveals that although brundage was married 
he kept a mistress in europe and had two children by her 
they sent me the brundage script and we talked back and 
forth says selby the more i learned about brundage the more i 
admired him and his energy and the way he raised himself up from 
his poor beginning i loved his passion for the olympics it was 
wonderful to play a man with such a strong belief 
we only had four hours so we had to strike a balance between 
the olympics and his personal life his mistress whos still 
alive was interviewed for the series 
brundage became an engineer and builder who put up much of the 
chicago skyline he was a handball champion when he was 60 doctors 
kept telling him he was overworking and he kept saying that other 
doctors who had told him that were all dead 
the series also stars sybil maas as his wife elizabeth renee 
soutendijk as his mistress linnea dresden kristoffer tabori as 
his alcoholic younger brother chester pat starr as his mother

a farm that has been in the family since 1660 
the place was totally selfsufficient he says we raised 
all of our own food had a cherry and apple orchard and a little 
coal mine where we got enough coal to heat the farm an uncle on 
the next farm had a dairy my parents still live in a house in 
morgantown built with timber grown on the farm and made into lumber 
in our own sawmill 
at the university selby became so consumed by acting that at 
one point he quit school to go to new york i had 25 in my 
pocket and the first thing i did was pay 19 for a ticket to the 
sound of music he says i went back to college with my tail 
between my legs 
after graduation he spent eight months with the famous barter 
theater in abbingdon va then nine months at the cleveland 
playhouse 
the barter theater was originally founded on the barter 
system he says one day a girl came and traded two cats for a 
ticket i kept that calico cat for 19 years i named her safronia 
clandon selby 
when he finally moved to new york to stay he not only began to 
get parts on the stage but landed a role as a werewolf in the campy 
soap opera dark shadows 
selby was in such movies as rich and famous up the 
sandbox supercops rich kids and raise the titanic 
i had been commuting to los angeles for years for film roles 
and made the move about five years ago he says i needed to 
change directions i wasnt getting the right film roles one day i 
got a call from lorimar they needed a new character for flamingo 
road i only did a few shows and it was canceled 
by then earl hamner was doing falcon crest i had known him 
from working on the waltons he said i was the only character to

martha clarke has some tips for the audiences 
watching her latest dreamlike some would say nightmarish 
experimental theater production miracolo damore 
it should be looked at the way one listens to music or the way 
one would look at a symbolist or surreal painting or interpreted 
the way one might a streamofconsciousness poem where it is 
highly imagistic and maybe metaphysical says the shows creator 
miracolo damore which has 15 performers played in may at 
the spoleto festival in charleston sc then opened june 14 at 
the offbroadway public theater here most new york performances 
have been sold out 
men wear the white costumes and tall caps of tiepolos 
punchinello drawings at the beginning women are nude and playing 
a circle game denoting innocence their costumes make them look 
like flowers based on sketches by jj grandville there is 
singing and talking in pidgin italian embraces with a skeleton 
loneliness gang rape fighting 
i meant the title the miracle of love ironically miss 
clarke says 
miss clarke is known for experimental theater pieces a 
succession of scenes usually around an hour in length inspired by 
art and culture where theatergoers ideas of what she meant 
vary widely 
miracolo damore is her leastliteral she says and it may 
be her last 
i think its a difficult piece for people she says they 
cant come out being able to say exactly what it is it has to be a 
subjective experience for the viewer because it is an emotional 
work and it is a sad work its kind of a meditation on love gone 
wrong 
the people who dont get it at all are angered by it and 
dismiss it i think it makes them frustrated im afraid i always 
feel in trouble with people looking for literal or intellectual 
ideas in my work 
of the people who like it somewhere it touches a deep 
emotional response in their own minds or dreams people can be open 
to it and not feel they have to understand in a literal sense 
dreams have magic 
the garden of earthly delights in 1984 was miss clarkes 
interpretation of a hieronymous bosch painting of heaven and hell 
it had dancers flying over the audience on wires 
vienna lusthaus in 1986 showed the elegance and decadence 
in which one might see seeds of fascism of vienna at the turn of 
the century 
the hunger artist in 1987 was taken from starvation in franz 
kafkas writings and emotional starvation of his life 
miss clarke started miracolo damore a year and a half ago 
it went in an unpredictable direction she says you never 
know where theyre going till youve gotten there i read a lot of 
italo calvino fairy tales to be inhabited by punchinellos and 
these flower fairies the stories were very dark horrifying funny 
and impossible to translate to stage i gave up on them real 
quickly and new york seemed glutted with fairy tales at the time 
then i just started working with my company in improvising 
themes on primal emotions there are elements of fairytale in it 
but fractured and shattered 
she isnt working on another one i dont want to do this any 
more she says its not a matter of success or failure its a 
matter of my own growth not to stay still and repeat i want to 
explore and direct opera next i want to get into film directing 
specific literal stories im now ready to go linear 
in july she went to london to talk to peter hall about possibly 
doing movement for a coproduction planned by the glyndebourne 
opera festival and the houston grand opera it is a discussion 
not a job at this point she says 
miss clarke studied modern dance at the juilliard school was a 
member of anna sokolows dance company for three years then the 
philobolus dance theater from 1972 to 78 she founded her own 
dance company crowsnest before moving into experimental theater 
she lives in connecticut divorced from sculptor philip 
grausman her son david is 19 and studies jazz composition 
garden probably her bestknown work was revived 
offbroadway in 1987 it has been on tour and will tour again next 
year vienna will tour this fall to spain portugal and france

basil pascali is an informer by profession he lives alone on 
the eastern mediterranean island of nisi an outpost of turkeys 
crumbling ottoman empire 
for years he has earned a small stipend for writing regular 
letters to turkeys sultan reporting news gossip and potential 
dangers to the government to pascalis great distress he never 
receives a reply 
ben kingsley portrays the frustrated spy in pascalis 
island and it is another superior chracterization for him more 
complex and human than his academy awardwinning gandhi 
kinglsey charles dance helen mirrin and a largely british cast 
create a fascinating tale of intrigue and duplicity 
the writerdirector is james dearden who wrote fatal 
attraction he adapted barry unsworths novel with equal skill 
and makes his featurefilm debut as director with pascalis 
island deardon had directed a short film diversions which 
he expanded into fatal attraction 
the film like the novel is told through pascalis eyes he is 
ever alert to newcomers on the island and he offers his services 
to urbane britisher anthony bowles dance who claims to be an 
archeologist pascali soon divines that bowles has other motives 
than searching for ancient artifacts the visitor also has eyes for 
a painter mirrin with whom pascali has secretly been in love for 
years 
the cast of characters is as varied and devious as any since 
john hustons conspirators in the maltese falcon and beat the 
devil everyone has an angle whether it is dance who is 
attempting a confidence scheme the pasha who is looking for 
graft the american who is supplying arms to rebels or the 
german who is seeking to extend his countrys empire 
pascali perceives it all and he sends his impassioned reports 
to the sultan no answer ever the informer pascali finally brings 
a crushing climax to the con mans game it is a violent and 
disconcerting finale inevitable perhaps but jarring 
kingsley continues to amaze with his capacity for assuming the 
skin of his characters dance is perfectly cast as the charming 
scoundrel and miss mirrin is seductive as well as cerebral 
pascalis island was filmed on the greek island of simi and 
on the island of rhodes and their deepblue coasts and winding 
streets are depicted with rare beauty by cinematographer roger 
deakins sid and nancy 
the avenue pictures release was produced by eric fellner the

raw is the technical result of an eddie murphy performance 
at new yorks felt forum and it is aptly titled it seems that 
murphy went to the richard pryor school of comedy and emerged with 
a doctorate in dirtyspeak 
the video opens at a family thanksgiving gathering in the 1960s 
after dinner a few of the youngsters give a talent show for their 
adoring parents eddie the child tells a scatological joke raising 
eyebrows from the grownups and providing a fast seque to 1987 and 
his stage show 
murphys routines are pat and almost formula by now with 
predictable swipes at women marriage sex homosexuals and various 
ethnic groups occasionally hes funny 
he gives a great imitation of bill cosby who allegedly called 
him on the phone one day to tell him that dirty words do not a 
comic make he also does good impersonations of mr t and richard 
pryor 
raw however is strictly for connoisseurs of eddie murphys 
brash narcissism

whos about to get on the college newspaper and hes waiting for a 
scholarship so he can go to cal tech 
everything is as rosy as life can be for bubbly optimistic 
teenagers then darcy becomes pregnant 
rather than go through with an abortion and continue chasing her 
goals darcy molly ringwald decides to have the baby and marry 
stan randall batinkoff 
their idea of marriage though is as idyllic as a tv sitcom 
neither realizes the realities and they face financial tortures

scholarship but decides to turn it down so he can work in a shoe 
store and be a father by the time the baby comes darcy doesnt 
even want to hold it

lot of growing up

good escaping the silliness that usually invades movies about teen 
social problems alvidsen is lean and focuses on the harsh 
realities and the human comic gifts that get most people through a 
crisis 
for keeps is especially good viewing for those teenagers 
who think that having a baby with or without a marriage is a 
nifty idea theyll quickly learn what dicey really means

panther yauarete columbia milton nascimento 
 
milton nascimento has a unique ability to combine primitive 
folklike melodies with sophisticated jazzinspired harmonies the 
result is music of unusual depth and complexity with moods ranging 
from jubilant to mournful 
yauarete contains a diverse collection of nascimentos 
latest compositions it can be listened to either as a showcase of 
those compositions or as the evocative performance of one of 
brazils most moving singers 
on the one hand the freshness and originality of the 11 songs 
on the album attest to nascimentos seemingly inexhaustible 
creative energy and the breadth of his talent meu mestre coracao 
heart is my master a deftly engaging bossa nova follows a 
meditative excursion entitled cidade encantada enchanted city 
cancoes e moments songs and moments is a short repeating 
refrain that nascimento has recently used as a closing number 
during live performances leaving the audience quietly singing it 
as he and the band gradually drift offstage each song on the 
record is different and each reveals another facet of nascimentos 
compositional skill 
even if nascimento hadnt written the songs however this album 
would be remarkable merely for his performances his voice is rough 
but powerful and it is often tinged with a bittersweet longing 
with one exception the songs on yauarete are sung in 
portuguese but the feeling in nascimentos voice carries across 
the language barrier columbia has however printed english 
translations alongside the portuguese lyrics on the albums inner 
sleeve nascimento works closely with several lyricists who 
generally supply the words to go with his music

after winning two consecutive bestactress 
awards from the cannes film festival barbara hershey seems ready 
for what her supporters believe is an overdue nod from the motion 
picture academy 
it could have happened last year as the bayou mother in shy 
people for which she won her first cannes prize but as she 
herself admits nobody saw the picture 
this year hershey was cowinner for her portrayal as the 
antiapartheid activist in a world apart that could be her run 
for an academy award or maybe if the academy voters dare as mary 
magdalene in the last temptation of christ or maybe for a 
comedy role in beaches which she is now filming with bette 
midler 
in any case 1988 appears to be the year of barbara hershey 
she has been in films since her debut in 1968 with doris day in 
with six you get eggroll 
hollywood refused to take her seriously after she became barbara 
seagull during a freeform liaison with david carradine which 
resulted in a son named free still she had a series of 
impressive performances in last summer the baby maker 
box car bertha and the stunt man 
producers began to take notice with the right stuff and 
the natural but her real turning point was woody allens 
hannah and her sisters 
that put me on those terrible lists she remarked referring 
to the film worlds elite of bankable stars all of a sudden 
i was ok to hire 
typical of hershey she continues accepting nonmainstream films 
and devoting excessive time to research them for shy people 
she traveled to the backwater bayous of louisiana and studied the 
cajun speech and lifestyle for a world apart she interviewed 
relatives and friends of ruth first her character in the film 
first a journalist and political activist was imprisoned in 
1963 under south africas 90day detention act the first white 
woman to be so punished the script was written by shawn slovo who 
is portrayed in the film as a 13yearold girl first remained an 
activist in exile and in 1982 was killed by a letter bomb 
she was a great woman but she wasnt an easy woman to those 
around her said the actress at the santa monica canyon home she 
shares with her son now called tom the fascinating thing i 
found in all my interviews was that each person had different views 
of her that confounded me but ultimately liberated me 
i realized sadly that i couldnt please them all i decided to 
take what i thought would say the most she was a complicated 
person and my admiration for her grew and grew 
one of the things i loved about her was that she loved to 
dress even in prison she wanted lipstick over food it was very 
important for her to look elegant and have her hair done contrary 
to our usual views of activists she loved to wear dark glasses 
even working at her typewriter late at night she wore dark 
glasses 
like richard attenboroughs cry freedom a world apart 
was filmed in zimbabwe conditions were primitive but hershey 
didnt complain that fused with what we were doing i kind of 
welcomed the adverse conditions 
the actress is well aware of the growing furor over the last 
temptation of christ which has been attacked by religious 
fundamentalists as being potentially sacrilegious and blasphemous 
i guess it was the greatest experience of my life so far 
hershey said the film meant so much to me and so much to marty 
scorsese like things that mean so much its a little sad to 
talk about i havent seen it but my feelings about it are that it 
must be great simply great 
i read the book by nikos kazantzakis when i was 20 and it 
became my favorite book i was moved as i never had been before 
by the christ story i finally got it to get to make it after all 
these years is really something 
if you dont like the book i dont think youll like the 
film she said all i can say is that i know why we made the 
film we made it not to thumb our noses at anybody or anybodys 
religion quite the opposite we made it because we were moved by 
the book it became a passion for marty i hope other people are 
moved too 
i find it ironic that the fundamentalists would object i find 
it a very tende and moving version of the christ story 
she was born barbara herzst 40 years ago in hollywood her 
family nicknamed her sarah after the great actress sarah 
bernhardt because she was always acting she spent hours before a 
mirror practicing expressions of annette darlene and other 
members of the mickey mouse club 
even before graduation from hollywood high she was appearing in 
such tv series as gidget the monroes and the farmers 
daughter at 20 she played a liberated young woman in last 
summer and she continued the role in her life with carradine 
it has taken a long time to shake that 1970s image but nows 
managed and has caught the industys eye

in one of 10 rooms in the cramped and dreary 
communal apartment a man escapes from his windowless existence in 
a novel way a contraption catapults him into space and freedom 
the apartment is a piece of art based on the moscow flat in 
which artist ilya kabakov grew up but it has no soviet address 
instead these fullscale rooms were built in an art gallery in 
new yorks soho section and to some the fact that kabakovs art 
reached america at all is every bit as remarkable as the device 
that propelled his character the man who flew into space 
under glasnost all of a sudden you can buy this work out 
of the soviet union said ronald feldman whose gallery after a 
decade of trying recently exhibited the kabakov installation 
entitled ten characters 
i think that this change cannot be underestimated they the 
soviet government do it for several reasons they do it to earn 
hard currency but at the same time they obviously are learning not 
to be afraid of their own intelligentsia of their own creative 
people 
in the united states where interest in things soviet is 
growing art dealers are leaping at the chance to show and market 
soviet art rarely seen outside the artists studios let alone 
outside their country 
under the leadership of mikhail gorbachev the soviet union is 
no longer making a clear distinction between official artists 
who bow to socialist realisms glorification of state and worker 
and unofficial artists such as kabakov who dont 
until recently western art dealers had to rely on smuggling and 
gifts to bring nonconformist art from the soviet union to their 
galleries said todd bludeau of sovart a private firm that 
promotes soviet artists in the united states now dealers negotiate 
directly with soviet officials to launch exhibits 
in putting together the kabakov exhibition feldman said he 
dealt with the soviet ministries of trade and culture the price of 
each work of art to be sold in the west is negotiated with the 
government 
if a painting sells for 10000 about 4000 goes to the 
gallery and 6000 to the artist of which the government takes 
3000 feldman explained but before the state remits an artists 
3000 share the money is changed into rubles at the low official 
rate 
a few blocks north of feldmans gallery the eduard nakhamkin 
gallery has exhibited the works of soviet artists vladimir 
yankilevsky and viatcheslav kalinin the phyllis kind gallery plans 
a soviet exhibition this fall 
kabakovs work ranges from 50000 to 100000 for one of his 
rooms most of kalinins paintings have sold for at least 30000 
yankilevskys work ranges from 2000 for an etching to about 
80000 for a painting 
although soviet nonconformist art is being actively sought by 
dealers collectors and museums in the west it is still gathering 
dust in the soviet union artists such as kabakov who supports 
himself as an illustrator in moscow have few opportunities to 
exhibit and sell their work there 
the russian ministry of culture doesnt mind for them to be 
exhibited outside and be successful but still very cautious 
inside russia said nakhamkin a soviet emigre who came to the 
united states 13 years ago and now owns five galleries in new york 
and california 
even inside the soviet union however change is in the offing 
kabakov and yankilevsky were among the contemporary soviet 
artists whose work was recently sold by sothebys at the first 
international art auction in moscow since 1917 foreigners spent 
more than 3 million at the sale 
in addition to 100 works by 29 living artists 18 paintings by 
five artists from the russian avantgarde period of 191040 were on 
the block alexander rodchenkos 1920 painting line topped 
the bidding at 567000 grisha bruskins 1986 work fundamental 
lexicon was sold for 416000 
works of the russian avantgarde also will be featured at an 
exhibition at the russian museum in leningrad in the fall much of 
the art has been kept from public view since 1932 when soviet 
officials decreed it was alien to the nations cultural goals 
in the spirit of glasnost a catalog of the exhibition 
entitled soviet art 19201930 from the russian museum 
leningrad is being copublished by harry n abrams inc and 
sovietsky khudozhnik the soviet publishing house for artists 
included in the exhibition and book are the works of kasimir 
malevich wassily kandinsky alexander rodchenko pavel filonov and 
vladimir tatlin 
loneliness and alienation are common themes in the art emerging 
from the soviet union ten characters is about little men 
and the contrast between their boring and cold outer world and 
their very intensive very colorful inner life said kabakov 
54 through his friend and interpreter gregory perkel an artist 
who emigrated from moscow 10 years ago 
each of the 10 rooms of the communal apartment is home to a 
different fictive character the room occupied by the man who 
never threw anything away is filled with carefully cataloged bits 
of trash 
theres also the collectors room where the walls are decorated 
with an array of colorful postcards and the short mans room which 
has a labyrinth of kneehigh drawings across the floor 
through his characters quirky passions documented by the 
objects in their rooms and a text which accompanies the 
installation the artist reveals humor passion and color even 
beauty 
kabakov insists that the installation is not about life in the 
soviet union but is a metaphor for human experience in general 
differences between the outer world and inner world exist in all 
social systems he said 
however when perkel first saw the room with the catapult he 
thought i cant stay there in that room particularly in that 
country i have to get out of that room so thats the reason im 
here i emigrated 10 years ago i just catapulted myself to the 
united states 
at the other end of the soviet art spectrum is kalinin 50 who 
considers himself a follower of the realist painting of the moscow 
school 
he distorts the natural into absurdity and caricature and dubs 
it fantastic realism an unsympathetic feeling pervades his 
work which features alcohol guns cardplaying wrinkled faces 
and abandoned buildings 
official people dont like my art because i show the 
unpleasant side of life in russia he said as nakhamkin 
interpreted for him but he added that he did not believe his work 
was negative 
the western romance with soviet art is in full swing feldman 
said but its duration is unknown but he noted the only thing 
that will last is good art

give kenny loggins a movie and hell give you a 
hit tune 
since splitting with partner jim messina in 1976 so both could 
pursue solo careers loggins has found success in songs for movies 
hes touted by columbia records publicity as the only male 
solo artist to have achieved three top 10 singles from three 
different films 
the songs are im alright from caddyshack in 1980 the 
title song of footloose in 1984 and danger zone from top 
gun in 1986 
his new single nobodys fool from caddyshack ii is in 
the top 40 and heading toward becoming his fourth top 10 from a 
film loggins new album back to avalon is his first in three 
years 
loggins talked about his new album and career in an interview 
before beginning an american tour which will keep him on the road 
through oct 9 
here are highlights of that interview 
q why is back to avalon your first solo album in three 
years 
a i was asking myself that the other day i guess time just 
sort of swept by i wrote and recorded more songs for this album 
than the 10 or 11 i normally do i recorded 16 or 17 
i had a third child a little girl 8 months old whose brothers 
are 7 and 6 weve been building a home in santa barbara calif 
for those whove built homes they know that can be consuming 
and during that period i had two soundtrack songs meet me 
half way in over the top and danger zone in top gun 
q is back to avalon about catalina island 
a no avalons a mythical place which has to do with king 
arthurs court the song isnt about king arthurs court its 
about a relationship that has been together awhile and started to 
drift apart the singer refers to the way love used to be as 
avalon theyve got one last try to regain that feel of avalon 
q do they 
a i have no idea its as if it was a scene of a movie you 
only get to see the one scene you dont get to see the resolution 
quite often i get a visual idea and what i try to do is describe 
the scene and the emotion behind the scene which is probably why i 
enjoy doing the soundtrack thing so much they deliver up a scene 
for me and i try to find the emotion behind the scene and write the 
song to it 
q have you always written that way 
a yes theres always a moment in time that you freeze and you 
try to describe best that single emotion in that single moment 
q what has been your most successful emotion behind a scene 
song 
a possibly forever a hit of mine a couple of years ago or 
back to avalon i like to think my writing gets better as i get 
older 
q are there disadvantages to being identified with movie songs 
a i dont think there is any stigma to singing movie songs the 
only thing i would worry about would be that radio would say 
were not going to play this any more so far theyre behind 
me thats all that matters i figure as long as its a good song 
theyll play it 
i dont think ive compromised my writing to do it ive been 
very fortunate that ive had such luck with it 
q can a hit song only come from a hit movie 
a i had a hit record meet me half way from a dog movie 
sly stallones over the top 
q have you had any movie songs that didnt work out 
a i told the two guys doing flashdance that i didnt have 
time to write and record for it i was on the road within a few 
days of being on the road i fell off a stage in utah and broke a 
couple of ribs i was sent home during the recuperation i tried 
to put together a song for flashdance they liked it i felt it 
wasnt good enough and i pulled it not realizing the movie was 
going to be one of the biggest summer movies in history 
q does your success with movie songs bring you lots of offers 
a i expected once you had a few hits theyd come looking for 
you but for the most part you have to search them out when i hear 
about a project that has got a buzz on it ill have my manager 
make some calls and see if theyre interested in music and if i can 
get in to see a screening 
q how did you start with movie songs 
a i wrote i believe in love which barbra streisand sang in 
a star is born and met jon peters streisands former 
companion who was producing jon called me for caddyshack 
they needed a theme song i watched a rough cut laughed a lot and 
wanted to be a part of it within a couple of days id written 
im alright 
but i wasnt so sure when he called about caddyshack ii i 
was a little skittish about trusting lightning to strike twice in 
the same place 
q have you written all the movie songs youve recorded 
a danger zone and meet me half way were both written by 
georgio moroder the footloose script was written by a friend 
of mine lyricist dean pitchford we wrote footloose and im 
free together which were in the movie he went on to collaborate 
on all the songs in the movie 
q what were your thoughts when you turned 40 this year 
a you mean about suicide i was a little depressed for a few 
days when youre in rock n roll you dont expect to turn 40

there are no sure things in bobbie ann masons 
stories just endless possibilities 
i think in terms of possibility its part of my heritage 
said mason whose second novel is called spence lila harper 
and row 1295 
spence and lila culpepper are a couple in their 60s who live on 
a farm in western kentucky they are brought together with their 
three children nancy catherine and lee when lila is diagnosed as 
having breast cancer and must undergo surgery 
mason a native of western kentucky contrasts the lives of 
spence and lila who have spent most of their lives on the farm to 
those of the children who have moved away 
its a very confusing time for people of that the childrens 
generation the author said theyre subject to so many 
influences and problems because of all the choices they can get 
divorced their parents couldnt do that so many influences so 
much more money 
while the children move around the country trying to find 
themselves spence is perfectly happy to stay on the farm 
theres a passage where spence is looking around the farm and 
thinking that everyone is breaking their necks trying to get 
something grand mason said for spence its right here on 
the farm the basic facts of the universe are here birth growth 
and death 
it is extraordinary to plant soy beans and harvest them 
mason born in 1940 can relate well to the culpepper children 
she grew up on a dairy farm near mayfield ky and was the first 
member of her family to go college taking journalism classes at 
the university of kentucky 
she has also done her share of moving after college she lived 
in new york and went to graduate school at the state university in 
binghamton ny and the uny 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
ty of connecticut she now lives 
with her husband in rural pennsylvania 
masons independence and thirst for adventure was inspired by 
the movies her parents took her to see as a child 
they saw movies but they didnt have the sense that they 
could just take off and go to california and go where the movies 
are she said it seemed possible for me to go out there 
the radio also had an impact on the author 
i first listened to rhythm and blues in the late 40s and 
early 50s mason recalled that struck a very deep chord in me 
one of those formative things i certainly had the longing and 
curiosity and wanting to experience new things 
thats why i have spence as a rock n roll fan 
masons first story was published in 1980 two years later she 
released shiloh a collection of short stories that won the 
penernest hemingway award for first fiction 
in 1985 she came out with her first novel in country the 
story of sam hughes a teenager trying to learn more about her 
late father a vietnam soldier killed before she was born 
in country was a best seller a film adaptation starring 
the english actress emily lloyd as sam and bruce willis as her 
uncle is in progess 
mason writes sparely leaving much of the interpretation to the 
reader she has been compared to such contemporary writers as ann 
beattie and raymond carver who have been called minimalists 
while mason admires carver and beattie she rejects the idea of 
consciously emulating them 
one doesnt like to identify with labels that means that you 
agree that youre part of a movement she said thats just me 
i think in a certain decade lots of people are going to sound 
similar 
describing lilas thoughts the night before her operation mason 
uses short almost telegraphic sentences 
lila cant sleep random scenes pass before her eyes the 
strong comfortable smells of cows in the barn waiting to be 
milked the steamy air in winter gathering in tomatoes before a 
frost sprinkling lime on the potatoes spread out on the ground in 
a stall of the barn laying the onions on screendoor racks above 
mason notes that the real meaning of her stories can be learned 
from the pacing of her writing rather than the words themselves 
hardly anybody points out those things the sentence rhythms 
mean everything because they create the tone and the voice and the 
characters 
for spence lila mason sought to create a delicate mood 
i wanted it be very calm and reflective and tender and deep 
to go way inside its a love story thats why she put a plus 
symbol in the title 
after lilas surgery she and spence return to the farm the 
books ends with this passage in the garden of spence observing lila 
the way she laughs is the moment he has been waiting for she 
rears her head back and laughs steadily her throat working and her 
eyes flashing her throat catches her finally and slows her down 
but her face dances like pond water in the rain all unsettled and 
stirring with aroused possibility 
somebody said to me that the word possibility is the key 
mason said of the ending possibility is what there is

singersongwriter randy vanwarmer is 
counting on the emotional edge of his new album to stem a nineyear 
slide since his millionselling hit just when i needed you most 
the 33yearold vanwarmer has just released i am a 
collection of soft country ballads with romantic titles such as i 
will hold youthats what your smile does for me and words 
i never meant its his first album in four years 
theres something spiritual about the record vanwarmer said 
in an interview its kind of like gathering your family around 
the fireplace 
as a marketing exercise however it has been a disaster 
instead of vanwarmers its a heartache a tune by popjazz 
singer michael franks the camera never lies was distributed 
erroneously with vanwarmers name printed on it 
the mistake was repeated during a second round of distribution 
so record company officials gave up on the song and will switch to 
another one where the rocky mountains touch the morning sun 
the radio stations kept calling and saying we like randys 
record but hes not country enough for our station vanwarmer 
said 
his record is kind of jazz funky but we have similar 
textured voices i can almost understand why they almost thought it 
was me 
his tough luck continues a pattern since his powerful just 
when i needed you most propelled him from obscurity in 1979 
instead of establishing himself as a ballad singer he followed 
up with an uptempo tune titled gotta get out of here 
it did terribly vanwarmer recalled 
more than half a dozen singles were released subsequently but 
none was a hit on the advice of others he declined to do american 
concert tours that would have built up his name and following a 
possible tour with anne murray was bypassed 
furthermore his record company wound down and i dont think 
they were putting the money behind the records that they needed 
to he said 
i dont blame anybody he said about the downfall maybe 
if i had been more knowledgeable 
we had one solid record and then we wanted to change 
direction something with a little more edge i wanted to do it 
that was just naivete my first record seemed so easy i do ballads 
best we could have done another ballad but we put out an uptempo 
thing 
though he failed to capitalize on the success of just when i 
needed you most he says his royalties from writing the hit paid 
the bills for six years 
his breakup with his girlfriend inspired the song 
that was kind of devastating he recalled six months later 
he sat down and put the song on paper 
i found that those kind of songs the deepest ones come some 
time after an event youre too traumatized at the time when 
someone leaves you just dont go sit down and write a song if you 
did youd almost wish bad things would happen to you 
he said the song was a hit because listeners related to a lament 
over a broken romance its happened to everyone that emotion is 
universal some people like to feel sorry for themselves he said 
i always hoped the record wasnt wallowing in self pity and it 
had some redeeming value and i guess it does 
a footnote about the song is that john sebastian of the rock 
group lovin spoonful played autoharp on the record 
to me it was one of the things that sold the record 
vanwarmer said 
in 1980 he wrote the song it never hurts to hurt sometimes 
which later became a no 1 hit for the oak ridge boys 
the song triggered by the death of his father 13 years earlier 
made its way to the charts in an unusual fashion the song got into 
the hands of oak ridge boys record producer ron chancey whose 
wife fell in love with it after hearing it on a demonstration tape 
it was then recorded by the group as a favor to her vanwarmer said 
one perk of being a songwriter is exorcising your feelings as 
they come along he said and people can exorcise theirs as 
they listen too 
he wrote it on christmas eve as he sat alone at home before 
gathering with family members 
it was emotion from the heart it wrote itself

the first word came in a japanese financial 
newspaper in january hiroshi maeda of the university of tokyo had 
found a superconductor that broke all previous temperature records 
while legions of physicists struggled to decipher the japanese 
and to duplicate maedas feat two newcomers at the university of 
arkansas announced they had smashed his record 
a few days later ibm scientists fiddling with the arkansas 
superconductor in san jose calif hit a hightemperature mark 
that still stands 
all the pandemonium began with the january 1986 discovery by two 
ibm scientists in zurich switzerland that a complicated mixture 
of lanthanum barium copper and oxygen could carry electricity 
with no resistance at 396 degrees below zero fahrenheit 
in the exotic landscape of physics that was terribly warm 
before the zurich oxide as its sometimes called 
superconductors worked only at temperatures colder than minus 418 
degrees about 42 degrees above absolute zero 
the ibm discovery impressed the stockholm crowd the scientists 
k alex mueller and j georg bednorz received the 1987 nobel prize 
one of the fastest on record 
superconductivity almost seems to violate natures laws when 
electricity passes through ordinary conductors some is inevitably 
converted into heat sometimes a lot of it as in your toaster 
but not in superconductors they carry electricity with no 
resistance and no heat loss none 
thats more than a scientists idea of a parlor trick these 
brittle ceramic metals could lead to zeroresistance electric power 
lines exotic energy storage devices and other wonders and no 
story on superconductivity would be complete without a mention of 
superfast trains magnetically levitated over superconducting rails 
the truth is no one is quite sure where and when 
superconductors will turn up outside physics labs economists may 
be better forecasters than physicists 
maglev trains might work in lab tests but who will pay to 
build them are utilities going to rip out serviceable power lines 
to put up superconductors not if they have to double or triple 
your electric bill to pay for it 
president reagan told a conference last year there are 
predictions of highspeed trains levitated above their tracks 
supercomputers on a single silicon chip cheaper and more effective 
medical imaging devices 
reagan said its our business to discover ways to turn our 
dreams into history as soon as possible but he wont foot the 
bill either the national science foundation budget for 
condensedmatter physics which includes superconductivity is 
372 million this year up just 05 percent 
such worldly concerns aside physicists are silly with 
excitement 
somebody described scientists like pigeons said brian 
schwartz a physicist at brooklyn college of the city university of 
new york you throw bread here and everybody pecks here then you 
throw bread over there and everybody pecks there 
the record holders are the ibm researchers led by paul grant 
who pushed the threshhold to 234 degrees below zero fahrenheit 
grant and company surpassed the report by maeda of 
superconductivity onset at minus 243 degrees maeda started with 
copper oxide or copper and oxygen the common denominators in 
nearly all the new superconductors and added bismuth strontium 
and calcium 
earlier compounds had contained yttrium instead of bismuth 
physicists soon were wearing buttons that read sell yttrium buy 
bismuth 
the last 18 months have been the most exciting in my life 
grant said at the march meeting of the american physical society in 
new orleans a year after the socalled woodstock of physics in 
new york 
that was when most physicists got their first reports on the new 
superconductors that was a onceinalifetime event it was 
incredible incredible what else can i say said grant echoing 
others who were there 
a woodstock ii session was held this year with late reports 
on the superconductors discovered in tokyo and arkansas 
one of the stars was arkansas allen hermann he and zhengzhi 
sheng discovered the thalliumbariumcopperoxygen superconductor 
to which they later added calcium that holds the high temperature 
record set by grant 
hermann and sheng reported superconductivity at minus 238 
degrees earning them a momentary record until grant pushed their 
compound further they since have matched his mark 
how high the temperature record will go is anybodys guess 
scattered reports of superconductivity at room temperature havent 
been confirmed but many researchers believe roomtemperature 
superconductivity may be possible 
not all the action is in the glamorous search for new 
superconductors and the race for higher temperatures however 
theorists the armchair physicists whose job is to think not to 
concoct think they are beginning to understand how the new 
superconductors work 
the key seems to be the arrangement of the copper oxide 
electron microscopes have shown that the copper and oxygen atoms 
arrange themselves in planes the other elements serve as spacers 
sandwiched between the planes 
in some compounds each plane is separated from its neighbors 
in others the planes are paired and in the newest the planes occur 
in threes 
the more planes the higher the temperature at which 
superconductivity occurs at the moment thats a mere observation 
if we can go to four layers we should be able to go to higher 
transition temperatures said robert hazen of the geophysical 
laboratory of the carnegie institution of washington dc 
the next question to be addressed is why it should be so but 
physicists at last have a direction to go thats more than hunch 
which is how they got where they are anyone can do it melt a few 
elements together let the stew harden cool it to frigid 
temperatures and see what happens 
hazen calls that shake and bake science or cook and 
look 
of course not everything is as simple as stacking planes just 
when physicists had become comfortable thinking about planes a 
superconductor with no stacked planes was discovered the mixture 
of potassium barium bismuth and oxygen became superconducting at 
about 406 degrees below zero according to its discoverers at 
atampts bell laboratories 
its not a contender in the hightemperature race but paul 
fleury one of the discoverers said theres a whole new 
ballfield thats opened up now 
on another ballfield stuart wolf of the naval research 
laboratory in washington dc has produced a 
lanthanumcopperoxygen superconductor with a simpler structure 
but similar to the other coppercontaining superconductors 
its a kind of superconductor building block and wolf believes 
its a contender he thinks it could go superconducting at higher 
temperatures than hermanns thallium mix and hes out to prove it 
his first tests show superconductivity at minus 280 degrees 
fahrenheit but hes betting he can reach a toasty 100 degrees 
below zero 
there is a catch wolfs simple superconductor isnt simple to 
make it must be cooked at 2700 degrees fahrenheit and squeezed at 
65000 times normal atmospheric pressure fortunately for wolf 
once the material is made it can be cooled and studied at normal 
temperatures and pressures 
natures been kind its done something we never expected 
said schwartz we never thought wed be operating at these 
temperatures in our lifetime or ever

richard pressingers troubles began when 
he was teaching in a portable classroom built with particle board 
his chest hurt he couldnt concentrate and he was depressed he 
had frequent colds and an abnormally low whiteblood cell count 
indicating liver malfunction doctors couldnt determine a cause 
for his symptoms 
pressingers suffering became so intense he finally left his 
girlfriend and gave up his job he joined the peace corps and went 
to teach in jamaica but had to leave after a year because the 
ministry of education began using a strong pesticide in the 
classrooms in which he taught 
suspecting sensitivity to chemicals he began sleeping on a 
beach to escape the smells of pesticides disinfectants paint and 
even perfume 
pressinger 33 is one of a growing number of people who believe 
they are severely allergic to chemicals victims of environmental 
illness 
doctors however cant agree on what is causing symptoms that 
have led some sufferers to seek a toxic free environment by 
giving up their jobs and moving to the desert or even going so far 
as to seal their rooms with aluminum foil linings 
much of what is attributed to environmental factors can only 
be theorized says dr phillip lieberman a memphis tenn 
clinical allergist and president of the american academy of allergy 
and immunology so there is great controversy as to whether the 
precepts of the physicians practicing environmental medicine are 
valid at this time 
the burden of proof belongs on the physicians practicing the 
specialty lieberman says 
dr william rae a cardiovascular surgeon who also specializes 
in clinical ecology says nothing is 100 percent proven but 
most of the debate occurs out of ignorance its a scapegoat for 
not looking into it critically 
rae contends that 10 percent to 20 percent of the population 
suffers from such sensitivity his clinic in dallas says it has 
treated 17000 people for environmental illness in the past dozen 
years 
some of them are sensitive to formaldehyde in particle board 
paneling and rugs others to food or gasoline even the smell of 
deodorant vehicle exhaust newsprint clothes bedding and other 
everyday substances can cause reactions 
pressinger lives at his mothers home here doing everything he 
can to avoid contact with chemicals he believes his only real 
escape is a secluded uninhabited island he has checked out 
properties in florida north carolina and tennessee and now is 
trying to get enough sufferers together to buy an island in the 
bahamas which is untainted by pollution 
the island hes found is 2 miles long and a halfmile wide 
about 5 miles from abaco island its asking price is 4 million and 
pressinger says it could be subdivided for sale just to sufferers 
of chemically caused illnesses 
this type of arrangement would allow complete control of the 
surroundings without the risk of unexpected chemical exposures 
weve got to find someplace its not a matter of if but when 
fred nelson who heads the national foundation for the 
chemically hypersensitive in wrightsville beach nc says the 
group is interested in a chemicalfree environment we feel the 
need is for an inexpensive longterm rehabilitation oasis for the 
environmentally ill and their families 
pressinger also has taken his idea to the chicagobased human 
ecology action league which publishes a magazine runs educational 
campaigns about the problem and helps sufferers find treatment rae 
is one of its directors 
in the beginning i thought i was the only one that had such 
problems says pressinger the initial reaction of doctors is 
that its a psychological problem its a complex illness that is 
little understood even by physicians 
there are many people out there who have it and dont even 
know it

ranchers say prairie dogs dont live up 
to that cutesounding name prairie rodents is more like it they 
grumble of the furry animals that chomp grass and boobytrap 
pastures with their burrows 
zoologist john hoogland admits the critters cause problems but 
says theyre basically misunderstood much of what he says flies in 
the face of lore 
prairie dogs will expand unless they are controlled said 
verne brakke director of regulatory services for the state 
agriculture department 
not so said hoogland in fact in a behavior pattern observed 
in fewer than a dozen other species prairie dog mothers leave 
their own pups unguarded to enter the burrows of female relatives 
where they kill and eat the babies 
the implications of this are enormous he said there 
seems to be a system in which the prairie dogs are controlling 
themselves 
hoogland of the university of maryland has been watching 
prairie dogs in one colony in wind cave national park since 1975 
and the population has stayed around 150 that colony has not 
expanded 1 inch he said 
the killings at first went unnoticed because they occurred in 
burrows then hoogland noticed that females visiting other burrows 
would emerge with blood on their fur the evidence was uncovered 
when a burrow was excavated 
fiftyone percent of all litters are killed by infanticide 
he said adding that the common perpetrator is a female relative 
though in a few cases the mother turns on her own litter litters 
average two to three pups 
the leading candidate is that they are doing it for food he 
said i have never seen them eat any other meat 
maybe in other colonies there are certain things we could do 
to make the prairie dogs control themselves 
ranchers wont shed tears over the deaths of prairie dog pups 
since the 1800s when pioneers and their cattle moved west its 
been war 
back in the early 1900s at one point the us government hired 
125000 people whose only job was to eradicate prairie dogs 
hoogland said 
those efforts continue today in states like south dakota 
wyoming montana nebraska and colorado said brakke most states 
have animal damage offices but antiprairie dog efforts are not 
coordinated from state to state 
south dakota had 800000 acres of prairie dog towns in 1980 
today that is down to 250000 to 300000 brakke said no figures 
are available on the amount of land infested nationwide but 
millions of acres are involved he said 
they are a rodent we give them kind of a cute and furry 
little attribute so we call them prairie dogs if we called them 
prairie rats or prairie rodents there wouldnt be that 
connotation he said 
i grew up with a dislike a distaste and an aboslute hate for 
prairie dogs said state agriculture secretary marvis hogen 
the bread of life in south dakota is grass and those little 
buggers eat grass and the second thing is they make holes that 
your horse can step in and break his leg 
hoogland said its hard to find examples of that and added 
everybody hates prairie dogs but almost nothing was known about 
them ranchers say look what theyve done to my land but 
theres a lot of evidence that prairie dogs move into areas that 
have already been overgrazed 
im not saying theres no competition with livestock but im 
saying all the evidence isnt in yet two hundred years ago there 
were jillions of prairie dogs and jillions of buffalo so they 
could coexist

the first word came in january hiroshi maeda 
in tokyo had found a superconductor that broke all previous 
temperature records 
while legions of physicists struggled to duplicate maedas feat 
newcomers allen hermann and zhengzhi sheng at the university of 
arkansas topped it 
a few days later ibm scientists fiddling with the arkansas 
superconductor in san jose calif hit a hightemperature mark 
that still stands 
all the pandemonium began with the january 1986 discovery by two 
ibm scientists in switzerland that a mix of lanthanum barium 
copper and oxygen could carry electricity with no resistance at 
minus 296 degrees fahrenheit the discovery won k alex mueller and

forget about mice researchers here are 
working on a better lobster trap one that lets the lobsters 
escape 
prompted by what they say are the needless deaths of 200000 
lobsters a year when wooden traps break free of buoys and the 
lobsters starve chemists at stevens institute of technology are 
trying out biodegradable plastic 
they have buried 16 plastic compounds in the seabed along the 
atlantic coast and will study the compounds this month says ken 
gonsolves a chemical engineer at stevens polymer processing 
institute 
the aim is to replace one or two of the slats in traditional 
traps with plastic that would deteriorate within a few months 
letting lobsters break out gonsolves said wood traps take a year 
or more to deteriorate underwater 
stevens is working with the new jersey maritime sciences 
consortium an alliance of midatlantic and new england colleges 
under a 187000 grant from the national oceanographic and 
atmospheric administration 
shrinking harvests could make lobstermen change to the escapable 
traps as a way to save future stocks says william gordon of the 
maritime consortium 
gonsolves suggested that the technology could also be applied to 
fishing and trawling nets which continue to trap fish and sea 
mammals after they are lost at sea

physicists who want to study the 
rotation of atoms hope to make them stand still by turning a lab in 
the sunshine state into the coldest spot in the universe 
the university of floridas microkelvin research lab will open 
in the early fall and physicist gary ihas said it is designed 
to take matter closer to absolute zero than it has ever been 
before well be able to get to within onemillionth of a degree of 
absolute zero to one microkelvin 
absolute zero the theoretical point at which even the atoms in 
matter stop moving around is minus 45967 degrees fahrenheit or 
zero on the kelvin scale 
the coldest temperature in the universe in the empty space 
betweeen galaxies is about 3 degrees kelvin so this will be 
roughly 3 million times colder than that ihas said 
at extremely low temperatures atoms slow to such an extent 
that you can look at very small interactions you can study the 
motion between the particles themselves ihas said looking at 
things in that way allows you to understand the laws of physics in 
basic deeper ways 
the lab supported by a 13 million national science foundation 
grant and private funds consists of three 41footdeep pits to 
house cryostats shielded refrigeration units footsteps can raise 
temperatures 500 microkelvin so huge shock absorbers will isolate 
the cryostats and an electromagnetic shield will deflect radio 
waves and other electrical disturbances 
the labs chief purpose is research but ihas said there are 
always spinoffs that are unpredictable not because we understand 
the new physics and apply it but because we stumble on to 
something because of serendipity 
one problem he said will be that since no one has really 
been this cold we dont know what kind of thermometer is going to 
work

thirteen years after the 
grizzly bear was declared to be a threatened species its 
population in the yellowstone area now is growing according to a 
task force of scientists 
the scientists said they cant pinpoint the number of grizzlies 
because the ecosystem comprises 9600 very rugged square miles but 
there were at least 45 adult females in 1985 up from 32 in 1983 
they figure 170 to 180 bears lived in the area and the population 
is growing 007 percent to 15 percent a year 
this increase is partially a result of grizzly bear management 
programs said the task force appointed by the interagency 
grizzly bear committee it cited the increase as cause for cautious 
optimism noting the recovery and survival of the grizzly bear in 
the yellowstone ecosystem will require continued careful 
management 
the grizzly bear has been protected since 1975 under the federal 
endangered species act

the investment firm forstmann little amp co is 
taking pullman co private in a buyout it values at about 650 
million having convinced the company to drop a managementled 
buyout plan 
forstmann little which specializes in leveraged buyouts 
announced sunday pullman had agreed to a buyout at 925 cash per 
share for its 419 million outstanding shares or about 38757 
million 
assumption of existing debt and expenses will make the total 
price of the buyout about 650 million forstmann little stated 
the buyout was conditioned on pullman terminating its earlier 
agreement for a 775 per share buyout by a group led by thomas m 
begel the companys chairman and chief executive and henley 
manufacturing corp pullmans biggest shareholder with 9 percent 
of the companys outstanding shares 
pullman stock closed unchanged at 9 a share friday on the new 
york stock exchange 
i am pleased that pullmans stockholders will get the benefit 
of the 925 transaction price and am confident that by being one 
of the forstmann little group of companies new opportunities will 
be provided for pullmans employees begel said in a news release 
pullman based in princeton nj is a diversified manufacturer 
of industrial and engineered component products including truck 
trailers aircraft seating food service equipment weapons systems 
components refuse disposal equipment and fluid handling systems 
the acquisition of pullman is an opportunity for forstmann 
little to purchase a wellmanaged diverse group of industrial 
businesses which have strong niche market positions said 
nicholas c forstmann a general partner of forstmann little 
in a leveraged buyout a company is acquired mainly with 
borrowed funds that are repaid with money raised by the target 
companys cash flow or the sale of its assets

the stock market will be ready for a major fall 
similar to the one in october if interest rates go any higher 
according to a georgia institute of technology professor 
it looks in a sense like 88 may be a replay of 87 as it 
relates to the stock market said fred c allvine a management 
professor who based his forecast on computer analyses of the 
economy 
with factories operating near capacity and unemployment at a 
14year low you see the possibility of inflation breaking out 
all over the genie getting out of the bottle said allvine who 
has headed georgia techs stock marketing forecasting project for 
nine years 
four of georgia techs five market computer analyses have 
reached a negative threshold which has been associated with 
ultimate downturns on the market allvine said 
last year the economy was running very strong there were 
inflationary concerns and the fed federal reserve was compelled 
to hold a steady course on liquidity which ultimately led to the 
very speculative stock market he said 
our numbers on our fed models are showing that both the 
shortterm and longterm interest rates are becoming very close 
to where they were a year ago at this time allvine said 
the fed is snugging up in terms of its action to see that the 
economy does not run away he said if this does not work and 
interest rates continue to rise there could be another crumble in 
the stock market 
inflation has been a major concern of the fed which tries to 
keep the economy stable by manipulating the supply of money in 
circulation 
the gloomy analysis is based on the fact short term rates are 
higher with the federal funds rate the interest for overnight 
borrowing by banks as high as it was on oct 19 the day of the 
crash allvine said 
the fed funds rate which stood at 7625 percent when the market 
collapsed was quoted at just over 775 percent on friday 
other interest rates are up sharply from the beginning of the 
year and some are higher than at the time of the crash allvine 
said 
in 1987 the prime rate rose from 775 percent in march to 925 
percent two weeks before the market crashed it stands now at 95 
percent the feds discount rate the interest rate it charges 
member banks for loans was increased from 55 percent to 6 percent 
a month before the crash and remains at that level

the law passed by the national peoples congress last april 
gives factory managers greater autonomy over planning and personnel 
and makes them responsible for profits and losses 
it is to be followed in november by enactment of chinas first 
bankruptcy law which will set down rules for shutting down 
insolvent plants 
legalization of the manager responsibility system already 
widely practiced in chinas staterun factories has been hailed as 
a major step in the governments drive to reduce the role of 
central planning and make industry more efficient by linking its 
production to marketdetermined supply and demand factors 
zhang yanning deputy minister of the state commission for 
restructuring the economy said last week government departments 
that previously exercised direct control over industries should 
abide by the principle of the state regulates the market which 
in turn guides the enterprises 
several years of experimenting with the manager responsibility 
system however has proved the difficulty of following that 
principle 
factory managers are still at the mercy of state allocations 
departments that control disbursement of scarce and increasingly 
expensive energy and raw materials managers told they now must 
make profits are also thwarted by irrationally low stateset 
purchasing prices for many of their products 
approximately onefourth of chinas staterun enterprises are 
operating in the red and the number is increasing with recent 
sharp increases in the costs of raw materials 
the peoples daily the official voice of the communist party 
said in a frontpage commentary monday that chinas 10yearold 
economic structural reforms have entered a critical stage 
enterprises can no longer harbor the illusion that the state 
will provide lowpriced raw materials and subsidies to cover 
losses it said banks will not be a certain source of lowinterest 
loans 
factories must move aggressively to reform their management 
personnel organization and income distribution systems because in 
the future market competition will be relentless 
there will certainly be some enterprises that will fail in the 
competition and be declared bankrupt the newspaper said 
under the new law enterprises will have the right to sell 
products on their own after meeting obligations to the state and 
to choose their own suppliers set product prices and negotiate and 
sign contracts with foreign parties 
senior leader deng xiaoping the mastermind of chinas economic 
reforms first suggested an enterprise law in 1978 but it was not 
until this year that disagreements over the relationship among the 
state the manager and workers were finally worked out

joseph horne co inc said monday its 
operations would not be affected by the collapse of an agreement 
between edward j debartolo corp and dillard department stores 
inc to buy the department store chain 
the current ownership and management of hornes is and will 
remain committed to the companys future robert a oconnell 
president and chief executive officer said at a news conference 
we intend to continue to operate hornes as we have been 
doing he said 
horne officials said they were surprised at the abrupt 
termination of the proposed sale of the 16store chain to a 
partnership formed by debartolo of youngstown ohio and dillard 
based in little rock ark

kept on 
horne whose stores are located in western pennsylvania and 
northern ohio employs about 3500 people 
spokesmen for debartolo and dillard department stores could not

mmc which manages a 25 million investment fund called the 
maverick fund i is in the business of buying companies with money 
from the fund and later selling them at a profit

million in a december 1986 leveraged buyout after its former parent 
company associated dry goods was taken over by may department

when fashion designer ralph lauren set his 
heart on a pair of racy ferraris he made one quick telephone call 
to indiana 
many of americas richest car buffs do the same 
displayed on the office walls of mitchell d kruse the man who 
answered laurens phone call are photographs of actors ken 
kercheval and joe piscopo pro football lineman brian bosworth 
hotelier bill marriott and former senator and white house chief of 
staff howard baker 
in his late 20s kruse is president and owner of kruse 
international one of the nations most exotic auction houses 
founded by his father dean v kruse the company has come to 
dominate the classic car market at a time when values have 
skyrocketed 
with the dizzying prices in the classic car arena wouldbe 
buyers of modest means are likely destined to remain wouldbe 
buyers 
we deal with such wealth that a guy can get excited and caught 
up and it doesnt matter that he just spent 100 for what most 
other people thinks worth 10 said kruse 
his figure of 100 of course is figurative top models such as 
duesenbergs routinely fetch 1 million and more the record belongs 
to a 1931 bugatti royale merline which brought 68 million in 
1986 last year the kruses coaxed bids of 152 million on about 
10000 automobiles 
the business started in 1971 at auburns annual weekend car 
festival dean kruse a successful local auctioneer of real estate 
and household goods noticed many of the old cars carried forsale 
signs so he stepped in and set up an auction 
we had a rope as a gate and 3500 people paid 1 to get in 
and another 3500 jumped the rope said the younger kruse a 
man turned down 35000 for his duesenberg which was just unheard 
of because they were selling for about 5000 to 10000 at the 
time 
the auction became an annual labor day weekend event and sales 
jumped their calendar takes the kruses across the united states 
and europe with auctions in switzerland and luxembourg as well as 
major sales in reno nev atlantic city and florida 
weve really developed florida as a market in the last couple 
of years because of the incredible wealth down there said kruse 
the kruses claim to hold 75 percent of the market 
wherever they go their sales technique doesnt vary much from 
the manner that sells lowprice household goods at a farm auction 
sell the sizzle the kruses say not the steak 
you can have a frying pan and go one dollar two dollar 
three dollar said kruse or you can say oh i can smell my 
grandmothers fried chicken in there right now wholl gimme 20 
kruses picks for todays best bets to become the classics of 
the future include the limited edition buick gnx mustang 
convertibles corvettes the irocz camaro maybe the cadillac 
allante and the avanti created by studebaker designer raymond 
loewy and now in limited production under owner michael kelly 
the keys to collectibility are condition design horsepower and 
historical significance kruse said people seem to value notoriety 
more than wholesome fame 
usually if a bad guy owned it its worth more than if a good 
guy owned it he said 
does it seem like there are limitless numbers of hitler staff 
cars 
kruse says there are more than 20 of the mercedes 770k models 
many protected by armor plate and bulletproof glass that might be 
touted as hitlers personal car 
if reich marshal hermann goering even looked at it its a 
hitler car kruse said

higher sales and lower expenses and taxes helped 
boost boeing cos secondquarter profits 368 percent over the 
same period of 1987 the seattlebased aerospace company said today 
boeing reported net earnings of 160 million or 105 a share on 
sales of 471 billion compared with profits of 117 million or 75 
cents a share on sales of 348 billion a year ago 
for the first half of 1988 boeing had profits of 296 million 
or 194 a share on sales of 832 billion up 26 percent from 
firsthalf 1987 profits of 235 million or 151 a share on sales 
of 724 billion 
in a news release boeing chairman and chief executive officer 
frank shrontz attributed the brighter performance to increased 
sales volume lower levels of research and development and other 
new business costs for computing electronics and military and 
space programs and lower federal tax rates 
but shrontz said the gains were offset somewhat by significant 
performance problems on several military airplane programs 
increased research and development and production costs at boeings 
dehavilland commuter plane division and having to bear a larger 
share of expenses on government contracts 
boeing enjoyed record orders of 133 billion for commercial 
planes in the second quarter with 23 customers ordering 268 jets 
and 29 turboprop commuter planes that compares with orders 
totaling 76 billion for secondquarter 1987

jets and 35 turboprop planes valued at 18 billion in the same 
period of 1987 there were 208 jets and 34 prop planes ordered 
worth a total 111 billion 
boeing is expected to have its fourth straight year of record 
orders for commercial jets the company however does not receive 
payment for planes until they are delivered which can be years 
after the orders were entered 
military sales in the first half totaled 24 billion 200 
million less than in the same period of 1987 shrontz said military 
sales for 1988 are expected to be slightly less than last year

construction spending inched up 01 percent in 
june as a big increase in investment for new factories helped 
offset declines in housing and government projects the commerce 
department said monday 
building activity rose to a seasonally adjusted but not 
inflationadjusted annual rate of 4028 billion in june 
following a 08 percent increase in may 
construction spending for the first half of 1988 was only 13 
percent above the januaryjune period of 1987 lagging behind the 
20 percent rate of inflation in construction costs between the two 
periods 
analysts had been expecting even greater weakness predicting 
office and hotel construction would decline in response to high 
vacancy rates but projects are getting built anyway 
what is happening is there is a lot of money available 
from here and overseas said economist michael sumichrast who 
heads a consulting firm in washington 
different aspects of the same phenomenon are fueling both the 
increase in factory investment which rose 57 percent in june and 
stands 21 percent higher than it was a year ago and the growing 
availability of money for other construction projects 
us manufacturers are spending more on new equipment and 
building projects to meet higher demand for us goods overseas 
theyre finally benefiting from the fall in the value of the dollar 
between early 1985 and the end of 1987 which made american goods 
cheaper on foreign markets 
however although the trade deficit is not as bad as it was 
foreigners still collect more dollars than they need to buy 
american goods and thus look for ways to invest that money 
the japanese particularly prefer to invest surplus dollars in 
government securities and real estate rather than in other 
investments such as corporate stock 
theres one good real estate deal for every 50 that you 
bring to the table but the money has to be put someplace im 
afraid were going to continue to build in some areas where we 
shouldnt really build sumichrast said 
for the rest of the year analysts are expecting a continued 
softening of construction activity led by weakness in housing 
which is being hurt by an upward creep in mortgage interest rates 
residential construction fell 09 percent in june to an annual 
rate of 1881 billion the third decline in a row a 07 percent 
drop in construction of singlefamily homes more than offset a 23 
percent increase in apartment construction 
john savacool an economist with the wefa group in bala cynwyd 
pa said factory construction will likely strengthen and 
residential building wane through the rest of this year 
however he said if the recent appreciation in the dollar 
which has rebounded somewhat from its lows at the end of last year 
continues it could choke off the us manufacturing boom and 
dampen the main area of construction strength 
the commerce department offered these details of construction 
spending in june 
nonresidential private construction climbed 25 percent the 
fourth consecutive monthly increase to a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate of 992 billion 
hotel and motel construction increased 194 percent after 
falling for two months analysts said the category swings widely 
from month to month because one or two large projects can skew the 
total 
construction of office buildings was off by 04 percent from 
the may level however the small decline followed increases in 
may april and march and the june rate was still 12 percent higher 
than a year earlier 
shopping center and other commercial construction was unchanged 
from may 
government construction projects fell 14 percent in june to an 
annual rate of 786 billion with highway construction the biggest 
segment of the government sector suffering a 16 percent decline

most us plant managers expect their production 
and new orders to increase in the third quarter continuing the 
rebound in the nations manufacturing industry according to a 
survey released monday 
the survey by dun amp bradstreet corp of 1500 plant managers 
around the country showed that 46 percent of them expect their 
production to rise in the current quarter while only 14 percent 
anticipate declines fortyseven percent of the managers predicted 
thirdquarter increases in new factory orders while 15 percent 
forecast declines 
the plant managers expectations for the third quarter however 
were slightly less optimistic than their projections for the second 
quarter that was because manufacturing growth has been so 
explosive and can be expected to slow a bit dun amp bradstreet said 
the business information company said plant managers are a good 
barometer of the nations manufacturing industry since they 
receive information on anticipated demand orders prices and 
production costs it was the second time that dun amp bradstreet did 
a quarterly survey of plant managers expectations 
this is really a continuation of a bullish outlook for the 
rust belt economy said joseph w duncan corporate economist and 
chief statistician for dun amp bradstreet though the outlook for 
the third quarter among manufacturers is not as strong as it was 
for the second quarter the current level of expectations 
represents a quantum leap in optimism since the october stock 
market crash 
the 46 percent of the plant managers expecting production to 
increase in the third quarter was down from 55 percent in the 
second quarter managers predicting gains in new orders declined to 
47 percent from 56 percent 
the manufacturing sector needs time to readjust after bursts 
of growth like the one it just came through duncan said it is 
during these momentary lulls that capacity is adjusted production 
schedules are revised and the groundwork is laid for future 
expansion 
he said it is remarkable that so many plant managers expect 
continued production increases given the fact that much of the 
nations manufacturing industry already has been producing close to 
maximum capacity the dollars marked decline in recent years has 
made us goods cheaper and more attractive overseas stimulating 
the industrial machine to produce more and straining its capacity 
similarly for the next 12 months most of the plant managers 
polled had slightly less optimistic expectations than in the 
previous survey 
fiftynine percent of the managers expect production to increase 
during the next year down from 63 percent those anticipating a 
rise in new orders slipped to 58 percent from 63 percent

the us governments exportimport bank 
announced on monday that its board of directors has agreed to 
resume lending to brazil to encourage sales of us goods there 
the action follows an agreement reached in paris over the 
weekend between brazil and 13 creditor governments including the 
united states this accord will delay repayments on 5 billion 
worth of debt falling due between jan 1 1987 and march 31 1990 
sergio amaral head of the brazilian delegation said that none 
of the interest or principal will be repaid until the end of that 
period payments will then be spread over 10 years it is unusual 
for such arrangements to delay payments of both interest and 
principal 
the us bank announced on july 11 that it was accepting 
applications for loans to brazil and that a decision would be made 
after the paris talks 
this condition has been satisfied and eximbank now is prepared 
to act on preliminary and final commitments said the banks 
president john a bohn jr in a statement 
brazils international credit was badly hurt in february 1987 
when it stopped paying interest on more than 60 billion of its 
bank debt the biggest in the third world it now has an agreement 
with a committee representing its bank creditors to delay payments 
on about 62 billion and to take new loans of 52 billion from 
the banks to help pay them the back interest 
the committee is collecting approvals from over 600 creditor 
banks for this arrangement the international monetary fund owned 
by 151 governments has said it will also lend brazil more money 
when the banks have agreed

soybean corn and oat futures skyrocketed their 
permitted daily limits monday on the chicago board of trade amid 
fears that a new heat wave in the midwest will do further damage to 
droughtstressed crops 
wheat futures also closed sharply higher 
the return of hot dry weather to the corn belt after a twoweek 
reprieve holds a particular threat to the soybean crop which is in 
the middle of its critical podfilling stage analysts said 
high temperatures 95 degrees or higher are more detrimental 
to soybeans at this growth stage than lack of moisture said rich 
feltes director of commodity research with refco inc a large 
chicagobased commodities brokerage house 
temperatures soared into the upper 90s monday afternoon in the 
central corn belt states of iowa illinois missouri and wisconsin 
and the hot dry weather was expected to persist for most of the 
week 
if these high temperatures continue were looking at a 
potentially serious shortfall in soybean production even with the 
recent rains in the eastern corn belt feltes said 
most contracts for future delivery of oats corn and soybeans 
closed up their respective daily limits of 10 cents 15 cents and 
45 cents a bushel the august soybean contract on which the limit 
has been removed pending the contracts expiration later this 
month closed more than 60 cents higher

agb television research is suspending its us 
television ratings operation saying it underestimated the costs of 
competing with audience measurement leader ac nielsen 
the disclosure disappointed some advertising and television 
industry executives who said agb had provided some competition in 
the national tv ratings arena that has been dominated for 30 years 
by nielsen 
they had breathed some life into what had been an inactive 
portion of the business an executive of a major advertiser said 
monday speaking on condition he not be identified 
but others said nielsen still faces potential competition from 
companies such as arbitron ratings co which has announced plans 
to launch a national tv ratings service over the next few years 
that also will monitor buying habits 
agb a limited partnership in which the british concern agb 
research plc had a major interest is widely credited or blamed 
depending on the view with encouraging use of people meters 
in measuring national tv audiences 
the people meter is a handheld device that not only 
electronically records when the television is on but permits 
viewers to push buttons to record exactly who is watching at any 
given time 
after years of use in europe agb decided to employ the devices 
as it launched its us television ratings operation in the fall of 
1987 
nielsen had been testing its own people meter and announced it 
would rely on the device for its 198788 ratings as well under its 
old system nielsen used a combination of meters to measure when 
sets were on and handwritten diaries to tell who watched particular 
shows 
critics of the old system said an explosion in viewing choices 
made it increasingly unrealistic for anyone to record accurately in 
a diary what everyone in the family watched but others said the 
people meters have shortcomings as well such as in measuring 
viewing by children 
if it hadnt been for agb coming into the market with their 
people meter i dont think nielsen would have come out as soon 
with their people meter said jack otter a senior vice president 
at the advertising agency mccannerickson worldwide 
but the cost of the ratings service was more than agb had 
expected 
the londonbased agb research said it had estimated in april 
1987 that it would cost 49 million for the us service but that 
within a year the complexities of the market had driven costs past 
67 million 
following discussions with the tv networks advertising 
agencies and advertisers it became clear that despite considerable 
support the prospects for future revenue would not make the 
project viable and would be unlikely to cover the increased level 
of costs the company said 
this past spring agb approached the three major television 
networks in an effort to get all three to sign up for this fall and 
beyond 
cbs had been the only major network to subscribe to the agb 
ratings in the 198788 season and getting abc and nbc to join was 
seen not only as a way to boost revenue for agb but also as a 
signal to advertisers and their agencies of the prospects for the 
service 
it is disappointing to have one of the competitors gone 
said paul sonkin vice president for network audience research at 
capital citiesabc but he said abc decided against subscribing 
because of the cost 
asked for a response to agbs announcement nielsens chairman 
and chief executive john c holt said our operating assumption 
that the television audience measurement business is a competitive 
one remains unchanged 
at arbitron spokeswoman nan myers said the agb decision will 
have no effect on that companys plans which call for introduction 
of a system that monitors both viewing and buying habits in five 
major markets in the fall of 1989 and expansion into a national 
system in the fall of 1990 
she noted arbitron has been measuring local audiences in the 
united states for years and has a longterm commitment to a 
national service 
in announcing arbtrons plans in june arbitron presdident aj 
aurichio said he expected arbitron would lose 125 million on the 
syswtem over four to five years before breaking even in 1995 
in announcing the suspension of its television ratings service 
agb research also announced it would acquire mediamark research 
inc which measures magazine audiences in an exchange of stock 
timothy joyce chairman of mediamark said agbs choice of the 
word suspension in describing the status of its agb television 
operation in the united states was deliberate leaving open the 
possibility that it could be resurrected in another form at some 
future date

us investors could lose 12 billion on their 
shares in south african gold mining stocks if legislation requiring 
americans to sell all their investments in south africa becomes 
law a report said monday 
the legislation introduced by rep ron dellums dcalif is 
intended to bring pressure on south africa to end its system of 
apartheid in which the black majority has no voice in national 
affairs 
americans would lose money because the legislation would force 
them to sell at depressed fire sale prices the study said 
the report was based on economists models of the interaction of 
supply and demand 
the study was conducted by the wefa group a consulting firm 
based in bala cynwyd pa on behalf of international investors 
inc a new yorkbased mutual fund that invests in precious metals 
mining stocks and has about 40 percent of its assets in south 
africa 
americans owned 45 billion in south african mining shares as 
of the end of 1987 and of that 32 billion was in gold mining 
shares making it the single most popular south african investment 
for americans the study said international investors estimated 
that about 500000 americans own shares in gold mining stocks 
the study did not attempt to calculate overall losses to 
american investors if the bill became law 
a dellums spokesman rh miller said the congressman believes 
negative effects of the bill would be temporary because the end of 
apartheid would free the south african economy from its state of 
siege 
the legislation is sponsored in the senate by sen edward m 
kennedy dmass

the gillette co and coniston partners ended a 
sixmonth power struggle monday with settlement of lawsuits over 
their proxy fight earlier this year 
as part of the settlement gillette will buy back an estimated 
16 million shares at 45 each or a total of 720 million 
the deal also contains a standstill agreement under which 
coniston said it would not buy significant numbers of gillette 
shares participate in any proxy contest or otherwise seek control 
of the company for three years 
the settlement ends conistons suit stemming from the april 21 
proxy vote it lost to gillette as a result the personal care 
products giant does not face a rerun of the election 
a federal judge said last month he was inclined to order a new 
vote because gillette misled stockholders in an advertisement about 
coniston before the election 
industry analysts have said a rematch would have strengthened 
conistons hand 
under terms of the settlement all gillette stockholders may 
sell one share back to the company at 45 for each seven they own 
gillette officials estimated the total number of shares likely 
to be purchased under the settlement agreement are about 16 million 
of the approximately 112 million outstanding shares 
edward froelich an analyst with pershing amp co said that the 
settlement means that gillette management wants to keep the 
status quo but theyre shrinking the capital and diluting earnings 
a bit 
after revlon chairman ronald o perelmans failed bid for 
gillette in 1986 gillette paid 558 million to buy back 92 
million shares of stock but froelich said the company will be able 
to continue to fight off such takeover attempts as long as they 
keep the earnings rising and they have i dont think the 
stockholders will be too badly off 
gillette stock plunged 262 a share to 3750 in composite 
trading on the new york stock exchange 
coniston which owns nearly 6 percent of gillette stock forced 
the proxy vote earlier this year in hopes of winning four 
directors seats to pressure the 12member gillette board to sell 
the company coniston believes a sale would boost the value of 
gillette stock 
gillette filed suit april 14 seeking to block conistons proxy 
bid on the grounds that coniston falsified securities and exchange 
commission filings and di not fully disclose all investors 
a countersuit filed by coniston five days later alleged gillette 
misrepresented coniston in advertisements and mailings to the 
companys 27000 shareholders and failed to publicly disclose all 
companies that had expressed interest in buying gillette 
us district court judge mark l wolf ruled in early april that 
gillette inaccurately portrayed coniston in newspaper 
advertisements leading up to the proxy vote in which shareholders 
rejected a coniston slate of four dierctor candidates 
paul tierney jr a coniston general partner issued a statement 
saying we believe this settlement at this time is in the best 
interests of all concerned 
joan fitzgerald spokeswoman for gillette maintained that all 
shareholders will benefit from the repurchase agreement and said 
it was not dissimilar to a buyback plan announced by the company 
for shareholders in 1986 prior to the coniston action

private consultants to defense contractors 
would have to register with the federal government under provisions 
of a bill introduced in the senate on monday by sen david pryor 
dark 
pryor chairs the senate government affairs federal service 
subcommittee which has held a series of hearings on the use of 
consultants by pentagon contractors 
the bill is intended to shed some sunshine on the 
alltooshadowy world of consultants bringing everything into the 
light should cut down on the shady dealings said pryor 
he was referring to the current investigation that focuses on 
allegations that contractors consultants many of them former 
pentagon employees paid bribes to current defense department 
workers for inside information about contracts no charges have yet 
been filed 
federal officials testified to pryors subcommittee that they 
didnt know specifically how much was being spent on consultants 
in part that lack of knowledge comes from the fact that contracts 
dont have to detail services provided by consultants 
pryors bill would create a registry of consultants and no 
consultants could be hired unless they were registered that 
registration would require detailed information about the identity 
of a consultants clients along with the services provided by the 
consultant 
the bill would also detail a new category in federal budgets 
requiring government departments to list the amount they spend on 
consultants

low supplies have doubled the price of 
antifreeze to about 7 a gallon and may drive it even higher 
suppliers and distributors say 
supplies have been limited by a shortage of ethylene glycol the 
base for antifreeze and by a series of explosions and fires at 
antifreeze production plants distributors told the omaha 
worldherald 
theres going to be a situation this fall where shelves are 
quite empty said mike mielenz manager of specialty products for 
texaco inc in houston 
antifreeze is used in the cooling systems of cars and other 
vehicles to protect their engines from freezing in the winter and 
overheating in the summer 
riaz waraich president of old world trading co one of the 
countrys major antifreeze suppliers said the antifreeze shortage 
is a longterm problem caused by the shortage of ethylene glycol a 
compound derived from natural gas that is the base for plastics and 
polyesters as well as antifreeze 
antifreeze the smallest and least profitable part of the 
ethylene glycol market is losing the competition to plastics 
which are in high demand waraich said from des plaines ill 
just when demand for the compound was increasing a series of 
refinery explosions took a big bite out of the ethylene glycol 
supply 
explosions last year in plants in antwerp belgium and saudi 
arabia reduced supplies worldwide in may an explosion shut down a 
shell oil co refinery in norco la in june fire swept a texaco 
plant 
the disasters cut 35 million to 40 million gallons of antifreeze 
from the us market which uses 200 million gallons annually 
waraich said 
the real impact will be felt in octobernovember when john 
public goes to the store for his coolant said waraich whose 
company produces peak advance and full force brands of antifreeze 
some in the industry said some consumers and suppliers are 
hoarding antifreeze making the crunch worse others said suppliers 
actually have restricted their orders to prevent hoarding 
lonn harlan district manager of rennoco oil co in omaha a 
wholesale antifreeze distributor said that due to higher prices 
from suppliers his company has boosted wholesale prices of 
antifreeze from 323 to 718 per gallon in the last four months 
rennoco could have to boost prices to more than 11 a gallon 
wholesale by jan 1 harlan said 
target stores antifreeze prices have climbed from 399 a 
gallon in june to 8 a gallon for prestone and 6 for xerex said 
george hite vice president for public and consumer affairs 
k mart stores will take a loss on antifreeze sales because of 
the shortage said don thompson sportsauto manager at the chains 
omaha store 
increased production is not possible in the short run industry 
spokesmen said 
the shell plant in louisiana and the texaco plant are not back 
at full production and the united states can not restore its lost 
supply of ethylene glycol because it can not import the raw 
material waraich said importing ethylene gas requires special 
shipping terminals the united states does not have he said

soybean corn and oat futures prices shot up their permitted 
daily limits monday on the chicago board of trade amid fears that 
the latest heat wave in the midwest will do further damage to 
droughtstressed crops 
wheat futures also closed sharply higher 
on other exchanges coffee futures plummeted cattle futures 
were sharply higher while pork futures were sharply lower precious 
metals were mixed energy futures were mixed and stockindex 
futures retreated 
the return of hot dry weather to the corn belt after a twoweek 
reprieve holds a particular threat to the soybean crop which is in 
the middle of its critical podfilling stage analysts said 
hot temperatures 95 degrees or higher are even more 
detrimental to soybeans than lack of moisture at this growth stage 
said rich feltes director of commodity research with refco inc a 
large chicagobased commodities brokerage house 
temperatures approached or exceeded 100 degrees monday afternoon 
in the central corn belt states of iowa illinois missouri and 
wisconsin and the hot dry weather was expected to persist for most 
of the week 
if these high temperatures continue were looking at a 
potentially serious shortfall in soybean production even with the 
recent rains in the eastern corn belt feltes said 
victor lespinasse a trader with dean witter reynolds inc said 
the critical period for soybean development would run through the 
third week in august 
the next two to three weeks are going to make or bake the 
soybean crop and it looks like were going to bake it he said 
most contracts for future delivery of oats corn and soybeans 
closed up their respective daily limits of 10 cents 15 cents and 
45 cents a bushel the august soybean contract on which the limit 
has been removed pending the contracts expiration later this 
month gained 63 cents 
wheat settled 8 cents to 14 cents higher with september at 
381 a bushel corn was 13 cents to 15 cents higher with 
september at 290 a bushel oats were 10 cents higher across the 
board with september at 281 a bushel and soybeans were 27 cents 
to 63 cents higher with august at 839 a bushel 
hot weather also contributed to limit losses in coffee futures 
on new yorks coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange 
coffee consumption typically hits its lowest point in 
midsummer and expectations that cash prices will fall prompted 
heavy speculative selling of coffee futures said sandra kaul an 
analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc 
three coffee contracts settled down the 6cent daily limit the 
limitless september contract plunged 805 cents to settle at 
11667 a pound 
cattle futures dipped on the chicago mercantile exchange in 
response to fridays semiannual cattle inventory report from the 
agriculture department which showed the nations cattle herd to be 
larger than the markets had anticipated 
analysts said the sharp rise in grain prices also weighed on 
prices for nearterm delivery of cattle feeder cattle for 
september and october delivery plunged the 150centsapound daily 
limit 
limit advances in the pork pits were fueled by fears that hot 
humid weather would decrease the number of hogs brought to market 
this week and by rising cash prices for pork bellies said philip 
stanley an analyst with thomson mckinnon securities inc 
live cattle were 35 cent to 95 cent lower with august at 6617 
cents a pound feeder cattle were 150 cents lower to 10 cent 
higher with august at 7837 cents a pound hogs were 55 cent to 
150 cents higher with august at 4530 cents a pound frozen pork 
bellies were unchanged to 2 cents higher with august at 3252 cents 
a pound 
silver futures gained while gold retreated on new yorks 
commodity exchange 
silver which had fallen sharply last week bounced back on 
bargain hunting and confirmation that perus stateowned mining 
company centromin had stated it might not meet its contractual 
obligations to deliver silver due to a 2weekold miners strike 
analysts said 
gold settled 170 lower across the board with august at 43440 
a troy ounce silver was 6 cents to 69 cents higher with september 
at 6915 a troy ounce 
crude oil futures prices fell slightly and oil products finished

they prefer not to call it an invasion but it was 
a meticulously planned operation that brought about 250 ncnb corp 
officials to texas to take over the states largest bank holding 
company 
with militarylike precision and secrecy to match the north 
carolina bankers set up camp at a dallas hotel and waited for the 
announcement that finally brought the failing first republicbank 
corp into their fold last friday 
we were all real pleased said brad iversen ncbcs senior 
vice president for marketing on monday there havent been any 
hitches at all 
the ncnb employees were flown into dallas late thursday and 
early friday morning expecting a dallas press conference that 
would mark the end of first republicbanks texas banking presence 
and the birth of ncnb texas national bank 
rumors had circulated earlier in the week that ncnb had a lock 
on a takeover and that the press conference would be a mere 
formality one local bank analyst said 
but iversen said monday that he and his ncnb advance team had 
heard no such rumors when the press conference site shifted to 
washington dc nearpanic set in 
it wasnt a done deal as far as we were concerned iversen 
said we were on pins and needles 
iversen and others breathed a collective sigh of relief when 
news came that the north carolina bank holding company had indeed 
won the bidding conducted by the federal deposit insurance corp 
we had done ads for newspapers and radio tons of posters and 
customer letters he said if the deal hadnt been done we 
wouldnt have been able to use that for anything but scrap paper 
all of the posters letters and advertising was secretly 
produced in north carolina and then quietly shipped to dallas on 
thursday via federal express 
there was so much material that ncnb had to rent a separate 
hotel room just to store it iversen said 
the north carolina delegation will stay on for short time 
longer officials said advance team members will be stationed at 
each of the first republicbank offices throughout texas 
theyll be there to reassure customers iversen explained 
then after one week well go away 
first republicbanks 40 texas banks were turned over to ncnb on 
friday 
the following day first republicbank and ifrb corp its wholly 
owned subsidiary and intermediate holding company formed in last 
years merger with interfirst corp filed for protection from 
creditors under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code 
in light of the bankruptcy filings the new york stock exchange 
on monday suspended trading in first republicbanks stock 
first republicbank retains a single bank in delaware and certain 
subsidiaries engaged in nonbanking activities the bank said in a 
statement

when ncnb corp came to the rescue of 
ailing first republicbank of dallas it was doing what came 
naturally aggressively expanding into new markets 
the single biggest strength of this company is we have a do 
business attitude ncnb vice president william p middlemas said 
monday we try to do something with every deal that comes in 
maybe we dont do it as its presented but we try to do it 
its part of our culture our strength he added were 
quite prepared to go there texas and do business 
as he spoke some 250 ncnb managers were in texas taking control 
of the 41 banks that made up the insolvent first republicbank 
corp now operating as ncnb texas national bank 
on friday ncnb currently the nations 18th largest bank with 
286 billion in assets was selected to acquire the financially 
ailing texas bank in what has been described as the largest bank 
rescue in us history 
the federal deposit insurance corp said it would spend up to 4 
billion to bail out first republic but expects to recoup a large 
portion of those losses 
north carolina national bank was created in 1960 when american 
commercial bank of charlotte and security national bank of 
greensboro merged 
the new bank had 480 million in assets 1300 employees and 40 
offices in 20 north carolina cities and towns 
in the next two decades ncnb grew rapidly through mergers with 
existing banks and by opening new offices it also gained a 
national reputation for aggressively pursuing new markets 
in 1981 ncnb purchased first national bank of lake city fla 
federal law had barred a bank from operating in more than one 
state but the merger was approved by the federal reserve board 
because ncnb had owned a trust company in florida since 1972 
before the state enacted laws prohibiting the takeover by 
outofstate companies 
observers say ncnbs venture into florida sparked a fiveyear 
buying spree that tripled its assets to nearly 29 billion 
once allowed to capitalize on opportunities in other states 
ncnb bought up banks in florida tennessee georgia and south 
carolina 
former ncnb corp president william dougherty said the latest 
move reflected the same strategy that opened the door to interstate 
banking seven years earlier if we hadnt been aggressively 
interested in florida we wouldnt have ever gotten in he said 
middlemas who is in charge of the companys north carolina 
banking group said the texas deal is a big step in ensuring 
ncnbs survival in banking circles for a long time size is 
important

chicago amp north western transportation co issued 
a compromise offer monday in an effort to avert a strike by the 
united transportation union that could affect 41000 commuters and 
disrupt freight deliveries in several farm belt states 
separately sen paul simon dill said he planned to 
introduce legislation to speedily extend a coolingoff period in 
the labor dispute for 36 days which would postpone any strike 
action 
the railroad offered to accept a recommendation by a 
presidential emergency panel to eliminate 700 brakemens jobs 
instead of the 1150 cuts campnw had previously said were needed 
but united transportation union general counsel robert hart said 
the union was not impressed by the offer that wont settle it 
hart said 
campnw spokesman james foote said the railroad made a 
concessionary offer to the union to try and settle this dispute 
but he acknowledged the railroad is not very hopeful the 
union will accept the offer to avert the strike scheduled to begin 
thursday 
the recommendation initially came from the presidential 
emergency board in july which president reagan appointed in april 
in an effort to solve the longstanding dispute foote said 
until mondays compromise offer campnw had said it wanted to save 
51 million a year by cutting most of its train crews from four to 
two people eliminating what it considers unnecessary brakemens 
jobs and leaving an engineer and conductor on board 
the union has considered that move unacceptable 
the presidential panel recommended that all the railroads 
freight trains be operated with three brakemen instead of four 
that only two brakemen be used on certain nonstop freight trains 
foote said 
the strike would affect commuters in a sixcounty area around 
chicago for whom campnw provides service through an agreement with 
metra a suburban commuter rail service it would also affect 
freight service in several midwestern states 
however neither side can act until a coolingoff period ordered 
by reagan ends at 1201 am on aug 4 
hart said mondays move by the campnw was intended to persuade 
congress not to extend the coolingoff period 
campnw doesnt want the strike to be postponed he said 
they want it to come to a head 
all the purpose of this statement is to persuade congress not 
to take any action hart said 
but in washington simon spokesman david carle said an extension 
of the coolingoff period would give both sides breathing room 
to come up with a solution on their own 
he said simon would introduce the bill under a fasttrack 
procedure that would allow a senate vote tuesday and would work 
with several house members who could get it through that chamber 
the next day
