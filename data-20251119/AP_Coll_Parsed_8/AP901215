while an investigaton continues 
assistant district attorney george prietz iii said authorities 
suspect dimmick knew his halfbrother had died but failed to report

house after spiegels death at age 71 dimmick most recently lived 
at a downtown homeless shelter authorities said neighbors said

city carpenter sent to board up the home in a treelined wellkept 
neighborhood known as piggsville 
the mans remains were in a sleeping bag on the kitchen floor 
among piles of debris in a house filled with collections of toys 
clocks and books delgadillo said 
i think he must have saved everything he ever owned in his 
life everything was piled up ceiling high he said 
neighbors recalled spiegel as a recluse who collected antiques 
especially cars and once had a oneman helicopter and threewheel 
car stored in his garage 
they said they spotted spiegel on several occasions dancing in 
his yard wearing a womans wig hat and dress and carrying a 
purse he was last seen by neighbors late in the summer 1988 
that was the fun part of having him as a neighbor said 
63yearold elfrieda nikolai who lives across the street he was 
unreal

weidensee 34 
another neighbor 34yearold george michalski said spiegel 
only left his house to attend flea markets and antique sales 
spiegel owned such cars as a davis threewheeler a corvair a 
packard and a tucker he reportedly sold for 35000 neighbors 
said 
prietz said friday authorities have learned little about 
spiegels antique collections or how he could afford such items 
we dont know how much he was worth the prosecutor said 
spiegel received a pension and social security but didnt trust 
banks after surviving the depression michalski said recalling

a month before the un security councils 
deadline to withdraw from kuwait iraq has stepped up preparations 
for war with usled forces 
bomb shelters are being built iraqis are being trained in civil 
defense and first aid and plans are being readied to evacuate 
major population centers 
the governmentcontrolled media has publicized the need to be 
prepared for any eventuality it has urged people not to panic 
during air raids 
posters pinned on walls at street corners in baghdad and other 
cities ask people to be prepared to face even chemical and nuclear 
weapons 
dont panic at the time of an air raid just be calm and ask 
for help from local civil defense men reads one poster in a main 
plaza of baghdad which has a population of around 4 million 
theres been a noticeable intensification of such preparations 
since nov 29 when the security council passed a ussponsored 
resolution authorizing military force against iraq if it does not 
leave kuwait by jan 15 
on the very day the deadline runs out evacuation drills are 
scheduled in the capital 
president saddam hussein and other leaders have insisted 
repeatedly that they will not relinquish any territory gained in 
the aug 2 invasion 
we want peace and are endeavoring to achieve it and work 
to reach a point where none of us brandishes his sword against the 
other but if our enemies want to push affairs to a military duel 
then with gods help we will win and walk over their corpses and 
tread on their heads saddam said thursday 
if war breaks out it will be the most ferocious war that ever 
took place so we have to make our people aware of that a senior 
iraqi official said in an interview he spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
many iraqis believe the united states might launch an offensive 
aimed at retaking kuwait after the security council deadline and 
fear that targets in iraq itself could be hit 
they believe that casualties could be high if the multinational 
force confronting iraq uses its formidable air power an estimated 
1900 aircraft will be available by midjanuary to knock out 
airbases military factories and economic targets many of these 
are close to population centers 
the iraqi people endured eight years of war with iran the 
government has never released casualty figures but unofficial 
estimates range from 10000 to 200000 iraqis killed 
baghdad and other cities came under missile attack during the 
198088 war and many people believe they should be prepared to 
meet the threat of a potentially more devastating conflict with the 
united states and its allies 
the iraqi army and people must resist this imposition by the 
united states and its allies whether in the battlefield down in 
kuwait or here in our cities and towns said shawkat ibrahim a 
retired government employee 
the 55yearold ibrahim who lives in a baghdad suburb said he 
has joined a civil defense class 
like other iraqis he said he believes war is inevitable if a 
settlement to the crisis is not found soon 
the government has ordered owners of multistory buildings to 
comply with regulations requiring shelters in their basements 
the shelters must be marked with signs advertising their 
presence fines or jail terms are possible for those who fail to do 
so 
on friday the ruling baath party organ althawra urged iraqis 
to join civil defense classes and learn first aid and firefighting 
as a national duty to foil the american agression 
our militant country is facing a great challenge represented 
by the americanzionist agrression and in order to achieve victory 
every one of us should should have a contribution to make whether 
by holding a gun on the battlefield or by combating the effects of 
the agrression against other facilities the paper said in a 
frontpage editorial 
we cannot achieve victory without knowing how to behave during 
agrression this is why we should join civil defense courses it 
said 
officials also said drills to evacuate major population centers 
have been conducted while similar drills are planned in baghdad on 
jan 15 
althawra said the civil defense courses were organized in 
villages around the country with iraqis being instructed by party 
cadres and labor unions on how to fight fires and treat casualties

their goose may be cooked next year but at least 
it wont cost much this christmas but take a gander at those side 
dishes bread and potatoes have doubled in price 
the traditional holiday feast enjoyed by east germans 
represents in a way the jarring vagaries of the worlds swiftest 
transition from planned socialist economy to unbridled free market 
it also illustrates just how difficult it is to tell whether 
living costs in this dramatically evolving society are falling 
climbing or holding steady pending a collapse next year 
new statistics from the federal government this week show that 
the cost of living actually fell 19 percent from november 1989 to 
last month 
but economists say that figure means little and is like 
comparing apples to oranges consumer complaints also cast doubt on 
the statistics which cover everything from furniture to medicine 
to apples and oranges 
the comparison with the previous year is worthless said 
berlin economist heine flassbeck whose german institute for 
economic research tracks the loopy eastern german economy 
the main problem is that you cannot compare with the previous 
year because you had a different basket of commodities different 
quality from different sources 
according to the federal statistics office food is 124 percent 
costlier this year while household goods are 234 percent cheaper 
clothing dropped 319 percent while health products rose 237 
percent 
perhaps the variances are best illustrated by the cost of the 
traditional christmas dinner a goose red cabbage potatoes 
bread sweets and sparkling wine 
the eastern german farm economy was geared mainly toward red 
meat not poultry when the market opened poultry imports flooded 
in 
today that christmas goose will cost about 30 percent less 
said sylvia koehler a government statistics expert in berlin 
by comparison potatoes and red cabbage staples heavily 
subsidized by the former communist government have risen by 214 
percent and 79 percent respectively 
bread likewise was heavily subsidized and used to cost about 
54 cents a loaf it now sells for about 136 
however chocolate and walnuts cost half as much because of a 
competitive flood of western imports sparkling wines are about 70 
percent cheaper 
finished with dinner coffee always was scarce in east germany 
and sold for about 476 a quarter pound now the same money buys 
the whole pound mrs koehler said 
i dont think ill pay more for my christmas dinner than in 
the past she said friday 
neither does ingrid correa of berlin who said it is the 
abundance of goods spanning vast price spectrums and the high 
jumps in a handful of oncesubsidized staples that skew the 
grocery bills 
we think everything is more expensive and a lot of it is 
said the 48yearold philosophy teacher after she emerged from a 
grocery store thursday but if you shop carefully and avoid all 
the new things food can cost the same 
but she also points out what the economists forecast the rough 
part of the former nations economic transition wont begin until 
after the holiday dishes are put away 
right now only 600000 workers are officially unemployed but 
up to 1 million are believed to be carrying postdated layoff 
notices that kick in during the first quarter of 1991 
the most pessimistic projections up to half the 8 million 
workers will be jobless next year 
living costs also could jump in january because remaining 
subsidies will begin peeling away rents now as low as 41 
monthly will begin rising 
energy costs will double public transportation a oneway bus 
or subway trip costs only 14 cents also will jump 
east germany officially converted to a free market july 1 
flassbeck said it will take a year to gauge whether people are 
prospering keeping pace or sinking into poverty 
determining the cost of living is impossible at the 
moment he said this is why we cannot say what has happened to 
real income has it fallen has it gone up 
for annette flohr a 27yearold working mother from berlin who 
bought groceries on her lunch hour the answer is simple 
if i have a job i can survive she said

the year 1990 was an unhappy one for journalists 
with some of the most serious setbacks coming where hope had been 
strongest the international press institute reported 
the institutes world press freedom review paid particular 
attention to press difficulties in romania yugoslavia south 
africa turkey kenya uganda nigeria chile colombia and iraq 
there has been an increase in attacks on the media and they 
most galling aspect of all is that they are occurring in countries 
where we had been given good reason to hope for dramatic changes 
for the better ipi director peter galliner wrote in the report 
released friday 
galliner said one of 1990s most gruesome incidents was the 
execution in iraq of farzad bazoft an iranianborn journalist 
working for the observer newspaper of london bazoft was accused of 
spying 
iraqs invasion of kuwait silenced about 40 kuwaiti 
publications the report noted 
ironically one consequence of saddam husseins move has been 
the opening of the saudi media which have been obliged to tell 
the population the truth at long last faced with the evidence all 
around them galliner wrote 
but the arab media as a whole remain shackled and 
subservient to the political line of their respective 
governments 
the report said restrictions have hampered newspapers that 
sprang up in romania following the overthrow of nicolae ceausescu 
it is remarkable and appallingly sad that after ridding the 
country of the horrors and repressions of the ceausescu regime 
romanias new leaders have ensured that the nation still has no 
truly independent newspaper or publisher because all printing 
facilities are governmentcontrolled he wrote 
galliner said journalists also have faced severe problems in 
yugoslavia where serbian leader slobodan milosevic has imposed a 
quasistalinist control of the media 
authorities closed down the albanianlanguage newspaper rilindja 
in the kosovo province and dozens of journalists on belgrade 
television and the daily newspaper politika were suspended for 
reporting an anticmmunist demonstration in june 
the study reported improvements in south africa but noted that 
unidentified gunmen killed sam mabe of the sowetan daily newspaper 
in july max de preez editor of the south african weekly vrye 
weekblad was imprisoned for violating the protection of 
information act 
in turkey cetin emec former editor in chief of the daily 
hurriyet of istanbul and turan dursun columnist for a banned 
publication were murdered the report said adding 
twentyeight turkish journalists or editors are still in 
prison in many cases serving sentences of more than 100 years an 
unacceptable state of affairs in a true democracy 
kenya expelled one foreign journalist and authorities arrested 
half a dozen others ugandan authorities suspended the 
accreditation of all foreign journalists and stringers the report 
said 
it said journalists were arrested in nigeria following a failed 
coup attempt in april 
the report said the new government of patricio aylwin has eased 
restrictions on expression in chile but juan pablo cardenas 
editor of analisis magazine was detained for 13 days in september 
and juan andres lago editor of the communist party weekly el 
siglo remained in detention 
in colombia drug traffickers murdered several journalists

homosexual and unmarried couples as well as 
traditional families are using a new interpretation of an old state 
law to put their relationships on the record 
all it takes is 10 for two or more people to register with the 
california secretary of state declaring themselves an 
unincorporated nonprofit association with the word family in 
the title 
to make it really official the association receives a colorful 
certificate with a gold state seal 
what were seeing here is a creative use of a longstanding 
division of law said tony miller chief deputy secretary of 
state people are gathering together forming an association 
calling it a family and registering it with the secretary of 
state 
but news of the registration was met with anger by some 
religious officials particularly in san francisco where voters 
last month approved a domestic partners ordinance amid controversy 
of course im opposed to however they set up domestic partners 
since their ultimate aim is to change the marriage laws said 
the rev charles mcilhenny of the first orthodox presbyterian 
church an outspoken opponent of the san francisco ordinance 
once the state government legislates the definition of the 
nuclear family or creates a family that will vie with the nuclear 
family then you essentially destroy the essential building blocks 
of a family he said friday 
other california municipalities allow unmarried domestic 
partners to register among them berkeley and laguna beach san 
mateo county employees can register domestic partners for all 
benefits except health insurance 
the idea to use a 60yearold law to register unions was 
conceived by los angeles attorney thomas f coleman former 
executive director of the california commission on personal 
privacy the panel was convened in 1980 by thengov jerry brown 
during the past 10 years reports and studies have documented 
discrimination against nontraditional families and the need for 
reform coleman said registration is a first step he said 
after some research coleman found the law regarding 
associations believing he had found a way to register families he 
tested his theory by filing his own application 
coleman would not discuss his private life saying he only used 
his family to see if his notion would work it did 
the first handful of applications after that had an uneven 
reception by the office of secretary of state march fong eu 
coleman later persuaded eus office with legal arguments thus far 
seven applications have been accepted and more are pending 
it should be noted that the secretary of state does not 
register families as such eu said this week in a prepared 
statement the secretary of state does however as required by 
law register the names of associations which may include as part 
of their name the word family 
miller eus chief deputy said the state which makes a 5 
profit on each filing is delighted to have the money 
coleman has hopes that association status can enable family 
associations to enjoy benefits afforded traditional families such 
as in frequent flyer programs health clubs and insurance 
at least one hospital cedarssinai in los angeles said it 
would honor the certificates as proof of immediate family for 
visitation rights he said 
oregon michigan new jersey virginia west virginia and 
wisconsin have similar association registration laws on their 
books coleman said 
the question is will their secretaries of state allow it to 
be used that way he said this registration is helpful to 
nuclear families its helpful to everyone

ocean has rocked the peruvian coast but caused no damage 
the earthquake friday measured 53 on the richter scale and was 
centered 65 miles southwest of the port city of chimbote the 
national geophysical institute said 
the quake was felt as far north as chiclayo and as far south as 
lima the institute said 
the richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a 
seismograph every increase of one number means that the ground 
motion is 10 times greater 
a quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage in 
populated areas a quake of magnitude 6 can cause svere damage in

president bushs nomination of rep lynn 
martin to head the labor department is receiving a somewhat chilly 
reception from union leaders who are troubled by what they see as 
her probusiness tilt 
in tapping martin for his cabinet on friday bush picked a 
longtime supporter who lost her illinois congressional seat last 
month in a bid for the senate bush called martin 51 a 
distinguished public servant and cherished friend 
but aflcio president lane kirkland noted that during her 10 
years in congress the republican lawmaker has often sided with 
business rather than labor according to the federations 
scorecard martin voted right on workers issues only 29 
percent of the time 
her voting record has not reflected a sensitivity to the needs 
of workers kirkland said 
john sturdivant president of the 700000member american 
federation of government employees said martins probusiness 
reputation gives us some cause for concern but he said he was 
hopeful she would continue the opendoor policy toward union 
leaders initiated by former labor secretary elizabeth dole 
the national education association the nations largest 
teachers union praised the appointment of martin a former 
teacher as did the us chamber of commerce 
the choice of martin to replace mrs dole who resigned to head 
the american red cross will assure the continued presence of at 
least one woman in bushs cabinet 
another gop congresswoman who was defeated in her effort to 
unseat a democratic senator patricia saiki of hawaii is 
considered a frontrunner for secretary of education lauro cavazos 
was forced to resign the post this week 
bushs announcement of martins selection made hastily before 
he boarded a helicopter bound for camp david md appeared 
designed to end a week of turmoil within the administration on a 
positive note 
cavazos resigned wednesday after being told to leave by white 
house chief of staff john sununu according to administration 
sources and bushs choice as the new republican national committee 
chairman william bennett bowed out thursday when he found out how 
drastically new ethics rules would limit his outside income 
martin was in illinois on friday and was told only an hour ahead 
of the announcement that she had landed the job said an 
administration official who requested anonymity martin declined to 
be interviewed but issued a brief statement saying her nomination 
was a high honor 
i look forward to appearing before the senate for the upcoming 
confirmation hearings she said thanking bush for his 
confidence and support 
the president said he would meet with martin on monday 
the congresswoman backed bush in his first presidential bid in 
1980 helped him prepare for his vice presidential debate with 
democrat geraldine ferraro in 1984 and was a national cochairman 
of his presidential campaign two years ago 
it also was apparent that bush felt he owed martin something for 
her party loyalty in giving up a safe house seat to make the uphill 
bid against sen paul simon dill she had been passed over in his 
first round of cabinet appointments after the 1988 election partly 
because of her own interest in the senate 
shes a mother who knows the need for child care shes a 
professional who understands the businesslabor relationship and 
as a congresswoman she spent years dealing with the concerns and 
aspirations of the working americans from every walk of life 
bush said of martin i know that she will serve with great 
distinction in our cabinet 
rep saiki had also been considered in the running for the labor 
post as well as for education secretary but fell behind in part 
because she had backed sen bob dole rkan over bush in the 1988 
presidential primaries 
republican sources said friday that dole had called white house 
chief of staff john sununu pushing saiki for a cabinet post

even a mild recession likely would exhaust the 
governments deposit insurance fund leaving it unable to handle 
bank failures without an infusion from taxpayers a congressional 
report says 
a severe recession would produce failures costing as much as 63 
billion over the next three years mre than twice the amount 
currently available to the fund it said 
the report due out monday at a hearing of the house banking 
subcommittee on financial institutions also sounded a stark 
warning about the nations largest banks 
this nation faces an almost unprecedented situation in having 
most of its largest banks operating on or conceivably over the 
edge of insolvency said the study prepared by three private 
economists at the direction of rep frank annunzio dill 
chairman of the panel 
it was written by robert litan of the brookings institution a 
washingtonbased think tank james barth of auburn university and 
r dan brumbaugh of stanford university barth and brumbaugh are 
former chief economists of the federal home loan bank board the 
regulatory agency since dismantled of the savings and loan 
industry 
the associated press obtained a summary of the study without 
the supporting financial data on friday 
the report directly challenges treasury secretary nicholas f 
brady who has declared banks and savings institutions as 
different as chalk and cheese and pledged that bankers not 
taxpayers will pay to bail out banks if necessary 
fdic chairman l william seidman has said the fund has enough 
money to handle the failures foreseen by the agency into mid1991 
he has recommended the adoption of a backup plan to inject 
additional dollars from banks into the fund if needed 
the report fundamentally deals with possible economic 
scenarios its a sort of what if report what we all dont 
know is which what if is the right forecast and well never know 
until we get there seidman said 
barth and litan favor shoring up the federal deposit insurance 
corp with a massive loan from the treasury as large as 50 
billion they recommend that banks repay the sum over an extended 
period perhaps 10 years 
the report said however that brumbaugh favors an unambiguous 
taxpayer bailout because he worries that higher deposit insurance 
premiums could push more weak banks over the financial edge 
meanwhile comptroller of the currency robert l clarke said in 
an interview with the washington post that some accounting rules 
would be changed to give banks more flexibility in dealing with 
troubled loans 
a change likely to be put into effect early next year would 
allow banks to count some renegotiated or otherwise troubled loans 
as good loans so the banks could count as income any interest 
payments received on those notes clarke said currently banks 
cannot count those payments as income 
we are trying to make sure that we have accounting rules that 
allow restructuring but do not allow bankers to hide their 
problems clarke said bankers should be given credit for 
working with borrowers so long as they are willing to acknowledge 
they have a problem loan 
the economists evaluated the health of the insurance fund under 
a range of recession scenarios from mild to severe mild is 
defined as a national downturn roughly half as bad as the recession 
now plaguing new england severe is defined as the national 
equivalent of the contraction that rocked texas in the mid1980s 
when oil prices plummeted 
in a mild recession the economists estimate the fdic is 
conservatively facing costs over three years of 31 billion to 
43 billion however the fdic will have at most 28 billion 
to pay for failed banks even if it raises deposit insurance 
premiums for the third time in as many years 
a severe recession with bank failures costing 63 billion over 
three years would swamp the fund 
the economists cautioned that their estimates could be low 
because thee is substantial evidence that the financial data 
publicly reported by banks can significantly overstate the 
health of weak institutions 
the key fact is that many of these banks not only currently 
have weak balance sheets by any reasonable standard but they are 
also highly exposed to additional deterioration from their 
significant involvement in highrisk lending the kryptonite of 
the banking system loans so toxic they can threaten even big 
banks the economists wrote 
the report recommended that regulators stop weak big banks from 
paying dividends to stockholders and that the government 
aggressively promote the merger of weak banks into stronger 
partners 
in the long run it said congress should pass legislation 
allowing banks to operate across state lines that way an 
institution could spread its loans around the nation rather than 
relying on one region that may be suffering a downturn 
it said that industrial and commercial companies should be 
allowed to buy banks investing their capital into the institutions 
to stand between losses and the government insurance fund

the navy is sending two additional fleet 
hospitals to saudi arabia as part of a vast buildup of us medical 
personnel and facilities in advance of the jan 15 united nations 
deadline for iraqi forces to leave kuwait 
navy officials said friday that up to 8000 more reservists will 
be ordered to active duty to support the expansion of combat 
medical care in and around saudi arabia 
the service also announced that it is requiring activeduty 
medical personnel to stay in uniform indefinitely that means that 
all navy doctors physician assistants nurses hospital corpsmen 
oral surgeons and medical service corps personnel in eight 
specialties who had planned to leave the service or retire after 
jan 1 1991 must remain on duty 
these are skills which are critical and in short supply due to 
expanded requirements for navy medical personnel to support marine 
corps units hospital ships other casualty treatment ships and 
fleet hospitals in the gulf the navy said 
earlier this month the navy invoked a more limited use of the 
stoploss authority to keep in uniform navy personnel 
performing medical and other duties for the marine corps the army 
has frozen its entire activeduty force in place 
the total numbers of us hospitals beds medical personnel and 
supplies for operation desert shield are classified as are the 
pentagons computergenerated estimates of casualties from a gulf 
war 
casualty projections vary according to assumptions about the 
type and length of a us offensive campaign to liberate kuwait 
but retired army col trevor dupuy in testimony friday to the 
house armed services committee estimated that an air and ground 
attack would result in about 9000 casualties 
about 2300 navy reserve medical specialists are being mobilized 
this week to set up and operate two combatzone hospitals in the 
saudi desert these are mobile prepackaged climatecontrolled 
hospitals that can be unpacked and set up quickly to treat 
casualties evacuated from the front lines 
the two navyrun fleet hospitals each with 500 beds and staffs 
of 950 people will be in addition to one already operational with 
500 beds and six operating tables in northeastern saudi arabia 
their exact locations are classified 
pentagon spokesman pete williams acknowledged to reporters 
thursday that extra medical personnel facilities and supplies are 
being dispatched to the gulf area as us military reinforcements 
begin arriving to back up the 260000 american troops already 
there 
by late january as many as 430000 us troops are expected to 
be in the gulf area joined by more than 220000 ground naval and 
air forces of 28 allied nations 
navy officials speaking on condition they not be identified 
said fleet hospitals 20 and 22 are being mobilized for deployment 
to saudi arabia unlike fleet hospital 5 already in operation 
there the additional two facilities will be staffed entirely by 
reservists the officials said 
fleet hospitals are similar to mobile army surgical hospital or 
mash units but are capable of providing more sophisticated care 
those being sent to saudi arabia are designed to operate at the 
rear of the combat zone about 75 miles from the front lines they 
are the first level of care available behind the medical units that 
accompany troops in combat 
the reservists who will staff fleet hospital 20 conduct their 
training at navy facilities in pennsylvania delaware and new 
jersey the units headquarters is in philadelphia fleet hospital 
22 is staffed by reservists who train in kansas colorado wyoming 
nebraska and missouri with headquarters in olathe kan 
besides the fleet hospitals and mash units the pentagon has 
sent an undisclosed number of air force airtransportable hospitals 
with 50 beds each combat support hospitals with 200 beds apiece 
and evacuation hospitals with 400 beds each 
also in the gulf area are two navy hospital ships the mercy and 
the comfort each with 1000 beds

federal research funds at stanford university 
are paying for flowers refurbishing a grand piano and until 
recently depreciation on a 72foot yacht 
the billings were uncovered by the house energy and commerce 
investigations subcommittee which is looking into possible abuses 
by universities of federal research grant programs 
the panel chaired by rep john dingell dmich plans hearings 
on the subject possibly as early as january 
the subcommittees findings prompted the office of naval 
research which oversees federal research grants to stanford to 
send a fivemember team to stanford beginning monday the team 
will look into the universitys billing practices 
following inquiries from the subcommittee stanford announced it 
had erroneously charged the government for 184000 in depreciation 
costs on the universityowned yacht several boats and some 
athletic department equipment 
we were redfaced with embarrassment when the depreciation 
was discovered larry horton stanford associate vice president for 
public affairs said friday 
the university will correct the mistake and depreciation charges 
wont be made against the federal government horton said 
stanford confirmed that the government is paying for the piano 
refurbishment floral arrangements and installation of cedar lining 
in a closet all at the home of university president donald 
kennedy 
congressional investigators said the amounts were 700 for the 
piano 500 a month for the flowers and 800 for the closet horton 
said the university has the billings under review 
stanford receives more than 240 million annually in federal 
research grants much of it for overhead costs for buildings 
supplies and administrative services 
the money for the flowers grand piano and cedar lining in the 
closet came out of the overhead and congressional investigators 
said federal guidelines may allow such payments it will depend on 
whether the costs pertain to researchrelated activities such as 
symposiums conferences or seminars 
auditors from the general accounting office an arm of congress 
are looking into the mtter 
dingells subcommittee in the mid1980s delved into soaring 
overhead costs in pentagon contracting the panel is looking at the 
same thing in governmentfunded research in academia where 
overhead rates have been climbing 
stanfords rate of 74 percent is one of the highest in the 
nation eight years ago it was 58 percent the 74 percent rate 
means that when a professor gets a 100000 grant the government 
must pay an additional 74000 for indirect overhead costs

president bush wants aides to move quickly to 
assess a dispute over minorityonly college scholarships that for 
the second time in two months has set him against leading civil 
rights groups 
bush told reporters friday he has ordered his staff to get a 
quick readout on an education department officials ruling that 
it is illegal for federally aided colleges to offer scholarships 
solely on the basis of race 
the ruling which could affect scholarship programs at thousands 
of colleges and universities nationwide drew the immediate ire of 
civil rights groups they claimed it was further proof that the 
administration holds minority issues in low regard 
bush faced a barrage of criticism from civil rights leaders 
after he vetoed a major antidiscrimination bill on oct 23 he 
argued that some provisions of the legislation would lead to quota 
systems in hiring minorities 
the white house was caught by surprise by the scholarship 
ruling and analysts said the president probably will move to 
overturn it rather than face another runin over his civil rights 
policies 
the democraticcontrolled house education and labor committee is 
to open hearings wednesday on the scholarship issue giving critics 
a platform to take bushs policies to task 
the ruling was based on title six of the 1964 civil rights act 
which prohibits discrimination on the ground of race color or 
national origin in any program or activity receiving federal 
financial assistance 
the education departments assistant secretary for civil rights 
michael l williams in announcing the ruling wednesday said he 
had warned fiesta bowl officials against offering 100000 in 
minority scholarships to the universities of louisville and alabama 
if they played the football game 
the bowl is among arizona sporting events threatened by boycotts 
after arizona voters rejected a paid state holiday honoring the 
late civil rights leader martin luther king jr 
bush defended williams saying he was an extraordinarily 
sensitive person i dont think anyone would accuse him of doing it 
on a racist basis 
williams 37 is a black lawyer who prosecuted racial crimes in 
the reagan administrations justice department and served as deputy 
assistant secretary for law enforcement in the treasury department 
before moving to the education deprtment 
meanwhile friday deputy education secretary ted sanders met the 
heads of six national education organizations to assure them the 
department is reviewing the ruling 
david merkowitz spokesman for the american council on 
education an association of colleges and universities said the 
meeting was really inconclusive it was evident the ball is in 
the white house court right now 
merkowitz said the administration must move quickly because of 
the tremendous amount of confusion and concern among colleges and 
students the message to potential students is that maybe those 
scholarships they are seeking are illegal thats devastating 
the ruling apparently does not affect federally backed programs 
for minorities or private grants directed at minorities what is 
at issue is any program that determines scholarship recipients 
solely on the basis of their race

an environmental protection agency report 
suggests a possible link between exposure to magnetic fields from 
electric power lines and cancer but the agency says more study is 
needed to confirm the relationship 
a draft report released by the epa late friday contained 
conclusions virtually identical to an earlier draft made public 
last june the agency said it was seeking comments from outside 
scientists before issuing a final document 
the report said an examination of more than 40 studies some 
dating back more than a decade suggests a causal relationship 
between exposure to electromagnetic fields from power lines and 
even household appliances and cancer 
but the epa cautioned in a cover memo that the agency is not 
prepared to conclude that such energy fields definitely cause 
cancer while some studies indicate a link others do not 
substantiate this association it said 
with our current understanding we can identify 60 hertz 
magnetic fields from power lines and perhaps other sources in the 
home as a possible but not proven cause of cancer in humans 
the report said 
as additional studies become completed a better 
understanding of the nature of the hazard will be gained 
the epa study was the subject of debate within the white house 
in recent weeks according to agency officials they said president 
bushs science adviser d allan bromley was concerned the report 
would unduly alarm the public 
the epa had been prepared to release the report last month but 
was prevented from doing so by the white house concerns officials 
said 
the agency cautioned in a cover note that the draft document 
should not be construed as representing agency policy or 
position until it undergoes further scientific review 
the report was being sent for further review by panels of 
scientists outside the epa so that disagreements among reviewers 
from various agencies about the weight of the evidence and the 
conclusions can be included in a final document said erich 
bretthauer assistant epa administrator for research and 
development 
the draft document was first made public last june no 
substantive changes have been made in its conclusions officials 
said 
the report which represents analysis by epa researchers of more 
than 40 earlier studies says the strongest evidence that 
electromagnetic fields may be causally related to cancer comes from 
studies of children who live near electric power transmission lines 
or who were offsprings of workers in electrical occupations 
several studies showing leukemia lymphoma and cancer of the 
nervous system in children exposed to magnetic fields from 
residential 60 hertz electric power distribution systems supported 
by similar findings in adults in several occupational studies 
show a consistent pattern of response which suggests a causal 
link said the epa report 
in addition it said laboratory studies on animals provide 
reason to believe that the findings of carcinogenicity in humans 
from exposure to electromagnetic fields is biologically 
plausible 
but the epa said at this time it could not show a definite link 
between cancer and exposure to electromagnetic fields because the 
basic nature of the interaction between such fields and 
biological processes leading to cancer is not understood

the personal tax exemption will increase by 
100 to 2150 next year the internal revenue service announced 
the exemption is adjusted each year to account for inflation as 
are the standard deductions the standard deduction for couples 
filing joint returns which is 5450 this year will go up to 
5700 the deduction for singles now 3250 will rise to 3400 
under a 1986 law incometax brackets are widened each year to 
avoid bracket creep the problem of taxes rising faster than 
real incomes these inflation adjustments known as indexing 
increase the amount of income a person may earn before additional 
earnings are taxed at a higher rate 
for example in 1990 a couple filing jointly could have 32450 
of taxable income before moving into the 28 percent bracket for 
1991 that figure rises to 34000 
these adjustments result in these tax brackets for 1991 
for couples the first 34000 of taxable income is taxed at 15 
percent the next 48150 is taxed at 28 percent and anything over 
82150 is taxed at 31 percent 
for single people the first 20350 will be taxed at 15 
percent the next 28950 at 28 percent and anything over 49300 
will be taxed at 31 percent 
as a result of a new tax law there will be no 33 percent tax 
rate after 1990 although a limitation on itemized deductions and a 
phase out of personal exemptions will have the effect of raising 
rates above 31 percent for upperincome taxpayers 
the irs also announced friday that in 1991 the standard 
deductible mileage rate for business use of a car will be 27 cents 
a mile up from 26 cents this year the change reflects higher 
gasoline prices and a 51centagallon tax increase that took 
effect dec 1 
none of the changes announced will affect 1990 tax returns 
which are due by next april 15

former national security adviser john m 
poindexter is asking a federal appeals court to overturn his five 
felony convictions for lying to congress about the irancontra 
affair 
attorneys for poindexter who served as president reagans 
national security adviser from late 1985 until the scandal became 
public nearly a year later contended in the friday filing that 
prosecutors had produced insufficient evidence to sustain the 
convictions 
they also argued that prosecutors failed to prove that 
references to testimony that poindexter gave under a limited grant 
of immunity from prosecution to congress had not unfairly 
influenced jurors and witnesses at the criminal trial 
in july a split federal appellate panel set aside the 
irancontra convictions of former white house aide oliver l north 
on the ground that his congressionally immunized testimony may have 
unfairly influenced his trial 
poindexter was sentenced to six months in prison last spring 
after his conviction on the five felony counts tied to the 
irancontra coverup 
among other things the defense argued that poindexter could not 
be convicted of lying to congress for sending a misleading but 
literally true letter in response to legislative queries about 
whether members of the white house staff were secretly aiding 
nicaraguan rebels 
letters he sent in july 1986 to the house foreign affairs and 
intelligence committees endorsing statements made in 1985 by his 
predecessor robert mcfarlane may have been misleading but were 
literally true the defense said 
mcfarlane had denied in his 1985 letters that north and other 
national security council aides were helping provide military aid 
to nicaraguan rebels when such assistance was banned by congress 
poindexter called congresss attention to mcfarlanes earlier 
statements and correctly paraphrased what mcfarlane had said the 
defense said but poindexter stopped short of affirming that 
mcfarlanes statements either had been true when made or remained 
true one year later said the brief filed in the us circuit 
court of appeals for the district of columbia 
it is not a crime to make evasive even intentionally 
misleading but literally true statements when testifying under 
oath in court the brief said nor is it a crime to make 
similar but unsworn statements to congress in an effort to 
influence a legislative inquiry poindexters lawyers said 
vigorous political advocacy and that is what is involved 
when an administration is seeking to dissuade congress from 
enacting a law that it dislikes involves a skillful interweaving 
of fact and argument there is no clear distinction in this context 
between efforts to persuade to evade or to mislead 
poindexters lawyers argued that a debate over political 
morality should not be joined before a jury in a criminal trial 
the defense also argued that us district judge harold h 
greene gave erroneous jury instructions and that prosecutors failed 
to prove that poindexter had committed the other crimes for which 
he was convicted

the crushing air power of the united 
states and its allies would likely devastate iraq in the first days 
of war most analysts say but there are more questions than 
answers about what would happen next 
as gen h norman schwarzkopf the us commander in saudi 
arabia noted recently the destruction of iraq may not be in the 
interest of the longterm balance of power in the region 
american planners are perplexed about how iraq would 
function after a us attack says retired adm gene laroque a 
washington analyst 
according to regional analysts here are some of the questions 
facing policymakers in the west and the middle east along with 
possible answers 
q will the situation provoke israeli intervention 
a before his missile batteries are silenced iraqi president 
saddam hussein will probably have a chance to unleash a number of 
missiles chemically loaded or not at israel as well as saudi 
arabias northeastern oil fields 
q if israel joined the battle would this force a breakup of 
the alliance of arabs and western nations lined up against saddam 
a israeli involvement would embarrass the americans 
politically the egyptians syrians and saudis even more so 
q if saddam hussein is captured or surrenders what is to be 
done with him 
a theres no proof despite his cruel and repressive regime 
that saddam would lose a popular election in iraq for linking a 
solution to the kuwait crisis to israeli withdrawal from the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip he has gained support among 
palestinians and other arabs a war criminal trial might be 
counterproductive killing saddam would probably end the crisis 
but there is the risk that arab radicals would hail him as a martyr 
and unleash a wave of terrorism 
q if saddam is killed or flees who will replace him 
a saddams oneman rule has permitted no strong potential 
rivals the army where there have been some signs of dissension 
with saddams strategy is considered the only likely source of 
challenge to his rule 
q after crippling air strikes against iraqs military 
industrial and political infrastructure iraq would be an 
embittered shattered and confused home for 17 million people in 
the absence of strong central rule like saddams what will keep 
iraqs disparate population of shiite and sunni moslems as well as 
christian arabs kurds and turks together 
a the shiite majority about 55 percent of the population 
wants a greater share of power from the sunnis who make up 
onequarter of the population and who pull all the strings 
the rebellious kurds mostly sunni make up 20 percent of the 
population and want an autonomous state in a federation 
q would president bush be willing to keep us soldiers in 
large numbers in the middle east long enough to perform such a 
complicated and thankless task as propping up an iraqi government 
which because of its us support would be suspect to other arab 
nations 
a the americans if not their western allies are likely to 
keep some forces in the region for some time but congress and the 
american public are unlikely to stand for stationing large numbers 
of americans there for long iran and others in the region would 
not be happy with an openended us military presence a new 
regional security structure could emerge with an arab multinational 
force 
q iraqs grab of kuwait was based on the claim that it was an 
artifical state set up by the british following the collapse of the 
ottoman empire after world war i might not neighbors make similar 
claims against a defeated iraq 
a when independent turkey was set up under ataturk after world 
war i the turks claimed the oilproducing province of mosul where 
there was a majority of turks and kurds but british empire 
builders arranged for mosul to be included in iraq which was under 
their control 
iran has not forgotten how saddam invaded in 1980 taking 
advantage of the weakness of the unconsolidated islamic revolution 
and leading to an eightyear war that caused 1 million casualties 
by conservative estimates the oilfields in southeast iraq would be 
a tempting prize for iran 
q would syrian president hafez assad saddams arab archrival 
want to grab a chunk of neighboring iraq if it collapses 
a assad has pledged 15000 troops to the multinational force in 
saudi arabia and has several divisions of his 300000man army 
deployed along his southeastern border with iraq he may grab what 
he could if everyone else started taking a bite of iraq

czechoslovakia has refused to 
immediately shut down a potentially dangerous nuclear plant near 
the austrian border but agreed to quickly investigate the plant 
an austrian commission reported thursday that a serious accident 
could occur any time at the bohunice nuclear plant 75 miles from 
vienna and about half that distance from bratislava capital of the 
slovak republic 
accidents with radioactivity release comparable to the 
accident in chernobyl cannot be excluded the report said the 
april 1986 chernobyl disaster killed at least 31 people and 
contaminated vast areas of the ukraine and byelorussia 
austrian ambassador karl peterlik handed czechoslovak premier 
marian calfa a copy of the report and a letter from austrian 
chancellor franz vranitzky demanding the immediate closure of 
bohunices two reactors 
austria has offered since the summer to supply free electricity 
to make up the shortfall 
calfa promised that a government commission appointed thursday 
would report on bohunice by dec 31 
the state news agency ctk quoted zdenek kriz a czechoslovak 
nuclear expert who has investigated the sovietdesigned plant as 
saying he did not expect it to shut down in the next two years 
the two bohunice reactors operating since 1985 provide vital 
power for bratislava a shutdown would create a deficit of 880 
megawatts of electricity officials say 
czechoslovakia relies on nuclear power for about 27 percent of 
its electricity according to 1989 statistics of the international 
atomic energy agency 
czechoslovak leaders have lamented unsafe nuclear energy but 
say the country lacks other energy sources to replace highsulphur 
brown coal whose combustion has ruined vast tracts of forest in 
northern czechslovakia 
i want to shut down all nuclear reactors in the country but i 
dont know how to do it czechoslovakias minister of 
environment josef vavrousek said in a recent interview 
the ctk report quoted manfred heindler the head of the austrian 
commission as saying experts agreed on the status of the reactor 
but differed on how to resolve the problem 
czechoslovak experts favor general reconstruction while 
austria does not consider such a solution sufficient heindler 
said 
austrians voted in a national referendum in 1978 not to fire up 
the only nuclear power station built in their country

members of the national council on the arts 
have rejected a plan to require either written or oral guidelines 
on decency for the national endowment for the arts grantjudging 
panels 
instead the council decided to comply with congress new 
decency standard by ensuring that its panels of outside 
experts who review applications for federal arts grants reflect 
the widest possible diversity of american cultural values 
the neas presidentially appointed advisory body met informally 
friday to discuss the implications of legislation congress approved 
in october 
after the vote endowment chairman john e frohnmayer expressed 
approval of the councils approach and said im not going to be 
the decency czar here 
when it approved a 174 million budget for the arts endowment 
this year congress repealed a yearold obscenity ban and 
substituted a requirement that the nea take general standards of 
decency into account when awarding federal grant money 
both restrictions were prompted by conservative lawmakers 
criticism of nea support for exhibitions of controversial works by 
photographer robert mapplethorpe and artist andres serrano that 
were denounced as obscene and blasphemous 
though milder than the obscenity ban the new decency standard 
has stirred emotional fire from some artists and arts supporters 
who contend that it also would hamper freedom of expression 
in a statement read at fridays council meeting members of the 
nea panel on opera and musical theater declared their unanimous 
opposition to the decency standard and said they would disregard 
it

a wobble that threatens a 750 million 
mission to explore the sun might have been prevented if designers 
had used silver coating rather than copper on one part of the 
ulysses spacecraft a nasa official says 
nasa revealed this week that ulysses began wobbling in space 
nearly a month after its oct 6 launch 
officials said as much of 90 percent of the crafts 
transmissions could be disrupted in the wobbling persists when 
ulysses begins transmitting information about the suns poles to 
earth in 1994 
scientists believe the wobble may have been caused by the sun 
warping an antenna boom on the spacecraft 
if thats so there are a number of things you could have done 
during design to minimize or eliminate the problem said henry 
hoffman head of nasas spacecraft guidance and control branch at 
goddard space flight center 
while most of the spacecraft is covered with reflective 
insulation hoffman said the antenna boom is made of 
copperberyllium metal which gives it the color of a dirty 
penny 
if it had been coated with shiny polished silver the 24foot 
boom might have reflected heat preventing it from bending and 
making ulysses wobble hoffman said friday by telephone from 
greenbelt md 
but edgar page the european space agency coordinator for nasas 
jet propulsion laboratory said he didnt fault the spacecrafts 
main contractor dornier deutsche aerospace of germany 
its very hard to pin this down and allocate blame he said 
hoffman also said engineers have not confirmed suspicions that a 
heatwarped antenna boom is to blame although he said its the 
only scenario i can conceive of at the moment 
the 250 million ulysses is the centerpiece of a 750 million 
joint mission by the national aeronautics and space administration 
and the european space agency 
the wobble is yet another problem for nasa others include a 
flawed mirror on the hubble space telescope space shuttle fuel 
leaks and a malfunctioning astro observatory that limited the study 
of celestial bodies during a shuttle mission this month 
if we cant do anything about it its very serious page 
said of the wobble we would stand to lose 90 percent of the 
data 
one solution he said might be for engineers to repeatedly fire 
ulysses thrusters during transmissions to stabilize the 
spacecraft if that works only about 20 percent of the data would 
be lost page said

portauprince haiti ap a few months ago the rev 
jeanbertrand aristide was in hiding the target of assassins 
supported by haitis traditional power brokers 
today he is widely considered the nations frontrunning 
presidential candidate 
the man who says his mission is to make life better for haitis 
impoverished majority has always been close to the masses since his 
ordination as a roman catholic priest in 1982 
dressed in white robes behind the pulpit of his slum district 
parish aristide delivered sermons that encouraged his parishioners 
to dream of democracy he became a symbol of hope for many haitians 
living under the cruel duvalier dictatorship that ruled the country 
for 29 years 
his most avid followers see him as a savior who will deliver 
them from repression and misery they endearingly call him the 
little priest because he stands about 5foot4 and appears 
frail 
aristide 37 wears thick glasses openly admits when he is 
suffering from depression and often cries in public 
his pulpit oratory is electric and attracts thousands who also 
call him the prophet an image he doesnt discourage 
like jesus i preach in the spirit of justice love and 
peace he said in a july interview god is not a man with a 
beard up in the sky god is you and me everybody 
to the ruling class many businessmen the military and the 
traditional church he is a leftist rabblerouser some accuse him 
of being a communist who will turn haiti into another cuba at a 
time when communism is dead 
a western diplomat speaking on condition he not be further 
identified said there are many concerns in business and industry 
sectors that aristides leftist leanings could lead to a closed 
market economy at a time haiti needs massive foreign investment and 
aid 
asked about this in a recent interview he said i have no 
intention to isolate haiti from the world 
from the beginning his passionate sermons encouraged his 
congregation to active nonviolence and they took to the 
streets to stand up for their rights 
sermons broadcast on radio reached peasants in tiny huts without 
electricity whose only contact with the political happenings of 
portauprince were batteryrun radios 
aristide and other political activists helped trigger nationwide 
uprisings against jeanclaude baby doc duvalier who fled to 
exile in france in 1986 ending a brutal family dynasty begun by 
his father papa doc francois duvalier in 1957 
he espouses liberation theology a belief that the church should 
get involved in the struggles of the poor he runs a home for 
street children called the family is life 
aristide was ousted in december 1988 by his salesian order for 
allegedly fomenting revolution 
he has been the target of at least three assassination attempts 
the last in september 1988 when thugs backed by the army stormed 
his saint jean bosco church during mass and killed at least 12 
parishioners aristide escaped unharmed 
depressed he went into seclusion and wrote a book truly the 
truth which he sent to the vatican as a defense of his beliefs 
he never got an answer back 
although he remains a priest he is prohibited from saying mass 
or giving sermons on the radio aristide has said he would quit the 
priesthood if the vatican opposed his holding public office 
jesus was not a priest he was a man fighting for justice 
aristide said 
he decided to run for president to counteract the candidacy of 
roger lafontant the selfproclaimed head of the dreaded tonton 
macoutes militia used by the duvaliers to terrorize the populace 
into submission lafontant later disqualified by the electoral 
council has vowed to keep aristide out of the presidency 
aristide was born in the southcoast town of port salut which 
in french means port salvation to a peasant family his father 
died when aristide was an infant and his mother moved with him and 
his sister to portauprince 
aristide studied theology and psychology in canada britain 
italy and israel hes fluent in italian french spanish english 
creole and hebrew

a prosecutor wont appeal the dismissal of 
a murder charge against the inventor of a device that an 
alzheimers patient used to kill herself 
however oakland county prosecutor richard thompson said friday 
the county will continue a civil lawsuit aimed at preventing the 
inventor dr jack kevorkian from using the device to help anyone 
else commit suicide 
kevorkians invention was seized by police and prosecutors 
obtained a temporary court order preventing its further use a 
civil trial to decide whether or not to make that order permanent 
will resume in january thompson said 
thompson said the dismissal thursday by clarkston district judge 
gerald mcnally of a firstdegree murder charge against kevorkian 
62 left many moral medical ethical and religious issues 
unsettled 
we think judge mcnallys decision was wrong he said 
but these profound issues should be decided by the legislative 
branch of government that branch which is preeminently suited to 
consider the consensus of society 
michigan has no laws against suicide or assisting in it but the 
legislature is considering at least two bills that would outlaw 
assisted suicide 
kevorkian a retired royal oak pathologist attached his device 
on june 4 to janet adkins 54 of portland ore who pushed a 
button that caused a fatal solution to flow into her veins 
thompson said there was no guarantee the michigan supreme court 
or michigan court of appeals would hear the case and that an appeal 
would drain county funds 
im pleased that hes not going to waste further taxpayers 
money on an appeal said geoffrey fieger one of kevorkians 
defense lawyers and i hope hell drop the civil case as well i 
hope he decides not to enforce morality through the prosecutors

albanian riot police and troops were 
called out in force today after workers burned and looted public 
buildings in four cities as europes last hardline communist 
government struggled to maintain control 
the unrest broke out thursday despite president ramiz alias 
decision earlier in the week to allow formation of opposition 
parties in a country that has been under rigid communist rule since 
1944 
a mob of about 1000 destroyed everything in their way 
friday as they stormed through the streets of elbasan about 18 
miles southeast of tirana the editor of the albanian ata news 
agency said 
albania radio reported police and troops moved into shkodra 
about 50 miles north of tirana after looting thursday by hundreds 
of hooligans who damaged buildings and wounded the local police 
chief and two other officers 
albanian media reported 10 people were hurt and 30 arrested in 
shkodra 
persistent reports this year spoke of unrest in shkodra and 
other northern areas that traditionally were roman catholic before 
the communists took over most of albania had been moslem 
police in tirana told the british broadcasting corp of fighting 
in durres about 20 miles west of tirana and saranda on the south 
adriatic coast near the greek island of corfu 
riot police and soldiers have been sent to the affected towns 
and are occupying the nations major highways the bbc reported 
the angry crowd in elbasan stoned official buildings broke 
windows looted food shops set fire to different shops cars and 
machinery said the ata journalist who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
elbasan a city of about 80000 residents with a giant steel 
mill was quiet friday night after soldiers and security forces 
moved in the reporter said no reports emerged on injuries or 
arrests there 
tanjug the official news agency of neighboring yugoslavia said 
albanian justice minister enver halili appeared on albanian tv and 
said democracy and socialism were in danger 
the rioting began despite president alias decision tuesday to 
allow formation of albanias first noncommunist political entity 
the democratic party of albania both the communists and the 
democratic party appealed for calm and a halt to unrest 
another factor in the crisis is the countrys economy which is 
in decline in part because of a devastating drought that has 
reduced harvests and cut hydroelectric power 
dan damon a reporter with londons daily telegraph told the 
bbc from tirana that the capital itself was calm today though with 
many security forces in the streets 
here in tirana the people do seem to be satisfied with the 
possibilities of organizing this new political party this 
opposition democratic party but outside in towns like elbasan and 
in shkodra clearly that hasnt impressed the people damon said 
popular uprisings last year toppled the other communist 
governments in eastern europe and alia wants to avoid an explosion 
of popular discontent over living conditions and decades of 
repression 
crowds in tirana gathered friday evening outside the palace of 
congress in anticipation of a meeting between the president and the 
new democratic party 
but the intellectual said the meeting never took place 
authorities apparently felt no meeting was needed because all 
that must be done and said has been done and said he said no 
more words now we must work 
the opposition had been expected to present its platform for 
economic reforms and adherence to international human rights 
guidelines

as recently as last month financially troubled 
eastern airlines falsified safety and maintenance records to keep 
planes flying on time according to confidential informants quoted 
in a federal affidavit 
the affidavit unsealed friday was given to support a dec 1 
raid in which federal investigators removed records from easterns 
miami headquarters 
prosecutors in new york city filed a 60count criminal 
indictment in july against eastern and nine of its top managers 
charging that safety records and other maintenance documents were 
falsified to keep its planes flying on time 
two eastern mechanics based at kennedy international airport 
have pleaded guilty to falsifying records and have agreed to 
testify against the airline during a trial scheduled for next year 
eastern officials denied falsifying records and said federal 
aviation administration inspections back them up 
the faas most recent inspections revealed that eastern was 
safe and that there was no evidence to suggest that maintenance 
records were being falsified the airline said in a statement 
issued in miami on friday 
eastern which has been operating under bankruptcy court 
protection since an unresolved strike began in march 1989 has lost 
millions of dollars its courtappointed trustee martin r shugrue 
jr has predicted the airline will begin to break even next year 
according to the affidavit an unnamed informant said easterns 
supervisors are under so much pressure to avoid delays that 
record falsification is the norm 
the affidavit said informants also reported that maintenance 
workers at hartsfield airport in atlanta routinely falsified log 
books to hide faulty navigation radar and other electronic 
equipment as well as bad tires and windshields that leaked air 
one informant in atlanta said he witnessed supervisors on 
almost a daily basis falsifying log books to make it appear that 
inoperative cockpit instruments had been repaired when in reality 
they had not been repaired the affidavit said 
investigators said the document was based on conversations with 
13 informants many of those people as well as most of the 
managers who allegedly falsified the records are still employed by 
the airline the affidavit said 
no one involved was named in the affidavit 
eastern officials protested the documents release us 
district judge i leo glasser ruled last week that it could be made 
public but held off releasing it until eastern had time to appeal 
the us court of appeals rejected the airlines appeal friday

a 7yearold girl in the middle of a 
dispute between her mother and the state over how to treat severe 
swelling in her joints was home today after the state relinquished 
custody 
juliet cheng won the right to use traditional chinese remedies 
on her daughter shirley who has rheumatoid arthritis state 
officials wanted the child to have surgery and won temporary 
custody in july 
shirley went home friday after five months at childrens 
hospital in nearby newington 
asked how it felt to be home shirley said its good and 
continued watching cartoons on television 
a judge awarded the state department of children and youth 
services temporary custody after cheng refused to allow doctors to 
operate on shirleys swollen constricted joints she cannot walk 
and usually uses a wheelchair 
of course im very happy but im also very angry cheng 
said this case is ridiculous it didnt make sense from the 
beginning it was beyond belief 
cheng who emigrated to the united states from china a decade 
ago wanted to continue treatment with the medicine of her 
ancestors acupuncture herbal medicines and massage 
two out of three doctors on a courtapproved panel recommended 
against surgery earlier this week after examining the girl 
invalidating an earlier court order permitting doctors to operate 
against chengs wishes 
on friday the state filed papers in juvenile court returning 
custody to cheng 
cheng who had planned to return to china to get treatment for 
shirley said she probably wont do that now and will instead 
continue shirleys treatment under the homeopathic physician who 
has been treating the girl for the last two months 
cheng has enrolled shirley in the first grade at a local 
elementary school where she is scheduled to start classes on 
monday 
doctors at newington childrens hospital had urged the state to 
intervene after deciding that surgery to ease the tension of the 
tendons and ligaments around the childs hips knees and left ankle 
was her only hope of walking 
the state won a court order in august allowing doctors to 
operate but in october cheng won a reprieve when a federal judge 
approved an agreement that gave her two months to follow the 
treatment of her choice as long as it was administered by a 
licensed doctor 
cheng could not find a traditional chinese practitioner who was 
also a licensed medical doctor so she chose dr william shevin 
who practices homeopathy a 200yearold alternative treatment that 
administers small doses of natural drugs which in a healthy person 
would produce symptoms like those of the disease 
shevin insisted that shirley improved under his care 
but the newington doctors said the swelling got so bad during 
the last two months that they sought shevins permission to treat 
her with naprosyn an antiinflammatory drug the drug helped ease 
the swelling said hospital spokesman thomas hanley

a london newspaper reported today that libyan 
secret agents acting at the request of palestinian terrorists may 
have planted the bomb that destroyed pan am flight 103 in 1988 
the guardian quoted sources as saying ahmed jibrils popular 
front for the liberation of palestinegeneral command probably 
turned to libya after german police broke up one of its cells in 
frankfurt a few months before the attack 
the guardian did not name its sources but said they are familiar 
with the investigation into the bombing 
on friday another london paper the independent quoted 
unidentified highlevel sources close to the public inquiry as 
saying they had conclusive proof libya was responsible 
the independent quoted its sources as saying the proof was based 
on analysis of a detonator fragment found in a field close to the 
southern scottish town of lockerbie it said the evidence had come 
to light in the past three months 
the independent quoted its sources as saying that the fragment 
was identical to one found in a radiocassette bomb seized from two 
libyan secret agents arrested at dakar airport in senegal in 
february 1988 
the boeing 747 was blown up over lockerbie on dec 21 1988 
while on its way to new york all 259 people on board and 11 others 
on the ground were killed the flight originated in frankfurt 
germany changing planes at londons heathrow airport 
investigators have said a bomb hidden in a radiocassette 
recorder caused the explosion 
a public inquiry into the bombing opened at dumfries near 
lockerbie on oct 1 it was adjourned on dec 7 until jan 22 
there was no immediate official comment on todays guardian 
report asked about the independent report on friday a spokesman 
for scotlands senior law officer the lord advocate declined to 
comment on what he called media speculation 
the guardian reported today the assumption until three months 
ago was that the bomb was planted by the remnants of the frankfurt 
cell and that it was of the same type found by german police 
semtex explosive to be triggered by an altimeter sensitive to 
height in a toshiba radiocassette recorder 
investigators now believe the trigger was a simple timer 
device of the kind found in the luggage of two libyan agents 
arrested in dakar in 1988 it said 
sources emphasize however that the libyan connection does 
not rule out the original assumptions that jibril syria and iran 
were involved american officials believe that the attack was 
conceived as revenge for the accidental downing of an iranian 
airbus in the gulf the newspaper said 
a missile fired by a us warship downed an iran air jetliner in 
july 1988 killing all 290 people on the plane 
the report in the guardian said damascusbased jibril is 
believed to have had help in the past from libyan leader col 
moammar gadhafi jibril a former syrian army officer has denied 
any involvement in the explosion

authorities in the capital executed 16 people 
this week for extremely evil crimes a newspaper reported 
today in part of a sweeping crackdown on delinquents 
police have arrested hundreds of thousands of people and 
executed hundreds of them since the campaign began in may 
the londonbased human rights group amnesty international says 
more than 250 death sentences were reported in june and july alone 
and that the pace has picked up since then the government hasnt 
said how many people have been put to death 
the beijing evening news report gave no information on the 
crimes committed by the 16 other than to say they were criminals 
who committed extremely evil crimes without whose execution the 
public indignation could not be quelled 
after being sentenced at mass meetings the prisoners were taken 
to the execution ground and shot the report said executions in 
china are by a bullet to the back of the head 
the chinese have handed down the death penalty for crimes 
ranging from murder to theft to poaching rare animals 
the same newspaper thursday reported a peasant sentenced to 
death for selling a young woman into marriage a custom that still 
occurs in the countryside 
theft and violent crime have surged in china over the past 
decade due in part to growing inequality in income as limited 
private enterprise has been allowed 
a radio station in the central province of anhui applauded the 
recent spate of arrests but added there has been no marked 
decline in the high rate of criminal cases on the contrary 
violent crime is on the rise

swiss officials say the united states must prove 
the money manuel noriega put in their countrys banks wasnt 
drugrelated before any can be withdrawn to fund the deposed 
panamanian dictators defense 
a us delegation is visiting europe to ask austrian and swiss 
officials to release millions of dollars to pay to defend noriega 
against us drug charges assistant us attorney michael sullivan 
said friday 
the delegation may also meet with officials of other nations 
said diane cossin a spokeswoman for the us attorneys office 
us officials have said noriega may also have money in french 
banks 
swiss officials expect to hold talks with the delegation next 
week switzerlands justice ministry spokesman joerg kistler said 
in bern 
but he added that if there is any evidence noriegas bank 
accounts contain illegal drug money swiss law requires that the 
government confiscate the funds 
we can only unfreeze in cases where it is clear that drug 
money is not involved kistler said the americans have to 
prove that to us 
noriega is charged with accepting 46 million in bribes from 
colombian drug traffickers to ensure safe passage of drugs through 
panama to the united states he surrendered to military officials 
after the us invaded panama in 1989 
after the invasion the united states asked european governments 
to freeze about 20 million that noriega had deposited in 27 bank 
accounts 
us district judge william hoeveler ordered 6 million released 
last june to pay noriegas lawyers but prosecutors said the 
european governments had begun their own forfeiture proceedings and 
refused to release it 
the judge said friday he welcomed the delegations efforts 
noriegas lawyers also praised the effort but said they may 
have to quit the case if they are not paid soon 
at some point you have to just say uncle said defense 
lawyer jon may 
hoeveler has proposed putting noriegas lawyers on the 
governments payroll until the issue of the foreign deposits is 
resolved but lead defense attorney frank rubino has rejected that 
idea he said the government would only pay the lawyers 75 per 
hour while 350 per hour is the normal amount to handle such a 
case 
rubino told hoeveler at a hearing friday that the defense team 
would not be ready to try the case before next june hoeveler said 
he would reschedule noriegas trial date but added that some of 
noriegas codefendants might still go on trial jan 28 as 
scheduled

just because the roman catholic church 
allows natural ways of family planning doesnt mean people should 
consider the methods a legitimate variation of contraception 
says pope john paul ii 
the pope said friday that an accepting attitude toward 
childbirth saves sex from the risk of falling to the level of 
mere utilitarian pleasureseeking 
expressing his strict attitudes on sex and contraception the 
pontiff told participants in a symposium on family planning that 
the churchs teaching on birth control often is misunderstood 
one stops in fact at the judgment on the moral negativity of 
contraception an always intrinsically dishonest act instead of 
viewing the teaching in the context of the responsibility for 
love and for life the pope said 
the vatican forbids catholics to practice artificial birth 
control but allows family planning based on abstaining from sex 
during a womans fertile periods 
the church holds that married catholics can postpone having 
children because of physical economic psychological or social 
reasons however they cannot completely avoid the idea of 
childbirth 
science today offers the possibility of securely pinpointing 
periods of fertility and infertility in women the pope said a 
married couple can use this knowledge for different legitimate 
purposes not only for spacing or limiting births but also toward 
the end of choosing for conception the most favorable moments of 
fertility 
the intrinsic connection between science and moral virtue 
the pope said permits in the end the comprehension that it is 
not possible to practice natural methods as a legitimate variant of 
a choice of closing oneself to life which would be thus 
substantially analogous to that choice inspiring contraception 
only if there is a fundamental willingness toward fatherhood and 
motherhooddo natural methods become an integral part of the 
responsibility to love and to life

the war in el salvador is the 
focus of a summit of six central american presidents gathering in 
this pacific coast resort city 
the leaders were to launch three days of talks today on ending 
smoldering political conflicts and on reviving sluggish economies 
the leaders planned to center their political talks on the 
conflict in el salvador where fighting between the armed forces 
and guerrillas of the farabundo marti national liberation front has 
recently flared anew 
unsponsored talks between the warring salvadorans have 
stalled over the future size and role of the armed forces 
the search for a dialogue to achieve a peaceful end to the 
salvadoran crisis is one of the principle goals of this summit 
said costa rican foreign minister bernd niehaus 
he said the presidents also would call for broader talks between 
guatemalan guerrillas and the presidential candidates facing a jan 
6 runoff 
niehaus also said the leaders will talk about the problems of 
panama where us troops helped snuff out a possible police coup 
on dec 5 and where the government has been struggling with labor 
unrest 
what occurred in panama in recent days is worrying and it will 
be discussed as the themes of security disarmament and democracy 
are intimately tied with the situation in central america 
niehaus said 
the first meeting was scheduled for 3 pm 4 pm est and the 
final gathering was set for monday 
participating are presidents vinicio cerezo of guatemala 
alfredo cristiani of el salvador leonardo callejas of honduras 
violeta chamorro of nicaragua and rafael angel calderon of costa 
rica president guillermo endara of panama which is not a member 
of the group of five was due to attend as an observer 
guatemalan foreign minister ariel rivera said the leaders would 
also discuss the regions military forces 
the ministers of costa rica and nicaragua have indicated 
interest in totally demilitarizing the region while el salvador 
and honduras with long records of military involvement in 
politics have expressed reservations 
the existence of our armed forces is not negotiable and an 
eventual reduction will be made when the armed conflict with the 
guerrillas ends said salvadoran minister jose manuel pacas 
carias said his goal was to equalize military forces in the 
region at between 20000 and 30000 men 
costa rica already has no military and nicaragua which until 
this year had the most powerful has reduced its 93000man force 
to 33000 soldiers

people who reported hearing a lion roaring in 
the vicinity of an auto transmission shop werent crying wolf 
police investigating the complaints friday found a 6monthold 
male lion at yonkers transmission where it had been living for 
four days 
hes really more like a kitten about 160 pounds said patsy 
tartaglione a partner in the shop in the new york suburb of 
yonkers but i guess the neighbors were complaining 
lt vincent fontana said he was reluctant to send an officer to 
track down reports of lion roars 
you get a lot of calls from people hearing things that dont 
check out he said 
but as calls persisted fontana dispatched sgt brian hill who 
asked tartaglione if he knew anything about a lion tartaglione 
said he had one in the back room 
he was vague about where the animal came from a friend of a 
friend dropped him off he said i really dont know who he 
was 
the lion was given a sedative and taken to a holding pen at john 
f kennedy international airport kathi travers of the american 
society for the prevention of cruelty to animals said the cat would 
eventually go to a zoo 
authorities did not file charges against tartaglione

the parent company of the daily news says its 
newspaper divisions profits have plunged more than 25 percent 
because of a weak economy and strikes at the newspaper and a 
companyowned paper mill in canada 
the chicagobased tribune cos newspaper division reported 
profits of more than 1587 million through the third quarter of 
this year down 412 million for the same period last year 
scott smith tribune vice president and chief financial officer 
said at a forum here friday that despite the losses the company 
still views the daily news and the paper mill as important 
investments for the future 
some 2300 workers represented by nine unions struck the 
newspaper on oct 25 charging unfair labor practices 
the paper has managed to publish continuously since then but 
publisher james hoge said its circulation has fallen from 109 
million to 600000 many major advertisers also have dropped out in 
recent weeks but hoge said he expects both circulation and 
advertising to recover 
hoge said after a tribune co board meeting this week that the 
company would not close or sell the daily news but would continue 
to support it 
he said the newspaper lost 115 million between 1979 and last 
year adding that figure could reach 200 million by the end of 
this year 
john s reidy managing director of the research division of 
smith barney said the tribune co was likely to stick to its guns 
the answer is they swallow losses as long as they want to 
particularly if circulation rises and advertisers come back he 
said 
meanwhile allies of the striking workers unveiled a new effort 
friday to get people not to buy the paper 
as news dealers have refused to sell the paper during the strike 
the daily news has recruited hawkers to sell it on street corners 
and subway platforms 
on friday morning the transport workers union bought 3500 
worth of copies of new york newsday the new york times and the new 
york post and gave them away at prominent locations where the 
hawkers gather including new york citys times square and grand 
central station 
strikers also held a fundraiser friday night at a new york city 
nightclub that they reported raised at least 40000 mayor david 
dinkins who attended called on the newspaper to resume 
negotiations with its unions

portauprince haiti ap the presidential campaign came to a 
close early today after about 10000 supporters of the rev 
jeanbertrand aristide a leftist priest regarded as the 
frontrunner held a final rally 
the campaign leading up to sundays election has been relatively 
peaceful though seven people died at an aristide rally last week 
he has blamed the attack on a supporter of the ousted duvalier 
family regime who promises to keep the priest from becoming 
president 
the capital portauprince was quiet this morning markets 
opened and festivecolored buses carried people to the city center 
independent radio metropole reported that only authorized 
vehicles such as vans used by security officers and the hundreds of 
international election monitors would be allowed into the capital 
on sunday the radio said the military banned all private citizens 
from carrying firearms sunday even those with licenses 
president ertha pascaltrouillot went on national television 
friday to urge her countrymen to vote she said peaceful elections 
would show the world that haitians could organize a democratic 
society 
the caribbean nation is trying to end decades of repressive rule 
and install its first democratically elected president 
haitis last attempt to hold democratic elections on nov 29 
1987 collapsed when assassins supported by the army shot and 
hacked to death at least 34 people at polling stations and in the 
streets 
in washington the state department urged haitians to avoid 
violence on the eve of the election 
the united states supports haitis electoral process and 
encourages all haitians to conduct the final days of the campaign 
in a peaceful atmosphere said a statement read friday by state 
department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
sympathizers of the ousted duvalier dictatorship are opposed to 
a transition to democracy several hundred international observers 
including former president jimmy carter are on hand to monitor the 
balloting along with 64 unarmed un military advisers 
the election campaign by law came to a close at midnight friday 
after the peaceful rally attended by about 10000 aristide 
supporters 
many chanted hallelujah and aristide is our president 
and danced as they waited for him to address the throng at the 
champs de mars central square in the capital of portauprince 
carrying poinsettas aristide was mobbed by admirers as he made 
his way to a bandstand where he led the crowd in singing the 
national anthem 
we are carrying the flowers of victory he declared 
marc bazin a former world bank official and finance minister 
also wound down his campaign with appearances in the capitals 
suburbs a favorite of the business class bazin is also believed 
to have wide support among the peasantry in the countryside 
about 3 million people are registered to vote for president 
bicameral legislature mayors and county officials the government 
has set up 14500 polling places polls open at 6 am and close at 
6 pm sunday 
haiti has been ruled by dictators virtually since gaining 
independence from france in 1804 the duvalier family reign ended 
in 1986 when jeanclaude baby doc duvalier fled to exile in 
france ending a brutal regime begun by his father the late 
francois papa doc duvalier in 1957 
there has been relatively little violence during this years 
campaign 
but fears of a bloody election were heightened on dec 5 when 
unidentified assailants threw a grenade and opened fire on people 
leaving an aristide rally killing seven and wounding more than 50 
others 
aristide blamed the attack on roger lafontant selfproclaimed 
chief of the tonton macoutes the former duvalier private militia 
lafontant denied his involvement in the attack 
lafontant returned from exile to run for president but was 
disqualified on technicalities by the electoral council he said 
this week he was determined to keep aristide from becoming 
president

european community leaders today lifted a ban on new 
investments in south africa to acknowledge the pretoria 
governments efforts to dismantle apartheid 
at the same time south africas main antiapartheid group the 
african national congress called for international sanctions 
against south africa to remain intact a special anc conference in 
johannesburg voted unanimously to ask the ec the us congress and 
all other international bodies to postpone any decisions on 
sanctions 
the ec investment ban was imposed in 1986 as one of a series of 
sanctions on south africas whiteled government 
although it will allow new investments in south africa the ec 
decided that bans on imports of south african iron steel and gold 
coins should remain until president f w de klerk fulfills his 
pledges to abolish apartheid 
the united states also has imposed sanctions on south african 
products 
the ec move was a significant recognition of de klerks pledges 
to institute power sharing with south africas black majority in 
the past year he has legalized the anc and begun powersharing 
talks with anc deputy president nelson mandela and other black 
leaders 
de klerk has pledged to negotiate a new constitution that would 
give political power to the black majority under apartheid the 5 
million whites control the government and economy and the 30 
million blacks have no national voting rights 
the anc vote came a day after mandela and anc president oliver 
tambo appeared to give differing views on sanctions in addressing 
the opening of the congress 
tambo said the anc must review its policy of supporting 
sanctions to keep pressure on the whiteled government to end 
apartheid noting international praise of de klerks reforms he 
indicated it would be wise for the anc to develop a more lenient 
policy on sanctions before foreign nations dropped them altogether 
mandela however said continuing pressure from the 
international community must be maintained he did not use 
the word sanctions 
the resolution adopted by the 1600 anc delegates today said 
sanctions must be maintained because basic institutions of 
apartheid remain in place in addition it alleged the government 
continues to use violence and police repression for political ends 
and that security forces have helped instigate violence in black 
townships around johannesburg 
the anc congress was the organizations first inside south 
africa in more than three decades

tehran radio monitored in nicosia said khamenei addressed 
ranking military officers taking part in the airsea exercises 
codenamed piroozi 1 or victory 1 
iran has spoken strongly against the presence of foreign 
military troops in the gulf region confronting iraq and khamenei 
referred to them as the enemy forces 
he said iranian military preparedness was important because its 
enemies are armed to the teeth iran stands ready to confront 
any unexpected situation in the region he said 
iran fought a 198088 war with iraq but iraqi president saddam 
hussein made concessions for peace after his armies invaded kuwait 
on aug 2 
the iranian maneuvers appeared to present no conflict with the 
usled multinational force because they were taking place near 
irans southern islands far from where the ships of the 
multinational force are deployed 
the maneuvers reportedly began wednesday but were not mentioned 
in the iranian media until today 
the radio said the destroyer sabalan which was rebuilt after 
being severely damaged in march 1988 by the us fleet protecting 
merchant ships in the gulf was launched by khamenei the rebuilt 
destroyer will be taking part in the war games the radio said 
it did not provide other details about the maneuvers 
the islamic republic news agency also monitored in nicosia 
said last month that the 10day exercises would cover 12000 square 
miles in the persian gulf and gulf of oman and involve 50 
warships 
several helicopters and hundreds of speedboats were also taking 
part irna said 
the news agency had earlier described the maneuvers as the 
biggest war games ever conducted by iran 
irna said the maneuvers would include amphibious operations and 
landings rescue of captured ships and underwater rescue of 
frogmen weapons to be used included surfacetosurface missiles 
and airtosurface missiles irna reported in november 
smaller naval exercises have been conducted by iran since the 
kuwait invasion 
the dominant islamic republic guards corps which has its own 
air military and naval wings and irans regular armed forces 
have often been in involved in disputes 
such internal strife was to blame for a string of military 
defeats in the iraniraq war which finally forced iran to accept a 
ceasefire in august 1988 
khamenei said he expected the guards corps and the navy to 
perform their duties 100 percent united

iraqs ruling revolutionary command 
council today insisted iraq alone will set the date for any direct 
talks in baghdad and accused president bush of lying about us 
proposals 
washington has rejected iraqis proposal of jan 12 as the date 
for a meeting between iraqi president saddam hussein and secretary 
of state james a baker iii the united states says that is too 
close to the jan 15 un deadline for iraq to withdraw from 
kuwait 
iraq alone has the right to fix dates for foreign officials to 
meet its president said the iraqi statement carried by the 
official iraqi news agency monitored in nicosia 
on friday bush told reporters in washington that he had offered 
iraq a choice of 15 dates in the next three weeks for highlevel 
talks and saddam ought to take one of them 
the iraqi news agency said a spokeman for the revolutionary 
command council whom it did not identify accused bush of lying on 
this point 
the american president bush only proposed two options either 
for the meeting to be held on 20 21 or 22 of december or on jan 
3 which we said were not appropriate the spokesman said 
bush originally invited saddam to receive baker any time between 
dec 15 and jan 15 however washington now says saddams proposal 
of jan 12 is a delaying tactic

european community leaders today wrapped up a key 
summit by approving 24 billion in emergency aid for the soviet 
union and issuing a statement that brought britain into the 
movement toward european union 
the community also decided to ease sanctions against south 
africa by lifting a ban on new investment and made a demand for 
iraq to withdraw from kuwait 
british prime minister john major endorsed the final communique 
which commits the 12 ec nations to work toward political union 
including common foreign and defense policies british officials 
said 
his signature ended at least for now britains 11year 
isolation over european union aspects of which his predecessor 
margaret thatcher opposed 
we have a menu for political union major declared our 
favorite dishes are on that menu so are others favorite dishes 
but the community has not yet decided what orders to place 
italian premier giulio andreotti the summit chairman said many 
difficulties lay ahead but told reporters what is important is 
that all the guests have joined the table 
in the final session of the twoday summit the leaders approved 
a 24 billion aid package for the soviet union including an 
immediate 1 billion of emergency food aid onethird in grants 
and the rest in credits the remainder was for technical assistance 
over two years 
the ec leaders also lifted the ban on new south african 
investment that was imposed in 1986 bans on iron steel and gold 
coin imports will remain until president fw de klerk fufills more 
of his pledge to abolish apartheid 
at the same time the african national congress south africas 
leading antiapartheid group called on all countries to maintain 
the economic sanctions 
the ecs final communique also included a strong statement 
demanding iraq pull out of kuwait 
complete iraqi withdrawal from kuwait and the restoration of 
kuwaiti sovereignty and of its legitimate government remain the 
absolute conditions for a peaceful solution of the crisis the 
resolution said 
responsibility for peace lies with the iraqi government by 
complying fully with the demands of the un security council 
including complete withdrawal from kuwait by jan 15 it said 
the date is the deadline the united nations has given iraq to 
pullout or face possible attack by a multinational force that 
includes european troops planes and ships 
france and italy had pressed for iraq to be given specific 
assurances that it would not be attacked if it withdraws from 
kuwait 
but the resolution was in line with a presummit call to the 
community by president bush who urged them not to weaken the 
antiiraq alliance following iraqs release of foreign hostages 
italian foreign minister gianni de michelis said the community 
had no intention of holding talks with iraqi foreign minister tariq 
aziz until after he meets with bush 
the ec last week invited aziz to rome after his trip to 
washington but azizs us visit scheduled for monday has been 
put on hold while the united states and iraq quarrel over the date 
of secretary of state james a baker iiis subsequent trip to 
baghdad 
britains concessions on european marked a reversal from the 
previous summit in late october when mrs thatcher loudly objected 
to the other nations plans for european union her position 
angered many members of her conservative party and led eventually 
to mrs thatchers nov 28 resignation 
britain under major has not dropped its opposition to the 
centerpiece of the economic union plan agreed by the other 11 at 
the october summit the establishment of a single central bank by 
1994 as a prelude to one currency for the community 
nor does he accept proposals that would give the ec powers over 
areas ranging from health education and social policy to national 
taxation policies but major has accepted the idea ofa formal role 
for the community in security 
he also has adopted a markedly more conciliatory tone than mrs 
thatcher 
it is not a matter of changing policy said another top 
british official but in some ways it can be easier for a new 
face to explain our overall policies

health officials obeyed a judges order and 
removed a feeding tube that has kept a comatose woman alive for 
seven years a spokeswoman said today 
doctors say 33yearold nancy cruzan whose case has sparked a 
landmark legal battle since she was injured in a 1983 traffic 
accident will die in a couple of weeks 
lester and joyce cruzan were at their daughters side when 
jasper county probate judge charles teels ruling was announced 
friday they had fought since 1987 to have the tube removed taking 
the case all the way to the us supreme court 
barbara shoun a spokeswoman at the missouri rehabilitation 
center in mount vernon where ms cruzan is being cared for said 
the tube was removed only a couple of hours after the judges 
decision was issued but the cruzan family asked that that fact not 
be announced immediately 
i think they wanted us never to say when it happened she 
said but i feel that we have to let people know that we did 
comply with the court order 
ms cruzan will be cared for until the end which could be two 
weeks three weeks said mrs shoun were not sure of how long 
it will take 
although food and water was withdrawn ms cruzan will continue 
to receive medication mainly sedatives and doctors said she 
should die peacefully 
because of nancy i suspect hundreds of thousands of people 
can rest free knowing that when death beckons they can meet it 
facetoface with dignity free from the fear of unwanted and 
useless medical treatment lester cruzan who goes by the name 
joe said in a statement issued through the familys lawyer 
in his twopage order teel said he believed there was clear 
and convincing evidence that ms cruzan would want to die there 
was no evidence she would continue her present existence 
hopeless as it is and slowly progressively worsening he said 
the state opposed the cruzans requests to remove the tube and 
teels 1988 ruling on behalf of the parents was overturned 
the issue then went to the us supreme court as the high 
courts first righttodie case it ruled in june that missouri 
could require clear and convincing proof ms cruzan would want 
to die and returned the case to teel to decide whether such proof 
existed 
ms cruzan left no instructions about what to do if she ever 
became incapacitated however three former coworkers testified in 
november that she told them she would not want to be kept alive in 
a vegetative state 
william colby the cruzans attorney said after the ruling was 
issued firday that the family was relieved and hopeful that it 
will soon be over 
they believe without question that if nancy could talk to us 
today shed say this is completely ridiculous stop this medical 
treatment im unconscious im never going to wake up stop it 
let me go on let my family go on he said 
ms cruzan suffered severe brain damage when her car overturned 
on jan 11 1983 doctors have said her condition is irreversible 
ms cruzans courtappointed guardian and her personal physician 
favored removing the feeding tube 
missouri citizens for life on friday appealed to gov john 
ashcroft to seek a stay of the ruling but ashcroft said that was 
impossible because the state was no longer a party to the case it 
withdrew after the high court set the legal standard 
another group called the ruling cruel 
we weep for nancy beth cruzan and the nameless others who will 
be cruelly put to death because others consider them to be social 
economic or emotional burdens said rita marker director of the 
international antieuthanasia task force in ohio 
ms cruzan suffers from a variety of ailments including 
seizures vomiting bleeding gums and severely contorted limbs her 
care costs missouri taxpayers more than 112000 a year the 
rehabilitation center said 
with nourishment she could remain in that condition for 40 
years doctors have said 
cruzan said this week that the coming days will be hard for his 
family which includes two other daughters 
in a lot of ways its like going back to 1983 no matter how 
much you prepare yourself its difficult to go through i know 
were going to face those feelings in the next few months he 
said

cambodian premier hun sen said today he 
would meet his guerrilla opponents in paris this week phnom penhs 
official spk news agency reported 
hun sen said he would arrive in the french capital on friday to 
attend a meeting of cambodias supreme national council according 
to the report monitored in bangkok 
the council was formed under a peace plan for cambodia first 
announced in late august by the five permanent members of the 
united nations security council britain china france the 
soviet union and the united states 
the supreme national council consists of six members from the 
phnom penh government and six from the threefaction guerrilla 
coalition fighting it it was intended to serve as the main 
reconciliation body under the un plan 
the peace plan envisions a major un role in cambodia to allow 
for general elections the warring factions have accepted it in 
principle but fighting continues 
the supreme national council convened once in bangkok in 
midseptember but the meeting broke up because it failed to agree 
on how guerrilla chief prince norodom sihanouk should join as 
chairman 
hun sen last week proposed reconvening the council in bangkok 
he said he was now going to paris after receiving an invitation 
from french foreign minister roland dumas and indonesian foreign 
minister ali alatas 
france and indonesia cochair the paris international conference 
on cambodia the forum under which a cambodian peace is supposed 
eventually to be agreed 
the invitation suggested opening the meeting on wednesday hun 
sen said it was impossible for him to be in paris before friday 
an spk report earlier today quoted hun sen as saying any 
settlement should respect both cambodian sovereignty and the terms 
of the un charter 
hun sen has said in the past that the military contingent 
proposed under the un plan should not be a peacekeeping force or 
a heavily armed fighting unit 
he has also insisted that the two rival cambodian governments 
continue to function in the period before elections and that un 
supervision of key phnom penh ministries under the plan should be 
limited 
there is a demarcation line between the cambodian sovereignty 
and the role of foreign countries the earlier spk report quoted 
him as saying 
vietnam installed the phnom penh government after invading 
cambodia in late 1978 and it has strongly criticized the latest 
international peace effort 
china is the major supplier of the guerrillas vietnam and the 
soviet union have been the strongest backers of the phnom penh 
side

a court on saturday sentenced a rightwing 
extremist to 12 years in prison for shooting a mayor who said the 
late emperor hirohito bore some responsibility for world war ii

outpouring of support for nagasaki mayor hitoshi motoshima and 
calls for greater respect for freedom of speech 
motoshima 68 was hospitalized for more than a month with 
serious injuries after being shot as he left city hall 
kazumi tajiri 41 a leader of a rightist group called 
seikijuku or sane thinkers school admitted that he shot

force the mayor to retract his comments about the emperor not kill 
him 
in his ruling presiding judge takeshi akatsuka of nagasaki 
district court noted the mayor was shot from only one yard away 
and said tajiri must have known there was a high chance that 
motoshima might have died

softly called for all people to work together for the future of 
japanese democracy

mayor told a city assembly meeting that hirohito shares 
responsibility for the war as well as all of us who lived in that 
period 
he said hirohito who died in january 1989 could have stopped 
the war earlier and spared nagasaki from atomic attack the united 
states bombed nagasaki on aug 9 1945 three days after it bombed 
hiroshima japan surrendered aug 15

after two years of scrubbing washington office 
buildings day and night jose ruano planned to bring the 8700 he 
had saved to his wife and child in el salvador next month 
those plans are now shattered 
the unchartered uninsured storefront investment company 
where spanish was spoken and where he had stashed his earnings has 
suddenly shut its doors now the 54yearold ruano and thousands 
of other latin american families who placed some 13 million with 
the company in many cases their life savings are wondering if 
they will ever see their money again 
i was going to pay off the debt on our house in el salvador 
ruano said through a translator wednesday its very bad 
with the economy stalling out some of the most vulnerable 
americans recent immigrants are being battered the hardest 
unfamiliar with customs and law in this country and in many cases 
here illegally they have entrusted their savings to neighborhood 
companies that offer ethnic comfort but little financial 
protection 
what were seeing is a whole community that is just 
devastated financially and psychologically said elaine grant 
executive director of the wilson international center a private 
community group that is helping victims like ruano 
adolfo torres the wilson centers office manager said 3500 
people had come forward so far saying they were depositors at the 
closed latin investment corp where ruano banked he said they 
claimed a total of 13 million in deposits an average of more 
than 3700 apiece 
attorney brian leitch who is volunteering his services to 
represent many of the depositors said many of the families had 
saved more than 10000 and a few had in excess of 50000 
were talking about one or more families in apartments 
pooling their assets to purchase a house or business leitch 
said this would be substantially all their savings 
it is unclear why latin investment shut its doors on nov 29 
it may have been siphoned off in a corrupt way it may have 
been put into bad investments said leitch 
but most officials following the situation say that at least 
part of the reason for the companys downfall is the weakening 
economy 
they apparently tied up a lot of their deposits in real 
estate said joseph lopes acting deputy general counsel for 
washingtons office of banking and financial institutions 
with the economy around dc slowing down people arent 
working two jobs any more they maybe arent working any jobs 
lopes said people started taking out more money than they were 
putting in and the cash reserve dwindled i dont know how savvy 
the guys running the business are 
fernando leonzo president of latin investment could not be 
reached for comment but he was quoted on dec 7 by el latino a 
weekly hispanic paper of which he is part owner as blaming the 
problem on the economic situation 
on thursday a federal bankruptcy judge ordered without 
opposition from leonzo that the company be liquidated federal 
agencies including the securities and exchange commission and the 
us attorneys office and several dc agencies are 
investigating 
the faltering economy mainly declining real estate values has 
been taking its toll on banks across the country through nov 26 
154 of the countrys 12400 commercial banks had failed this year 
and 190 of the 2900 savings and loans had gone out of business 
with mounting bank failures keeping their hands full federal 
and local banking officials say they rarely hear of companies like 
latin investment 
latin investment provided savings accounts checkcashing wire 
transfers and even made loans all without the required charter 
or federal insurance officials say they frequently unearth 
unregistered companies that wire money which sometimes are used by 
drug dealers to launder funds and ship them out of the country but 
fullservice firms like latin investment are unusual they say 
we see them very few times said tim mahoney director of 
the special investigations division of the new york state banking 
department in new york city 
but others say companies like latin investment thrive in big 
cities across the united states wherever large groups of 
undocumented immigrants live 
without the social security numbers that regular banks demand 
from people who want to open deposits many illegal immigrants have 
no real alternatives but companies like latin investment 
if you dont have a social security number and you cant open 
an account with a bank and you dont want to put your money under 
your pillow this is your option said lawyer leitch 
these firms escape the attention of regulators because they 
never register with the proper authorities 
this is absolutely not isolated said lisa navarrete 
spokeswoman for the national council of la raza the hispanic civil 
rights organization 
theyre not on any lists anywhere said rita soler 
ossolinski acting executive director of washingtons office on 
latino affairs theyre incorporated under all kinds of titles 
in washington latin investment has competitors who also provide 
banking services without being chartered or insured one of them 
the latin american investment group was jarred last week when 
depositors worried about latin investments problems began 
withdrawing their money in droves 
now officials in the capital concede that they are uncertain 
how widespread companies like this are 
weve seen this crack in the wall and we have a lot of 
anxiety about what may be behind it said lopes of washingtons 
banking office

in a few weeks the price of a prescription 
drug used to treat a common infection in women is expected to drop 
by as much as a third as stores begin to stock it for 
overthecounter sales 
the expected price drop for gynelotrimin from about 21 to 
25 now for a sevenday treatment by prescription to 1718 
follows the same pattern as for most products when they no longer 
require a doctors prescription 
industry representatives and analysts say companies can lower 
the price when a product can be sold over the counter because 
demand will generally increase and it is cheaper to produce the 
drug in larger quantities 
the pharmacys dispensing fee also is eliminated with 
overthecounter drugs one survey showed these fees ranged from 
150 to 15 per prescription said steve grote vice president for 
purchasing for retired persons services inc 
the companys marketing approach also changes as it appeals 
directly to the consumer rather than to the physician 
its the same drug but the physicians prescription isnt 
needed it becomes a product that is promoted directly to the 
consumer said ronald nordmann a pharmaceutical analyst for 
painewebber inc 
the average price of a prescription drug is 17 while the 
average cost of an overthecounter drug is around 4 said jack 
walden a spokesman for the nonprescription drug manufacturers 
association 
but sidney wolfe director of the public citizen health research 
group a consumer advocacy group founded by activist ralph nader 
said that even though nonprescription prices are lower most of 
them still are too high 
whether youre talking about prescription or overthecounter 
drugs people are getting massively ripped off wolfe said 
the lower price for nonprescription drugs is neutralized by 
the fact that the price of the drug is higher than it need be he 
said they figure theyll charge whatever the traffic will bear 
its still cheaper than going to the doctor but it could be much 
much lower 
in the case of gynelotrimin its manufacturer expects a 
significant increase in sales as this drug will be the first 
product available without a prescription to treat vaginal yeast 
infections 
threefourths of all women get this kind of infection at least 
once in their lifetimes and 22 million cases are reported each 
year according to scheringplough healthcare products maker of 
gynelotrimin 
prescription sales of the product now total 21 million 
annually said company spokesman lewis nolan we expect a 
significant increase in sales he said but he declined to 
discuss the amount 
the company plans to begin shipping its overthecounter product 
jan 2 and to have it in stores nationwide by the beginning of 
february officials said 
though the price of the drug will be lower outofpocket costs 
for some women will be higher since most health insurance policies 
dont cover nonprescription drug costs 
but for many women the overall price for treatment will be 
lower since they would not have to see a physician to get a 
prescription 
firsttime sufferers are advised by the company to see a doctor 
so they can get an accurate diagnosis but for subsequent 
infections women can diagnose and treat themselves the food and 
drug administration said in approving the switch for gynelotrimin 
last week 
sales volume generally increases for a variety of reasons when a 
product goes over the counter 
for one thing nonprescription drugs may be sold at 750000 drug 
stores supermarkets and other retail outlets nationwide compared 
with about 60000 outlets for prescription drugs said victor 
clough another spokesman for the nonprescription drug 
manufacturers association 
also americans are more willing to take overthecounter drugs 
because their confidence in them has grown as more successful 
prescription drugs have been switched to nonprescription clough 
said he cited such drugs as ibuprofen and hydrocortisone 
since 1978 the fda has allowed 45 active ingredients used in 
prescription medicines to be sold over the counter for specified 
uses walden said these ingredients are contained in more than 200 
nonprescription products he said 
the ingredient in gynelotrimin clotrimazole is already sold 
over the counter in an athletes foot medication called lotrimin 
af its nonprescription use for vaginal yeast infections is whats 
new 
ortho pharmaceuticals is seeking fda approval to allow its 
antifungal product monistat to be sold without a prescription 
company officials said

with nearly a million troops arrayed in the 
middle east because of a conflict that began over oil some 
environmentalists see oil fading as one of the worlds most 
important products 
the end of the fossil fuel age is now in sight said a study 
by worldwatch institute a private group financed by united nations 
organizations and private foundations 
while oil dependence may seem inevitable and permanent it 
could turn out to be shorter than the 200year age of coal the 
report said 
oil is a danger to peace a dangerous pollutant and not that 
cheap argued christopher flavin vice president of the institute 
he is coauthor with nicholas lenssen of beyond the petroleum 
age designing the solar economy a pamphlet made public 
saturday 
he said the choices in the future will be either a gradual 
transition from oil encouraged by government policies and market 
forces or a sudden emergency shift amid economic and social chaos 
the american petroleum institute which represents the industry 
disagreed 
the us department of energy forecasts that 40 years from now 
oil will still contribute almost the same proportion of americas 
energy supply that it does today it said in a statement 
in the future energy from solar wind and geothermal sources 
may indeed become more important components of the us and 
worldwide energy mix however it would be a mistake for the united 
states to pursue policies to exclusively stimulate these 
technologies the oil institute said 
worldwatch urged replacing oil by different forms of solar 
energy not only photovoltaic cells that make sunlight directly 
into electricity but windmills driven by air currents caused by 
different levels of the suns heat and the burning of plant 
material nourished by the sun wood sugar cane waste and other 
forms of biomass 
norway though an important oil producer already gets more than 
half its power from other sources electricity produced by its 
abundant forests and water resources worldwatch said 
many of the machines and processes that could provide energy 
in a solar economy are now almost economically competitive with 
fossil fuels worldwatch said 
it calculated that in 1988 windpower electricity cost only 8 
cents a kilowatt hour in areas where it is practical particularly 
denmark that is about its estimate for the average cost of all 
forms of electricity it said geothermal energy another way to 
produce electricity in some limited areas costs only about half as 
much 
but its figures show the cost of direct electricity production 
from the heat of the sun will come close to the 8cent level only 
at the end of the century 
robert j lieber a professor of government at georgetown 
university said the united states should reduce oil imports and 
use different sources of energy but that the policies of the last 
10 years have moved the country in the opposite direction 
solar energy in many forms can have significance over the long 
term he added the problem is how do we get from here to 
there 
he suggested that solar energy should not be considered a 
magic bullet but one of many ways of reducing dependence on the 
oil of the middle east 
world resources institute another environmental group issued a 
report last week favoring development of cars that run on different 
fuels to prevent future persian gulfs 
it noted that bmw and mercedes benz in germany have produced 
cars powered by hydrogen for research purposes and that general 
motors is already selling an electric van hydrogen produced from 
water would be a cheap and abundant fuel

the twolayer cake had a fake stick of 
dynamite for a candle a yellow hammer and sickle painted on the 
red wax the words on the cake said long life mr president 
it was a birthday party for the leader of perus shining path 
the most dogmatic and dangerous guerrilla group in south america 
he wasnt there abimael guzman known to his followers as 
presidente gonzalo and the fourth sword of marxism after 
marx lenin and mao has not been seen in public since 1979 
guzmans 56th birthday was dec 3 about 30 rebel inmates of 
lurigancho prison on limas slumridden eastern outskirts gathered 
the day before to wish him a long life 
we are celebrating the anniversary of the birth of the 
greatest living communist on the face of the earth said a 
shining path political officer who identified himself only as 
comrade fausto 
without president gonzalo we would have nothing we would not 
have achieved what we have said fausto who presided at the 
celebration in the dining hall of the rebeldominated cellblock 
it was visitors day as the rebel inmates watched almost with 
reverence fausto called a 10yearold boy the son of a prisoner 
to the front of the room he gave him a carved wooden rifle to hold 
and asked him to blow out the candle on guzmans cake 
its chocolate inside fausto said smiling broadly the 
flavor our president likes 
at least 20000 people have been slain since the maoist 
guerrilla group began its insurrection in 1980 most of the victims 
have been highland peasants who were killed either by the rebels 
for resisting them or by security forces who suspect them of rebel 
sympathies 
about 200000 refugees have streamed into the cities from remote 
villages guzmans followers have done more than 16 billion in 
damage they destroy roads bridges power lines agricultural 
research stations any target with economic value to this 
impoverished nation 
rumors spread in recent years that guzman a former philosophy 
professor was ill or dead but were discounted after police raided 
a rebel safehouse in an upperclass lima neighborhood in june 
they found guzmans thick eyeglasses a wig and sleeping pills 
in a bedroom but the elusive leader of the shining path slipped 
away before they arrived 
the escape was bad news for alberto fujimori who became 
president of peru on july 28 
unless fujimori devises an effective strategy against guzman 
analysts say he probably wont be able to pull peru out of its 
economic and social crisis 
gustavo gorriti author of a new book on the rebel group calls 
guzman democracys most formidable enemy in south america and

wanted to cross the street would go get her and help her across 
said luis guillermo lumbreras one of perus leading archaeologists

other acquaintances remember a tenacity and a gifted intellect 
guzman has since put to use in exploiting the constant crisis in

president bush retreated to camp david for the 
weekend perhaps gratefully following a week that saw one domestic 
policy calamity after another 
he left behind two awkward departures the forced resignation of 
lauro cavazos as education secretary and the rejection by william 
bennett of the republican party chairmanship 
and he had an embarrassing civil rights flap on his hands 
because of a college scholarship decision 
finally on friday in an attempt to end the week on an upbeat 
note the white house rushed out an announcement that rep lynn 
martin of illinois was bushs choice for labor secretary 
the announcement of martin to succeed elizabeth dole who 
resigned in october to head the red cross tentatively had been 
planned for monday but the paperwork was pushed through at the 
last minute by bushs chief of staff john sununu 
bush himself announced the decision on the south lawn of the 
white house as he prepared to board his helicopter for the trip to 
the presidential retreat at camp david md it was the first time 
bush has announced a major appointment without the nominee at his 
side in a formal setting 
martin back home in illinois could not have gotten to 
washington in time bush called to tell her the job was hers just 
an hour before he announced it to the world 
bush can only hope the coming week is less bumpy but the 
decisions awaiting him are not easy 
white house aides said they expect the president to act quickly 
perhaps as early as monday in announcing his choices for education 
secretary and for the chairmanship of the republican national 
committee 
domestic policy never has been viewed as bushs strong suit and 
after being on the road for three weeks visiting europe the middle 
east and latin america bush walked into a hornets nest in his 
first full week back in washington 
first there was the abrupt resignation of cavazos the first 
hispanic to serve in any cabinet after being virtually fired by 
sununu cavazos submitted a terse resignation letter to bush and 
wasnt even in town when it was announced 
white house aides conceded that cavazoss departure could have 
been handled better 
and even presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater seemed to be 
straining to pronounce the official line that cavazos had resigned 
i am not going to characterize this any way other than the way he 
would have wanted it which was that he resigned fitzwater said 
even more clumsy was the decision by bennett the former drug 
control director to turn down bushs offer of the chairmanship of 
the rnc just two weeks after he had accepted it 
bennett was told by white house counsel c boyden gray that hed 
have to give up a lucrative book contract and forgo outside paid 
speaking engagements for one year to avoid running afoul of ethics 
laws 
bennett decided to shove the job instead he left with a parting 
swipe at gray for allegedly changing his advice something gray 
denies 
his exit in a huff held the white house up to ridicule and drew 
glee from democrats democratic chairman ron brown said bennetts 
tenure lasted about as long as most of president bushs campaign 
promises 
clearly it didnt come out the way any of us would have 
wanted one senior white house official said 
meanwhile if the white house was snubbed by cavazos and 
embarrassed by bennett it was really caught off guard by a ruling 
by the education department 
without checking with the white house the agency ruled that 
colleges and universities could have federal funds revoked if they 
offered minority scholarships 
the opinion by an assistant secretary of education was 
denounced soundly by civil rights education and business groups 
were looking at it right now bush said on friday ive 
asked our staff here to give me a quick readout on that so we can 
make a determination 
fitzwater said the white house was caught completely by surprise 
by the decision obviously we like to know in advance of 
decisions that have wide repercussions but we didnt thats the 
way it happened 
add to the list of vacancies a critical opening on the federal 
reserve board manuel johnson left six months ago and the white 
house has indicated it wants to fill the position by christmas 
even on foreign policy bush had a spotty week 
although he won hearty bipartisan praise for his decision to 
extend 1 billion in agricultural credits to moscow to help the 
soviet union through the winter his efforts to nail down a date 
for secretary of state james a baker iiis mission to baghdad 
continued to be resisted by iraq 
all in all camp david must have looked to bush like a respite 
from the combat zone

the lawyer for sen donald w riegle jr today 
clashed with a former top aide to charles h keating jr in an 
effort to show the witness testimony has been inconsistent 
the witness james grogan acknowledged his testimony in senate 
ethics hearings changed over three days this week but he 
attributed the differences to documents that refreshed his memory 
the ethics committee held a rare weekend session today in its 
hearing on five senators ties to keating a major political donor 
no further hearings are scheduled until early january 
grogan has contradicted riegles testimony by telling the panel 
the michigan democrat arranged an april 2 1987 meeting between 
four senate colleagues and the top thrift regulator the senators 
were there on behalf of keatings failing lincoln savings and loan 
riegles lawyer thomas green reminded grogan that he originally 
testified that he first discussed a keating fundraiser for the 
senator during a visit to keatings phoenix headquarters in march 
1987 
grogan later acknowledged that there had been discussions about 
the moneyraising event the previous january he said documents 
refreshed his memory 
sometimes refreshing ones recollection changes ones 
memory green said 
i dont think thats fair grogan responded 
your memory had changed countered green 
i dont like that characterization said grogan 
friday grogan testified that keating bought access but not 
action when lincolns owner provided 13 million to the 
campaigns and causes of the five senators 
i believe senators only have so many hours in the day and if 
you make contributions you have a better chance of getting time in 
front of a senator said grogan former counsel and lobbyist for 
keatings american continental corp of phoenix 
but he told the senate ethics committee on friday i never 
got the impression that in order to take any action we were 
requesting would require a contribution i never got even the 
impression from mr keating that he expected certain actions from 
the senators because of contributions 
the grogangreen exchange today came as the panel marked the 
18th day of public hearings into allegations the five senators 
improperly intervened with regulators on behalf of keatings 
failing lincoln savings and loan of irvine calif 
the committee also is seeking to determine whether the senators 
actions were tied to the contributions keating provided or arranged 
for them 
grogan testified in public for the first time friday after 
receiving a grant of limited immunity from prosecution and 
undergoing two days of closeddoor questioning by the panel 
grogan 36 once earned 300000 a year as a top executive of 
keatings nowcollapsed financial empire whose parent was american 
continental corp of phoenix 
directly contradicting the sworn testimony of one of the five 
senators riegle grogan said riegle arranged a critical april 2 
1987 meeting between senators and the top federal sampl regulator 
edwin gray 
grogan also testified about instances where sen alan cranston 
dcalif and his chief fund raiser discussed political 
contributions or a campaign loan in the same conversations as 
substantive help for keating 
and he said keating conducted a firstever fundraising event 
for riegle after the michigan senator visited his arizona 
facilities and suggested a meeting with the top regulator 
along with riegle and cranston the senators under scrutiny are 
democrats john glenn of ohio and dennis deconcini of arizona and 
republican john mccain of arizona 
grogan said cranston agreed to call grays successor m danny 
wall to arrange a meeting between the regulator and keating in 
late 1987 he said keating made the request after grogan delivered 
250000 in checks for a voterregistration drive cranston 
supported 
on another occasion he said cranston fundraiser joy jacobson 
requested a 300000 line of credit from lincoln in case cranstons 
1986 reelection campaign needed it in its closing days he said 
she made the request after grogan had telephoned her expressing 
alarm about proposed legislation that would damage lincoln 
grogan said jacobson prefaced the request by saying now i 
want to switch gears and i want you to know this is totally 
unrelated the line of credit was extended but never used 
riegle chairman of the senate banking committee has told the 
panel i did not arrange the meeting april 2 riegle did not 
attend the session and denies he set it up 
is there any doubt in your mind that sen riegle arranged the 
meeting with the senators committee special counsel robert s 
bennett asked grogan 
no sir the witness replied

with more than 1000 soviet jews arriving each 
day both the immigrants and israelis are learning it sometimes is 
painful when dreams come true 
israels dream of gathering in the jewish exiles has become an 
acute reality this nation of 47 million will take in as many as 1 
million soviet immigrants within three years about 150000 have 
arrived this year 
the soviet immigrants dream of escape from ethnic unrest and 
economic ruin to a safe haven in israel has been shattered by 
government indecision and wrangling over creating jobs and 
providing housing 
both sides see hope in the future israelis believe the 
immigration will end their fear that a higher arab birth rate will 
leave jews outnumbered in their own state the newcomers envision a 
better life tomorrow at least for the children 
they rise before dawn to wait in line outside absorption 
ministry offices many waited silently even during the twoweek 
strike by ministry workers but some tacked up a sign in russian 
please end the strike stop torturing people 
the strike deprived thousands of immigrants of the government 
stipend their only income but the stipend is not enough to live 
on anyway 
a family of thre receives 18000 shekels a year the equivalent 
of 9000 down from the equivalent of 10000 in june now there 
are plans to cut it to about 8000 
even for a tworoom apartment the immigrants must pay up to 
6000 the stipend also must cover food and other costs 
the government is not allowing them even a minimum standard of 
living while at the same time making it very hard for them to 
become productive members of israeli society said vladimir 
glozman of the soviet jewry zionist forum an umbrella for 
immigrant groups 
two three even four immigrant families may share a twobedroom 
apartment the supply of rental apartments is expected to run out 
by march and absorption minister yitzhak peretz says tent cities 
soon will be necessary 
with the countrys unemployment rate fluctuating between 88 and 
10 percent many immigrants must survive on the stipend 
some gather spoiled fruits and vegetables thrown out by markets 
some women have become prostitutes another a mother of two in her 
20s said she is looking for a rich israeli who will feed us 
still there are successes people who got jobs in their 
professions and many examples of aid and kindness by israeli 
families 
there also are stories of unscrupulous landlords and employers 
of professionals who sweep the streets or wash dishes 
cardiologist eduard zaslavsky and his economist wife polina 
scrub the floors of jerusalems business administration college to 
support themselves and their 17yearold twin girls 
i was mentally prepared for any difficulties before we came to 
israel but i admit that this kind of work was below my 
expectations mrs zaslavsky told an israeli newspaper 
the immigrants are gradually replacing palestinians from the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip as israels lowincome workers 
they are the countrys new slaves as the daily maariv put it 
within months thousands of immigrants will mark the first 
anniversary in israel and will find themselves with no jobs and 
unable to cover rent with lower secondyear subsidies 
i dont know what to do said dioma kudriavtzev a 
20yearold russian student with a wife and newborn son we will 
probably find ourselves in the street 
the bulk of the immigrants accept such hardships in israel 
they say at least they have hope 
there is also despair 
in november a 53yearold woman from the ukraine jumped to her 
death leaving a note that said her husband had no work earlier 
this month leonid brun 53 hanged himself in beersheba he was 
jobless and his note said he could not adjust to life in israel 
although these are isolated cases some have criticized the 
government for its absorption failures the daily yedioth ahronoth 
recently ran a series of articles on immigrant absorption under a 
banner headline in russian proval failure 
israels 1991 budget for the first time allocates more to 
immigrant absorption than to defense spending traditionally a 
sacred cow in israel 
israelis are beginning to understand that immigration will mean 
fierce competition for jobs a further increase in high housing 
prices apartment shortages and overburdened schools and social 
services 
palestinians already complain about lost jobs and now israels 
800000 arab citizens fear their jobs and land could be taken away 
a bitter land dispute has arisen between nazareth ilit a city 
of 28000 which took in 5000 immigrants this year and the arabs 
of nazareth housing minister ariel sharon wants to settle 10000 
immigrants among the arab villages around nazareth 
a recent immigrant from tadzhikistan michael alterman went to 
work in a jerusalem metalworking factory and noticed his arab 
colleagues were disappearing 
they fired mahmoud who taught us everything said alterman 
it does give a bad feeling but i have to eat

what they get a family of three is entitled to an absorption

of household appliances the sum is paid over a year the family

some japanese worry that if the persian gulf crisis 
turns into a shooting war one of the early casualties could be 
japanus relations 
they worry that if us soldiers start dying in the desert 
criticism of tokyos lessthanoverwhelming contribution to the 
antiiraq effort could aggravate relations between the worlds two 
top economic powers 
when casualties take their toll and tv screens show body bags 
every day then the frustrations may be oriented toward japan 
said one foreign ministry official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity of course we are worried about that 
since iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait there have been 
complaints in the united states that japan heavily dependent on 
middle east oil and one of washingtons most important allies 
should contribute more toward coping with the crisis 
japan imports about 99 percent of its oil needs most of it from 
the middle east 
the tokyo government eventually pledged 4 billion although 
some observers said that assistance came only after pressure was 
applied by washington some us officials have also contended 
japan has been slow about paying what it promised 
a proposal by prime minister toshiki kaifu to allow deployment 
of japanese troops to the persian gulf for noncombat duty died in 
parliament amid strong public sentiment that the plan would violate 
japans pacifist postwar constitution 
so far the ministry official believes damage to bilateral 
relations has been contained the us ambassador to japan michael 
h armacost recently said the two governments have a track record 
of cooperation in the gulf 
but the real challenge may lie ahead 
armacost said washington obviously would count on the 
political support of the japanese government if force were 
required to enforce un resolutions against iraq 
it would be important for japan to respond to war by quickly 
issuing a statement expressing moral and financial support for the 
united states said seizaburo sato a political science professor 
at tokyo university 
if japan is perceived as not cooperating sato said then i 
think usjapan relations will face a really serious crisis 
maybe many americans will be really upset 
although the foreign ministry official insists japan will stand 
firmly together with washington the government often fails to act 
quickly in times of crises because of bureaucratic infighting and 
the diffusion of political power 
a slowness to respond could rekindle us frustrations that 
japan is not taking enough risks in the gulf crisis and not 
shouldering its responsibilities as a major economic power 
analysts say the danger of a deterioration in relations 
already strained by seemingly endless trade disputes would be 
especially great if a war were to drag on 
some people believe a persian gulf war would be one of those 
events that will remain in the american psyche a long time so 
whether japan helped or not could be something very significant in 
terms of bilateral relations said charles morrison director of 
the international relations program of the eastwest center in 
hawaii 
still the japanese government in drafting its response to a 
war would have to take into account the countrys strong pacifist 
sentiment and the unwilliness of some to unquestioningly follow 
washingtons foreign policy 
if the us government unilaterally starts a war without 
consulting japan why does the japanese government have to follow 
the policy in a 100percent way asked rei shiratori chairman of 
political studies at tokai university 
while there seems no chance that japanese troops would fight 
alongside american gis in the middle east deserts the ministry 
official said there were other ways in which tokyo could assist 
particularly through economic aid 
and he urged the united states to realize that not every nation 
need make the same contribution to the multinational effort 
well try to help those multilateral forces as much as 
possible in a way that is appropriate and allowed by the 
constitution the official said i dont think it is fair to 
expect everyone to do the same thing

workers on saturday began shutting down eastern 
germanys last sovietdesigned nuclear power reactor which was 
once on a blacklist of nuclear installations prone to catastrophe 
the fourreactor power station near greifswald on the baltic sea 
coast had supplied 10 percent of the electricity used by the 16 
million people of the former east germany 
but its shutdown was planned as soon as west german experts 
examined it after the berlin wall fell a year ago 
the last of the four reactors had been working at low output for 
months only because it also provided hotwater heating for 45000 
people and scores of factories 
the gradual shutdown of the reactor began saturday plant 
spokesman peter baier said the plant will be completely off by 
tuesday a hastily built oilfired plant is being put into 
operation to supply hotwater heat 
it was a deep worry that it went on so long said klaus 
schlueter an environmental official and former member of the 
interim noncommunist east german cabinet 
the problem is the metal is brittle and there were serious 
safety concerns this is the main problem with all the old reactors 
in this region schlueter said in a telephone interview from 
schwerin in northern germany 
greifswald the only nuclear power station in former east 
germany is not the only old soviet reactor creating worries in 
eastern europe 
among other cases austria wants czechoslovakia to close a 
tworeactor power plant at bohunice 75 miles northeast of vienna 
austrian chancellor franz vranitzky said his country would supply 
electricity at its own expense 
czechoslovakia lacking alternative power sources refuses to 
shut the bohunice plant immediately but has promised a reassessment 
by a new government commission by dec 31 
an international commission spent four months examining the 
bohunice plant and concluded that a serious uncontrollable 
accident must be expected at any time 
the commission said it could not exclude the release of 
radioactivity on the scale of the chernobyl disaster in 1986 that 
killed at least 31 people cast fallout over much of europe and is 
still causing serious problems in the soviet ukraine 
similar alarms were raised about greifswald early this year and 
the two germanys cooperated in a probe of safety conditions while 
reactors 2 3 and 4 were taken out of operation in february and 
march 
last january environment minister klaus toepfer confirmed a 
report in the newsmagazine der spiegel that a disaster had been 
narrowly averted in 1976 when a fire destroyed wiring to pumps in 
the plants emergency cooling system 
in may helmut hirsch of the ecology institute in hanover one 
of seven experts who examined the greifswald reactors said they 
were on a blacklist of the worlds especially dangerous nuclear 
installations 
greifswalds considerable safety defects threatened a 
catastrophic breakdown of the reactor pressure vessel he said 
with a 1960s soviet design greifswalds 440megawatt 
pressurizedwater reactors went into service between 1973 and 1979 
four more sovietdesigned reactors were being built there but no 
5 failed during its breakin period in early 1989 and never went 
into full service it was three years behind schedule due to safety 
changes introduced after the chernobyl catastrophe 
construction was halted on the other three reactors at 
greifswald 160 miles north of berlin and also at stendal about 
75 miles west of berlin there are no plans to build any other 
nuclear plans in eastern germany 
western germany supplied electricity to make up for the 
shortfall after greifswalds power was reduced early this year 
schlueter said the reduction affected politics in eastern germany 
during the early days of democracy 
the reactors meant jobs to almost 5000 people and about as 
many were working on construction for the expansion of the station 
he said a demonstration against the reactor closures was the first 
large public protest against the new politics in east germany he 
said 
now i believe most of the people know the safety problems and 
did not oppose the closing of the reactors schlueter said 
they learned how big the problem is 
schlueter added that environmentalists in eastern germany now 
were shifting their attention to the many reactors in the west 
which got 34 percent of its electricity from nuclear power in 1988

throwing new fuel on an old fire berlins new 
mayor said saturday that a federal decision to lift visa rules for 
poles will lead to a rise in crime in the german capital 
mayorelect eberhard diepgen whose conservative christian 
democrats won berlin elections dec 2 called for a repeal of new 
rules allowing poles to travel without restrictions to germany 
he contended in an interview on saarland state radio that an 
unregulated flood of poles will lead to a drastic rise in crime and 
black market trafficking in berlin 
he also asserted it would result in hundreds of thousands of 
shopping tourists each week in the city 
his comments were certain to increase ethnic tensions between 
poles and germans 
poles had been free to visit east germany and west berlin before 
german unity oct 3 but the government later imposed tough visa 
requirements that restricted the ability of most poles to visit the 
united nation 
poland invaded by nazi germany during world war ii bitterly 
protested the new visa restrictions and contended they were 
tantamount to ethnic and economic discrimination 
germany acquiesced to the complaints on friday the bundesrat 
the upper house of parliament approved rules allowing poles to 
come to germany and stay for up to three months without visas the 
rules take effect jan 1 
polish media praised the new rules 
until the tougher restrictions were enacted poles routinely 
came to west berlin to buy western goods difficult to obtain in 
their economically troubled nation 
many also bought goods to sell back in their native country and 
many others peddle a variety of products in berlin in order to 
obtain coveted western currency 
their ubiquitious presence has fueled resentment among many 
germans not always known for their tolerance of lessaffluent 
foreigners many germans are openly hostile to polish visitors 
extremist rightwing groups have based much of their support on 
demands that poles turks and other groups be thrown out of the 
country 
berlin was designated capital of the united germany but the seat 
of government remains in bonn the united german parliament likely 
will decide next year whether to move the federal administration to 
the historic city 
berlin authorities lobbying hard for the government seat have 
become increasingly sensitive about the citys reputation among 
some germans as a hotbed of radicalism rising crime and sloppy 
chaotic government

the nations largest sheriffs force is 
seeing its onceshining image dimmed by a major drug money scandal 
large brutality settlements and allegations of ganglike behavior by 
some deputies 
the 8000member los angeles county sheriffs department 
suffered its biggest blow just last week when a jury convicted six 
deputies all former members of an elite narcotics squad of 
skimming cash seized in drug raids 
the scandal led to a shakeup in the departments drug operations 
and jeopardized scores of criminal prosecutions 
all law enforcement people feel taited when something like 
this takes place said lt mike post who heads the 
vicenarcotics bureau for suburban glendales police department 
which sometimes works with the sheriffs department 
this years problems stand out because the sheriffs department 
has enjoyed a good reputation until now avoiding the highly 
publicized scandals of other large law enforcement agencies 
including those in new york and miami 
admirers have taken a new look at sheriff sherman blocks 
department and critics have held no fire 
sherman block runs a sloppy corrupt organization that finally 
got caught said stephen yagman a lawyer who has successfully 
sued local law enforcement agencies in brutality cases 
los angeles police patrol within the city of los angeles and the 
sheriff is responsible for the sprawling countys unincorporated 
areas the sheriff also works in the countys smaller cities that 
have contracted with the department for police protection 
block who was appointed sheriff when his predecessor retired in 
1982 and subsequently elected three times portrayed the drug money 
scandal as the work of a few bad deputies in an otherwise fine 
department 
its a tremendous feeling of betrayal block said calling 
the personal feeling of loss second only to an officers death in 
the line of duty 
acting in an investigation block initiated a grand jury last 
february indicted 10 sheriffs deputies including the head of a 
narcotics unit on charges they stole 14 million in confiscated 
cash and used the money to buy vacations boats houses luxury 
cars and electronics 
a federal jury monday convicted six deputies of stealing 48000 
in confiscated money and convicted a seventh of circumventing bank 
requirements to conceal large cash deposits the prison terms could 
go as long as 53 years 
the drug squad leader had pleaded guilty and testified against 
his former subordinates 
two more trials are scheduled for next year involving one of 
those deputies and two others the investigation is expected to 
continue with officials expecting more indictments 
all this occurred in a department run by a lawman glowingly 
described by his peers as being among the best in the business 
block whos been with the sheriffs department since 1956 
responded to the scandal by disbanding major narcotics teams 
changing some ways of supervision and limiting the time deputies 
can serve in certain units

were abused by sheriffs deputies in the lowincome suburb of

when hog farmer martin bubs 
hohulin told voters he would give away part of his legislative 
salary if they elected him to the house he was trying to show he 
thought state lawmakers are overpaid 
hohulin did win and now that promise has put the republican 
rookie into an unexpected legal jam 
back when i was a teenager i did some things i probably 
should have gotten in trouble for and now i get into trouble for 
something like this its wild the 26yearold hohulin said 
the snag state law prohibits candidates from promising a part 
of their salary to any public or private interest 
hohulin promised to donate 2800 of the 22863 annual house 
salary for college scholarships to eight high school students in 
the district 
it was my way of showing that i was against lawmakers voting 
to raise their pay said hohulin who hails from lamar the 
birthplace of harry s truman 
democrats raised the issue of the promise during the campaign 
and then filed a complaint after hohulin defeated democratic rep 
jerry burch a 12year incumbent 5051 votes to 4500 the 
missouri attorney generals office is looking into whether the 
promise violated the law 
if we find there is a violation of the law then we will 
prosecute said spokeswoman mary jenkins whose boss attorney 
general william webster is a republican 
she said the infraction would be a misdemeanor with a maximum 
penalty of one year in jail and a 2500 fine but no forfeiture of 
office state election officials said they didnt recall a similar 
case 
i honestly in my heart thought i was trying to do something 
good for the people in my community anybody who knows me knows im 
not a dishonest person hohulin said 
asked if he would make good his promise hohulin said he was 
waiting to see what the attorney generals office decided 
if i did something wrong im sorry but i dont know all the 
laws im a farmer not a lawyer said hohulin 
democrats said they arent swayed by hohulins remorse 
campaigns shouldnt be run on a bidding basis saying youll 
take less money than your opponent said state democratic 
chairman gene bushmann said if weve got the law on the books 
then we ought to enforce it 
few people in the district abutting the missourikansas border 
seem to view hohulins promise as the key to his victory 
they attribute burchs defeat to an antiincumbency attitude and 
a feeling by some that he was more interested in statewide matters 
than local problems 
house speaker bob griffin a democrat said burch just got 
blindsided because he was worrying too much about statewide 
issues 
burch who had a good shot at becoming house majority leader 
next year voted to spend state money to build a st louis sports 
stadium and to repair sports complexes in kansas city an 
unpopular idea in the conservative farming district 
everybody is upset over government spending too much money 
people were really infuriated over the stadium bill said doug 
davis publisher of the weekly lamar democrat they felt jerry 
sold them out and they felt they were going to have to pay taxes 
for the benefit of kansas city and st louis

the united states is preparing to organize 
shipments of medicine to the soviet union as pressure increases for 
western nations to go to the aid of the beleaguered gorbachev 
regime 
a us study of the seriousness of the soviets consumer goods 
shortage has confirmed there is no widespread hunger in the country 
and that adequate food is available if authorities can get it 
distributed said an administration official 
the medical supply problem is deeper and were looking at 
working with private groups to help relieve that situation said 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity 
americares a private relief agency recently announced it was 
dispatching 40 tons of medical supplies to the soviet union japan 
also has promised medical assistance 
the american committee on ussoviet relations recently urged 
the government to organize an international consortium to provide 
urgent shipments of food and medical supplies to the soviet union 
during the advancing russian winter 
president bush on wednesday outlined avaried economic aid 
package that included technical and medical assistance and support 
for the soviets to affiliate with the international monetary fund 
and world bank 
although germany and several other western european countries 
are organizing food aid programs the us government still sees no 
immediate need for such relief the official said 
long lines and inefficiency are different from hunger and a 
lot of people in the world are worse off than the soviets the 
official said he acknowledged however that the lack of food in 
stores and widespread and worsening trouble finding food cause a 
problem in social psychology and we need to calm peoples fears 
about what lies ahead as the soviet winter gets harder 
several european countries following the lead of the germans 
are shipping food to the soviets despite transportation logjams 
that have left many tons of supplies sitting on rail sidings with 
no place to unload several leaders have said the aid program is 
necessary to shore up gorbachev whose popularity and authority 
have been battered by the deepening crisis 
us observers say the europeans appear to be motivated at least 
partly by the fear that severe shortages coupled with the soviets 
easing of travel restrictions could cause a mass exodus of people 
fleeing the soviet union for the more prosperous countries of 
western europe 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has pledged to crack down 
on black marketeering and boost food imports to ease the food 
crisis 
he installed a longtime kgb officer and an army general at the 
top of the interior ministry to tighten domestic control in the 
face of deteriorating order and growing squabbles with the 
countrys 15 republics and he announced formation of vigilante 
committees to crack down on theft and diversion of food supplies 
from established channels 
gorbachevs reforms which were designed to open up soviet 
society and institute democracy have weakened the traditional 
power structures particularly the communist party which ruled the 
soviet union from its founding 73 years ago 
observers expressed both satisfaction and concern following 
gorbachevs recent moves to strengthen control over his 
disintegrating union 
a us analyst speaking privately said gorbachev is trying to 
reestablish central control to prevent chaos but in doing so he 
risks choking off a number of embryonic moves toward a market 
economy 
there are real problems with the food distribution system 
the official said but were starting to see signs of some very 
crude markets develop there is bartering going on black markets 
speculation it would be ironic if in the effort to exert order 
he ends up crushing those first beginnings of the transition to 
market 
gorbachev has begun a program to convert the centrally planned 
soviet economy to one controlled by market forces but there have 
been few concrete steps taken toward that goal 
for the short term we need to help calm public anxiety and 
support the soviet government which president bush has said he is 
willing to do the official said we will be ready to do that 
but in the medium and long term we have to make sure gorbachev 
doesnt take his eye off the fundamental economic reforms that are 
needed

the african national congress 
on saturday refused to back down on its support for sanctions 
against south africa a day after anc president oliver tambo urged 
a review of the policy 
the vote at an anc consultative conference was a victory for 
hardliners it clearly was timed to influence leaders of the 
european community who were discussing in rome whether to continue 
sanctions to protest apartheid 
but as the anc announced its decision the 12nation community 
announced it would lift a ban on new investments in south africa to 
acknowledge president fw de klerks reforms 
it is unfortunate anc spokesman pallo jordan said of the ec 
vote it shows the ec is not convinced by our arguments 
foreign affairs minister pik botha said the decision in rome 
marked a dramatic reversal in south africas foreign relations 
this will be to the advantage of all the people of south 
africa he said 
jordan said there had been overwhelming opposition to 
lifting sanctions during a closed session of the anc conference 
saturday but he refused to characterize that opposition as a 
rejection of tambos views and noted that tambo himself had 
introduced the motion to keep sanctions 
mr tambo said yesterday we need to reexamine the issue of 
sanctions jordan told a news conference when you say 
reexamine it doesnt mean youre going to change your mind 
in his keynote speech friday tambo went further than urging a 
simple review of the ancs 30yearold stand supporting sanctions 
the anc president told the 1600 delegates it was no longer 
enough to repeat the same old slogans and said they must reconsider 
the advisability of insisting on the retention of sanctions 
given changes at home and abroad 
a draft discussion document handed out to delegates closely 
reflected tambos speech 
the government says lifting sanctions could help the economy and 
ease black unemployment and other problems it has entered talks 
with the anc aimed at ending apartheid and setting up fullscale 
negotiations on giving political power to the black majority 
the purpose of the anc conference was to decide strategy in the 
talks and the obvious strength of hardliners within the 
organization could strain governmentanc relations 
hardline elements distrust the whiteled government and some 
fear the governments push for reforms is upstaging the opposition 
movement 
tambo who returned thursday from 30 years in exile read 
delegates the twoparagraph resolution which jordan said was 
adopted unanimously it said the anc was cognizant of the 
necessity to counteract the growing perception that de klerk should 
be rewarded for recent reforms 
the basic institutions of apartheid are still firmly in 
place it said and the government continues to use violence 
and police repression to suppress legitimate political and civic 
actions 
we therefore resolve that the existing sanctions package be 
maintained the resolution said it specifically appealed to the 
ec and united states to uphold sanctions 
disagreement on the sanctions issue was evident friday when 
nelson mandela the anc deputy president addressed delegates 
though he did not use the word sanctions mandela said that 
continuing pressure from the international community must be 
maintained 
on saturday morning anc spokesman saki macozoma told a media 
briefing the conference was not united on the sanctions issue 
the anc has supported sanctions since the government declared it 
an illegal organization in 1960 in addition to economic sanctions 
barring investment in and trade with south africa it urges nations 
to observe a boycott on cultural exchanges and sports contacts 
de klerk has promised to end apartheid but the ancs stand is 
that sanctions should remain as long as the whiteminority 
government was in power jordan said the anc would let foreign 
governments know when it felt the time was right to relax 
sanctions 
asked if the vote saturday was intended to sway the ec leaders 
he said that would not be a farfetched consideration 
the conference which ends sunday is the ancs first inside 
south africa since it was banned de klerk lifted the ban in 
february and freed mandela from 27 years imprisonment for plotting 
to overthrow the government

a judge has ordered some people convicted 
of misdemeanors to publish their photographs and information about 
their crimes in a newspaper but a publisher said he may not accept 
the advertising 
escambia county judge william white said he imposed the unusual 
punishment on friday to serve as a deterrent the sentence was 
given to about a dozen people convicted of soliciting for immoral 
purposes drunken driving and shoplifting 
white said he was worried about the annual rise in drunken 
driving and theft arrests during the holiday season and the growing 
threat of aids 
when youve got an aids epidemic theyre not just risking 
their life white said referring to those convicted of 
soliciting for sex theyre risking everybodys life 
he ordered advertisements measuring one column by 2 inches be 
placed in the pensacola news journal this florida panhandle citys 
only daily newspaper 
news journal publisher kenneth w andrews on friday said he has 
consulted with lawyers and not yet decided whether to accept the 
ads 
were not comfortable with it yet andrews said he added 
that he will lookat the issue further 
at least one defense lawyer objected to the unusual sentence 
joel cohen wrote white a letter asking that he hold a hearing to 
consider mitigating circumstances and an alternate punishment for 
one of his clients david e davis who pleaded no contest to a 
soliciting charge cohen also said he may file a civil suit to try 
to block the advertising order 
this is a precedentsetting thing cohen said people who 
get convicted of felonies dont get this kind of public shame 
davis 44 of rural holt also was placed on probation for six 
months fined 80 and ordered to write an essay on aids and 
venereal disease and have his wife sign it 
the past two weeks my wife and i have suffered a lot davis 
said i felt like i was innocent but i didnt have the money to 
fight the charge now this is just more humiliation 
cohen said the advertising sentence may result in more than just 
humiliation 
there is no reason to give this man everything short of the 
death penalty for a lapse in judgment cohen said he could 
lose his job his friends his position in the community its not 
like he raped someone

when sonia schreiber weitz heard that a man who 
makes execution devices was going to appear in court she wanted to 
be there 
she cared little for the case charging him with being a phony 
engineer as a survivor of five nazi concentration camps she finds 
it repugnant that fred leuchter jr says to have proof that there 
was no holocaust 
i lost 84 members of my family i lived through it said 
mrs weitz 62 i can still smell the burning bodies i went back 
to auschwitz three or four years ago and it was very antiseptic 
but for me the smell will always be there 
but leuchter a manufacturer of electric chairs gallows and 
lethal injection machines and a selfproclaimed expert on 
execution techniques says systematic mass murders never occurred 
at auschwitz and other concentration camps he has inspected 
leuchter appeared at malden district court last week on charges 
he is not an engineer and practiced without a license another 
hearing was set for next month 
outside of court the larger issue for many is the paper he 
published called the leuchter report end of a yth in which 
he concludes not one person was killed in a gas chamber at 
auschwitz birkenau and majdanek 
although the legal proceeding is minor and would result in a 
maximum three months in jail and 500 fine jewish activists hope 
the case exposes him as a fraud and helps discredit his holocaust 
theories 
the pretrial hearing reopened the painful memories of holocaust 
survivors and their relatives people outside the courtroom yelled 
liar 
beate klarsfeld the worldrenowned nazi hunter traveled from 
france to protest leuchters views 
the event has sparked renewed international debate on the 
holocaust revisionist movement that alleges the holocaust was a 
hoax 
essentially there was no german plan to kill off all the jews 
of europe it cant be shown a single jew was killed in a gas 
chamber no attempt to annihilate the jews was made said 
theodore okeefe editor of the leading revisionist publication 
the journal of historical review 
leuchter denies he is a revisionist describing himself as a 
modernday columbus simply shattering a widely held belief 
i dont have anything to do with them he said in an 
interview thursday they have taken scientific fact which is 
truthful anybody is entitled to that 
but leuchter has been embraced and adopted by the revisionists 
and his report has been cited in various places including a war 
crimes trial in toronto where a defense attorney reportedly read 
the paper into the record as an example of legitimate questions 
about the holocaust 
the beate klarsfeld foundation reports that the ku klux klan and 
other white supremacist organizations have promoted the report it 
also notes that other publications have espoused theories the 
holocaust did not occur including the 1969 the myth of the six 
million and an anonymous european publication did six million 
really die 
revisionists such as fred leuchter have dared to subject the 
various and admittedly contradictory accounts of socalled 
survivors postwar confessions and standard historical accounts to 
scientific scrutiny okeefe said 
kirk lyons a texas lawyer who has represented a ku klux klan 
grand dragon and addressed the aryan nations congress has 
volunteered to take leuchters case for free 
in his deeds and in his words he is every bit a holocaust 
revisionist said sally greenberg an official at the 
antidefamation league in boston he has appeared at holocaust 
revisionist conferences he presents socalled scientific evidence 
the holocaust is a hoax the only thing missing is his willingness 
to admit to the label 
the holocaust revisionist movement is not new the institute for 
historical review the leading organization behind the movement 
was formed in 1979 
many academics are reticent to even debate revisionists or their 
theories 
they should not be dignified with refutation said lawrence 
langer a professor at simmons college about to publish his fourth 
book on the holocaust 
according to langer holocaust historians now estimate slightly 
more than 5 million people died some were shot some gassed and 
others died of starvation or neglect i dont waste one second 
proving the holocaust happened 
langer said he can only speculate on the motivations of 
revisionists some may find the notion of the holocaust too 
incredible to be real others may crave attention or indeed be 
antisemitic he said 
but for survivors the controversy has nothing to do with 
academics 
paul parks said hes never even heard of the term revisionist 
but he knows what he saw as he followed american tanks into dachau 
in 1945 
i saw the bodies i saw the people coming out of the 
buildings the furnaces were still hot he recalled we dug 
large common graves with our bulldozers to bury the bodies they 
died in the showers gassed to death

a comatose woman at the center of the us 
supreme courts first righttodie case probably will die of 
dehydration within two weeks now that her feeding tube has been 
removed doctors said saturday 
nancy cruzans physician at the missouri rehabilitation center 
in mount vernon removed the tube friday seven years after a car 
accident left her unconscious the removal came shortly after a 
judge ordered the center to accede to the familys wishes to allow 
ms cruzan to die 
well see a shutdown of kidneys and shell gradually become 
less responsive dr james c davis said 
the 33yearold womans body functions will gradually dwindle 
primarily from dehydration until all have failed and she dies 
medical experts said 
davis testified three years ago that he opposed removing the 
feeding tube however he said in court last month that he now 
believes its in ms cruzans best interest to end her living 
hell 
i wouldnt want to live like that davis said saturday 
lester and joyce cruzan were at their daughters side when 
jasper county probate judge charles teels ruling was announced 
friday they had fought since 1987 to have the tube removed taking 
the case all the way to the us supreme court 
the state is no longer a legal party in the matter and will not 
try to intervene gov john ashcroft said friday night 
although food and water was withdrawn ms cruzan will continue 
to receive medication mainly sedatives and doctors said she 
should die peacefully 
it will be very hard on the family but its the right 
thing to do said dr ronald cranford a minneapolis neurologist 
who has examined ms cruzan 
dr stephen lefrak a professor of medicine at washington 
university in st louis said ms cruzan would feel no pain because 
of her neurological condition lefrak was not involved in the case 
doctors have said there is no hope of recovery for ms cruzan 
who suffered severe brain damage when her car ran off a road and 
overturned ejecting her on jan 11 1983 
in his order teel said he believed there was clear and 
convincing evidence that ms cruzan would want to die three 
former coworkers testified in november that they had conversations 
with ms cruzan in which she stated she would not want to be kept 
alive by medical machines should she become incapacitated 
the cruzans also maintained that they knew their oncevivacious 
daughter would never want to live in her present condition her 
ailments include seizures vomiting bleeding gums and severely 
contorted limbs 
her care costs missouri taxpayers more than 112000 a year the 
rehabilitation center said the cruzans medical insurance was 
exhausted in 1986 
doctors have said she could remain in her condition for 30 to 40 
years with nourishment 
the state opposed the cruzans requests to remove the tube and 
teels ruling in 1988 on behalf of the parents was overturned 
the issue then went to the us supreme court which ruled in 
june that missouri could require clear and convincing proof ms 
cruzan would want to die and returned the case to teel to decide 
whether such proof existed 
ms cruzan left no instructions such as a living will about 
what she wanted done if she ever became incapacitated 
ms cruzan was moved friday from her private room on the third 
floor of the redbrick rehabilitation center to a room on the 
second floor affording the cruzans more privacy center spokesman 
barbara shoun said 
william colby the cruzans attorney said the parents and 
nancys two sisters and their children were relieved the ordeal was 
nearing an end the cruzans refused to speak with the media but 
lester cruzan known as joe issued a statement after the decision 
thanking the judge and praising nancy 
now we walk with her to the door of death so that she may at 
last pass through and be free he said so fly away little 
sister and have fun we will always hold your memory in our hearts 
and love you

an offshore drilling platform caught 
fire and a fuel tank aboard exploded saturday and authorities said 
they would just have to let the blaze burn itself out there were 
no injuries 
the initial fire broke out about 415 am said coast guard 
petty officer elizabeth brannan then about four hours later a 
fuel tank on board the platform exploded forcing two groups of 
firefighters off the deck 
the firefighters were not hurt and neither were the two workers 
on the platform at the time the original fire broke out she said 
there was no evidence any of the fuel spilled into the ocean she 
said 
the platform about two miles off the gloucester coast north of 
boston is used to drill pipelines to dispose of sewage at sea 
after the explosion coast guardsmen and firefighters tried 
battling the blaze from the water before deciding to let it burn 
out brannan said rainstorms were helping dampen the fire she 
said 
basically theyre just standing off and waiting for the fire 
to go out on its own brannan said 
there are several other fuel tanks on the platform in addition 
to the one that exploded but brannan said there was believed to be 
little chance any other of the tanks would explode 
the cause of the fire was not immediately known 
the owners of the platform maitland brothers of louisiana told 
authorities they would assume responsibility for the fire and have 
hired clean harbors inc a company involved in the cleanup of 
boston harbor brannan said 
phone calls placed to maitland brothers went unanswered saturday 
afternoon 
four coast guard cutters a fireboat from the massachusetts port 
authority and several smaller boats all equipped with 
firefighting equipment were called to fight the blaze a 
helicopter also was dispatched to the site

israel ordered four palestinian activists 
deported on saturday a day after palestiniams stabbed three jews 
to death the army said 
the four were issued deportation warrants the army said and 
will be allowed to appeal to the israeli supreme court 
israel radio said the four were residents of the occupied gaza 
strip and members of the moslem fundamentalist movement hamas or 
zeal 
the radio said the activists were arrested along with hundreds 
of other hamas activists after moslem fundamentalists stabbed three 
jews to death friday in the arabjewish town of jaffa adjacent to 
tel aviv 
the army said the four were all activists who directed violent 
activities but it was not clear if they suspected of involvement 
in the killings 
also saturday israel restricted the number of palestinians 
allowed to leave the gaza strip as part of its search for the 
assailants 
the israeli army command initially sealed off the occupied gaza 
strip confining its 750000 arab residents to the area and barring 
journalists from entering 
but the command reopened gaza later to allow palestinians who 
met strict security criteria to enter israel journalists were told 
to check with the army command before trying to enter the 
territory 
police said two palestinians were wanted in fridays killings of 
the jews and they were believed to be hiding in gaza 
the army command would not say how many arabs were arrested 
arab reports said it was nearly 500 
arab reporters said dr abdel aziz rantizi a founder of hamas 
was one of the arrested two men who preach at the al aqsa mosque 
on the temple mount also were detained arab reports said 
hamas marked the third anniversary of its founding friday and 
had called on palestinians to honor the date by escalating their 
uprising against israel the arabs who killed the jews sprayed 
moslem fundamentalist slogans on the walls before fleeing police 
said 
radio reports said the government would discuss fridays attack 
at its weekly sunday meeting

european community leaders wrapped up a historic 
summit saturday with a statement that brought britain back into the 
movement toward political union and with a decision to ease 
sanctions on south africa 
with britain back in the fold the community sets out on a 
crucial but tricky course to build a unified political force 
capable of speaking with one voice on foreign and security issues 
concluding their twoday summit the 12 ec leaders lifted a ban 
on new investments in south africa in recognition of reforms made 
by president fw de klerk but they decided to keep other 
sanctions in place pending the complete abolition of apartheid 
it was the first major joint action by the wealthy trade bloc to 
ease sanctions since de klerk embarked on his reform program in 
february bans on iron steel and gold coin imports will remain 
on the persian gulf crisis the summit issued a strong demand 
for iraq to liberate kuwait unconditionally in compliance with un 
security council resolutions and backed the us demand for early 
direct talks with president saddam hussein 
the leaders also ratified fridays decision to give 1 billion 
in emergency food aid to the soviet union and an additional 500 
million in technical assistance 
in a key decision for the ecs future britain joined the other 
11 nations in agreeing on broad guidelines for relinquishing some 
of their national sovereignty and transforming the trading bloc 
into a sort of united states of europe 
we can say without exaggeration that the community has 
embarked on a rendezvous with history said jacques delors 
president of the ecs executive body 
italian premier guilio andreotti chairman of the summit said 
the unanimous agreement on the principles of political union 
exceeded the expectations of a few months ago even a few days 
ago 
the road will not be easy it is very complex andreotti 
said noting the historic rivalries among the european powers 
what is important is that all 12 have joined the table 
the breakthrough hinged on a new conciliatory attitude by 
britain whose isolation at the last ec summit in october led to 
the downfall of prime minister margaret thatcher 
i explained to the community that we have a very positive 
attitude and are determined to be wholeheartedly engaged in the 
enterprise of building shaping and developing europe said the 
new british prime minister john major 
britain under major has still not dropped its opposition to the 
centerpiece of the economic union plan agreed by the other 11 at 
the october summit the establishment of a single central bank by 
1994 as a prelude to one currency for the community 
following saturdays conclusion to the summit the proposals 
were formally lanched at separate intergovernmental conferences 
headed by foreign and finance ministers 
the ministers are charged with amending the ecs founding treaty 
to forge economic monetary and political union italian foreign 
minister gianni de michelis said he hopes the conferences will 
complete their work by next october and that the treaties can be 
ratified by national parliaments by the end of 1992 
among the most ambitious objectives of political union is the 
development of a common foreign and security policy including the 
possibility of an eventual ec military role 
the language in the final communique was deliberately vague 
reflecting the delicate task ahead of trying to bring all 12 
nations aboard 
britain for example has been a leading skeptic of the idea of 
nations giving up their sovereign rights ireland is the only ec 
country not in nato and denmark is wary of security and military 
links because of its close ties with neutral sweden and finland 
on south africa the leaders said they were lifting the 
investment ban to encourage creation of a united nonracial and 
democratic society 
the communitys ban was imposed in 1986 along with the bans on 
the import of iron steel and gold coins and on arms exports the 
leaders said they would let up on those sanctions once de klerk 
introduces laws to abolish laws that reserved most of the nations 
land for the white minority 
the decision came despite a decision by the african national 
congress on saturday to stick by its support of international 
sanctions against pretoria 
the antiapartheid organization registered its disappointment 
with the ec statement 
it is unfortunate said anc spokesman pallo jordan in 
johannesburg it shows the ec is not convinced by our 
arguments 
foreign affairs minister pik botha said the decision in rome 
marked a dramatic reversal in south africas foreign relations 
this will be to the advantage of all the people of south 
africa he said

democratic senators touring us 
troop positions in saudi arabia said saturday that the region is 
closer to war because iraq and the united states have been unable 
to agree on dates for talks 
my sense is that the prospects of war are greater than they 
were two weeks ago in large part because of the way in which 
iraqi president saddam hussein is using the meeting as a form of 
manipulation rather than serious discussion said sen bob graham 
of florida 
everyone is weighing it very carefully there are few that 
prematurely want to take a decision ahead of the president said 
sen charles s robb of virginia 
the group led by senate majority leader george mitchell of 
maine also went to the red sea port of jiddah to meet king fahd 
in addition to graham it included sens paul simon of illinois 
richard shelby of alabama richard bryan of nevada and herbert kohl 
of wisconsin 
the tour also is to include stops in cairo on sunday and monday 
where the senators will meet president hosni mubarak as well as a 
visit to jerusalem tuesday for talks with prime minister yitzhak 
shamir 
while opinion among the democrats varied the general consensus 
was that the two sides had moved closer to war this week as the 
united states and iraq disputed a date for secretary of state james 
baker iii to visit baghdad 
everyone is weighing it very carefully there are few that 
prematurely want to take a decision ahead of the president said 
sen charles s robb of virginia 
shelby said it meant the situation seemed more weighted to 
military actions than it was a couple weeks ago 
simon a member of the senate foreign relations committee came 
out most strongly against using force if iraq ignores the un 
deadline of jan 15 to withdraw from kuwait or face conflict 
the question is do you pursue sanctions with troop rotations 
or do you move militarily my own inclination would be to have 
sanctions with rotations said simon he added that it might mean 
delaying the fight for a year or more 
but robb and others said sanctions might not have the desired 
effect 
robb also on the foreign relations committee said i didnt 
find a single soldier who didnt say hed rather get this over with 
and go home 
robb a vietnam veteran said that conflict taught washington 
two things the support of the us people and congress was 
essential for any overseas war and massive force should be used 
from the beginning 
the senators said they could not give bush a blank check to go 
to war but that if he sought their support for such a decision he 
would likely get it 
the president is attempting to prevent war by the threat of 
war i think that is a policy which we hope will achieve the 
desired result mitchell said 
but no one of us to my knowledge has stated we should rule out 
the use of force and that we recognize that it may become 
necessary he added 
the senators took an hourlong helicopter ride to visit the 
remote base of the 18th airborne corps

president bush bruised by his veto of a major 
civil rights bill is expected to move quickly to end a new 
controversy over minority scholarships and avoid another battle 
with civil rights groups political analysts say 
they say bush may move as early as this week to rescind or 
otherwise remove the teeth from an education department ruling that 
bans federally funded colleges from setting aside scholarships on a 
race exclusive basis 
to do so he will have to sidestep the issue of quotas that bush 
raised in his oct 23 veto of a major civil rights bill the 
president claimed the bill would force employers to rely on quotas 
in the minority hiring practices 
bush on friday said he had asked his staff for a quick 
readout on the ruling that could affect millions of dollars in 
scholarship programs for minorities the education department with 
white house prompting has promised clarification in the next few 
days of what the ruling entails 
the house education and labor committee dominated by democrats 
is to open hearings on wednesday at which it is likely the 
departments new policy will be strongly assailed 
theres been an extremely sharp reaction said reggie govan 
the committees council for civil rights and labor standards the 
focus will be on a policy that has been in place over the last 
decade and the process of the department in changing that policy 
sen paul simon dill demanded in a letter to bush dated 
saturday that he overrule or at least suspend the scholarship 
ruling until it could be reviewed 
i believe that immediate action is warranted in order to 
prevent further deterioration of the hopes and opportunities of 
minority youth simon wrote 
simon who sits on the labor and human resources and judiciary 
committees also ordered his staff to review options on how to 
reverse the decision 
gop strategist john buckley said the scholarship ruling may be 
from the worlds most defensible legal position but from a 
political standpoint it stinks it obviously just wont survive 
the departments assistant secretary for civil rights michael l 
williams in announcing the ruling wednesday focused on a narrow 
legal point that offering scholarships solely on the basis of 
race violates title vi of the 1964 civil rights bill that article 
prohibits discrimination on the ground of race color or national 
origin in any program or activity receiving federal financial 
assistance 
but coming less than two months after the civil rights veto the 
political fallout has been swift and heavy 
civil rights groups claimed it was further proof of the 
administrations lack of concern for minorities we are in fact 
incensed at the insensitivity callousness and quite frankly the 
illogic of such a ruling said benjamin l hooks executive 
director of the naacp 
douglas wilder dva the nations only black governor wrote a 
letter to bush saying the new policy will have a chilling effect 
on all minority targeted programs he added i have faith that 
you understand the dire and unfortunate consequences if this 
decision is not reversed 
the consequences are far from clear williams said private 
grants and federal programs for minorities are not involved and 
that only those college programs that determine scholarships solely 
on the basis of race are illegal 
but david merkowitz spokesman for the american council on 
education said the bush administration must move quickly because 
of the tremendous amount of confusion and concern among colleges 
and students the message to potential students is that maybe 
those scholarships they are seeking are illegal thats 
devastating 
deputy secretary of education ted sanders met the heads of six 
educational organizations including the ace on friday to ease 
their concerns and promise quick clarification on the issue but 
merkowitz said the meeting was inconclusive and it was evident 
the ball is in the white house court right now 
analysts said bush could bury the issue either by coming up with 
a legal basis to override the education departments ruling or by 
having congress legislate it out of existence 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater has declared it an 
inbetween case not falling into either bushs support for some 
affirmative action programs and his opposition to quotas 
bush will avoid linking the scholarship question to quotas said 
gop analyst doug bailey he said making scholarships a civil rights 
issue would be a big minus for bush especially among northern 
suburban voters who in the past have supported the presidents 
civil rights policies 
bailey said the republican party and the administration 
currently lack a domestic agenda soeach issue that comes along 
seems to get a lot of attention active politicos are whipping this 
up because its the only one

three ruddycheeked people burs stuck 
in their clothes snorting steam in the cold dawn come hissing 
and warbling out of the woods 
but theres no need to flee theyre part of the national 
audubon societys 91st annual christmas bird count in which bird 
watchers across north and south america began their tallies 
saturday 
when it ends jan 2 42000 birdwatchers will have counted 
upwards of 100 million birds 
it doesnt seem so large when you watch a tiny piece of it such 
as the count along the hudson river in the hamlet of newton hook 
about 100 miles north of new york city 
robins four robins across the river calls becky holberton 
one of three counters scanning the river with telescopes and 
binoculars 
waterfowl on the flat she cries moments later 
good spotting answers her companion richard guthrie 
canada geese 
earlier guthrie stood in a barn tugging on a rope from the 
roof trying to flush out roosting birds 
i see rock doves called kathy schneider the third counter 
waiting outside to see what birds flew out and youre scaring 
the daylights out of them 
the annual count is a good indicator of the health of our 
environment said holberton an ornithology student at the state 
university of new york at albany 
when populations dwindle it generally means human development 
is destroying birds habitats as in the destruction of tropical 
rain forests in south america she said 
wed all like to point our fingers at south and central 
america without worrying about the destruction in our own 
backyards holberton said but we really cant do that anymore 
its a global problem 
birdwatching teams will cover birds in about 1600 zones each 
15 miles in diameter counting as many birds as they can in one 
day the results will be published next year in american birds a 
national audubon journal 
the counts began in 1900 when environmentalists rebelled 
against christmas hunting competitions said geoff lebaron 
christmas bird count editor at american birds conservationist 
frank chapman countered with a plan to count the birds rather 
than try to shoot them lebaron said

ailing pie international announced 
plans saturday to shut down the nationwide trucking corporation 
within three weeks and begin liquidating assets 
us bankruptcy judge george l proctor approved the plan in a 
brief hearing after pies attorney said a weak national economy 
and lessthanprojected revenues over the last five weeks made the 
outlook bleak 
there was no light at the end of the tunnel said the 
lawyer steve busey the company determined there was no real 
prospect of a successful reorganization 
pie has been struggling since it and parent olympia holding 
corp filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization two months 
ago listing debts of 237 million and assets of 169 million 
prior to the filing pie operated 230 terminals and employed 
3500 workers 800 of them in the companys jacksonville base 
after two months of scaling down with the elimination of 1500 
jobs and 69 terminals friday pie now employs about 2000 people 
and operates about 100 terminals cuts were expected to continue 
through pies final weeks busey said 
proctor last month granted pie the operating funds to stay in 
business through saturday but the company would have to 
demonstrate benefits for the company and its creditors to get any 
more money 
under the courtapproved liquidation plan the company would 
continue to operate under chapter 11 during the two to three weeks 
it takes to deliver the remaining freight in its warehouses 
then a courtappointed trustee scheduled to be named by proctor 
on dec 29 will supervise the liquidation of the companys assets 
the liquidation plan comes after weeks of pressure from anxious 
creditors 
pies biggest creditor fidelcor business credit corp filed 
a motion last month to have the case converted to a chapter 7 
liquidation because of the truck lines continuing losses pie 
owes fidelcor 39 million 
chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code protects a company 
from its creditors while it reorganizes in chapter 7 the 
companys operations cease and all assets are sold to pay its 
creditors

a former aide to charles h keating jr 
testified saturday that he did not believe his boss political 
donations to five senators prompted them to assist keating in 
fighting thrift regulators 
i didnt smell that i didnt sniff that i didnt see that 
james grogan told senate ethics committee hearings 
grogan also said he never believed that keating who raised 13 
million for the five donated the money expecting to buy the 
senators intervention on behalf of keatings troubled lincoln 
savings and loan 
most of the committees 18th public hearing on the keating five 
was consumed by crossexamination of grogan who was keatings 
300000ayear corporate counsel grogan never wavered from his 
prior statements that sens donald w riegle jr and alan cranston 
played key roles in intervening with thrift regulators on behalf of 
lincoln 
at the end of grogans testimony committee vice chairman warren 
rudman rnh asked whether grogan was concerned that giving the 
senators very large amounts of money might lead to an 
appearance of impropriety by lawmakers enlisted to help you 
i can honestly say to you senator no the 36yearold 
lawyer responded its easy for me to say that it never bothered 
me because i never either from the senators any of them or from 
mr keating i never got even a hint that money was being given in 
exchange for anything 
nothing was said no action was taken he said i didnt 
have the impression that either mr keating was attempting to 
have the senators do something for him because of the donations or 
the senators were doing something in exchange for the donation 
grogan who functioned as keatings main liaison with congress 
during lincolns problems with regulators admitted some of his 
testimony has been inconsistent 
keating sought and received the intervention of the keating 
five to press his argument that regulators were treating the 
struggling sampl unfairly the irvine calif thrift was taken over 
by the government in april 1989 at a potential cost to taxpayers of 
more than 2 billion 
the senators under investigation are riegle dmich ranston 
dcalif john mccain rariz john glenn dohio and dennis 
deconcini dariz 
grogan testified under a grant of limited immunity that prevents 
his statements from being used against him in court he could 
however be prosecuted for perjury 
in the situation im in the only way i can injure myself is 
not to be totally honest he told the senate ethics panel on 
saturday 
he said his testimony was given not to defend anyone not to 
carry water for anyone not to help anyone not to hurt anyone 
grogan said again that riegle set up an april 2 1987 meeting 
between the nations top thrift regulator and four senate 
colleagues intervening for keating 
riegle has given the committee a sworn statement that he did not 
arrange such a meeting between the senators and edwin j gray 
gray said deconcini improperly tried to negotiate on keatings 
behalf and appeared to be speaking for the other three senators in 
attendance 
grogan also renewed his assertion that in november 1987 keating 
asked cranston to call thenchief regulator m danny wall to 
arrange a meeting between wall and keating 
the telephone conversation was held after grogan had just 
delivered 250000 in keating contributions to voter registration 
projects strongly backed by cranston 
grogan clashed with riegle lawyer thomas green over 
inconsistencies in the witness two days of closed door testimony 
this week and fridays public session 
green reminded grogan that he originally testified that he first 
discussed a keating fundraiser for the senator during a visit to 
keatings phoenix headquarters in march 1987 
grogan later said there had been discussions about the 
moneyraising event held march 23 the previous january the 
witness said documents shown him by green refreshed his memory 
sometimes refreshing ones recollection changes ones 
memory green said 
i dont think thats fair grogan responded 
your memory had changed green countered 
i dont like that characterization said grogan 
under crossexamination from cranston lawyer william taylor iii 
grogan insisted that in november 1987 keating asked cranston to 
call wall to arrange a meeting 
but grogan admitted he had no knowledge of whether cranston 
made that call wall and keating did meet in january 1988 to 
discuss lincolns problems with the bank board 
grogan also admitted to taylor that there were times cranston 
flatly turned down keating requests 
in the fall of 1988 grogan testified keating requested 
cranston to ask the chairman of the house banking committee henry 
b gonzalez dtexas not to hold hearings on lincoln 
senator cranston said no that was not something he could 
do grogan testified 
the panel is trying to determine whether the senators help for 
keating was related to the 13 million he raised for the five 
senators campaigns and causes 
grogan also testified that keating made his donations because 
he believed in the issue or he believed in the person he was 
supporting 
after the rare saturday session to finish grogans testimony 
the committee planned no further public hearings until jan 2 
because panel members have prior commitments

cambodian premier hun sen said saturday 
that he will go to paris this week to meet with guerrilla leaders 
who have fought his vietnaminstalled government for more than a 
decade 
hun sens comments were reported by cambodias official spk news 
agency and monitored in bangkok 
the premier said he would arrive in the french capital friday to 
attend a meeting of cambodias supreme national council according 
to the report 
the council was formed under a peace plan for cambodia first 
announced in august by the five permanent members of the un 
security council britain china france the soviet union and the 
united states 
the supreme national council consists of six members from the 
phnom penh government and six from the threefaction guerrilla 
coalition fighting it it was intended to serve as the main 
reconciliation body under the un plan 
the peace plan envisions a major un role in cambodia to allow 
for general elections the warring factions have accepted it in 
principle but fighting continues 
the supreme national council convened once in bangkok in 
midseptember but the meeting broke up because it failed to agree 
on what role guerrilla chief prince norodom sihanouk should play in 
the council 
hun sen said he was going to paris after receiving an invitation 
from french foreign minister roland dumas and indonesian foreign 
minister ali alatas 
france and indonesia lead the paris international conference on 
cambodia a forum overseeing peace efforts 
the invitation suggested opening the meeting wednesday hun sen 
said it was impossible for him to be in paris before friday 
hun sen has said in the past that the military contingent 
proposed under the un plan should not be a peacekeeping unit or a 
heavily armed fighting force 
he has also insisted his government continue to function in the 
period before elections and that un supervision of key phnom penh 
ministries under the plan should be limited 
vietnam installed the phnom penh government after invading 
cambodia in late 1978 and ousting the khmer rouge regime under the 
rule of the communist khmer rouge which began in 1975 hundreds of 
thousands of the 8 million cambodians died from executions famine 
and civil unrest 
china is the major supplier of the guerrillas which include the 
khmer rouge vietnam and the soviet union have been the strongest 
backers of the phnom penh side

here is the official text of the european community 
statement on south africa issued saturday 
 
the european community and its member states have consistently 
followed developments in south africa with the greatest attention 
and have given a favorable reception to the initiatives which have 
been to bring about the abolition of apartheid and the 
establishment of a united nonracial and democratic south africa 
they have already expressed approval of the results of the talks 
between the government and the anc african national congress in 
particular those of the pretoria meeting in august which opened the 
way to the negotiation of a new constitution 
they deplore the phase of serious violence through which south 
africa is passing which may endanger these developments they 
welcome however further indications serving to confirm that the 
process of change already begun is going ahead in the direction 
advocated by the strasbourg european council they have decided to 
continue to encourage this process 
against this background the european council has decided that 
as soon as legislative action is taken by the african government to 
repeal the group areas act and the land acts the community and its 
member states will proceed to an easing of the set of measures 
adopted in 1986 
as of now so as to contribute to combating unemployment and 
improving the economic and social situation in south africa and to 
encourage the movement under way aimed at the complete abolition of 
apartheid the european council has decided to lift the ban on new 
investments 
at the same time the community and its member states with the 
objective of sending a clear message of political support to the 
victims of apartheid and intending to contribute to a new economic 
and social balance in south africa have agreed to strengthen the 
program of positive measures and to adapt it to the requirements of 
the new situation including requirements related to the return and 
resettlement of the exiles 
the community and its member states hope in this way to be able 
to contribute to the speeding up of the process under way through 
sending to all the parties involved in negotiations a concrete sign 
of support for the establishment of a new south africa united 
nonracial and democratic and capable of resuming the place which 
it deserves in the international community

the european community on saturday lifted a ban on 
new investment in south africa and said it would phase out other 
embargoes when the whiteled government introduces laws to abolish 
land segregation 
the move at the end of a twoday meeting of community leaders 
was the first major joint action by the wealthy trade bloc to ease 
sanctions since president fw de klerk embarked on his reform 
program in february 
at the same time the ec said european sanctions would remain on 
imports of iron steel and gold coins 
the ec move came despite the urging of nelson mandela 
vicepresident of the african national congress who wrote to the 
community leaders this month asking them to delay any action 
on saturday in a move clearly aimed at influencing the ec 
leaders an anc congress in johannesburg reaffirmed that sanctions 
must remain because basic institutions of apartheid are still in 
place 
it is unfortunate anc spokesman pallo jordan said of the 
ecs move saturday it shows the ec is not convinced by our 
arguments he spoke in johannesburg 
foreign affairs minister pik botha on the other hand said the 
decision in rome marked a dramatic reversal in south africas 
foreign relations 
this will be to the advantage of all the people of south 
africa he said 
the ecs investment ban was imposed in 1986 along with embargoes 
on the imports of iron steel and gold coins and on arms exports 
the united states also imposed sanctions in 1986 and since then 
loans to pretoria have dried up from international lending 
agencies 
a communique at the end of the ec summit said the lifting of the 
investment ban was aimed at encouraging the creation of a united 
nonracial and democratic south africa 
it said the community would start to let up on the other 
embargoes once de klerk introduces bills to repeal the group areas 
act which segregates residential areas and the land act 
the land act a cornerstone of apartheid allocates 87 percent 
of the country as land for the 5 million whites with the rest 
consisting of scattered homelands for the 30 million black 
majority 
britain and portugal had spearheaded demands for a relaxation of 
the embargoes 
britain lifted the investment ban a socalled voluntary 
embargo in february when the rest of the community agreed only to 
lift restrictions on cultural and scientific contacts 
the rest of the embargoes can be ended only with communitywide 
agreement 
the community has taken a very important step forward on south 
africa british prime minister john major said we recognize 
the huge changes that president de klerk has brought about 
britain and two other community countries germany and france 
rank among south africas major trading partners 
ireland and the netherlands have led resistance to easing ec 
sanctions following the release of mandela and scores of other 
political prisoners 
de klerk has also legalized the anc scrapped race laws in 
public places and promised to negotiate a new constitution to 
enfranchise the black majority 
the anc vote urging a retention of sanctions came a day after 
mandela and anc president oliver tambo appeared to give differing 
views on sanctions in addressing the opening of the congress 
tambo said the anc must review its policy of supporting 
sanctions to keep pressure on the whiteled government to end 
apartheid he indicated it would be wise for the anc to develop a 
more lenient policy on sanctions before foreign nations dropped 
them altogether 
mandela however said continuing pressure from the 
international community must be maintained he did not use 
the word sanctions

money to help pay for operation desert shield 
is coming in at an astonishingly low rate from us allies and 
the bush administration is doing little to solicit more support 
two house democrats said saturday 
were putting up a red flag today house majority leader 
richard gephardt said warning the president he must be more 
aggressive in securing financial backing from americas allies if 
he wants congress to approve additional spending 
gephardt told a news conference the administration will seek 
another 20 billion in funds for the persian gulf operation early 
next year 
one of the criteria upon which congress and the country will 
judge the presidents request is the level of commitment of our 
allies both in manpower and money the missouri democrat said 
gephardt along with rep charles schumer dny presented 
figures estimating the costs of desert shield in fiscal year 1991 
at 3685 billion 
they said americas main allies in the antiiraq coalition 
japan kuwait saudi arabia the united arab emirates germany and 
korea have pledged only 1062 billion or 29 percent leaving 
the united states to pay the other 71 percent 
rep anthony c beilenson dcalif head of a 19member house 
group that returned to washington on saturday from a persian gulf 
tour played the same theme at a news conference at andrews air 
force base 
we urge the president to seek to secure as many additional 
funds from our allies are needed said beilenson 
he said allies ought to contribute more to this undertaking 
pointing particularly to the japanese and germans this a concern 
for all of us in the free world he said 
the lawmakers said that of germanys 1 billion pledge more 
than 43 percent is in old east german military equipment that is no 
longer of use to them saudi arabia has promised 4 billion while 
earning an estimated 438 billion in windfall profits from rising 
oil profits during the fiscal year beginning in october gephardt 
and schumer said 
they said japan gets 64 percent of its oil from the gulf but is 
bearing only 5 percent 2 billion of the cost of the us 
military operation 
the 3685 billion figure was calculated by taking the original 
defense department estimate of 15 billion and multiplying it by 
congressional budget office estimates of cost increases due to 
bushs later decision to deploy another 200000 troops in the 
region 
schumer said the figures document the astonishingly low rate 
at which our allies are sharing the burden in the gulf 
he said that while bush has moved mountains to build and 
sustain support for our goals in the gulf he has barely lifted a 
finger to obtain the necessary financial support from our allies 
schumer said the other coalition members should be paying at least 
half the cost 
gephardt faulted the administration for not seeking more allied 
support after his decision to add another 200000 us troops in 
the gulf it has almost been an afterthought with the 
administration 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater on friday said the 
white house was pleased with the cooperation of other coalition 
members and would continue to work with them 
the pentagon after releasing figures earlier in the week 
showing that the allies so far had delivered only a small portion 
of promised financial support on thursday said it had 
unintentionally understated the value of allied nations 
contributions 
were very pleased with what our allies are doing pentagon 
spokesman pete williams said 
gephardt said this is the first postcold war instance in which 
nations have come together to respond to an international outlaw 
if the antiiraq coalition fails he said this will be a 
precedent that will be looked back on 
the burdensharing estimates did not include economic aid that 
japan saudi arabia and other nations have pledged to frontline 
states such as jordan turkey and egypt but schumer said us 
contributions for these economically strapped nations exceed those 
of the allies 
the lawmakers noted that france and britain are the only un 
security council members to send troops to the gulf and that here 
too the united states is carrying too much of the burden 
ive told the president that if body bags go back to the 
united states theyve got to go to london paris and cairo as 
well gephardt said

shipping hundreds of tons of 
mail more than 6000 miles to the persian gulf every day is no easy 
task but 200 airmen and army soldiers at mcguire air force base 
seem to have it licked 
neither rain nor sleet nor miles of sand has stopped operation 
desert mail the roundtheclock operation handles 70 percent of 
all military mail earmarked for troops in saudi arabia 
its a 12hour day of constant work said air force master 
sgt denny myers who helps organize the operation the mail 
never ends 
operation desert mail began at mcguire in midoctober when the 
us postal service asked the air force to handle mail heading to 
the middle east said capt richard trembley tinker air force base 
in oklahoma city handles the balance of the mail 
in terms of volume this is probably the biggest airlift mail 
operation since vietnam trembley said we just never realized 
that much mail could be generated 
about 20 percent of the mail arriving at mcguire is addressed to 
any soldier in the persian gulf he said 
trembley said 10 million pounds of mail and packages have been 
shipped to the gulf from mcguire since october the volume of 
letters and packages hit an alltime high when 250 tons or 26 
pounds of mail for every soldier in saudi arabia was handled nov 
29 
one way or the other were handling it trembley said 
during a tour last week at the central new jersey base well 
move the mail 
it hasnt been an easy job 
earlier this year mcguire scaled down its regular cargo 
operations based on recommendations of a department of defense 
study trembley said but on oct 20 mcguire was asked to relieve 
the mail load from dover air force base because the delaware 
installation was already handling a large quantity of military 
cargo headed to the gulf he said 
all of a sudden we had to rev up again and go back in the 
other direction trembley said its a high priority 
an aircraft maintenance hangar adjacent to an airstrip at 
mcguire was dubbed big blue and converted into a mail 
processing facility the operation is spread over most of the 
sixbay hangar large enough to hold six large cargo planes 
bundles of letters packages cookies and fruit are trucked to 
mcguire by the us postal service from sites in new york 
washington chicago and jersey city on an average day about 28 
trucks pull up to the hangar 
theres another truck pulling up as soon as we get one 
unloaded said myers a recruiter from saugus mass who was 
transferred to mcguire in august as far as you can see you see 
mail 
the mail already stamped with domestic postage is sorted and 
loaded onto aluminum pallets the 7by9foot pallets are labeled 
bound in netting and secured measured and weighed 
before the pallets each weighing about 15 tons are trekked 
outside to the tarmac to await loading on cargo jets information 
on its destination is put into a computer used to keep track of 
mail 
within 24 to 48 hours after the mail arrives at mcguire its 
loaded aboard an aircraft headed to the middle east officials say 
mcguire uses a fleet of 10 aircraft including two boeing 747s and 
707s leased from a commercial airline trembley said 
we have to move the mail quickly trembley said every 
time we see a name on a package it motivates us everyone here 
realizes if we were over there we would want our mail we feel 
like were helping someone

iraq insisted saturday that it alone will set the date for 
direct usiraqi talks in baghdad and it accused president bush 
of lying about the issue the white house said the dispute shows 
iraq is not serious about peace 
one month before a un deadline for iraq to give up kuwait 
iraq gave no hint it was ready to consider a pullout 
iraqi president saddam hussein said he did not rule out 
reconciliation but repeated that the emirate is irrevocably part 
of iraq he also said iraq would rather plunge into pools of 
blood up to our chests than retreat from its principles 
european allies meanwhile lined up behind president bush in a 
strong warning to iraq to get out of kuwait or face the 
consequences 
but in washington two congressmen criticized us allies for 
being too tightfisted in helping pay the huge costs of the 
military operation in the gulf 
iraq has an estimated 500000 troops massed in kuwait and 
southern iraq facing about 350000 soldiers in the multinational 
force including about 250000 americans the us contingent is 
expected to number about 420000 by midjanuary 
some democratic senators visiting american troops in the saudi 
desert expressed worry that the two sides are moving closer to war 
now that usiraqi talks have been sidetracked by the dispute over 
dates 
my sense is that the prospects of war are greater than they 
were two weeks ago in large part because of the way in which 
saddam is using the meeting as a form of manipulation rather than 
serious discussion said sen bob graham of florida 
washington has rejected the iraqiproposed date of jan 12 for a 
meeting between saddam and secretary of state james a baker iii in 
baghdad the united states says that is too close to the jan 15 
security council deadline and has suggested other dates 
but iraqs ruling revolutionary command council declared in a 
statement saturday that iraq alone has the right to fix dates for 
foreign officials to meet its president 
the statement came one day after bush told reporters in 
washington he had offered iraq a choice of 15 dates in the next 
three weeks for highlevel talks and saddam ought to take one of 
them 
he also said if saddam had time to meet with private envoys such 
as boxer muhammad ali or former attorney general ramsey clark 
surely he had time for baker 
the iraqi news agency quoted a spokeman for the revolutionary 
command council as saying bush lied about having proposed 15 dates 
the spokesman who was not identified said bush only proposed 
two options either for the meeting to be held on 20 21 or 22 of 
december or on jan 3 which we said were not appropriate 
those who want peace should not make noises about the dates 
the spokesman added 
because of the disagreement over bakers visit to iraq bush 
said friday that iraqi foreign minister tariq azizs trip to 
washington for talks with bush was on hold both sides had 
previously said they did not object to monday as a date for those 
talks 
we have communicated to the iraqis that mutually satisfactory 
dates should be set white house spokesman john herrick said 
saturday todays public announcement is just a reaffirmation of 
the iraqi unwillingness to deal seriously with the issue 
in rome the european community said it would hold no talks with 
aziz until after he meets with bush the ec last week had invited 
aziz to come to rome after his trip to washington 
the ec summit also issued a strongly worded communique demanding 
iraq pull back its armies and restore the former kuwaiti 
government saying those remained the absolute conditions for a 
peaceful solution of the crisis 
saddam was defiant in the face of mounting pressure in remarks 
carried by ina he said nations should not interfere in one 
anothers internal affairs or use force to resolve disputes 
any step that brings us closer to these principles we will 
not hesitate to take it be it political flexibility or 
reconciliation or anything else he told islamic clergymen on 
saturday but we will reject any step that moves us away from 
these principles even if that plunged us in pools of blood up 
to our chests 
the iraqi president also repeated his view that a settlement of 
the persian gulf crisis should be linked to solving the 
arabisraeli conflict the united states says the issues are 
unrelated 
the commitment of us allies to helping bear the financial 
burden of the military deployment in the gulf was questioned 
sharply saturday by two house democrats 
house majority leader richard gephardt dmo and rep charles 
schumer dny said the main us allies in the antiiraq 
coalition japan kuwait saudi arabia the united arab emirates 
germany and korea have pledged only 29 percent of the operations 
costs leaving the united states to pay the other 71 percent

administration officials battling over the 
shape of the nations energy policy are at odds over conservation 
measures including tightening auto efficiency standards and using 
alternative fuels officials said saturday 
disagreements erupted in what participants described as a lively 
meeting where voices were raised last week when energy secretary 
james watkins brought a range of proposals to a meeting of 
president bushs economic policy council 
white house chief of staff john sununu raised strong objections 
to the assumptions and models used by the energy department to 
forecast future energy use and supply according to officials who 
participated in the meeting 
bushs top economic adviser michael boskin trounced proposals 
that would have required automakers to increase the fuel efficiency 
of their cars and ordered greater use of nongasoline fuels said 
some officials who were present all spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
boskin contended those measures would have been far too costly 
to implement and would have involved excessive government 
interference with free market processes the sources said 
the cabinetlevel meeting was one in a series to discuss 
formulation of the national energy strategy that president bush 
early in his administration promised he directed watkins to 
prepare the policy officials say it is likely to be ready early 
next year 
the persian gulf crisis and the increased focus on reducing the 
need for middle east oil adds a political dimension to the policy 
debate officials say that how the united states handles its energy 
strategy will be closely watched by other nations especially those 
to whom the administration has gone for support of its military 
buildup in the gulf region 
officials said that a range of options are under consideration 
for the strategy they said the conservation proposals have not 
been finally ruled in or out but are still being debated 
on the supply side the policy is likely to include a 
recommendation to open the vast arctic national wildlife refuge in 
alaska to oil exploration 
bush has long made clear he wants to open the refuge but one 
official said saturday that any such move would carry restrictions 
designed to minimize environmental damage protecting the anwr is 
one of the top priorities of environmental organizations 
officials said the principle discussions at last wednesdays 
meeting dwelled heavily on conservation issues and that watkins 
feels very strongly that they ought to be part of any energy 
strategy the demand or the conservation side ought to be given 
equal emphasis to the supply side 
but according to officials boskin made a strong argument 
against the autorelated conservation measures on the basis that 
watkins proposed fuel efficiency requirements would involve 
excessive regulation and would cost automakers so much to implement 
that when measured against how much oil would be saved it would be 
the equivalent of paying 60 to 80 per barrel of oil 
regarding alternative fuels boskin made an analogy to former 
president carters beleaguered effort to promote synfuels even 
reading from carters policy and equating its claims with the 
claims for energy conservation made by alternative fuels advocates 
according to participants 
on the other side environmental protection agency 
administration william reilly white house counsel boyden gray and 
agriculture department deputy secretary jack parnell all stood up 
for government encouragement of the alternative fuels 
boskin clearly a comes from a market oriented prospective and 
doesnt see any tinkering with the market based approach said 
one official 
boskin said saturday he had no comment on the matter 
sununu blasted the energy departments models and assumptions on 
the nations future energy needs 
william nitze a former state department official who now heads 
the alliance to save energy coalition predicted problems for the 
energy strategy in congress if it does not contain strong 
conservation measures 
if they dont do something serious on conservation theyre 
going to get a lot of criticism he said

lawmakers who threatened to seek president mikhail 
s gorbachevs resignation at the upcoming congress of peoples 
deputies said saturday they will now support his policies tass 
reported 
the soyuz group of deputies meeting to discuss its tactics 
at the congress that begins monday expressed unanimous support for 
gorbachevs course toward reforms the official news agency said 
if soyuz indeed supports gorbachevs policies at the congress 
the soviet leader will have successfully defused his latest 
challenge 
in recent weeks gorbachev appeared to appease the hardliners 
by talking tough on law and order and replacing the moderate 
interior minister with a kgb general expected to crack down on 
political uprisings 
col victor alksnis the leader of the hardline group that 
claims a membership of 400 to 500 lawmakers warned nov 17 he 
wouldseek gorbachevs resignation unless the soviet leader acted 
before monday to stem the political and economic problems of the 
soviet union 
other hardliners formed a group called the national salvation 
committee which is seeking a nationwide state of emergency 
suspension of new political parties and transfer of control to the 
committee itself 
on dec 2 gorbachev replaced interior minister vadim bakatin 
who is popular among liberals with boris pugo a communist party 
official and friend of alksnis pugo became a kgb major general 
while running the secret police in latvia in the early 1980s 
kgb chairman vladimir kryuchkov went on national television on 
tuesday and vowed to battle radicals who he said were trying to 
gain power by sabotaging food supplies during the nations economic 
crisis 
gorbachev also has ordered the kgb the army and interior 
ministry to stop workers in the state distribution system from 
stealing food and selling it on the black market such pilfering is 
one key factor contributing to the nations current food shortage 
tass the official news agency noted the sharp contrast at 
saturdays soyuz meeting compared with its members speeches a 
month ago 
at the congress the 2250 deputies who comprise the congress 
are expected to approve the streamlining of the executive branch of 
government proposed by gorbachev last month to help speed up his 
reforms under his plan the council of ministers or cabinet 
headed by prime minister nikolai ryzhkov would be replaced by 
several bodies under direct presidential control 
the congress also is expected to approve a draft of the union 
treaty the new legal charter proposed by gorbachev to redefine the 
relationship between the central government and the 15 soviet 
republics 
under the proposed treaty the national government would retain 
control over defense and national security as well as energy 
transportation and other key industries 
russian president boris n yeltsin and 10 other republic leaders 
have agreed to join the union treaty negotiations but only if they 
control natural resources in their republics 
moldavia and the baltic republics of latvia lithuania and 
estonia have refused to join the talks 
radical deputies to the congress meanwhile were reported in 
disarray 
tass said the interregional group of deputies the largest 
opposition force in the parliament failed to reach a consensus 
friday on key items on the congress agenda

certain forces incited by domestic and foreign enemies the state 
ata news agency reported from tirana the albanian capital

on tuesday alia announced that the communist leadership would 
for the first time allow the formation of alternative parties an 
apparent concession to protests by students in the capital a day 
later the first noncommunist party in 46 years was formed

and a half all the windows were smashed 
in a telephone interview the director of foreign operations at 
albanian state radio napleon roshi said the general feeling is 
that there are forces of retrogression that are doing their best to 
obstruct the move to democracy 
he would not elaboarate but alias decision to open albanias 
rigid political system may have touched off resistance among 
conservative elements of the ruling communists and the sigurimi 
the secret police 
also saturday the albanian government turned back five western 
journalists who tried to enter the country without visas a 
threeman television crew from the british broadcasting corp a 
journalist for italys sateowned rai radio and an associated

won a 250000 award in a sexdiscrimination lawsuit against the 
stock brokerage firm

who reported him to authorities for child molesting before he was 
sentenced to nine years in prison 
regardless what happens here i will be forever thankful for 
the courage and the righteousness that allowed these young men to 
come forward richard dilley said friday in superior court 
i can promise the court and i want to promise the families 
its not going to happen again in my lifetime he said 
dilley 31 leader of a mormon churchsponsored scout troop 
until last summer was sentenced by judge patricia aitken to one 
year more than the eightyear prison term recommended by 
prosecutors 
authorities said he could be free after five years with time off 
for good behavior 
retribution is not what i am seeking aitken said the 
only way to protect this community is for mr dilley to go to 
prison 
police began investigating last summer after a member of 
dilleys troop told his parents about child molesting and rape 
since 1988 dilley acknowledged in court documents that he had 
sexual contact with two boys ages 14 and 15 between august 1988 
and july

jersey since 1969 ordered to return deposits 
some in line had waited overnight at united savings bank 
federal regulators seized the thrift in may citing poor 
management improper loan documentation risky interest rates 
unsafe real estate loans and excessively high salaries 
resolution trust corp the federal agency that manages ailing 
thrifts closed the 49yearold united savings without warning 
thursday night 
i made a deposit wednesday and nobody said anything said

november former controller ronald rudd pleaded guilty to federal 
bankfraud charges 
paterson police estimated more than 2000 people waited to take 
their turn at uniteds main office 
the thrifts branches in parsippanytroy hills succasunna and

depositors who have not claimed their money

former democratic presidential nominee george 
mcgovern said he was considering a run for the white house in 1992 
mcgovern 68 told the boston herald that hell decide by 
february whether to make a bid for the democratic nomination 
i think its possibly a doable campaign he said 
mcgovern lost the 1972 presidential race to richard nixon and 
briefly entered the 1984 campaign but dropped out after finishing 
third in the massachusetts primary 
this time he said he has support from major democratic 
fundraisers 
ive had more people in more states talk to me about running 
again than any time in my life mcgovern told the newspaper in a 
story published friday 
ive been around long enough to know the difference between 
just a sporadic comment and the kind of sustained encouragement 
ive gotten in the last couple of years he said 
mcgovern said he lost the election 20 years ago because he 
concentrated too much on the vietnam war and not enough on the 
daytoday troubles of the typical american household

center 18 miles west of moscow is scheduled to open in 1992

soviet foreign ministry and greenbraebased american international 
golf resorts calls for a combined effort to finance promote and 
operate the resort 
financial details of the joint venture were not disclosed 
the resort is to be used primarily by diplomats international 
business people and tourists 
it will enhance the relationship between countries because 
it will be a meeting ground said ivan ivanovich sergeev deputy 
director of diplomatic corps service bureau a division of the 
soviet foreign ministry 
its not purely a commercial enterprise it will enhance the 
trust between these people sergeev said through a translator 
noted golf course architect robert trent jones jr who lives in 
woodside designed the course and helped put together the deal 
the soviet union hired jones in 1988 to design the resorts 
championship 18hole course the 7000yard par72 course is being 
built within a birch and evergreen forest

a hotel the hotel and the complexs infrastructure already have 
been completed officials said 
the late armand hammer chairman of occidental petroleum corp 
had acted as a liaison on the project with soviet officials over 
the years 
work on the golf course was delayed partly because of economic 
and weatherrelated problems jones said 
clearing of the forest drew protest from nearby pensioners who 
were concerned they would lose mushrooms collected from the forest 
as food to compensate jones said he has suggested that wood 
chopped to make way for the course be given to the pensioners to 
supply heat

portauprince haiti ap the government saturday closed the 
dominican border and barred civilians from carrying weapons 
tightening security on the eve of an attempt to hold the first 
democratic vote since a 1987 election day massacre 
the army urged calm and serenity and said it would take 
whatever measures necessary to ensure a safe election sunday 
in a statement published by the staterun newspaper lunion the 
army high command said it reaffirmed its commitment to do 
everything possible to guarantee maximum security 
in a series of security measures announced saturday the 
provisional civilian government closed the border between haiti and 
the dominican republic until tuesday the two countries share the 
island of hispaniola 
officials gave no reason for the move but there has been talk 
of worry about the possibility of armed mercenaries crossing the 
border to disrupt the election 
the government led by president ertha pascaltrouillot also 
barred all private citizens not involved in the security operation 
from carrying weapons through tuesday 
the government also prohibited the sale of alcoholic beverages 
during the election period and restricted traffic on sunday to cars 
with election permits and a few bus and taxi companies 
the capital of portauprince with an estimated 1 million 
inhabitants bustled with the usual saturday traffic congestion and 
shopping at crowded marketplaces 
white vans flying blueandwhite united nations flags ferried 
international election monitors around the city 
police stopped cars on john brown avenue the main thoroughfare 
and checked for registration papers but the security forces were 
mostly out of sight no problems were reported from the 
countryside and expectations of a successful election were running 
high 
it looks as far as anyone can tell aok said ismael 
diallo of the african nation of burkina faso spokesman for the 
130member un monitoring team which includes 64 unarmed military 
security advisers 
i regret now that i didnt register to vote in october but i 
was too afraid said huguette pierre 24 an unemployed 
switchboard operator 
haitis last attempt to hold democratic elections on nov 29 
1987 was aborted when assassins supported by the army shot and 
hacked to death at least 34 people at polling stations and in the 
streets 
subsequent elections in january 1988 were controlled by the army 
and boycotted by most leading contenders in the previous election 
the only disturbance so far in this campaign was a 
grenadeandbomb attack dec 5 that killed seven people and wounded 
more than 50 others at a campaign rally for the rev jeanbertrand 
aristide the apparent frontrunner 
diallo said the un observers had no confirmed reports of 
irregularities at any of the 14500 polling stations across the 
country which were being prepared the electoral council revising 
earlier estimates said saturday that 2970000 people or about 90 
percent of those eligible are registered to vote 
un observers will be on hand at polling stations at 530 am 
sunday onehalf hour before polls open and remain until they 
close at 12 hours later they are among an estimated 800 
international observers including former president jimmy carter 
in haiti for the election 
the electoral council said it did not expect to release any 
results before noon monday 
aristide a leftist roman catholic priest with a large following 
among the majority poor is considered a frontrunner and un 
spokesman diallo said widespread speculation of an aristide 
landslide posed a potential security threat 
if they aristide supporters win by a landslide there is 
some concern they may overreact diallo said if they lose 
some may not accept it 
rumors were circulating that aristide supporters were preparing 
big celebrations sunday while polls were still open the un 
official said 
although the army has pledged to ensure a smooth election 
sympathizers of the fallen 29year duvalier dictatorship oppose any 
move toward democratic government 
last week the selfproclaimed head of the tonton macoute 
militia vowed to prevent an aristide victory 
we will do everything to prevent this danger said roger 
lafontant who himself was barred from contesting the election 
my country will never be delivered to communism 
the tonton macoutes violently enforced the duvalier dictatorship 
for 29 years 
haiti an impoverished caribbean nation of 6 million people has 
been ruled almost exclusively by despots since gaining independence 
from france in 1804 after a slave revolt 
aristide 37 who was expelled from his ecclesiastical order in 
1988 for allegedly preaching class struggle is widely regarded as 
the frontrunner among 11 presidential candidates 
however former world bank official marc bazin seen as a 
favorite of the bush administration because of his international 
business ties could command strong voter support 
aristides antiimperialist rhetoric has made us officials 
wary but he has presented a moderate though somewhat vague 
election platform calling for a dignified relationship between 
the two countries 
at a news conference saturday carter said he had received 
assurances from electoral officials that the army would ensure the 
safety of voters 
he said he had spoken with aristide and was somewhat concerned 
over the priests attitude that his victory was inevitable 
its not a fatal problem the former president said adding 
that he himself always had predicted victory in his election 
campaigns 
if no candidate receives more than 50 percent of the vote a 
runoff will be held in late january 
haitians also are electing 110 members of a bicameral national 
assembly 134 mayors 268 municipal council members and 1695 
county officials

american indians marked the centennial 
of grief saturday over the slaying of sitting bull and the massacre 
at wounded knee with the start of a horseback ride across south 
dakota 
about 50 people gathered for the 175mile journey on horseback 
an annual event since 1986 
the mostly south dakota indians began from the place on the 
standing rock indian reservation where sioux leader sitting bull 
was killed dec 15 1890 
to me the ride is a way of bringing together the people who 
make up the sioux nation and in that respect bringing together 
the nation itself said ron mcneil who said he is a descendant 
of sitting bull 
the riders were headed for wounded knee on the pine ridge indian 
reservation along the way they expect to be joined by about 250 
more riders before the journey ends dec 29 
it was at wounded knee 100 years ago that the last major 
engagement occurred between american indians and us troops 
today we start a new road said dave archambault president 
of standing rock college in fort yates nd on the standing rock 
reservation 
he called the anniversaries of death and massacre a time of 
healing for the sioux nation we must all start walking this 
prayer and living this prayer 
a group of sitting bulls descendants met for a religious 
ceremony at his old camp along the grand river 
shortly after dawn about 20 runners left fort yates nd for 
a 45mile relay to meet the riders at the camp before the runners 
left a pipe ceremony was led by isaac dog eagle who said he was a 
sitting bull descendant 
sitting bull was killed during a period of unrest at standing 
rock police there feared an uprising and hoped that by arresting 
the powerful chief dissent could be diffused 
the arrest went awry and sitting bull was killed the slaying 
heightened tension between american indians and police that 
culminated in the massacre of sioux men women and children by us 
cavalry troops at wounded knee on dec 29 1890 
how many american indians died there is a point of contention 
the federal government says about 150 indians say close to 400 
twentynine federal soldiers died 
indisputable said historian michael lawson was that the deaths 
of sitting bull and those at wounded knee were the inevitable 
result of a clash of cultures 
lawson of the us bureau of indian affairs was among 
historians who addressed a symposium saturday attended by about 100 
people in pierre 
the massacre at wounded knee marked the end of the golden age of 
the sioux a period in which they dominated the northern plains 
lawson said 
the sioux warrior society reached a peak in 1876 when indians 
defeated lt col george custer in the battle of little big horn on 
traditional sioux hunting grounds in nearby montana he said 
the fortunes of the sioux rapidly declined after that as a 
series of treaties stripped them of land and forced them onto 
reservations in south dakota 
after sitting bull was killed miniconjou chief big foot led a 
band of about 400 sioux from central south dakota to seek refuge at 
the pine ridge reservation 
the sioux agreed to camp with calvary troops in wounded knee 
but fighting broke out on dec 29 1890

factors in addition to carbon monoxide 
poisoning may have caused the deaths of 12 people during a 
religious ceremony at a house in a border shantytown a doctor said 
saturday 
as a doctor i have a hard time accepting carbon monoxide as 
an explanation for all of this said dr humberto ariel perez 
munoz director of the hospital where survivors were taken 
perez said the victims suffered some kind of poisoning but 
tests have not revealed what substance was involved 
tijuana authorities attributed the deaths early thursday to 
accidental carbon monoxide poisoning victor vazquez a deputy 
district attorney said a butane lamp burned in the small house 
and doors and windows were shut tight he speculated that the lamp 
filled the house with carbon monoxide 
the dozen people were found dead with five others who were 
stricken in the house five miles east of this crowded border city 
three of the survivors were comatose 
the survivors havent been able to explain what happened to them 
during a ritual that began wednesday night found in the house were 
a rope circle with 13 knots and a cardboard cutout of the virgin 
mary 
i dont think were going to find an explanation for what 
happened perez said 
the victims choked on their vomit from carbon monoxide 
poisoning said dr gustavo salazar head pathologist in the 
coroners office but perez said doctors were still investigating 
the possibility that victims ingested methanol 
perez said it was more likely the deaths could be attributed to 
a combination of factors including carbon monoxide poisoning and 
some unknown substance that the victims consumed 
two survivors 22yearold alfredo osuna hernandez and 
8monthold ana osuna were improving and should fully recover 
perez said 
two others in the house federico padres mexia 62 the 
ceremonys leader and consuelo ponce 35 remained comatose and 
were deteriorating another comatose patient juan jose sarabia 
49 was transferred to another hospital he was in grave condition 
at last report 
in a bedside interview osuna said he couldnt remember details 
of the ceremony he was groggy and often lost his train of thought 
osuna an autobody repairman who recently moved to tijuana from 
culiacan said he remembered that everyone drank some punch but he 
didnt know what was in it 
osuna said he had been going to padres house for about four 
months for similar ceremonies 
we were going to see the virgin i was looking for work 
he said 
a sixth person moises merida gonzalez 32 who checked into the 
hospital thursday night was also recovering 
the house stands alongside a wide rutted dirt road through the 
shantytown surrounding it is a neighborhood of hundreds of oneand 
tworoom wooden shacks home to some of the most impoverished 
people in tijuana most of the neighborhood has no running water or 
electricity 
although osuna was improving perez said alfredo isnt in a 
condition to say what happened 
osuna said he was introduced to padres by his sisterinlaw and 
that he had been friends with him for several months he said 
padres never talked about his past 
he talks a lot about god just god osuna said 
he said he believed stories told by padres claims of being able 
to perform miracles and of having healing powers 
osuna recalled that sometime after the ceremony began people 
began to get ill 
a girl who was there fainted a lot of people started to 
vomit i was trying to pick up a woman i couldnt do it from then 
on out i dont remember he said 
no one tried to leave the ceremony because we would be harmed 
nobody wanted to go out osuna said 
osuna was unable to elaborate on the nature of the harm in an 
interview friday osuna said it is very damaging to leave the 
circle

uprising against israeli rule sixty arabs have been expelled since 
the uprising began in december 1987 
in washington the state department denounced saturdays 
deportation orders 
the united states deplores this decision by the government of 
israel state department spokesman alan shub said weve 
consistently held that such deportations are a violation of the 
fourth geneva convention as it pertains to the treatment of 
inhabitants of occupied territories 
other nations in the past have also condemned deportations as a 
violation of human rights 
in the recent outbreak of antiisraeli violence that followed 
the oct 8 temple mount riot in which 17 palestinians were killed 
some israeli politicians have called for reinstating deportations 
israel radio said the four ordered expelled were residents of 
the occupied gaza strip and were members of the moslem 
fundamentalist movement hamas or zeal 
the radio said the activists were arrested along with hundreds 
of other hamas members after moslem fundamentalists stabbed three 
jews to death friday in the arabjewish town of jaffa adjacent to 
tel aviv 
the army would not say how many arabs were arrested arab 
reports said it was nearly 500 
the army said the four all took part in violent activities but 
it was not clear if they were suspected of involvement in the 
killings 
earlier police said two palestinians were wanted in fridays 
killings of the jews and they were believed to be hiding in gaza 
also saturday israel restricted the number of palestinians 
allowed to leave the gaza strip as part of its search for the 
assailants 
the army command initially sealed off gaza confining its 
750000 arab residents to the area and barring journalists from 
entering 
but it later lifted the closure allowing palestinians who met 
strict security criteria to enter israel 
arab reporters said dr abdel aziz rantizi a founder of hamas 
was one of the arrested two men who preach at the al aqsa mosque 
on the temple mount also were detained arab reports said 
hamas marked the third anniversary of its founding friday and 
had called on palestinians to honor the date by escalating their 
uprising against israel the arabs who killed the jews sprayed 
moslem fundamentalist slogans on the walls before fleeing police 
said 
radio reports said the government would discuss fridays attack 
at its weekly meeting sunday 
curfews were in place saturday in parts of the gaza strip and 
west bank to prevent violence on the hamas anniversary the curfews 
meant that about 250000 arabs were confined to their homes 
in other incidents paramilitary border police clashed with 
masked youths in east jerusalem in the arab neighborhood of silwan 
jerusalem police spokesman aharon elhayani said one youth was 
injured slightly by a rubber bullet 
in the gaza town of rafah masked men fatally shot akram hosli 
aram 18 in the head an activist group said aram who worked as a 
laborer in israel was killed for collaborating with israeli 
authorities 
arams death brought to 318 the number of palestinians killed by 
fellow arabs during the 3yearold uprising most on suspicion of 
collaborating with israel at least 778 arabs have been killed by 
israeli civilians or soldiers during the revolt 
fridays deaths raised to 57 the number of israelis who have 
died in the violence

the oneyear anniversity of its revolution the protesters have 
also objected to some economic reforms and proposed steep price 
increases 
also saturday opposition parties and other groups called for a 
government of national unity to lead the country to early 
elections 
the refusal of the current compromised leadership to 
relinquish power could generate an uncontrollable explosion of 
discontent said the civic alliance an increasingly influential 
union of nonparliamentary opposition groups 
union representatives said the strike spread from one timisoara 
factory on monday to 11 major local enterprises and 50000 
employees by saturday 
meanwhile university students in timisoara declared they would 
continue boycotting classes to back demands for the governments 
resignation more than 100000 students and hundreds of professors 
nationwide have been on strike for five days

timisoaras central opera square saturday

which marks one year since the revolution spread to bucharest

because of fears of violence 
we know that there are irresponsible people in this 
country who may want to turn the event into a bloodbath he 
said 
lazslo toekes a protestant pastor whose threatened resettlement 
by officials helped touched off the revolution said in an 
interview that the revolution had to continue to sweep away old 
structures 
but toekes among the new governments most prominent critics

using another model the secretarial school graduate said she would 
have whiled away her days as the worlds worst stenographer

the idea from news reports about what is acceptable in saudia 
arabia the country has strict standards particularly dealing with 
how women can dress in public 
we thought putting clothes on them would be interesting she 
said 
the 10member troop of 8 to 13yearolds will color and 
clothe pictures of men and women wearing bathing suits shorts 
tank tops and similar clothing members thought about pasting 
clothes on models but quickly abandoned the idea

an egyptian islamic leader who is on a list of 
people with ties to terrorists is living in a brooklyn mosque where 
the accused killer of rabbi meir kahane once worshiped a newspaper 
reported 
the new york times said in sunday editions that sheik omar 
abdelrahman blind and in ill health is the spiritual leader of 
the farouq majid 
the sheik was banned by the state department from entering the 
united states but illegally obtained a tourist visa from the us 
embassy in sudan and arrived july 18 the newspaper said 
abdelrahman was tried in egypt on charges of inciting the 
assassination of president anwar elsadat but he was released for 
lack of evidence he frequently was detained without trial in egypt 
but never convicted 
nyda novidvorski a spokeswoman for the state department said 
the consul who issued the visa should have checked abdelrahmans 
name against a list of terrorists 
federal agents questioned abdelrahman about the nov 5 
assassination of kahane but found no evidence the sheik knows el 
sayyid a nosair the egyptian immigrant charged in the slaying 
the times said 
nosair worshiped occasionally at abdelrahmans mosque the 
newspaper said 
the sheik through his assistant khalid nasr declined a 
request to be interviewed the times said nasr said abdelrahman 
does not know nosair 
the sheik reportedly denounced kahanes death in sermons since 
the slaying saying it would bring unwanted trouble on moslems the 
times said 
abdelrahman is regarded in egypt as spiritual leader of the 
radical underground islamic groups known as the islamic jihad or 
islamic holy war which favor revolution against the government and 
the establishment of a state based on islamic law 
officials learned abdelrahman was in brooklyn when city police 
went to the mosque to question people about nosair state

them he was here 
immigration officials said last week they had been notified that 
the sheiks visa was revoked but they werent aware he was in the 
country and would investigate the first step toward deportation 
the state department has linked the jihad to the oct 6 1981 
assassination of sadat and the fatal shooting of the speaker of the

an israeli national has agreed to 
plead guilty to trying to broker an arms deal that would have 
fulfilled a shopping list of weapons for a colombian drug cartel 
david candiotti 30 of miami beach promised in an agreement 
filed friday in federal court to testify about shipments foiled in 
a sting that produced his arrest june 9 1989 at an exit off the 
florida turnpike 
agents seized an arsenal of machine guns and explosives with 
candiottis arrest and that of colombian national carlos enrique 
gil 26 on weapons charges a third suspect robert waddell of 
willis texas was arrested on weapons charges a day later 
prosecutors said candiotti gil and waddell had completed two 
weapons shipments to the cali cocaine cartel in july 1988 
candiotti and waddell they said trained some colombians in the 
use of the weapons 
federal investigators said the three planned to ship the 
military hardware to the cali cartel for an assassination attempt 
on pablo escobar gaviria head of the rival medellin drug cartel 
candiotti and gil allegedly told undercover agents before their 
arrest that their orders came from don pacho a leader of the 
cali cartel investigators said 
candiotti agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to violate the 
arms export control act and to the receipt and transport of an 
explosive 
candiotti could face a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison and 
a 500000 fine but in return for his pledge to testify 
prosecutors agreed to request a prison term of three to four years

the list included antiarmor weapons systems grenade launchers 
c4 plastic explosives ar15 assault rifles 9mm pistols and 
rifles 
court documents later identified mark golden the owner of a

a tape recording of data pulled from the wreck of 
an amtrak train may provide clues on the cause of a crash that 
injured 267 people in the citys back bay station a federal 
official said saturday 
federal investigators thought at first a key portion of the tape 
had been ruined by a long tone superimposed when amtrak officials 
examined it said susan coughlin national transportation safety 
board vice chairman 
the tape holds an electronic record of the trains speed and 
braking patterns 
investigators hope to verify the speed the amtrak night owl from 
washington was traveling when it smashed into the rear of a 
commuter train wednesday coughlin said 
safety board officials estimate the train averaged 918 mph the 
last 1 mile before it derailed on a curve leading into the 
station 
the train engineer has told investigators the trains brakes 
appeared to fail when he tried to slow the train as it approached 
the station 
robert herman amtrak general manager of transportation 
services said the train was well within the speed limit before it 
derailed the speed limit in that final section is 100 mph but 
drops to 30 mph at the curve the ntsb has said 
safety board spokesman brent bahler emphasized that the trains 
speed has not been firmly established he said he could not comment 
on why herman said the train was traveling under the speed limit 
efforts to reach amtrak officials in washington for 
clarification saturday night were unsuccessful 
one of two event recorders on the amtrak train was destroyed in 
the crash safety board officials said earlier this week that the 
tape from the second recorder did not record information for the 
last 5 miles of the trip rendering it useless 
but friday coughlin said amtrak officials had apparently placed 
an electronic tone over the tape while examining it in an attempt 
to mark certain data lab technicians will now try to lift the tone 
to get at the data underneath 
herman said saturday the tape was only handled by top level 
bostonbased amtrak officials after the accident he said amtrak 
made a copy before turning the tape over to ntsb investigators 
herman said the steady tone indicated no change in speed for the 
trains final five miles 
i would be surprised if it was determined that someone at 
amtrak intentionally placed the long tone on the tape herman said 
the amtrak train was carrying about 200 passengers and the 
commuter train had standing room only with about 900 passengers 
when it crashed 
seven people injured in the crash remained hospitalized 
saturday including engineer trainee richard abramson 41 of 
trumbull conn and head engineer willis copeland 53 of bethany 
conn 
copeland tested negative for alcohol and drugs coughlin said 
the roles of abramson and copeland in the accident are also part of 
the investigation 
most of the wreckage from both trains was removed by saturday 
herman said amtrak would complete repairs on the tunnel track by 
wednesday and would run tests with unoccupied trains before 
resuming full commuter and amtrak train service later in the week

severe air pollution forced the government to 
order a major oil refinery and more than 50 other companies to cut 
production an official said saturday 
we wanted to stop industry in time rather than stop everything 
later said rene altamirano director of environmental prevention 
for the urban development and ecology department 
he said the cutback was ordered friday morning for the 53 
companies the measures were lifted about noon saturday for all but 
a refinery of the government oil monopoly petroleos mexicanos in 
the azcapotzalco sector of the the capital altamirano said 
it was unclear if the cutback orders would resume monday there 
were no immediate details on the extent of the cutbacks 
nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide levels in mexico city are 
double the level considered the maximum acceptable he said 
the measures which have been used rarely put into effect the 
first stage of a government contingency plan for cutbacks of 
pollution sources when smog levels become critical 
the group of 100 environmental organization last week again 
warned that air pollution early this month was already dangerously 
high and worse than the past two years at the same time 
thermal inversions which trap pollution in cold air in the 
lower atmosphere are frequent from december through february

the army must offer compelling reasons to 
resume controversial research that involves shooting cats in the 
head to study gunshot wounds a congressman said 
i met with army officials and told them that i share their 
goals and agree there are times when animal research is 
justified said us rep bob livingston 
but they ought to be sensitive to the legitimate concerns of 
people about doing unnecessary research and they are going to have 
to prove that this is not unnecessary he said friday 
the catshooting experiments have become a symbol of the 
conflict between medical researchers and animal rights activists 
researchers at louisiana state university medical center fired 
pellets into the heads of about 700 anesthetized cats to study 
results and thus improve treatment for battlefield head injuries 
the project which began in 1983 with a 2 million army grant 
was suspended 13 months ago after complaints that the research was 
inhumane and ineffective 
livingston expressed doubt the research should continue he 
would be the key player in any congressional action 
i do not think it is unreasonable to pose the question what 
realistically can be ascertained from continuing experiments and 
spending half a million dollars and possibly more of taxpayers 
funds livingston said 
a spokeswoman for lsu said the university would not comment 
the principal researcher dr michael carey is on duty as a 
neurosurgeon in the persian gulf 
the research produced a scientific paper suggesting that 
braininjured people might spontaneously resume breathing long 
after they stopped breathing unassisted one of careys associates 
also has said the team was investigating use of a promising drug 
when the research was stopped 
a panel of neurosurgeons that examined the project for the 
general accounting office found that it was doing worthwhile 
research 
most panelists however expressed concerns about the research 
in two areas the management of general anesthesia and 
postoperative care that they thought could affect some research 
results the gao said in a report 
a panel of veterinary anesthesiologists said the validity of 
some of the research might have been jeopardized by anesthesia it 
also questioned postoperative care for the cats 
the gao could not obtain sufficiently detailed records to look 
into the questions about postoperative care said the gao the 
investigative arm of congress 
the gao concluded that the army should decide whether continuing 
the research will produce additional useful information if so 
the gao said the army should ensure that lsu corrects deficiencies 
cited by the medical panels 
congress has said the army must give congress notice of its 
intent to resume the experiments the project was not likely to 
resume before february 
suzanne roy spokeswoman for in defense of animals a national 
animal rights group said congress should permanently cancel this 
cruel and useless experiment

nan wood graham the model for the 
tightlipped farm woman in the painting american gothic died 
friday in a menlo park calif nursing home she was 91 
the painting caused unhappiness in cedar rapids in 1930 when 
mrs graham posed for her brother iowa artist grant wood 
local women thought wood was poking fun at them the painting 
portrays a somber pitchforkbearing farmer and his equally somber 
daughter standing before a cottage the late dr byron mckeeby of 
cedar rapids posed as the farmer 
one woman wrote to say mrs grahams face would sour milk 
but after she came forward identifying herself as the model 
the painting gained acceptance and woods popularity soared 
mrs grahams popularity also flourished if her brother who 
died in 1942 had used another model as originally planned the 
secretarial school graduate said she would have whiled away her 
days as the worlds worst stenographer 
instead she once said grant made a personality out of me i 
would have had a very drab life without it 
born in anamosa and educated in cedar rapids she married real 
estate investor edward graham in 1924 the couple who had no 
children lived all over the country eventually settling in 
riverside calif 
in 1984 widowed and going blind mrs graham entered a menlo 
park calif nursing home ending a lifetime job as historian of 
her brothers work 
she was creative in her own right said john fitzpatrick fine 
arts project leader for the cedar rapids community schools who 
visited mrs graham less than two weeks ago 
she had an artists temperament not only in her defensive 
attitude toward people who abused grant woods work but in the 
painted glass she would make the tissue collages she would make 
and her creative sewing

warning about the nations largest banks
