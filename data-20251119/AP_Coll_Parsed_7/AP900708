france plans to keep troops in germany for at least 
four more years and is intent on remaining western europes top 
military power the countrys defense minister says 
the cabinet minister jeanpierre chevenement speaking on a 
radio show sunday rejected any suggestion french troops withdraw 
from germany by the end of the year 
that wont happen for at least four or five years he said 
adding that withdrawal even then would depend on actions of the 
soviet union and coordination with western allies 
chevenement said the eventual withdrawal of the 50000strong 
unit called french forces in germany would fit in with plans to 
reduce frances armed forces by 35000 men 
the defense minister stressed that these tentative withdrawal 
plans have no bearing on french troops in berlin whose status is 
governed by a four powers agreement nor on a newly formed joint 
frenchgerman brigade 
chevenement recalled that france refused to endorse a 
declaration at last weeks nato summit stipulating that the 
alliance would use nuclear weapons only as a last resort 
it was in our interests to refuse to go along with this idea 
that one uses nuclear weapons as a last resort when all would be 
lost he said 
france would stick with its completely opposite strategy of 
nuclear deterrence he said this is extremely important for 
france and for europe 
france is the biggest military power in europe after the 
soviet union chevenement said and must maintain all its 
capabilities 
in five years there will be a strategic void which is very 
dangerous because a void of arms can lead to outside interference

watching his parents grow old in a nursing home 
helped motivate dr daniel rudman to seek out a new use for a 
hormone therapy his research team found can reverse some of the 
damage of aging 
researchers at veterans hospitals in milwaukee and chicago led 
by the 62yearold endocrinologist found that injections of human 
growth hormone a oncerare protein made through genetic 
engineering will help old people build up sagging muscles take 
off flab and grow more youthfullooking skin 
their findings were published last week in the new england 
journal of medicine 
while his work in the field of hormone therapy has drawn 
attention in the past ill tell you this is the one thats 
brought the most interest rudman said this type of work 
really touches a nerve center 
rudman was among a group of physicians in the 1960s and 1970s 
who used human growth hormone taken from pituitary glands in 
cadavers to treat children whose growth is retarded because they 
dont make enough of the protein 
the results were truly remarkable rudman said the children 
not only grew quickly but also lost fat and rapidly grew lean 
muscle he said 
during that period rudman visited his parents in nursing homes 
and was shocked by the poor medical care given to the residents 
it was obvious to me that medical conditions in nursing homes 
were primitive compared to the kind of medicine that younger people 
get he said 
on a hunch rudman said he decided to use the same blood test he 
was using for children to check for levels of human growth hormone 
in the elderly 
he interested other endocrinologists in his idea of testing the 
effect of human growth hormone on the elderly and began some 
limited testing in 1980 he said 
rudman began a pilot study at the veterans administration 
medical center in north chicago ill and continued it when he 
moved to the clement j zablocki va medical center in milwaukee and 
the medical college of wisconsin in 1988 
all of the 12 healthy men ages 61 to 81 who had deficient levels 
of growth hormone and were given additional amounts of the hormone 
for six months showed significant physical improvements rudman 
said 
their muscle mass grew their skin became thicker and more 
youthlike and their fat mass shrunk removing the effects of an 
estimated 20 years of aging 
however rudman cautions that the treatment is not the fountain 
of youth and should not be used routinely until questions are 
answered about its longterm effects and possible hazards

most people in california are too busy doing 
other things to bother voting in elections according to a 
newspaper survey 
too much to do was the most frequent response given by 2260 
people polled by telephone for the survey which was conducted by 
the los angeles times the polls margin of error was 3 percent 
about 35 percent of those who were registered to vote but did 
not said they were too busy the newspaper reported sunday a lack 
of interest in politics the next most common reason was cited by 
8 percent 
in last months state primaries about 14 million who were 
eligible to vote failed to do so about 49 million people did vote 
nonvoters whether registered or not share many qualities with 
those who do vote having the same range of views on abortion 
capital punishment and taxes the newspaper reported 
they also were split evenly between support of dianne feinstein 
the democratic candidate for governor and republican candidate 
pete wilson 
where they seem to differ is how they perceive voting for the 
nonvoters the practice is seen as more trouble than its worth 
pollsters said 
among unregistered nonvoters 22 percent said they were too 
busy and 21 percent said they did not care other reasons given by 
both groups were dislike of the candidates and the feeling that 
voting doesnt matter 
most nonvoters are young with 56 percent under age 40 the 
poll showed

president ranasinghe premadasa has 
switched from negotiating to fighting in the 7yearold tamil 
rebellion and has gained broad public support 
thousands of people send money to a fund for soldiers families 
each day and young men stand in line to join in the army the main 
opposition party which called premadasas conciliation a joke has 
expressed support for the new policy 
after three weeks of fierce fighting however advancing 
government troops are bogged down by land mines and booby traps in 
the east and are pushed to the wall in the north 
at least 2109 combatants have died in the new battle for 
control of the north and the east where guerrillas of the 
liberation tigers of tamil eelam militia want a separate nation 
they would call eelam 
it began june 11 and ended a 13month truce during which 
premadasa tried to talk the tigers into laying down their arms in 
exchange for limited autonomy 
the ceasefire had been tenuous and the tigers began accusing 
the government early in june of trying to wreck negotiations 
on june 11 they overran dozens of police stations in the east 
and captured 850 policemen the military says the tigers killed at 
least 330 of the officers the rest are also feared dead 
premadasas government established a fund to help families of 
the policemen and other members of the security forces who have 
been killed 
sri lankans have contributed 40 million rupees 105 million 
to the fund and other donations have been received from sri lankans 
in the united states japan and britain the defense ministry said 
no breakdown is available but most of the money is thought to 
come from the ethnic sinhalese majority that has dominated sri 
lanka since the island republic then called ceylon became 
independent of britain in 1948 
at military headquarters in colombo thousands of young men have 
been lining up to join the army 
defense minister cyril ranatunge said 30000 volunteered after 
newspaper advertisements appeared two weeks ago 
we must finish this tamil problem once and for all said 
bandaragama rajapakse a 18yearold sinhalese waiting in line 
anura bandaranaike president of the opposition sri lanka 
freedom party said in parliament we stand solidly behind the 
forces today our hearts go out to them 
ranjan wijeratne the deputy defense minister predicted the 
government eventually would be able to disarnits unlike indian 
troops who moved large columns of soldiers wijeratne said 
indian soldiers were sent to sri lanka in july 1987 to oversee a 
surrender of arms by tamil guerrillas as part of an indiabrokered 
accord between tamil groups and the government of junius r 
jayewardene premadasas predecessor 
most tamil militias gave up their arms but the tigers soon 
reneged and took to the jungles the indians followed and were 
drawn into a twoyear guerrilla war in which more than 1100 of 
their soldiers were killed 
the last indian troops withdrew in march at premadasas request 
last year premadasa put down a twoyear rebellion by radical 
sinhalese who accused the government of making too many concessions 
to the ethnic tamil minority 
sinhalese make up 75 percent of sri lankas 16 million people 
and control the military as well as the government tamils 18 
percent of the population claim discrimination in jobs education 
and language 
tamil separatists have fought from the jungles and swamps since 
1983 at least 13000 people have been killed in the war 
premadasa a sinhalese crushed the extremists in his own ethnic 
group their leaders were arrested and died in what were officially 
described as shootouts or escape attempts thousands of followers 
and suspected supporters were killed by progovernment bands that 
roamed the villages and countryside 
we have learned from our past experiences and are now capable 
of destroying the rebels col parami kulatunga said in the 
northern town of vavuniya one of the main sites of the latest 
fighting 
lakshman jayakody of the opposition a former defense minister 
said at the moment i dont think we have any choice other than 
war

drummond presented the artificial heart that had been implanted in 
his chest to the smithsonian institutes national museum of

a fire burning for three 
days in yellowstone national park spread across 220 acres on 
saturday but officials were confident it could soon be fully 
contained 
by saturday night firefighters had contained about 60 percent 
of the lightningcaused blaze in the parks northeastern section 
and expected to have it fully under control by monday evening said 
park spokeswoman marsha karle 
we dont expect it to move anymore she said it may burn 
back on itself but unless the winds increase or humidity drops 
dramatically it looks like its not going anywhere we almost have 
a line all the way around it 
about 315 firefighters were deployed to battle the parks first 
major blaze of the summer karle said ground crews were helped by 
drops of fire retardant and water from helicopters and airplanes 
over the lower east slopes of mount washburn and by cooler 
temperatures and light winds she said 
crews have had difficulty gauging the parameters of the fire 
which started thursday afternoon and had spread to an estimated 100 
acres by late friday she said 
its been very smoky and hard to see karle said its 
been hard to get real good fix because the terrain is steep rocky 
and hard to get around no structures have been threatened but a 
couple of hiking trails in the area were closed

vietnam is being driven toward economic 
crisis by a large reduction in aid from the soviet union and 
eastern europe its only major allies in the past decade 
aid from noncommunist countries began drying up when vietnam 
invaded cambodia in december 1978 and it cannot turn to the 
international monetary fund or world bank because of us 
opposition 
commercial concerns have become paramount in moscow and 
communist rule has collapsed in eastern europe so agreements 
extending aid in the name of socialist fraternity will not be 
renewed at the end of this year 
our relations were not balanced and not mutually beneficial 
said anatoly voronine of the soviet embassy we had to spend a 
lot of money for that friendship we need to commercialize our 
cooperation 
jozef hanculak charge daffaires of the czechoslovak embassy 
said about 90 percent of vietnams credits had come from the soviet 
bloc he said the interest rate had been only 2 percent or 3 
percent a year but going international rates would apply to future 
credits 
prime minister do muoi told the parliament june 28 that citizens 
must be more selfreliant and tighten their belts because foreign 
aid that we have relied upon for many years now is being 
reduced rapidly cheap imports and huge loans for state 
expenditures no longer will be available he said 
vietnam signed a friendship treaty with moscow shortly before 
invading cambodia and has called the alliance the cornerstone of 
its foreign policy 
the kremlin now seeks better relations with hanois archrival 
china however and has lessened support for vietnam on political 
issues including cambodia 
voronine said military aid would be reduced significantly 
because vietnam no longer is threatened 
diplomats said vietnams alliance with the former soviet 
satellites was based solely on common ideology and was bound to 
collapse when the political and economic systems in those nations 
changed 
vietnams relations with east european countries will be on 
new conditions said ambassador dietmar grumbach of east germany 
this applies for economic cultural and other fields of 
cooperation because one thing is clear the political and 
ideological bases of our countries are different 
vietnam has been expanding trade with britain japan south 
korea and other noncommunist countries and its military withdrawal 
from cambodia in september improved relations with the european 
community last year france became the first ec country to resume 
aid and in may italy pledged 97 million 
the economy still may suffer severely because vietnam cannot 
attract enough help to replace the soviet aid that is ending a 
senior government economist said on condition of anonymity 
he said the soviets had abandoned some projects they started 
and they and the east europeans canceled some orders for vietnamese 
goods 
foreign traders say a reduction in fertilizer supplies from the 
soviet union is hurting rice production and there are signs of 
problems caused by smaller deliveries of soviet petroleum 
most of the 180000 vietnamese guest workers in the soviet union 
and eastern europe will be returning home as labor cooperation 
programs are ended or reduced 
in 19861990 moscow gave vietnam about 10 billion rubles 166 
billion at the official rate of exchange in credits for trade and 
technical assistance voronine said he said about 3000 soviet 
technical advisers were in vietnam down from a peak of 8000 to 
9000 in the early 1980s 
analysts say vietnam cannot meet the demand of its old allies 
for trade starting next year in hard currency at world market 
prices 
trade with the soviet union and eastern europe was about 60 
percent of vietnams total in 1989 said government economist tran 
van chu vietnam has obtained most of its cotton steel and 
vehicles from the soviet union and many basic goods such as 
construction materials and food from eastern europe 
most everything we see in vietnam today just isnt going to be 
around said christopher bruton a business consultant 
he said vietnam has an equivalent problem with its major exports 
to eastern europe including agricultural products clothing and 
apparel because they are of low quality and other buyers are not 
interested 
carlyle thayer a vietnam scholar estimated soviet military 
aid vital to a nation with no armaments industry totalled 13 
billion last year 
moscow is said to have removed most combat aircraft from cam 
ranh bay once its largest overseas base and foreign minister 
nguyen co thach of vietnam said all soviet troops would leave the 
country by 1992 
analysts said vietnam might benefit from the change in the long 
run 
the soviets ditched a lot of cash and got very little out of 
it bruton said vietnam got shoddy products and technology it 
was a disaster for both sides vietnam has to recognize now that it 
is a southeast asian nation and it lives and dies on its relations 
with the region

physicians need to act more aggressively on 
the initial complaints of women especially younger women who 
find lumps in their breasts a study of breast cancer malpractice 
claims and lawsuits indicates 
the study by the physician insurers association of america found 
that in 69 percent of cases where claims were paid because breast 
cancer diagnosis was delayed the patient had discovered the lump 
the physician needs to be impressed by such findings and order 
followup studies said the report 
this study indicates that selfdiscovery often may be ignored 
especially in younger women where the incidence of malignancy is 
thought to be less than in older women and is more difficult to 
detect the study said 
the study reviewed 273 paid claims reported by 21 member 
companies of the association all of the cases involved a delay in 
diagnosis of breast cancer 
women with breast cancer have best chances of surviving when it 
is discovered and treated in earliest stages 
the study released at the associations annual meeting in may 
was discussed by members of the study committee in telephone 
interviews last week 
though breast cancer is more common among older women the study 
indicates that delayed diagnosis in younger women results in the 
majority of lawsuits nearly 70 percent of the cases involved women 
under age 50 and 40 percent were filed by women under 40 
the most common reason for delay in diagnosis was that the 
physical findings at examination failed to impress the physician 
the report said this was the case for 55 percent of the women 
the second most common reason found in 35 percent of cases was 
that mammogram reports were negative in 14 percent mammograms 
were inconclusive 
doctors have to be more suspicious of the incidence of cancer 
in the breast and cant depend entirely on the mammogram 
said dr sylvan h eisman a distinguished professor emeritus of 
clinical medicine at the university of pennsylvania school of 
medicine who directed the study 
the american medical association had no comment on the findings 
the study suggests that a biopsy always follow any suspicious 
findings 
its foolish not to do it a biopsy if theres reasonable 
cause of suspicion eisman said 
the study also found that family history was unknown in 37 
percent of the cases though women with a family history of breast 
cancer are at higher risk of getting the disease themselves 
lack of communication among physicians involved in a case also 
can contribute to delays in diagnosing cancer as each often 
thinks the other is the responsible physician the study said 
the study stressed the importance of selfexamination by women 
thorough examinations by a physician and regular mammograms 
the american cancer society recommends a mammogram for women at 
around age 35 and regular mammograms every one or two years 
beginning at age 40 and annually after age 50 
among american women breast cancer is the leading type of 
cancer and is second only to lung cancer in cancer deaths 
the cancer society estimates that breast cancer will be 
diagnosed in 142000 women in the united states this year and will 
cause 43000 deaths

secretary of state james a baker iii has invited 
israeli foreign minister david levy to meet with him next week in 
paris to try to get mideast negotiations started 
whether levy accepts depends on his health diplomatic sources 
told the associated press on sunday the foreign minister is 
recovering from surgery for a circulatory disorder 
it would be the first substantive talks between the bush 
administration and the new israeli government 
baker will be in paris for talks july 1718 on german 
unification with soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze and 
the british french west german and east german foreign ministers 
baker suggested in a letter he sent to levy on thursday that 
they meet july 17 or 19 he told levy he knew the foreign minister 
had a reputation as a problemsolver and described himself as 
one as well the sources said 
we badly need a peace process in the middle east baker said 
sunday on abctvs this week with david brinkley program he 
said he had proposed the paris meeting with levy to begin 
discussions to this effect 
bakers last attempt to open mideast negotiations stalled in 
march over his attempt to persuade israel to accept participation 
by palestinian arabs deported from the west bank and others who had 
homes in east jerusalem 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir objected to those 
arabapproved provisions because he saw them as challenging 
israels retention of jerusalem as its capital and the west bank 
baker told levy he was anxious to have a meeting in paris 
provided the foreign ministers health permitted the sources said 
levy had not responded yet and that a decision depended on what 
his doctors decide 
hopefully he will be able to go the sources said 
the israeli government has been eager for talks with the bush 
administration which lately has taken a cool stance toward it 
us strategy is to push the israelis to accept bakers formula 
for the elections shamir proposed last year to hold among 
palestinians on the west bank and in gaza 
in the letter baker reiterated the provisions israel found 
objectionable and said they had been adapted at the behest of the 
palestinians because we thought it might be helpful

angela van etten uses the five dwords to describe the most 
bizzare barroom fad of the 1980s its dangerous its degrading 
derisive dehumanizing and it engenders discrimination 
she says 
ms van ettens disgust is aimed at dwarftossing the strange 
sport that evolved in australia and became popular in this 
country a few years back she is herself a dwarf a vocal member of 
the little people of america and she is one reason there may be a 
sixth dword for dwarftossing 
dead 
ms van etten a lawyer who writes law books in rochester ny 
is one of several shortstatured people who have lobbied 
relentlessly in favor of a bill to effectively ban dwarftossing in 
new york state 
the bill similar to one that became law in florida last year 
would ban the practice in any place that serves liquor since 
dwarftossing has never been terribly popular in places that dont 
serve liquor the ban pretty much gives it the hook 
the bill awaits gov mario cuomos signature he said last week 
that he was studying it and hadnt made up his mind 
it may be moot members of little people of america the 
organization for dwarfs founded by actor billy barty in 1957 have 
kept a close watch on exhibitions of dwarftossing across the 
country they say it has virtually stopped at least for now 
it may be a fad thats faded out said heidi heinrich an 
office manager in tallahassee fla who has been a national leader 
in the fight against dwarftossing 
ms heinrich is aware of only one exhibition of dwarftossing in 
recent months an event in south carolina that occurred while the 
state legislature was considering a bill to criminalize the 
practice the bill was defeated 
dwarftossing as the name suggests is a practice in which 
people of average height pick up dwarfs and heave them as far as 
they can it also has produced an offshoot dwarfbowling in 
which small people are put on skateboards and rolled into bowling 
pins in many cases the dwarfs are paid to take part 
i find it somewhat hard to understand ms van etten says 
but i think people are willing to go along with it because the 
dwarfs agree to it 
that of course is not reason enough for ms van etten or many 
other dwarfs who say that all small people suffer from the acts of 
a few 
it perpetuates the whole image that were playthings you 
know the jesters in the kings court ms heinrich said 
ms van etten calls it intolerable really even if these 
people are willing to be thrown if you picked out any other 
minority group do you think it would last five minutes can you 
imagine a jew toss or a black toss 
critics say the practice is not only offensive but dangerous 
many dwarfs have brittle bones to begin with and even a strong 
human body wasnt made to be a projectile 
dwarftossing is believed to have begun in this country around 
1985 it reached a peak of notoriety last year when it was 
featured on an episode of televisions la law a dwarf lawyer 
on the show was put in the position of defending the practice in 
court 
in real life its not easy to find anyone to defend 
dwarftossing promoters and practitioners tend to travel around 
and keep a low profile one promoter who will gladly discuss the 
issue is baird jones of new york but jones approaches 
dwarftossing from a slightly unusual perspective his 
dwarftossing contests were presented as avantgarde art a way of 
tweaking the values of mainstream america 
jones says dwarftossing is more akin to a lynching than 
anything else thats what we were mocking when we did it we were 
saying can you believe that in a civilized society this is 
occurring 
for a while it was all the rage in some of manhattans 
trendiest nightclubs but no more the glitterati have gone on to 
more tasteful pursuits such as nude juggling 
i havent done anything recently with it because once that 
bill got started none of the clubs wanted it jones said 
ive been turned down at all the clubs whenever ive proposed 
it 
that suits little people just fine 
i hope its a passing threat and there will be movement on to 
other concerns ms heinrich said this was just a first step 
toward making society realize that we deserve acceptance were not 
freaks

former atlanta mayor andrew young remains a 
democratic frontrunner in his bid to become georgias first black 
governor but experts see large hurdles in his path even if he 
finishes first in the july 17 primary 
youngs problems include the unspoken issue of race the 
likelihood of a runoff after the fiveman primary and lt gov zell 
miller 
miller youngs leading white opponent has won substantial 
support from blacks and liberal whites over the past 16 years as 
the states lieutenant governor 
while the primary campaign has been free of racial references a 
milleryoung runoff could produce racially polarized voting that 
would tip the election to miller said atlanta pollster claibourne 
darden 
racism is there it just hasnt been brought up darden 
said and it wont be brought up by any opponent of andys but 
andys black and zells white and even a blackandwhite tv shows 
that its inherent in the election it never needs to be spoken 
georgia requires a runoff if no candidate receives more than 50 
percent of the vote but the law is under challenge in a federal 
court suit filed by black legislators and civil rights activists a 
judge is scheduled to hear arguments beginning monday 
young is not participating in the lawsuit at one time he 
opposed runoffs but he now says they ensure the emergence of a 
strong democratic nominee 
for the moment young and miller are nipandtuck for the lead 
according to the latest poll conducted last month by the atlanta 
journalconstitution it showed young and miller with 30 percent 
each 
state sen roy barnes a lawyer courting the conservative and 
environmental vote had 12 percent state rep lauren bubba 
mcdonald a hardware store owner backed by state house leaders had 
6 percent and former gov lester maddox had 4 percent 
young is hoping to accomplish in georgia what l douglas wilder 
did in virginia last year when he became the nations first elected 
black governor and during the campaign he has taken only glancing 
attacks from opponents despite eight years as mayor of atlanta 
when he came under fire for his management style and for the citys 
crime rate and other urban problems 
theres been a lot of carefulness not to make charges against 
young that could be interpreted as racial said michael binford 
associate professor of political science at georgia state 
university the white candidates are really cautious they dont 
want anything to appear racially motivated because they know 
theyre going to need black voters in the fall 
the most likely republican challenger in november is state rep 
johnny isakson an atlanta real estate executive 
young whose core support is among blacks and liberal whites 
has attempted to capture the attention of conservative white 
voters by telling businessmen in economically strapped areas he can 
recruit industry as easily for southern georgia as he did for 
atlanta 
blacks made up 218 percent of the states registered voters in 
1988 last year for which complete figures are available but 242 
percent of the population 
young also has taken pains to secure the votes of abortion 
rights advocates reminding voters he is prochoice so is miller 
the campaigns are well financed in figures released last month 
youngs contributions were second only to millers 276 million 
compared with 368 million 
campaign spokesmen said about onethird of youngs money came 
from out of state disclosure reports showed the givers included 
talk show host oprah winfrey 10000 entertainer bill cosby 
15000 sportscaster howard cosell 500 musician herb alpert 
5000 and jacqueline kennedy onassis 1000 
financial disclosure reports for june released friday show 
young has kept the most money for the final days of the primary 
campaign with 464581 on hand miller had 309619 in cash and 
barnes had 221725 left in the bank 
miller has made legalizing a state lottery one of his principal 
campaign issues the atlanta journalconstitution poll in june 
found 72 percent of those sampled favored a lottery 
young says he favors letting the people vote on a lottery but 
personally opposes the idea

a city inspector ticketed lubeski 47 in may after receiving a 
complaint from an unidentified neighbor who took offense at the 
shade of green highlighting the otherwise white colonialstyle 
house 
but now the resident is unwilling to testify in court which 
means lubeski cannot be charged with a misdmeanor city spokesman

according to dearborn law homes in a neighborhood must be

shocking orange and there is a citizen complaint this could happen

the scene from the weekly cabinet session and vowed police would 
use tougher measures to prevent further attacks

the us embassy has warned americans 
to stay away from the citys nightclub district because of 
unconfirmed reports that communist rebels may try to kill us 
nationals there a us spokesman said sunday 
embassy spokesman stanley schrager said the advisory was issued 
after a bar owner received a letter last week purportedly from the 
new peoples army threatening attacks on americans in the citys 
ermita district 
we dont know whether the letter is valid or not said 
schrager but we have a policy of advising americans every time 
we receive any indication of a threat 
relatively few americans frequent bars in the ermita district 
located about two blocks from the us embassy the district 
includes several foreign firms 
ermita a highcrime center of drugs prostitution and petty 
street crime is popular with australians west germans french and 
scandinavian tourists who are easily mistaken by filipinos for 
americans 
the us embassy estimates there are between 120000 and 140000 
americans in the philippines including 40000 affiliated with the 
american military 
at least eight americans are believed to have been slain by the 
new peoples army since april 1989 last month suspected rebels 
kidnapped peace corps volunteer timothy swanson 26 of cheyenne 
wyo on the central island of negros 
also last month the united states suspended peace corps 
operations because of rebel threats swanson was abducted june 13 
but us officials learned of it only two weeks later after trying 
to contact him about the suspension order 
on friday a statement purportedly from the negros rebels said 
swanson and a japanese aid worker kidnapped in may would be 
released this month the statement said both were safe and had been 
cleared of spy charges 
if the statement was authentic it would be the first public 
acknowledgement from the rebels that they were holding swanson and 
the japanese worker fumio mizuno 
the statement warned that peace corps volunteers would no longer 
be permitted to work on negros because some of them had been spying 
for the philippine military 
schrager said the united states welcomed reports that swanson 
was alive but had no way of verifying whether the statement was 
really from the guerrillas

the bush administration is determined to resolve 
a nasty dispute between the united states and europe over farm 
subsidies at this years economic summit 
without a compromise on agriculture the administration 
believes an ambitious fouryear effort to overhaul the global 
trading system could end in failure 
those talks being held under the auspices of the 97nation 
general agreement on tariffs and trade hold out tremendous promise 
of expanding trade opportunities for american farmers and 
businesses by removing existing barriers and bringing more products 
under the rules of the global trading system 
in an era when the united states has suffered through six 
consecutive years of 100 billionplus trade deficits it is no 
wonder that the administration is searching for ways to boost us 
exports 
us trade representative carla hills paints failure of the 
trade liberalization talks in almost apocalyptic terms of gravely 
diminished prosperity for both rich and poor nations alike as 
countries turn inward and erect trade barriers 
the talks known as the uruguay round for the country where they 
began in 1986 face an endoftheyear deadline for conclusion with 
the final bargaining session scheduled for brussels in early 
december however with only six months left none of the major 
issues has been resolved 
us negotiators are seeking to phase out all tradedistorting 
farm subsidies to dismantle barriers to trade in services a 
highgrowth area where the united states is extremely competitive 
and to crack down on copyright piracy estimated to cost american 
companies 60 billion annually 
but of all the issues agriculture is seen as the key that is 
because third world countries have balked at agreeing to us 
proposals on removing barriers to trade in services and beefing up 
their enforcement of copyright laws unless they win expanded 
markets for their farm products 
the farm subsidy battle is also draining government treasuries 
with the cost to us taxpayers and consumers put at 75 billion 
annually and the cost to the 12nation european community running 
an even higher 125 billion annually 
the united states is pushing for a complete phase out of 
subsidies in three areas export subsidies paid by governments to 
make their countrys products cheaper on world markets domestic 
price supports paid to farmers to boost production and barriers 
erected to keep products out thus boosting the price to a 
countrys consumers 
the european community however has balked at this approach 
expressing a willingness only to consider reducing the aggregate 
total of farm subsidies and charging that the us proposals could 
mean pushing 2 million to 3 million of their lessefficient farmers 
off the land a politically unacceptable result 
the dispute over farm subsidies turned bitter at a may session 
attended by us and european officials 
frans andriessen the communitys top trade official told 
reporters in houston that continued pressure by the united states 
would backfire and make it even harder to reach a compromise 
if the pressure is exaggerated it makes it more difficult to 
negotiate andriessen said 
the united states however is holding firm to its position that 
it will accept nothing less than an agreement which addresses all 
three areas 
the bush administration has tried to paint the european 
community as the lone holdout in the farm battle but japan is also 
holding back on the question of removing all market barriers which 
would submit the protected japanese rice market to foreign 
competition 
about the only thing that is certain is that bush will have his 
hands full in convincing his economic summit partners to come 
around to the us position japan west germany france britain 
and italy all have reasons for protecting farm subsidies at the 
economic summit bush can count only on canadian prime minister 
brian mulroney for full support for the us position 
but hills said the united states has no intention of dropping 
its effort for global agricultural reform seeing success here as 
the key to achieving ultimate victory with the total uruguay round 
the uruguay round holds the promise at a magical moment in 
history of being the ultimate competitiveness machine it will 
provide an enormous boost for emerging democracies in eastern 
europe and latin america she told reporters at a presummit 
briefing it holds a real prize not only for us but for the 
vitality of the global trading system in the 21st century

iran has decided to use its influence 
with shiite moslem kidnappers to free one of 16 western hostages 
they hold and a scenario for the release is being worked out a 
source close to the fundamentalist hezbollah said sunday 
the decision was taken in tehran to release the hostage the 
details on where when and how are now under consideration in 
lebanon the source said on condition of anonymity 
the source would not speculate on who would be released or 
answer any other questions we have to wait for a communique 
from the kidnappers he said 
another source close to the command of syrian troops in beiruts 
moslem sector said he did not expect a hostage to go free before 
the middle of the week 
we havent been contacted yet about arrangements of the 
release it usually takes two to three days after such contact to 
have the hostage out the source said he also requested 
anonymity 
the shiite source spoke just before israeli warplanes struck a 
hezbollah base in southern lebanon in their 14th air raid on 
targets in lebanon this year 
at least two people were killed and seven wounded in the raid on 
a position between the villages of jarjou and ein bouswar two to 
three miles north of israels selfdesignated security zone in 
southern lebanon 
it was not clear if the hostageholders would cancel the 
reported plan for a hostage release in retaliation for the raid 
moslem fundamentalists accuse western governments especially 
the united states of bias toward israel and hold them responsible 
for israels actions against the arabs 
hezbollah or party of god is believed to be an umbrella for 
underground factions holding most of the westerners 
newsmen and photographers maintained a vigil at their offices 
and outside major syrian army positions awaiting word from the 
kidnappers to confirm reports of an imminent hostage release 
hostages released in the past were turned over to the syrian 
army command driven to syria and then flown from there to their 
homes their releases followed statements from the kidnappers 
announcing who would be freed and when 
syria is the main powerbroker in lebanon it has 40000 troops 
in northern and eastern provinces as well as moslem west beirut 
but it has little influence on the hostageholders 
tehrans official islamic republic news agency reported saturday 
that a western hostage would probably be released soon it said 
that most likely the hostage would be one of the europeans 
the hostages include six americans and 10 europeans four 
britons two swiss two west germans an irishman and an italian 
the longest held is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press he was kidnapped march 16 
1985 
the 47word report from irna monitored in nicosia cyprus was 
attributed to unidentified sources the headline read a european 
hostage may be released soon 
the report said the sources hinted that he is most probably a 
european national 
a source close to the syrian army command said that if any 
hostage were released it would probably be the irishman brian 
keenan 
the source who spoke on condition of anonymity refused to say 
why he thought keenan who also holds a british passport would be 
the one 
keenan 39 was kidnapped in moslem west beirut april 11 1986 
as he walked from his home to the american university of beirut 
where he taught english 
diplomats in tehran said in recent interviews that iranian 
president hashemi rafsanjani has renewed a push to get the captives 
freed 
no group has claimed the abduction of keenan of belfast but 
when american educator frank reed was released from captivity in 
april he said he had seen keenan 
another american robert polhill also was freed in april but 
he apparently was held by other kidnappers 
keenans sister elaine spence told the british press 
association in london that she held hope her brother would be

national security adviser brent scowcroft on 
sunday agreed with a leading chinese dissident that scowcrofts 
controversial secret mission to beijing last year was a failure at 
least so far 
i think its premature to say whether the mission was 
successful or not scowcroft said on cnns newsmaker sunday 
television program within the time frame we hoped for it was 
unsuccessful 
scowcroft was responding to a statement broadcast earlier sunday 
from fang lizhi a chinese astrophysicist who spent more than a 
year in the us embassy in beijing following chinas brutal 
suppression of prodemocracy demonstrations last summer in 
tiananmen square 
lizhi who recently was allowed to go to britain said i do 
not believe that the sending of a special presidential envoy last 
december was a successful tactic 
lizhi in a prerecorded interview broadcast on nbctvs meet 
the press program called for close monitoring of chinas human 
rights record 
there still remain a large number of students held in custody 
or in prison he said some have already been sentenced these 
cases still need to be solved moreover we must not forget those 
who have been imprisoned now for more than 10 years people like 
wei jingsheng 
in the wake of the tiananmen president bush announced sanctions 
and suspended highlevel contacts with the chinese government but 
he secretly sent scowcroft to beijing saying later it was 
important for china not to feel isolated 
at one point secretary of state james a baker iii denied there 
had been any such missions and later was forced to admit he had 
lied 
scowcroft here with bush in advance of mondays opening of the 
western economic summit said chinas transition to an open 
society interrupted by tiananmen has perhaps resumed if you 
call the release of fang lizhi part of that process 
but scowcroft said the administration still wanted china to 
release all those who were peaceful protesters stop jamming the 
voice of america and resume the course they were on 
lets not put those as conditions for the united states to 
relax its remaining sanctions against china he added but there 
are strong limits as to what the united states can do if china 
does not change 
bush on saturday said he would not stand in the way of a planned 
52 billion loan from japan to china

just eight days before georgias primary 
elections a federal judge will hear arguments monday in a lawsuit 
alleging that the states majorityvote rule is racially 
discriminatory 
a group of black legislators and civil rights officials led by 
state rep tyrone brooks has challenged the system that requires a 
runoff if one candidate fails to receive a majority of the votes 
cast in elections for state offices 
the class action suit seeks to immediately impose a plurality 
system whereby the candidate receiving the most votes would be the 
winner even if he or she got fewer than half a hearing is 
scheduled before us district judge richard c freeman 
if imposed before the primary such a method would be seen as 
helping former atlanta mayor andrew young in his bid against four 
others in the democratic gubernatorial race 
young trying to become georgias first black governor is 
thought to have a better chance to win a plurality on july 17 than 
a majority in a twocandidate runoff current polls put him roughly 
equal with the leading white candidate with each getting about 30 
percent support 
young however is not backing the lawsuit 
the state has argued that the 1964 law passed in the wake of 
national civil rights legislation was not rooted in racism but 
instead represents a longstanding commitment to the concept of 
majority voting 
attorney general michael bowers chraged in briefs filed last 
month that the suit was an attempt to manipulate the 
governors race 
laughlin mcdonald an american civil liberties union attorney 
representing the plaintiffs in the case said he will present 
evidence that the georgia system was established as a way to 
maintain the power of the states white democratic leadership and 
disenfranchise blacks 
the white democratic leadership regards it as very 
critical he said friday if you go to a plurality it will 
drive out the white majority 
lawyers in the attorney generals office who are involved in the 
suit did not return phone calls for comment late last week 
brooks said friday that legislative debate at the time of the 
bills passage focused on its impact on blacks and that the 
results of elections in ensuing years have provided ample evidence 
that the majority requirement discourages black candidates 
were going to do our best to demonstrate to judge freeman 
that when the statute was enacted the intent was to keep blacks out 
of office brooks said 
we intend to show that because of the runoff weve been kept 
at the bare minimum of the elected officials he said 
brooks brushed aside criticism that the suit was timed to aid 
young he said he has been trying to eliminate the runoff system 
since 1984 but has been turned back by his fellow lawmakers 
no matter when you file it its going to impact on some 
election cycle brooks said we have elections every two years 
we didnt see any reason not to file it this year 
mcdonald rejected the notion that the concept of majority voting 
was an american tradition 
to say that it is american and constitutional is simply not 
so he said the bill of rights says that minorities do have 
rights 
if there were strict adherence to majority voting he said we 
would never have had desegregated schools because thats not what 
the majority in the states wanted 
the state has argued that the case should be dismissed or moved 
to another judicial circuit because brooks has another suit 
pending against the states system of electing superior court 
judges the state contends two cases overlap

years said cullen was in a class by himself 
professionally nobody i ever worked with was his peer said 
stewart a friend for 35 years there was nobody like him nor 
will there every be off camera he was the same kind of lovable 
fun mischievous guy you saw on television

new york times in 1958 i may never be one in any case but ive 
seen too many big names burn themselves out on television

albanian leader ramiz alia appears 
unshaken in his determination to keep tight control over his 
limited reform program despite unprecedented popular resistance to 
decades of harsh communist rule 
the crisis began when thousands of discontented albanians 
crowded foreign embassies hoping for a chance to begin new lives in 
the west others took to the streets of the capital tirana in 
antigovernment protests 
but by sunday the turmoil generated by the asylumseekers had 
not escalated into the kind of unrest that toppled communists 
elsewhere in europe 
potentially more threatening to the regime was dissatisfaction 
with its slow tentative approach to changing the centrally 
controlled economy which has caused albanias standard of living 
to lag far behind its neighbors 
alia began tinkering with the stalinist economic political and 
social systems he inherited even before the rush on foreign 
embassies in tirana 
under a reform program begun in may and recently accelerated 
citizens who previously had no hope of traveling abroad are now 
entitled to passports a ban on religion has been lifted the death 
penalty has been abolished for defectors and modest economic 
retooling has been promised 
the country long considered the hermit of europe for its 
isolationist policies has signaled willingness to restore ties 
with both superpowers it plans to join the 35nation conference on 
security and cooperation in europe after being the only nation on 
the continent to boycott it 
but alia has offered far fewer reforms than communists in other 
eastern european countries such as hungary and bulgaria who 
voluntarily abolished their monopoly on power and introduced 
multiparty democracies 
alia told a special session of the communist party central 
committee called in part to deal with the embassy crisis that the 
party would remain supreme 
what is of fundamental importance is the fact that the masses 
should be led by the party alia told the meeting over the 
weekend his comments avoided any reference to even limited 
political plurality 
while the central committee approved personnel changes in the 
party and government alias authority appeared unshaken several 
longtime politburo members were replaced with younger men believed 
closer to his way thinking 
the naming of hekuran isai as interior and police minister 
however seemed to indicate a determination to deal harshly with 
any challenge from the street of the kind that ended communist rule 
in romania czechoslovakia and east germany 
isai had held the post under enver hoxha the founder of 
communist albania and alias predecessor the choice disappointed 
those hoping for central committee appointees not associated with 
past repression 
police sealed off embassy row over the weekend from new 
asylumseekers but it appeared they had been ordered to keep a low 
profile and avoid further street confrontations as the leadership 
sought to weather the storm 
as part of that strategy authorities agreed saturday to let the 
more than 5000 asylumseekers emigrate under foreign supervision 
the leaders clearly hoped that sealing the embassy district and 
providing free access to passports would halt another rush on the 
diplomatic missions and end the threat of unrest 
alia also announced limited economic reforms to the central 
committee meeting calculated to alleviate low living standards 
lack of luxury items and shortages of staples all of which have 
generated widespread dissatisfaction 
he announced wage increases of as high as 20 percent in some 
cases and said tradesmen and shopkeepers could once again work for 
themselves rather than the state such moves may be too little too 
late however particularly under liberalized travel laws allowing 
more of the population of 32 million to compare their spartan 
existence to life in the west 
while some of the asylumseekers appeared motivated by 
frustration over political repression others were clearly 
disillusioned by their scramble to make ends meet and ready to risk 
all for a better economic life 
one of the wouldbe emigres in a telephone interview with 
hungarian state radio said he just cant make a living in 
albania 
the 28yearold man said he worked as bricklayer a chauffeur 
and a lathe operator for 60 dollars a month not enough to 
support his family

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev is worried 
his country cannot make the painful leap from a closely controlled 
economic system to a marketdriven version without western help 
his quest for financial aid will be a major issue at the 
sevennation summit of industrial powers that opens monday in 
houston 
but its a twopart issue not only is there the question of how 
much the other industrial giants can or want to do but also the 
matter of what a huge cash infusion would accomplish in the soviet 
union 
there is no doubt gorbachev wants help he has made that clear 
in public as well as in recent private letters to president bush 
and british prime minister margaret thatcher 
the leaders of west germany and france are advocating that the 
industrial powers approve aid worth 15 billion to bolster reforms 
and help moscow meet payments to foreign firms the soviet union 
traditionally has been punctual in meeting payments but recent 
delays have started to erode confidence among foreign investors 
bonn already has approved an unconditional loan of 31 billion 
and chancellor helmut kohl is apparently growing impatient with 
opposition from other leaders to the soviet aid plan 
bush so far has been reluctant to agree to a massive aid program 
until soviet authorities move more decisively from a planned to a 
market economy 
estimates of how much money would begin to stabilize the soviet 
economy range from 5 billion to 20 billion colossal compared to 
what eastern european countries have received to restructure their 
economies but modest given the size of the soviet economy and its 
relatively small foreign debt 
moscows balanceofpayment deficit now tops 2 billion nearly 
half it owed to west german companies part of the west german 
credit is expected to be used to pay overdue bills 
inability to keep food stores stocked has already forced moscow 
to spend an extra 3 billion rubles 500 million on food imports 
and more aid is thought necessary if the soviet union is going 
to leap from a centrally planned to a market economy 
without western cash the move to the market could inflict 
hardship on the population and more social pressure on gorbachev 
premier nikolai i ryzhkov told the supreme soviet parliament in 
late may that the consumer market was destitute 
ryzhkov presenting a plan for what he called a regulated 
market economy warned that if trends continued many crucial 
decisions unpopular as they are will meet an even more embittered 
response 
the soviet economy is plagued by inflation and a huge budget 
deficit in the first four months of this year ethnic unrest and 
strikes caused the loss of an estimated 10 million manhours 
promarket reforms are likely to drop production further as 
unprofitable businesses go bankrupt 
still there is hope that western aid could help keep store 
shelves stocked and bolster peoples faith that reforms will 
improve their lives 
soviet reformers are stymied not only by consumer shortages but 
by a 70year legacy of central planning that allowed only limited 
forms of individual enterprise they are also hampered by decades 
of propaganda portraying capitalist economies as ridden with 
poverty unemployment and vicious competition 
gosplan the central agency responsible for running the economy 
has concluded outside aid is needed but has not made public a 
blueprint for how to spend western money 
delegates to the 28th communist party congress under way in 
moscow have shown deep hostility to private property and individual 
ownership of factories although some delegates did support western 
help 
aid is a good idea there are big changes in our economy but 
we cant seem to set things straight help could make things better 
and we should accept this offer said delegate nikolai v mikhug 
a worker from a tuberolling factory in the ural mountains

african leaders open an annual 
summit meeting monday that will be overshadowed by the collapse of 
communism in eastern europe 
noting political shakeups from the baltic to the balkans the 
51member organization of african unity ministerial council 
resolved that its governments pledge themselves to full 
democratization in a continent dominated by oneparty states 
when they gained independence from european colonial powers 
many african unity countries adopted political systems like those 
entrenched at the time in eastern europe 
a permitting political environment which guarantees human 
rights and the observance of the rule of law would assure high 
standards of probity and accountability on the part of those who 
hold public office the ministers declared in a draft statement 
for the summit 
the heads of state meet monday through wednesday for their 26th 
conference 
main issues for discussion will be efforts to end south africas 
racial policy of apartheid the member states foreign debts the 
growing plight of refugees and the middle east 
but the winds of change in eastern europe constitute major 
parameters which should govern africas collective thinking about 
the challenges and options before her in the 1990s and beyond 
the draft declaration said 
it was prepared by foreign ministers who set the summit agenda 
during a threeday meeting last week 
on the issue of south africa the report welcomes president fw 
de klerks recent reforms but it also noted that those changes 
only tinker with the system and fall far short of a common 
objective of totally dismantling apartheid 
the ministerial council said that until pretoria commits itself 
to abolishing apartheid the international community must continue 
to presure south africa with economic sanctions 
the ministers painted a grim picture of an african continent 
that is disintegrating 
food output is down and population growth up the draft notes 
per capita income has plunged and exports have dropped standards 
of living have fallen in tandem with spending on health housing 
education and other social services 
by the end of 1989 foreign debt had swollen to 257 billion 
the ministers proposed that foreign powers restructure their 
economies to help poorer nations 
apart from events in eastern europe a highlight of the summit 
will be an address by nelson mandela deputy president of the 
african national congress guerrilla group that is at the forefront 
of efforts to end apartheid in south africa 
mandela 71 who was freed from a south african prison in march 
is expected to thank african leaders for supporting the anc during 
the 27 years he was incarcerated 
lask week in uganda mandela and three african presidents 
discussed proposals aimed at hastening an end to south africas 
white rule they said they would present the proposals to the 
summit

lech walesa and solidaritys rank and file 
accused the trade unions parliament members of forgetting their 
roots sunday at a meeting in the gdansk shipyard where the labor 
group was born 
the sixhour meeting which drew more than 2000 workers and 
their families was attended by solidarity parliamentary leader 
bronislaw geremek and 160 of the lawmakers swept to office by union 
endorsement last year 
prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki under increasing attack over 
the governments painful economic reform measures turned down a 
request to attend instead he asked workers to come talk with him 
wednesday 
held in the workers hall where the east blocs first 
independent trade union was formed in 1980 the meeting highlighted 
the rift between workers in the provinces and the solidarityled 
government in warsaw 
it took place one day after mazowiecki and walesa met at a 
secluded monastery outside warsaw and announced a truce in their 
political war over the pace of reforms in poland 
but the prime minister remained embattled representatives of 
polands 25 million private farmers have given him until wednesday 
to agree to guaranteed minimum farm prices or face a nationwide 
road blockade 
in a partial answer to walesas calls for faster political 
change mazowiecki ousted three former communists from his cabinet 
friday and agreed to early parliamentary and presidential elections 
only about 100 of the 260strong solidarity parliamentary 
caucus known as the citizens parliamentary club failed to come to 
gdansk to meet with the shipyard workers some of those who 
rejected the invitation had earlier cited the aggressive tone in 
which it was framed 
about 400 people jammed the hall sunday and more than 2000 
listened outside over loudspeakers as walesa addressed the 
lawmakers not mincing words 
today i hear voices saying who dared to invite the 
parliament deputies he said doesnt this hall have the right 
to call you it has you started from here 
walesa said parliament has to be accountable to voters 
the question is whether you are going to be above us or 
should you first come back and ask whats most important not in 
your opinion but in the opinion of those who elected you 
he acknowledged the deputies were working day and night but 
said there was a lack of public explanation of their decisions 
one blow from the farmers or the miners will put all those 
laws into the wastebasket walesa said 
the solidarity chairman in his only reference to the talks 
saturday said he and mazowiecki discussed how they fell into their 
current dispute 
we said bluntly because we never talked about what was 
supposed to happen after communism how we would accomplish the 
second stage how we would go along with poland without forgetting 
where we came from he said today we must return to the 
roots 
workers from the baltic port citys three main shipyards invited 
parliament members to tell them workers complaints about the 
10monthold solidarityled government 
the government is late with everything and ordinary people 
feel helpless facing poverty said zbigniew lis leader of the 
solidarity chapter in the gdansk shipyard 
according to lis workers want communists punished for past 
economic and political crimes the elimination of companies created 
by the communist elite from state property and a slowdown of the 
recession caused by the austerity measures 
geremek told the workers it was not surprising they were upset 
by the difficulties they face 
whoever promises there will be a speeding up in public welfare 
is speaking an untruth we are at the beginning of a difficult road 
and we must not make any false promises he said

when sen jesse helms was a television 
commentator in the 1960s he made a flattering assessment of the 
first black student to enter clemson university 
now the conservative republican is being challenged in his 
reelection bid by that same man democrat harvey gantt former 
mayor of charlotte 
in 1963 helms called gantt sincere in his desire to obtain an 
education and praised him for resisting the pose of a conquering 
hero 
helms heaped praise on gantt while directing criticism at james 
meredith who had become the first black to enter the university of 
mississippi a few months earlier an event that sparked a major 
riot 
meredith who was wounded during a freedom march in mississippi 
in 1965 has changed his views markedly since then and today serves 
on helms washington staff he calls integration a con job and 
blames liberals for blacks social problems 
in his commentary 27 years ago helms said gantt has 
demonstrated that he knows a thing or two about human nature and 
more important to our way of thinking that he is sincere the 
editorial was broadcast jan 29 1963 on wraltv in raleigh the 
news and observer of raleigh reported sunday 
he has stoutly resisted the pose of a conquering hero for the 
forces of integration helms said he simply wants he says to 
be an architect and clemson is the only college in south carolina 
that can teach him how to be one 
he has rejected the fanfare and trappings of the naacp he has 
turned away from the liberal press and television networks which 
would glorify him he has refused to make pompous speeches and 
statements 
if ever a man put his best foot forward harvey gantt has done 
so his conduct will not cause south carolinians to relish court 
orders relating to integration but he has done a great deal 
probably more than he himself realizes to establish respectful 
comunications across sensitive barriers in human relations 
helms said gantt and meredith were a study in contrasts 
there is a difference in james meredith and harvey gantt 
meredith as a man handpicked as the showpiece of forced 
integration meredith as a man who never quite persuaded anybody 
that he was really interested in an education meredith as a man 
constantly and piously parading before the microphone and 
television cameras helms said

a test found the national weather services new 
computerized radar storm detection system breaks down frequently 
and is less reliable than the 33yearold system now in use a 
newspaper reported sunday 
results of the sixmonth test rate the 1957vintage radar system 
as 10 times more reliable than the new equipment called nexrad 
the cleveland plain dealer reported sunday 
the test results were obtained under the freedom of information 
act by the union representing weather service employees the 
national weather service employees organization it said 
the test was conducted by the air force from march to august 
1989 in oklahoma the 118page report said the new radar 
malfunctioned every 19 days while the existing radar called 
wsr57 breaks down on average every 14 days 
the air force testers said failures critically degraded the 
effectiveness of nexrad because they occurred during periods when 
forecasters especially depend upon radar to detect severe storm 
patterns 
many times in severe weather episodes when the operators 
needed the system to support critical warning operations the 
system was not available the air force said 
the testers said the wsr57 has a demonstrated reliability 
approximately 10 times greater than the demonstrated reliability of 
the nexrad tested 
some 120 nexrad units which can measure wind speed and 
direction and rain volume in a storm are the centerpiece of a 1 
billion modernization of the weather service scheduled for the 
1990s 
william read head of a team investigating the weather services 
actions during the june 14 storm that caused flash flooding in 
eastern ohio and killed 26 said the conventional radar at 
akroncanton was unable to determine the storms severity in time 
to post a warning 
don sarreals special assistant to the nexrad program office 
said the weather service is committed to modernization despite the 
test results 
the program is supported and we are proceeding to install the 
radar sarreals said were making progress as rapidly as we 
can when youre building something for the first time you 
encounter various obstacles 
he said the first operational nexrad will be installed in 
october near oklahoma city 
its going to go through a vigorous testing period before its 
turned over to the government and commissioned sarreals said 
most problems have been encountered in the computers that 
interpret weather data obtained by the radar unit he said 
the key to the thing is the computer thats what makes it 
unique sarreals said its the computer that can dig into the 
data 
in the eastern ohio flooding meteorologists were unable to 
determine the potential rainfall in the thunderstorms appearing on 
conventional radar sarreals said 
you have to make estimates for rainfall now which are 
basically done by humans he said a computer with a highspeed 
processor will dig into that with nexrad

groups a television station has decided to pull the 1961 dick 
tracy cartoon series because two characters are considered ethnic 
stereotypes 
the disneyowned kcal had scheduled a 13week run of the 
cartoons to coincide with disneys release last month of the dick 
tracy movie 
the series ran four weeks before asian and hispanic groups 
complained about the characters jo jitsu and go go gomez two 
detectives who helped tracy fight crime 
jo jitsu has buck teeth squints through glasses and 
mispronounces the letter r go go gomez wears a sombrero and 
takes frequent siestas 
it should have been obvious from the very beginning that the 
show was offensive said raul ruiz a professor of chicano 
studies at cal state northridge 
kcal said in a statement that the series had been reviewed 
before it was broadcast and was not deemed offensive because the 
characters were positive images 
its not our intention to offend anybody said kcal program

the united states undisputed leader of the free 
world for four decades of cold war is adjusting to a new era when 
economic power counts more than military might 
the adjustment process will be nowhere more apparent than in 
houston as president bush plays host beginning monday for the 
annual economic summit meeting of the worlds seven richest 
industrial democracies 
where the western allies were once willing to let the united 
states set the agenda the summit countries seem willing even 
eager to chart their own courses now that americas nuclear 
umbrella no longer seems crucial 
1990 is the first year after the end of the cold war said 
michael mandelbaum an international expert with the council on 
foreign relations it is a time when the american nuclear surplus 
will be less and less important and the american fiscal deficit 
will be more important 
america is still the wealthiest of the wealthy when measured in 
terms of the 5 trillion in goods and services it produces 
annually but japan now second with a 3 trillion economy has 
been rapidly closing the gap some economists believe it could 
surpass the united states by the year 2000 
japan has already replaced the united states as the worlds 
largest creditor country reflecting its global investment clout 
america which began the 1980s as the worlds largest creditor 
country is now the biggest debtor the transformation occurred 
largely because americans transferred billions of dollars into 
foreign hands to pay for imported cars television sets and other 
consumer goods 
forced now to rely on foreigners to finance its economy to the 
tune of about 10 billion a month the new economic reality has 
spurred great domestic debate over whether the united states is 
losing control of its destiny to foreigners 
bush finds himself at odds with a number of the summit countries 
on a variety of issues at this years summit ranging from aid to 
the soviet union to cleaning up the global environment and trying 
to keep a nasty battle over farm subsidies from scuttling an effort 
to reform the world trading system 
if the farm subsidy fight is not resolved some analysts fear 
that the cold war could very well be followed by a global trade war 
as more and more countries fall to squabbling over trade imbalances 
and erect protectionist barriers to keep imports out 
as the compelling drive of the soviet threat no long forces 
the west to work together the economic forces could drive them 
apart said robert hormats a vice president at goldman sachs and 
a former us sherpa the top aide who prepares the summit 
agenda for the president 
the huge us budget deficit has long been a sore point with 
americas summit partners who contend that americas profligate 
borrowing needs have driven up world interest rates now that us 
defense spending is no longer seen as critical to keeping world 
peace the size of the budget deficit is likely to be even more of 
an irritant 
just before the summit bush reversed his opposition to tax 
increases as a way of solving the deficit problem while that 
change of heart drew catcalls from conservatives in the united 
states many foreign officials have breathed a sigh of relief 
they view getting the us budget under control as a critical 
step in solving some of americas more nettlesome economic problems 
as well as providing bush with sorely needed resources to play a 
more active role on the world stage 
last year for the first time japan replaced the united states 
as the worlds largest donor of official foreign aid 
the us government constrained by the budget deficit has 
provided what many considered to be rather modest amounts to help 
in the economic transformation of former communist countries in 
europe 
some foreign leaders see americas budget problems as the real 
reason bush is dragging his feet on giving direct economic support 
for soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs reform efforts 
bush is coming to the summit with one new initiative seeking 
support from the other leaders for a us plan to pour economic aid 
into fledgling democracies in latin america similar to the 
assistance being offered former communist countries in europe 
that bush proposal has been seen as a hopeful sign that the 
united states while no longer able to dominate the economic 
agenda will not draw inward in the coming decade 
our credibility has been damaged by unwillingness to provide 
even modest resources to support democratization in eastern europe 
and latin america said c fred bergsten head of the institute 
for international economics a washingtonbased research group 
budget correction would enable the united states to become a 
serious global player and world leader again

all four unsolved cases involve the slaying or disappearance of 
young people who were traveling by car in isolated areas one crime

victims mrs lauer said fbi and state police agents have told her

stepmother of another slaying victim said sunday after accounts of 
the police theory were published in area newspapers she is a 
spokeswoman for a group of the victims relatives and friends 
the virginianpilot and the ledgerstar newspapers in their 
combined sunday edition quoted an unidentified souce as saying 
that the killer could be someone disguised as a police officer or 
even an actual police officer 
here are details of the four cases 
in october 1986 rebecca a dowski 21 a william and mary 
student from poughkeepsie ny and cathleen m thomas 27 a

voters in warscarred chad cast ballots 
sunday in the first contested election since independence in 1960 
but opposition parties remain banned and virtually all candidates 
were from the ruling party 
voters chose among 436 progovernment candidates for the 123 
seats in a new national assembly most were from the ruling 
national union for independence and the revolution 
democracy here we are declared an enthusiastic commentator 
on state radio which reported calm orderly voting throughout the 
country 
some polling stations in ndjamena the capital were reported 
crowded and others nearly deserted as chads 3 million eligible 
voters had their first opportunity to pick among political rivals 
although opposition parties were barred from the elections the 
campaign was lively and hardfought candidates toured city streets 
in vehicles equipped with loudspeakers and wooed voters with offers 
of lowpriced beer or free sugar in one ndjamena district 26 
candidates were competing 
the 4000 polling stations spread across the vast landlocked 
nation opened at 6 am local time and were scheduled to close at 
midnight final results were not expected for at least two days 
the elections are the product of constitutional reforms approved 
by 99 percent of the electorate in a dec 10 referendum that also 
gave president hissene habre another sevenyear term 
habre voted about in his ndjamena neighborhood then told 
journalists that chad was entering a phase of democratization 
i hope these processes will be seen through to completion 
he said 
of the 123 assembly seats five are reserved for women and will 
be allocated on a delayed basis if less than five women win seats 
outright assembly members will serve fiveyear terms 
few senior members of the government or ruling party are seeking 
seats in the assembly which will replace the recently dissolved 
national consultative council 
the council had served as national legislature since 1982 but 
its members were appointed by habre and its powers were limited 
some council members have questioned whether the new assembly will 
have greater authority 
the threeweek campaign ended without any reports of serious 
political violence although the statecontrolled press scolded 
some candidates for wooing support with gifts or emphasizing clan 
allegiances rather than issues 
chad has a population of about 55 million it is one of the 
worlds poorest countries with an annual per capita income of 
200 and has been engaged in civil war almost continuously since 
independence from france three decades ago 
habres government is locked in a struggle with libyanbacked 
rebels who stage raids on border outposts from neighboring sudan 
the only previous legislative elections in chad were in 1962 
but the ruling party put up only one candidate for each seat

pioneer artificial heart recipient michael 
drummond who received two artificial hearts and one human heart 
has died of multiple organ failure at age 30 five years after his 
first transplant 
drummond succumbed saturday night to overwhelming complications 
including a blood infection kidney failure and lung problems 
brought on by a combination of a diseased gallbladder and obesity 
said dr jack g copeland 
copeland called drummond a pal and a friend and a good 
patient 
in 1987 when his first artificial heart was presented to the 
smithsonian institutes national museum of american history 
drummond said i guess i am sort of a part of history but not by 
choice its possible 100 years from now that the artificial heart 
will be as routine as a blood transfusion 
drummond and copeland set medical history in 1985 when drummond 
became the youngest of six jarvik7 artificial heart recipients and 
the first to undergo an implant as a bridge to human transplant 
on aug 29 1985 he was given his jarvik7 after a viral 
syndrome had caused congestive heart failure and copeland 
determined he had only 48 hours to live 
after 9 days on the jarvik heart drummond received the donor 
heart of a 19yearold texas man who died in a motorcycle crash 
drummond recovered fully including from a minor stroke while on 
the jarvik and led a normal life for 4 years resuming work at a 
phoenixarea grocery 
but he had been on a downhill course since undergoing emergency 
surgery feb 3 to remove a gangrenous gallbladder that led to a 
severe blood infection a blood clot in the lungs and an episode of 
rejection of his artificial heart 
copeland replaced drummonds failing transplanted heart may 21 
with a symbion j770 artificial heart within two days of the 
second implant other complications developed including fluid 
retention in the lungs and kidney impairment 
drummond 6foot2 weighing 268 pounds with an engaging smile 
that offset a quiet stoic demeanor certainly had the fight 
said lisa slayton a member of the cardiothoracic intensive care 
units nursing team 
she said the nursing team had had a good cry after his death 
we all took care of mike like he was our brother he was like 
family 
drummonds father clarence said in a wavering voice saturday 
night were just grateful that the artificial heart was here for 
mike the first time he wouldnt have had the 4 years if he hadnt 
had it 
and even this time there were still things that mike wanted 
to do and with the artificial heart he had a shot at it anyway 
it didnt work out but he had a shot at it

a wave of bombings and attacks 
is widely viewed as the start of a terrorist campaign by rightwing 
extremists who want to preserve white rule at any price 
government and security officials fear the terrorism will be a 
major threat to stability as white and black leaders seek a 
peaceful solution to south africas centuriesold racial divisions 
the right hopes it can preserve white rule by foiling any peace 
talks 
what they are doing is to harm the efforts at reconciliation 
as well as the hopes of a peaceful transition to a new society 
the citizen newspaper said in an editorial july 5 
south africa does not need white terrorists any more than it 
needs black terrorists 
minister of law and order adriaan vlok said sunday nine white 
rightwing whites had been detained without charges in connection 
with a series of bombings against antiapartheid targets that began 
on april 12 
vlok said all nine had been detained under the internal security 
act which allows for indefinite detention without trial the 
people arrested are all supporters of a farright political 
ideology but cannot thus far be connected to any particular 
organization he said 
leaders on both sides say rightwing attacks could lead to 
general racial violence and undermine the peace effort black 
leaders say they will be forced to strike back if their people are 
hurt by the extremists 
some extreme rightwing groups have declared war on president 
fw de klerks government for announcing that it wants to end 
apartheid and negotiate a new constitution to share power with 
blacks 
six bombings in johannesburg in a week including an attack july 
6 on a black bus station that injured 24 people are seen as the 
first major offensive by the right wing other attacks in recent 
months included random killings of blacks and attacks on jewish 
temples 
the terrorism has come at a time when such black nationalist 
groups as the african national congress have all but abandoned 
violence 
government officials say the right poses a far greater threat 
than the armed struggle of the anc and other black organizations 
the anc campaign which began in 1961 was largely ineffective 
because of the groups internal problems and the superior strength 
of south african forces 
terrorism by whites is likely to be much more effective and 
dangerous security officials said nearly all white men receive 
compulsory military training guns and explosives are readily 
available to whites and the right has numerous sympathizers in the 
police and military they said 
it also is much easier for white extremists to operate without 
suspicion in a society with apartheid laws that give priviliged 
status to whites 
extremist white groups have taunted the government and police 
with their ability to operate easily and elude capture one stole 
scores of weapons from air force headquarters in pretoria in april 
with inside help 
there is no time to plan a counterrevolution it is now open 
war piet rudolph the groups leader said in a videotape sent 
to newspapers we will use every means at our disposal to fight 
the de klerk government the overthrow of which is the highest 
priority to us 
rudolph has claimed responsibility for bombing two offices of de 
klerks national party an organization calling itself the white 
wolves has claimed responsibility for attacks in johannesburg 
police have not broken any of the extremist underground groups 
that have claimed responsibility for bombings and other attacks 
officials believe the extreme right consists of only a few 
hundred people but security officials say even a handful of white 
terrorists could cause havoc south african press reports say up to 
45 extremeright groups operate in south africa 
conservatives contend de klerk has no right to end apartheid 
and they demand creation of a state for whites only 
several large rightwing political groups have been forming 
private armies the afrikaner resistance movement and similar 
groups deny responsibility for the terrorism but regularly display 
their wellarmed commandos or military units 
leaders of the right claim south africa is rushing toward a race 
war and that thousands of whites are flocking to their movement 
it will be a holy war afrikaner resistance leader eugene 
terreblanche said at a recent display of men in nazistyle 
uniforms we know we are heading for a confrontation

soviet premier nikolai i ryzhkov will head a 
commission to prepare negotiations with lithuania on granting the 
baltic republic independence a lithuanian government spokesman 
said sunday 
czeslovas jurshenas a spokesman for prime minister kazimiera 
prunskiene and a deputy to the lithuanian parliament said 
lithuania was preparing documents to present at preliminary talks 
to set up formal negotiations on the republics quest to separate 
from the soviet union 
prunskiene told lithuanian tv viewers on saturday that she had 
spoken by telephone with ryzhkov she said he had shown 
understanding for three major demands that lithuania had for the 
period leading to formal negotiations jurshenas said 
the spokesman said in a telephone interview that lithuania wants 
moscow to suspend draft requirements for lithuanians into the 
soviet army although any lithuanian who wanted to join was free to 
do so 
the baltic republic is also demanding that the soviet union 
permit normal contact with the outside world lift travel 
restrictions at the one border crossing with poland and consider 
opening a second one he said 
finally vilnius wants moscow to ease the restrictions it 
imposed on foreign travelers especially officials after lithuania 
declared its independence on march 11 he said 
jurshenas also said that vilnius would like a pledge from moscow 
that the soviet union will not interfere with lithuanias efforts 
to establish direct contacts with other soviet republics 
lithuania had been seeking to get supplies from other soviet 
republics without moscows authorization after a blockade was 
imposed on almost all oil most natural gas and numerous other 
items on april 18 
but the lithuanian supreme council or parliament on june 29 
accepted a compromise which traded a 100day moratorium on the 
declaration of independence for an immediate end to the blockade 
and the start of negotiations 
jurshenas said preliminary talks could start within 10 days 
lithuania an independent nation between the two world wars was 
forcibly annexed to the soviet union by dictator josef stalin in 
1940 along with neighboring latvia and estonia those republics are 
also seeking to secede from the soviet union but they have 
proceeded at a slower pace than lithuania in breaking with moscow

a soviet official said sunday his nation will 
gradually end the financial aid to cuba that the bush 
administration says must stop before moscow gets any us economic 
support 
gennadi gerasimov spokesman for the soviet foreign ministry 
said on cbs face the nation that subsidies for fidel castros 
marxist government will fade away but not tomorrow 
gerasimov speaking from moscow did not elaborate on plans for 
the aid which he called a hidden subsidy based mainly on 
paying higher than market prices for cuban sugar and giving havana 
a break on its purchases of soviet oil 
this is the hidden subsidy not just cash he said this 
is our obligation 
other senior soviet officials have said in recent weeks that aid 
to foreign nations including cuba would be reassessed although 
moscow has not made an explicit public commitment to any reductions 
the question of western financial assistance to moscow is 
expected to be a major subject of debate at the sevennation 
economic summit that opens in houston on monday 
secretary of state james a baker iii interviewed sunday in 
houston on abcs this week with david brinkley said the 
sovietcuba situation was one reason president bush is unwilling to 
provide direct aid to moscow 
we still have major problems with soviet assistance to cuba 
baker said 
he added however that the administration saw indications that 
internal soviet economic pressures eventually would force a cut in 
aid to communist nations 
the soviets know they are going to have to start pulling 
back he said 
baker said moscow spends about 15 billion a year in support of 
third world communist countries

east germanys deposed communist leadership 
maintained links with any known terrorist group that would help 
destabilize western nations the countrys interior minister said 
in an interview released sunday 
before their ouster last fall the communist leaders were 
willing to deal with all terrorist groups known to us 
petermichael diestel told the west german newspaper die welt 
specifically the nowdisbanded ministry for state security or 
stasi as it is known in german maintained at least informal 
contacts with the basque separatist group eta and the irish 
republican army which seeks to overthrow british rule over 
northern ireland diestel said 
die welts interview with the conservative politician was to be 
published in its monday edition an advance text was made available 
by the paper on sunday 
diestel spoke after the recent arrests in east germany of eight 
alleged red army faction terrorists wanted for attacks in west 
germany 
the eight had reportedly been given new identities and sanctuary 
by the stasi possibly with the knowledge of former communist party 
chief erich honecker and stasi head erich mielke 
one of the red army faction suspects susanne albrecht gave 
herself up to west german police and reportedly promised to speak 
out on the groups structure and earlier terrorist attacks 
diestel who promised further disclosures on east germanys 
former links with international terrorism next week said we 
have arrested more people than you are aware of 
he refused to specify whether those were also red army faction 
members or whether any of the detainees were still being held 
but he did say that in some cases east germanys statute of 
limitations meant suspects had to be released while in others 
there was insufficient proof 
speaking of the former government diestel said that nothing 
was too dirty for them in their political deliberations 
we hope very much that these werent contacts aimed at aiding 
and abetting international terrorism he said 
the hardline communist regime was ousted in a peaceful popular 
revolution late last year

the us military is setting up a 
sophisticated intelligencegathering system in bolivia to keep tabs 
on drug traffickers and it has sent in advisers to help a us 
official said 
increased us military presence in bolivia is part of an 
intensification of the antidrug war encouraged by promises of aid 
from washington 
eugene castillo acting us drug enforcement administration 
attache for bolivia said friday the us southern military command 
would reinforce the bolivian police and dea operational 
capabilities throughout south america 
bolivia an impoverished south american country of 7 million 
people produces onethird of the cocaine for us and other 
foreign markets castillo described the new system as 
innovative 
it gives us intelligence and the ability to transmit that 
intellingence to affected areas so that operations can be planned 
and mounted in a minimum amount of time castillo said 
castillo spoke friday on condition the story would not be used 
until sunday 
a computer system recently installed in la paz and santa cruz 
will link major cocaine centers and provide data on trafficking it 
will also provide a safe way of transmiting information among 
antidrug operations centers 
it will shortly be installed in three other bolivian cocaine 
centers 
currently the dea and bolivian police rely on 
koreanwarvintage radio equipment that can easily be intercepted 
by drug traffickers who use the latest in radio communications 
equipment 
castillo said the us military command is also helping the dea 
and bolivian police formulate and maintain a countrywide 
operational strategy to prevent the production and export of 
drugs and import of chemicals 
for about a month three military advisers one each from the 
us navy army and air force have been coordinating strategy 
with bolivian police and the dea at least 10 other special agents 
are training bolivian antidrug police 
the us military is prohibited by the bolivian and us 
governments from directly participating in any antidrug operations 
the military is only a support force castillo said all 
we are doing is using military expertise to assist us in 
intelligence gathering 
during a may meeting in washington bolivian leader jaime paz 
zamora and president bush agreed on greater military involvement in 
the antidrug war 
paz zamora agreed to commit 900 soldiers to the effort and to 
increase air force and navy involvement bolivian military 
personnel are already assisting police in antidrug activities 
in return bolivia was promised 75 million worth of military 
equipment and training for 19901991 
but the growing militarization of the antidrug war has created 
opposition in bolivia and raised concern that a largely peaceful 
police enforcement effort could escalate into civil wars such those 
in peru and colombia 
the participation of the military in cocaproducing zones 
is only producing violence said felipe caceres garcia a leader 
of the coca growers association of chapare the region the size of 
new jersey produces 80 percent of bolivian coca leaves the base 
for cocaine 
in bolivia there is no violence there is no terrorism and we 
do not want it to get to that caceres garcia said 
bolivias army is better known for coups detat and corruption 
than combat skills a military government that took power in 1980 
worked closely with cocaine traffickers 
the army also has a reputation for heavyhandedness when it is 
called in to put down strikes for instance bloodshed often 
results 
cocagrowing peasants militant and well organized have sworn 
they will resist any any military crackdown 
but those who favor military involvement including us 
ambassador robert gelbard say army action is needed if bolivia 
is going to nip in the bud what is developing into a real national 
threat 
many bolivians remember the regime of luis garcia meza in the 
early 80s and the instability of the countrys democratic 
institutions before that and are afraid of a return to those 
problems gelbard said friday also on condition the story not be 
used until sunday 
we believe that the broadbased public support of democracy in 
bolivia and the militarys clear commitment to democratic 
principals poses no threat

west germanys ultrarightist 
republican party on sunday reelected a former waffen ss soldier to 
be its chairman ending a sixweek fight over the groups 
leadership 
east germany meanwhile briefly detained the selfproclaimed 
fuehrer german for leader of a group that openly advocates 
nazi ideology 
the reelection of franz schoenhuber and the arrest of michael 
kuehnen came amid reports of growing activity particulary in east 
germany of rightist and neonazi groups 
west germany has long had a small but vocal neonazi movement 
ultraconservative organizations like schoenhubers have sought to 
capitalize on economic insecurity and resentment of the countrys 
immigrant population 
in east germany the ousted communist leadership regarded 
neonazism as a problem afflicting only its capitalist western 
neighbor but groups of ultrarightist east german youths wearing 
swastikas and giving nazi salutes have attacked rival gangs and 
there have also been reports of vandalism attacks on jewish graves 
and property 
along with jeanmarie le pen in france schoenhuber is one of 
western europes most notorious ultrarightist politicians 
at a tumultuous twoday conference 376 of 563 republican 
delegates voted for schoenhuber who resigned as chairman in 
midmay after criticizing the party for drifting too far right 
dozens of police sealed off the conference hall in this eastern 
bavarian town as delegates cheered schoenhuber and booed his main 
rivals harald neubauer and franz glasauer 
in his acceptance speech schoenhuber said the republicans under 
his leadership would be a party of historically purged patriotism 
rightwing therefore 
east germany banned the republicans from taking part in the 
nations first free elections last march and schoenhuber himself 
has been refused entry to east germany several times 
the republicans also adopted a motion banning members of several 
neonazi groups from holding office in the party the motion was 
put forward by schoenhuber reflecting his publicly expressed 
concern that the group will be become identified with neonazism 
late saturday the east german interior ministry reported it had 
arrested kuehnen a former lieutenant in the west german army who 
has twice served prison sentences for his neonazi activities 
kuehnen who calls himself a fuehrer is west germanys most 
notorious neonazi he was detained during a rally near the east 
german city of cottbus and released a short time later according 
to the east german news agency adn 
he has been charged with propagating fascist militarist 
ideas during a may 1 demonstration by his group near erfurt east 
germany adn said

nine white extremists have 
been detained in connection with a series of bombings aimed at 
antiapartheid targets an official said sunday 
adriaan vlok the minister of law and order said all nine men 
had been detained under the internal security act which allows for 
indefinite detention without trial they have not been charged 
the people arrested are all supporters of a farright 
political ideology but cannot thus far be connected to any 
particular organization vlok said 
he identified three of those arrested as leonard veenendaal 
darryl stopforth and david rootenberg he said the other six men 
could not yet be named because of the nature of the investigation 
but he did not elaborate 
vlok did not say when the arrests were made 
since april 12 there have been a series of bombings in which 
rightwingers were suspected the most serious attack was the 
friday bombing of a taxi stand in which 27 blacks were injured 
among the targets in the bombings were two offices of the 
national party that party leads the countrys white government 
rightwing whites have expressed outrage at president fw de 
klerks plans to end apartheid south africas system of racial 
discrimination and share power with the 30million black majority 
both de klerk and the african national congress the leading 
black opposition group have said a terrorist campaign by heavily 
armed rightwing whites could undermine blackwhite negotiations 
veenendaal and stopforth were arrested last year in neighboring 
namibia and charged with killing a security guard at a un office 
veenendaal and stopforth escaped from namibia in december and 
returned to south africa 
south africa granted independence to namibia on march 21 a move 
opposed by rightwingers the united nations supervised the 
transition to independence 
also sunday the independent south african press association 
reported that the proapartheid conservative party said it plans to 
defy a government law requiring public facilities to open to all 
races by october 
the separate amenities act passed in 1953 gave local 
governments and privatelyowned enterprises the right to reserve 
facilities for whites such as parks hotels swimming pools 
bathrooms and recreation centers 
in a statement after saturdays conservative party meeting 
pikkie coetzee a member of parliament and chairman of the partys 
municipal committee said the conservative party also warns the 
government very seriously that the friction which will come from 
its discontinuation of the separate amenities act will be the 
exclusive responsibility of the government 
the conservative party won 31 percent of the vote in septembers 
election it is the official opposition in the white chamber of 
parliament and the conservatives control dozens of local councils 
throughout the country

the national education association 
soundly defeated all challenges to its abortion rights position as 
it concluded a fourday convention sunday 
education secretary lauro cavazos sent his warmest greetings 
to the convention and pledged to work closely with the union to 
improve schools the message seemed to signal an end to a feud 
between the nea and the education department that began during the 
reagan administration when the department was led by the outspoken 
william bennett now drug czar 
although reluctant to use the word abortion a majority of 
the 8100 delegates sunday defeated an attempt to change the 
unions support of family planning including the right to 
reproductive freedom 
the nations largest teachers union also voted to oppose any 
legislation that erodes the supreme courts abortion ruling or 
tries to impede access to information on choice of reproductive 
health care options 
whether you or i agree with abortion is irrelevant said 
robert chase a vice president of the nations largest teachers 
union during floor debate what is relevant is the right of 
women to make the choice for themselves 
robert pawson head of teachers saving children vowed to 
continue attempts to reform the nea from within 
pawson said abortion opponents for the first time in 10 years 
had been able to get nea delegates to act on the issue in the 
past he said abortion rights advocates had prevented debate on the 
issue 
in the daylong session kathleen holzmeister of the illinois 
education association lost an effort to forbid abortion counseling 
at communityoperated schoolbased family planning clinics 
on saturday delegates easily defeated an attempt to stop the 
unions policy of lobbying for abortion rights 
christine nowak of new york led efforts to eliminate abortion 
lobbying from the legislative agenda of the nations largest 
teachers union she and others argued that union dues should not 
be used for such activity because the neas 2 million members have 
a variety of views on the issue 
in a resounding voice vote the legislative amendment was 
rejected 
in other action the union put itself on record in support of 
giving teachers more authority over their jobs and school 
curriculums popularly called sitebased decisionmaking 
the nea also agreed to write president bush and congress in 
support of sanctions against south africa until apartheid is 
eliminated and to encourage pension funds divestment of companies 
doing business in south africa

richard nixons presidential library 
will pick and choose who can do research there and probably will 
keep out pulitzer prizewinning watergate reporter bob woodward 
library officials say 
the library also will lack a full set of memos letters and 
other documents from nixons white house years when it opens later 
this month 
thats because the originals are in the custody of the 
government and nixon has chosen to copy only those he considers 
important to the library 
the actions have irked some scholars who say they mistrust a 
library where documents will be screened 
who knows what the nixon people have screened out said 
stanley kutler a wisconsin history professor who recently 
published a book on the watergate scandal that led to nixons 
resignation as president on aug 19 1974 
the librarys director hugh hewitt says every document of any 
importance including many relating to watergate will be in the 
library but he acknowledged that woodward probably wouldnt be 
allowed to study them 
i dont think wed ever open the doors to bob woodward hes 
not a responsible journalist hewitt said 
it would be far more of a taint to let the premises be used 
indiscriminately by groups who oppose everything he nixon has 
worked for he added 
woodward and fellow reporter washington post reporter carl 
bernstein uncovered the white house coverup of the botched burglary 
of democratic national headquarters in the watergate complex in 
1972 
woodward the posts assistant managing editor for 
investigations said the suggestion that he or others would be kept 
out demonstrates that the library will be part of a continuing 
coverup 
the richard m nixon presidential library will be able to use 
its autonomy as a privately run facility to choose the scholars it 
allows to do research 
of the nations other presidential libraries only the 
rutherford b hayes library is privately operated eight are run by 
the national archives which will also control the ronald reagan 
library under construction in simi valley 
the nixon librarys exhibition section will be dedicated july 19 
at a ceremony to be attended by president bush and former 
presidents reagan and gerald ford the archives will open sometime 
next year 
hewitt said the library will include a watergate hall and 
many documents detailing the scandal including the 1972 smoking 
gun tape recording in which nixon says he will ask the cia and 
fbi to halt the watergate investigation excerpts will be played 
for visitors 
thats not enough to satisfy kutler who accused nixon of being 
obsessed with secrecy and control 
the idea that nixon wants to control the librarys contents is 
a presumption on the part of the liberal nixon haters said 
walter annenberg nixons ambassador to great britain 
that library is going to contain everything favorable or 
unfavorable said william e simon president of the library 
foundation academics and historians have always hated nixon

a regulation attacking crack cocaine houses by 
requiring them to have health and safety plans appears likely to be 
replaced with one declaring them health hazards 
the prosecutor was concerned that it looked like we were 
permitting an illegal operation said chuck kleeburg king county 
director of environmental health 
the county prosecutors office proposes replacing the existing 
regulation with one designating crack houses a health hazard 
because of addiction toxic exposure and violence health officials 
could fine landlords and tenants 1000 for each day a crack house 
remained in operation 
the board of health is scheduled to vote on the new plan july 24 
the original regulation which was adopted in january and 
scheduled to take effect july 1 county police were to inform 
health officials when a building was being used for making or 
selling the potent crack form of cocaine 
the owner then was to be notified of an apparent violation of 
health regulations given 10 days to present a plan for reducing 
the health and safety risk and ordered to pay a 100 review fee 
health officials said they never expected to get a health and 
safety plan and would use fines for failing to file health and 
safety plans as another way to attack crack houses 
police have relied heavily on a state law allowing civil 
abatement fe proceedings to close and condemn crack houses after 
owners fail to end drug operations the statute has been used less 
frequently by police in the county and suburban jurisdictions

visiting san mateo superior court judge reginald littrell to reset 
the trial for september miller claims his client was illegally 
extradited from mexico a few days after the april 1989 slayings

counts of murder had a brain dysfunction that fueled the bloody 
killing spree in the sonoma county vineyard country 35 miles north 
of san francisco

the father of their eldest daughter sofia

when salcido was served with court papers ordering him to pay child 
support to his exwife in fresno county whom angelia knew nothing 
about 
in a statement to a sheriff returning with him from mexico city 
salcido said the killing started after bouts of cocaine and alcohol 
use 
according to his statement salcido took his three daughters 
theresa 1 sofia 4 and carmina 3 to a county dump site where 
he slit their throats carmina survived 
he then drove to the home of robert richards sr and his family 
salcidos inlaws he knocked his motherinlaw marian louise 
richards 47 unconscious and then killed her daughters 
12yearold ruth and 8yearold marie before leaving he 
allegedly stabbed his motherinlaw to death as she regained 
consciousness 
salcido said he went back to his boyes hot springs home where he 
beat his wife and shot her with a 22caliber pistol as she tried 
to get to a telephone 
salcido said he thought about killing himself but decided to go 
to the grand cru winery where he worked to shoot coworkers 
tracey toovey 35 and ken butti 33 
ive killed already so many i think ill kill the two 
other guys the detective quoted salcido as saying

while charles taylor was driving rebel 
forces against the president of liberia his wife was driving their 
children to summer camp and trying to rally support for her 
husbands rebellion 
tupee taylor hasnt seen her husband for five years but she is 
unflinching in her belief that her husband will overthrow liberias 
president samuel doe 
the rebels accuse doe who gained power of the tiny west african 
country in a bloody coup in 1980 of corruption tribalism and 
brutal suppression of the opposition 
taylor 42 and his forces invaded the west african country from 
the ivory coast on dec 24 mrs taylor learned of the action when 
her husband telephoned on new years day 
i wasnt surprised or shocked she said someone had to do 
something and if anyone would do it i know charles would be the 
one hes very determined and very very intelligent 
taylors forces have continued to tighten their noose on the 
capital of monrovia rebels besieging the capital rejected a 
ceasefire proposed by doe and resumed fighting sunday rebel 
sources said doe continued to decline an american offer of safe 
passage out of the country 
and 5500 miles away mrs taylor 29 worked to promote her 
husbands cause while trying to maintain a normal life for her 
schoolage children 
the best i can do is to get as much publicity as i can she 
said i am a christian and i pray a lot we dont want to be 
separated but its safer for us here 
the taylors met in the united states through their involvement 
with liberian student associations she attended seton hall while 
he graduated from bentley college with an economics degree 
he always had political ambitions she said he was always 
outspoken he always spoke out about the injustices in liberia and 
the need for democracy if he is the next leader of liberia well 
have a better future things will be different 
the taylors married in liberia in 1980 and witnessed the coup 
that overthrew the late president william tolbert 
we stayed because thats our country and no matter who came 
into power we believed in staying there and restoring democracy 
mrs taylor said 
taylor took a job in does cabinet as director of the general 
services agency but became disillusioned and was arrested for 
circulating subversive materials in 1981 
he continued working for does government until 1982 when their 
house was ransacked and he was implicated in the first of many coup 
attempts she said 
the taylors returned to the united states where taylor was 
arrested in may 1984 outside boston and accused of embezzling 1 
million from liberia a charge his wife claims doe fabricated 
sixteen months later taylor fled the plymouth county house of 
corrections in massachusetts while awaiting extradition mrs 
taylor said she does not know how he escaped i was happy he 
left she said i didnt ask him how he did it 
she also said she does not know what her husband did in the 4 
years between his escape and the start of the revolution there 
are so many things charles could have been doing in that process 
nobody knows she said 
taylor was raised in an affluent family in althington liberia 
one of 10 children their father was a commissioner of immigration 
and later became a judge said nelson taylor one of two taylor 
brothers and three sisters living in rhode island 
the taylors two americanborn children charen 9 and camille 
7 learned of their fathers activities accidentally 
i tried to keep it from them because i didnt want to confuse 
them mrs taylor said but charen read about the rebellion in 
the newspaper and so they decided themselves and they just 
started watching the news 
the united states and other countries have questioned taylors 
commitment to democracy and free elections his credibility has 
also been damaged by reports of executions of suspected doe 
supporters 
those reports are completely false his wife said it 
makes you crazy because things get distorted mrs taylor said 
she said her husband is committed to holding free elections 
if the liberians wants charles taylor as the leader the 
liberian people will vote for charles taylor for right now hes a 
fighter she said

us officials helped at least 39 people 
including exnazis slip into canada to build a new life in the 
early 1950s to reward them for their work as spies previously 
classified documents indicate 
a study by ottawa historian alti rodal completed three years 
ago for a federal royal commission that investigated suspected nazi 
war criminals says the 39 people came to canada with false 
documents and identities from us authorities 
ms rodals report was released in heavily censored form in 
1987 with several general references to the involvement by us 
intelligence officers in resettling alleged exnazis 
the report said the us officials who were responsible for 
screening europeans seeking a new life in north america after the 
war misled canadian authorities about the backgrounds of some of 
the emigrants 
the 39 cases involved mostly germans who had worked for nazi 
organizations during world war ii they were recruited by the 
united states after 1945 as part of an intelligence ring to spy on 
the russian zone of occupied germany and suspected communist 
sympathizers in the american zone 
more details of the resettlement plan emerged last week as 
material previously deleted from ms rodals report was made public 
following requests by journalists under the access to information 
act 
there was no cia spokesperson available sunday in washington to 
comment on the new details from ms rodals report 
government documents cited by ms rodal show the royal canadian 
mounted police and the external affairs department were surprised 
when they stumbled on the us plan in 195354 
lester pearson then external affairs minister and future 
liberal prime minister complained the americans should have taken 
such people into their own country if they wanted them rather than 
dumping them on others 
canadian diplomats in washington were instructed to take the 
matter up directly with allen dulles then head of the cia 
washington eventually provided background information on the 
people involved and assured external affairs the information 
package was complete 
but royal police memos indicate the police force was skeptical 
and thought others may have been smuggled in and never detected 
one memo from september 1954 noted 35 cases had been discussed 
at that point with the americans but we are not convinced that 
the figures which have been given to us in the first instance are 
in fact correct 
another memo the same month noted four more cases had been 
discovered 
all involved people were sponsored by the us army research and 
resettlement branch which played a key role in relocating former 
intelligence agents including nazi collaborators 
ms rodal concluded the americans probably acted with the 
knowledge and cooperation of a royal police sergeant then 
stationed in karlsruhe west germany he apparently kept the scheme 
from his superior 
at least some had criminal records on grounds of moral turpitude 
the immigration category then used to exclude suspected war 
criminals and nazi collaborators 
the 198587 royal commission under justice jules deschenes 
recommended urgent action against 20 suspected war criminals in 
canada and further investigation of 200 other cases 
the justice department has since initiated three criminal 
prosecutions and one civil action it has 45 other cases under 
consideration

canadian prime minister brian mulroney said 
sunday that soviet president mikhail gorbachev should be given a 
special briefing on the results of the economic summit of 
industrialized nations 
a senior canadian official demanding anonymity said mulroney 
suggested that president bush as the host of the gathering 
provide the kremlin leader with details of the highlevel talks 
the briefing could be done by telephone or letter or through an 
emissary he said 
the summit leaders he said should send a positive economic 
signal to the soviet union which would match the positive 
politicalmilitary message that came from the london summit of nato 
allies 
the leaders of the 16 nations of the north atlantic treaty 
organization decided on friday to reshape the western military 
alliance in response to the political upheavals in eastern europe

environmentalists had a cool idea for a symbolic 
publicitygrabbing gimmick to illustrate their concerns about 
global warming a gigantic block of melting ice 
neat just the way to grab attention at the economic summit in 
sweltering houston 
one problem 
it turned into a puddle twice as fast as expected 
houston ice carver nathan smith worked all night on 10240 
pounds of ice in a downtown park to make a globe showing all the 
continents surrounded by the flags of the summit participants 
the final piece was carved at about 845 am less than 8 hours 
later the ice was virtually gone as midafternoon temperatures 
reached 90 degrees 
our climate is heating up our natural resource base is 
melting down was the message according to wilderness society 
president george frampton 
catherine moore of the envirosummit coalition said 
organizers though the ice would last until tuesday but they 
miscalculated because the sculptor had never done such a project in 
heat

about 30 friends and relatives of a 
cheyenne indian mother jailed in a custody dispute with her 
exhusband demonstrated outside the jail and she was briefly led 
outside to speak to her supporters 
tina cady has been jailed four months for refusing to return her 
two small children to their father who has legal custody claiming 
she fears possible child abuse the youngsters are on an indian 
reservation where state courts cant touch them 
sheriffs deputies took cady out to speak to the crowd that 
gathered at the jail saturday demanding her release 
i really appreciate your support and im sure my kids do 
too she said 
the demonstrators included tom gardner sr of lame deer who 
served eight years as a judge on the tribal court of the nearby 
northern cheyenne indian reservation cady is a member of the tribe 
and lives on the reservation in lame deer 
cady 26 has been jailed since march 9 when state district 
judge joe hegel held her in contempt for refusing to comply with a 
court order to return her children to her former husband walt 
donges 34 of colstrip 
donges was awarded custody of the children 4yearold brittany 
and 2yearold ryan when the couple divorced last october 
cady said that on feb 9 when she picked up the children for a 
visit she noticed a large bruise on brittanys buttock 
an indian health service doctor examined the bruise and 
recommended that cady not return the children to donges until an 
investigation had been conducted 
donges has denied causing the bruise or ever hitting his 
children contending that the girl was bruised because her little 
brother bit her 
the custody battle reached an impasse when cady took the 
children to her parents home in busby on the reservation where 
they have remained the reservation is outside the state courts 
jurisdiction 
last month the northern cheyenne tribal court ordered that the 
children would be temporary wards of that court and placed 
responsibility for their care with the tribes social services 
department 
because of that court action cady said that even if she wanted 
to she could not return brittany and ryan to their father 
hegel said in a telephone interview with the billings gazette 
that he doesnt know if cadys interpretation of the matter is 
correct but said he is looking for a quick resolution to the 
situation

a prominent human rights lawyer under 
threat of arrest for his criticism of kenyas oneparty government 
has sought refuge at the us embassy a source said sunday 
also sunday stonethrowing demonstrators confronted police in 
nairobis commercial center where a day earlier police had fired 
tear gas and live ammunition to disperse a prodemocracy rally 
witnesses said they saw at least two people injured sunday 
there were unconfirmed reports that three people were killed 
by late sunday afternoon at least three trucks carrying scores 
of heavily armed troops had moved into the area riot police 
bearing clubs were seen in surrounding neighborhoods occasionally 
firing canisters of tear gas to break up groups 
in once incident police using a club beat a man who was 
subsequently hospitalized elsewhere a youth was crushed between a 
bus and a van in an accident caused when bystanders started 
throwing stones at traffic a witness said 
human rights lawyer gibson kamau kuria a former detainee who in 
1988 won the robert f kennedy human rights award had gone into 
hiding late thursday after the government detained at least 12 
advocates of multiparty democracy 
it was unclear when kuria 43 reportedly moved into the us 
mission in downtown nairobi but the source who spoke on condition 
of anonymity said the lawyer was there 
us officials including ambassador smith hempstone refused 
comment on the status of kuria or paul muite another lawyer who 
also went into hiding after last weeks arrests 
the united states has criticized the crackdown on the 
opposition and the ruling partys newspaper threatened the us 
ambassador with expulsion in an editorial on sunday that was 
titled shut up mr ambassador 
saturday riots erupted after a rally supporting multiparty 
democracy turned violent and police dispersed the crowd with 
gunfire and tear gas 
police pursued demonstrators into nairobis commerical center 
and the disturbances quickly spread throughout the city but by 
nightfall only small bands of demonstrators remained playing 
catandmouse with the troops 
newspapers said scores of people were injured in saturdays 
violence hospitals provided no casualty figures and the government 
issued no comment 
regarding muite his wife and associates said the lawyer was 
safe but would not reveal his whereabouts 
philip kilonzo kenyas national police chief said authorities 
still were trying to find the two lawyers we have not given up 
our efforts to get them he was quoted as saying in sunday 
editions of the ruling partys englishlanguage newspaper the 
kenya times 
the us state department protested the arrests in a statement 
last week 
these actions only serve to tarnish kenyas image in the 
international community the state department said in a comment 
issued saturday 
previous us suggestions that kenya consider multipary 
democracy have angered the government which at one point 
threatened to curtail hempstones movement 
president daniel arap moi has rejected the idea and cabinet 
ministers have called those backing such moves subversives 
moi repeatedly has threatened to arrest opponents he claims the 
existence of about 40 tribes in kenya would invite tribalbased 
parties leading to ethnic divisions and even warfare 
on sunday the ruling party newspaper responded to the state 
departments recent comments in an editorial it described 
hempstone as the epitome of developedworld conceit of the vilest 
kind and threatened him with expulsion 
he will have only himself to blame should kenya find it 
necessary to declare him a persona non grata it said 
he should remember that he is a diplomat a person sent by his 
government to promote good will between states and not an 
international political terrorist said the editorial 
diplomacy is most effectively conducted quietly and not through 
selfrighteous pronouncements 
hempstone seemed unruffled by the editorial which he described 
in a telephone interview as an outrageous piece of work 
the united states is a major donor to kenya whose economy is 
heavily dependent on foreign aid last year the us gave 61 
million in economic aid and 15 million in military assistance 
according to a study prepared by the heritage foundation a 
conservative think tank in washington

a promise of freedom secured thousands 
of albanians in tirana settled in sunday for an uncomfortable wait 
in crammed foreign embassies surrounded by vigilant police 
foreign governments already pondering the logistics of 
evacuating the albanians in their missions and resettling them 
abroad were faced with the more immediate problem of housing and 
feeding them in the meantime 
more than 5000 people were sheltered in missions some of them 
overcrowded the situation appeared worst in the west german 
mission which was overflowing with 3000 albanians the italian 
and french embassies also reported difficulties in taking care of 
the refugees 
a baby girl was born during the night in the west german mission 
security forces were back on duty sunday they were withdrawn 
from the area late last week under foreign pressure following 
reports that they had shot at asylumseekers scrambling up embassy 
walls 
the french foreign ministry reported that the diplomatic quarter 
was sealed off sunday by 600 police officers and soldiers who 
blocked anyone from getting through austrian tv said police 
roadblocks had been set up on main roads into tirana 
on saturday albanian foreign ministry officials told diplomats 
that the albanians in the embassies would be allowed to leave under 
foreign supervision 
the officials said embassy personnel could accompany the 
asylumseekers as they picked up travel documents and left the 
country 
but only those accepted as refugees by foreign countries would 
be allowed to leave the diplomats said a hungarian diplomat said 
the embassies were told they had to arrange transport for any 
albanians they accepted 
no departures were expected for days while arrangements were 
made for travel documents and transportation 
there were no reports sunday of unrest on saturday thousands 
gathered near embassy row for silent rallies against communist 
rule austrias apa news agency said 
the turmoil at the embassies appeared to contribute to a 
shakeup saturday of the ruling politburo and central committee 
one politburo member was dismissed three other functionaries were 
retired and the police minister and minister of war were fired 
the reorganization was reported by the state ata news agency and 
staterun television the reports named hekuran isai as the new 
police minister and kico mustaqi as the new minister of war 
mustaqi is believed to be more moderate than his predecessor 
but isai had already held the ministry under the late enver hoxha 
and was considered close to the founder of communist albania his 
reappointment indicated a determination to keep a tight rein on 
dissent 
some foreign missions lacked sufficient food and water for the 
refugees and hygenic conditions were poor officials said sunday 
they said albanian authorities were not allowing foreign 
governments to send supplies 
the situation in our embassy but in other embassies as well 
has become intolerable west foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher told west german television 
in paris the french foreign ministry described the situation at 
its embassy as increasingly difficult with inadequate sanitary 
facilities and a lack of medicine there was no word of major 
illness 
the embassy was sheltering more than 500 albanians and a french 
doctor was seeing 60 patients a day many of whom were injured 
while scaling the compounds fence said the ministry 
italian sen franco salvi said in rome after returning from a 
private visit to tirana that 900 albanian asylumseekers wanted to 
come to his country 
we hope we can welcome them in a dignified way he said 
we just cant throw them in some camp 
the ambassadors wife was forced to buy food at the local market 
to feed those in the mission salvi said two prefabricated huts 
were hastily erected on embassy grounds to house some of the 
albanians 
hungarian television news showed a small but jubilant crowd in 
the hungarian embassy waving their passport application forms and 
flashing vforvictory signs 
a hungarian diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity 
described the mood among the approximately 40 albanians in the 
embassy as optimistic 
he said the albanians had received a red cross shipment of 
clothes were exercising regularly in the embassy garden and were 
filling out forms to receive their travel documents 
we are all set to take the forms to the foreign ministry 
tomorrow morning and to discuss what the next step will be the 
diplomat said 
hungarian television also broadcast an interview with leka i 
the pretender to the albanian throne who is now an arms dealer in 
south africa 
speaking from his farm near johannesburg leka called for the 
overthrow of the communist regime and claimed he had support in 
the security service in the army and even some party 
member supporters 
leka is the son of king zog the last albanian monarch who 
abdicated after world war ii 
in geneva on sunday un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar said he had sent a swedish un diplomat to tirana to 
obtain firsthand information on the situation 
during 45 years of hardline communist rule travel for average 
albanians has been virtually impossible but albanian leaders have 
sought better ties abroad since 1985 and they recently began to 
implement some reforms 
a package of new regulations that took effect tuesday entitled 
all albanians over age 16 to own a passport 
communist leader ramiz alia decreed several measures saturday to 
reform albanias command economy including the introduction of 
smallscale private enterprise but he did not mention the embassy 
standoff or promise political reforms 
the reported breakthrough on the embassy crisis came hours after 
albanian legislators guaranteed citizens could leave the embassies 
without fear of punishment 
the parliamentary decree published by ata was the first pledge 
with the force of law that albanians in the foreign missions could 
receive passports without fear of prosecution

codesal signaled that defender roberto sensini had fouled striker 
rudi voeller brehme scored kicking the ball into the lower left 
corner of the net past the outstretched goalie sergio goycoechea 
the win ended years of frustrations for the west germans world 
cup runnerup against italy in 1982 and against argentina in 1986 
west germany has now joined italy and brazil as the only 
threetime winners of the tournament 
argentine defender nestor lorenzo left the field in tears with 
blood dripping from his mouth his teammates seemed stunned by the 
penalty and the loss that ended argentinas hopes of becoming the 
first team to win two consecutive cups since italy did so in 1938 
after the award ceremony joyous german players took a victory 
lap around the stadium rushing toward the delirious singing 
cheering flagwaving german fans and holding the trophy 
triumphantly over their heads 
west germanys victory comes after a month of hearttouching 
triumph and dreamshattering defeats for the other 23 teams in the 
finals 
no other competition stirs passions and national pride as much 
as this tournament for soccers most coveted trophy 
italys stateowned rai television network which made live

when england lost to west germany in the semifinals fans went 
on a rampage in nearly 30 english cities more than 500 people were 
arrested and 35 police officers injured in a night of brawling and 
vandalism

argentina 10 in the opening match 
cameroon also beat romania and made it to the second round of 
the tournament one the great surprises of the competition 
world cup veterans said the 1990 tournament lacked some of the 
drama of earlier cups still it had its moments 
italys salvatore schillaci mesmerized a nation with his uncanny 
ability to find the opening the ball and the net the pride of 
sicily was the cups top scorer with six goals 
cameroons roger milla provided some of the most enduring images 
of this world cup dancing in the corners after he scored the 
comparatively old 38yearold substitute came out of retirement 
and off the bench to score four world cup goals 
but there were other enduring images such as bluehelmeted 
police using tear gas and truncheons disperse rowdy fans who hurled 
stones bottles or chairs at police rivals or each other 
italian authorities stationed thousands of police at stadiums 
and banned the sale of alcoholic beverages on match days in cities 
where games were played

president violeta barrios de chamorro 
on sunday urged thousands of striking sandinista workers to return 
to the job after police threatened to intervene to reopen shuttered 
workplaces 
but the strikers vowed to keep them shut in the weekold wave of 
walkouts to protest government policy 
it is the obligation of all workers to go back to work 
tomorrow the president told the associated press in an interview 
sunday 
a police communique released saturday evening said police 
will guarantee workers free access to their respective job sites

on friday finance minister emilio pereira announced a 43 
percent wage increase for civil servants in lower pay brackets 
plus costofliving increases for 65000 of the governments 
100000 workers 
but national labor front leader jose angel bermudez said the 
offer was an effort to fool state employees 
its an attempt to get the workers back on the job and buy off 
their just demands by means of a solemn joke about salaries 
bermudez said he said inflation will eat up the earnings and 
massive firings are in the offing 
government agricultural industrial service and office workers 
are demanding a new minimum wage job security protection of 
peasant land distributed under land reforms of the former leftist 
sandinista administration financing for industrial ventures and 
the opening of new construction projects

demands for more participation in economic policymaking 
the workers are allied with the sandinista front which remains 
the largest single political bloc in nicaragua 
the series of strikes is the second in the 2monthold 
administration of mrs chamorro 
mrs chamorro was the candidate of the usbacked united 
national opposition coalition in the feb 25 elections in which 
she beat sandinista party incumbent daniel ortega she is trying to

two of the countrys largest chemical 
companies withheld information from employees on the toxic nature 
of dioxin wastes at a local chemical plant a newspaper reported 
sunday 
officials of hercules inc and dow chemical also knew about 
dangers of dioxins a class of chemicals generally considered 
unwanted byproducts that may cause a range of ailments as early as 
1965 and were concerned the government would learn about the 
dangers the arkansas democrat reported 
hercules operated the jacksonville chemical plant and dow 
contracted with hercules to produce herbicides including 245t 
a dioxincontaminated herbicide hercules also made the 
dioxintainted defoliant agent orange at the plant from 196770 
the newspaper said it obtained memos beginning in 1965 from 
chemical company officials in delaware michigan germany and 
arkansas that show wastes at the jacksonville plant were tested for 
dioxin which had caused outbreaks of a skin ailment called 
chloracne in chemical plant workers in the united states and abroad 
hercules dow and jacksonville plant officials knew as early as 
april 1 1965 that dioxin was highly toxic and capable of 
inducing a disfiguring disease from dermal skin exposure to very 
small amounts an internal hercules memorandum said the 
newspaper said 
officials of both dow and hercules declined comment on the memos 
management didnt tell employees they were working with dioxin 
for many years not until publicity about the chemical began 
appearing and then downplayed its dangers workers told the 
newspaper 
they never explained the danger to us they never stressed the 
danger to us said joe bolden who worked at the plant for nine 
years 
he said workers would frequently get burned by the chemicals 
if something got on you you would go to the laboratory and 
they said its not going to hurt you just take a shower bolden 
said 
i remember people talking about dioxin they said we had it 
but not to the extent that it would hurt anybody i didnt get 
anything officially from anybody said luster kennedy jr a 
former plant safety director 
the newspaper said one memo sent on july 12 1965 by jr 
frawley a toxicologist at hercules corporate office in 
wilmington del to two officials at the jacksonville plant 
summarized a telephone call he received from earl farnham of dow 
dow was concerned about an acnegen or dioxin causing 
chloracne in workers at its 245t plant in midland mich 
they are aware that their competitors are marketing 245t 
which contains alarming amounts of acnegen and if the government 
learns of this the whole industry will suffer they are 
particularly fearful of a congressional investigation and excessive 
restrictive legislation on manufacture of pesticides might 
result frawley wrote 
vertac chemical corp of memphis bought the plant in 1976 it 
ceased production in 1986 but did not abandon the site 
the site is 18th on the federal governments superfund list a 
roster of more than 1000 of the nations hazardous chemical sites 
later this year incineration is scheduled for nearly 30000 drums 
of hazardous wastes stored at the site

us officials stopped short sunday of denying 
a report that plans are being developed for a uscoordinated 
military attack on drug lords in south america but said there has 
been no change in the policy of not involving us forces in direct 
operations 
newsweek reported saturday it has obtained briefing papers from 
us southern command headquarters in panama that envision an 
attack coordinated by the southern command and using the armies of 
colombia bolivia and peru to attack drugtrafficking targets in 
those countries 
national security adviser brent scowcroft said on cnns 
newsmaker sunday that it would be a real misnomer to refer 
to the operations as a big drug raid as suggested by an 
interviewer 
us troops will be used the same way theyve always been 
used he said that is when asked for they will help train 
local military they will not be used operationally in 
interdiction and intelligence for example in tracking and so on 
yes we will use the military as we have been doing it all along 
asked whether the reported operation signals an escalation of 
the drug war scowcroft said no well hopefully its an 
intensification its not an escalation 
newsweek said the attack would involve a massive use of force 
applied swiftly and simultaneously to the cartels entire support 
structure possibly targeting drug lords homes drugprocessing 
centers and secret airfields used for smuggling 
us troops would direct the operation but would not take part 
in it unless the need arises the magazine reported 
our policies are clear said defense secretary dick cheney 
were doing in central america latin america what we can to 
help those nations that are involved where there is production we 
only do what they ask us to do our involvement is limited in the 
sense that no us forces are permitted to go out on operational 
assignments and no us forces participate in any activities down 
there unless ive personally signed off on their presence in those 
countries 
cheney did not respond directly when pressed on cbs face the 
nation to comment on specifics of the newsweek account 
i suppose you could argue that at present youve got a 
situation where the military units in those countries are actively 
involved in fighting the drug cartel and we are actively involved 
in supporting them by coordination and support and 
assistance he said 
although the plan reportedly is almost ready to be carried out 
newsweek said members of congress fearful the operation could 
escalate into another vietnam with high us casualties were 
unlikely to view it favorably

president bush threw a texasstyle welcome for 
western leaders sunday on the eve of an economic summit already 
divided by an appeal from mikhail s gorbachev for aid to bolster 
the crumbling soviet economy 
us and british officials dug in their heels against direct 
aid but prime minister brian mulroney was more sympathetic 
extending commercial credits to moscow and saying houston has to 
provide the beginnings of an economic response 
bush said he would present a letter from gorbachev when leaders 
of the worlds seven richest democracies convene monday for their 
16th annual economic summit the letter dispatched july 4 came to 
bush in his role as summit host 
tomorrow we go to work bush told a cheering audience after 
a festive night of presummit partying i think were all working 
for the same thing for world peace for harmony in this exciting 
world were living in 
to strengthen the soviet case for aid foreign ministry 
spokesman gennadi gerasimov said moscow was taking steps demanded 
by bush he said the military was being cut down to size and that 
moscows huge subsidies to cuba would fade away but not 
tomorrow 
two of the western leaders delayed their arrivals to attend the 
world cup soccer championship in rome helmut kohl cheered west 
germany to a 10 victory over argentina and italys giulio 
andreotti was there to present the trophy 
trade and environmental issues were being aired at the summit 
but the question of direct aid to moscow topped the agenda the 
united states japan and britain said moscow wasnt ready for aid 
from the west while west germany france and italy were ready to 
plunge ahead 
british foreign secretary douglas hurd said sunday we dont 
believe that they the soviets have the economic requirements in 
place which would justify putting huge sums of western money 
into their pockets their pockets have got holes in them 
canada was somewhere in the middle mulroney was anxious to find 
some approach to support gorbachev 
where would we be if he were chucked out mulroney asked 
if he were chucked out by some of the extreme right influences we 
see at play in the soviet party conference that is ongoing in 
moscow today i think we would be at an infinitely worse position 
than we are today 
and yet mulroney called soviet aid to cuba profoundly 
unacceptable and an obstacle to western aid 
in a cbs interview gerasimov addressed the three main obstacles 
bush has described to direct aid from the united states economic 
reform military spending levels and subsidies to cuba 
specifically he said moscows 5 billion annual subsidy to cuba 
would fade away but not tomorrow as the soviets shift to 
market prices for sugar purchases and oil sales moreover he said 
we are now taking steps to cut our military to size that is why 
they are grumbling some of the generals 
canada was not ready to provide direct aid but mulroney said 
yes we will provide credits we want to send out a signal 
that this leadership in the soviet union is valid and valuable 
the 2 billion canadian about 17 billion in us funds in 
credits have been granted for wheat and other products 
national security adviser brent scowcroft said gorbachev is 
asking for help for a couple years as he implements his economic 
reforms 
it will be a time of austerity and troubles and what he would 
like is some assistance to help tide over while those economic 
restructuring programs are taking hold scowcroft said on cnn 
he said gorbachev was interested in food aid consumer aid 
to give some hope to the average soviet citizen that things are 
getting better asked if the united states would provide that 
help scowcroft said its very difficult for the united states 
bush would not describe gorbachevs entreaty explaining i 
have some responsibilities to be sure that our summit partners are 
briefed on that gorbachev letter before we go public but sources 
said the letter was a general appeal for assistance from the west 
but made no specific requests 
bush in his adopted home state of texas hosted a homestyle 
howdy for the arriving summiteers there were cowboys and barbecue 
bull riding and bucking broncs at a sunday night rodeo and the 
grand ole opry left its hometown of nashville to be here for a 
special broadcast featuring minnie pearl and loretta lynn 
bush and mulroney showed up for the festivities in newly made 
summit cowboy boots margaret thatcher of britain wore white heels 
bush treated his guests to a horseshoe throwing match and threw two 
ringers himself japans toshiki kaifu tried several pitches to no 
avail 
the economic summit follows hard on the heels of last weeks 
16nation meeting which rewrote nato warfighting strategy in 
accordance with reduced eastwest tensions 
the nations represented here are britain france canada italy 
and west germany japan and the united states 
britains hurd said the soviets governmentcontrolled economy 
wasnt equipped to cope with massive western assistance the 
summits message he said should be mend the hole in the pants 
before you fill the pockets with dimes and cents 
secretary of state james a baker iii asked about direct us 
aid to moscow said no thats not right now in the cards 
instead he emphasized that the united states would continue to 
give technical assistance such as advice on how to move toward a 
market economy 
west germany and france have been pressing for a 15 billion 
package of western aid for moscow leaders of the european 
community meeting in dublin last month agreed in principle to 
provide assistance but stopped short of committing themselves to a 
specific program or amount 
a formula for compromise has been suggested by baker he said 
recently the houston summit could reach agreement on a set of 
guidelines and principles for assistance short of actually sending 
aid 
bush removed another contentious issue from the summit agenda 
when he told japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu that the united 
states would not object to a resumption of japanese aid to china 
japan under pressure from beijing as well as japanese 
businesses wants to resume at least part of the 5 billion aid 
package it promised to china two years ago

here are key elements of an abortion 
bill passed by the louisiana legislature the bill outlaws most 
abortions by creating a new simple battery offense under the bill 
simple battery of abortion is the specific intent of 
terminating a pregnancy other than to preserve the life or health 
of an unborn child or to remove a dead fetus 
abortion on a rape victim is not a crime providing the victim 
sought medical care from a licensed physician within seven days of 
the rape reported the rape to law enforcement authorities within 
seven days of the offense and had the abortion within the first 
trimester of the pregnancy 
abortion performed in an incest pregnancy is not a crime if 
the abortion is performed in the first trimester 
only a licensed physician may perform an abortion in the 
circumstances allowed by law 
although simple battery in louisiana ordinarily is a 
misdemeanor with a maximum sixmonth prison term and 500 fine 
abortionists under this bill would face prison at hard labor for 
one to 10 years with fines of not less than 10000 or more than 
100000

the legislature on sunday passed the 
strictest state abortion bill which would ban most abortions and 
punish doctors who perform them with up to 10 years at hard labor 
the state senate earlier had failed to override the governors 
veto of an even harsher measure that would have restricted abortion 
even in cases of rape and incest 
to pass sunday nights measure legislators cannibalized a 
failing flag burning law and outlawed abortion by creating a new 
crime simple battery of abortion the bill was hurried through the 
legislature hours after the override failed 
the bill passed 8322 in the house after a 327 vote in the 
senate it passes now to gov buddy roemer 
the bill bans abortions except in cases of rape incest or where 
the mothers life is in danger it carries a penalty of up to 10 
years in prison and a 100000 fine for doctors who perform 
abortions it would not penalize the woman who seeks the abortion 
simple battery in louisiana ordinarily is a misdemeanor with a 
maximum sixmonth prison term and 500 fine 
pennsylvania currently has the strictest state abortion law but 
it is less restrictive than the louisiana bill 
the senate earlier had failed to override roemers veto of a 
bill that didnt allow abortion even in instances of rape and 
incest so sen john saunders amended antiabortion language onto 
an unrelated bill 
roemer has indicated he would accept an abortion bill that 
contained the rape and incest exceptions through a spokeswoman 
roemer said he had not seen sundays bill and would not comment on 
it until monday 
abortion rights supporters reacted with incredulity 
weve just seen the legislature go from the most restrictive 
abortion bill in the nation to the most absurd said terri 
bartlett of planned parenthood of louisiana the only thing that 
surpasses it is the mockery of the legislative process 
only in louisiana could you have a flag burning bill become an 
abortion bill 
rep woody jenkins the original bills author voted against 
the new version because of his belief that the unborn is a human 
being from the moment of conception and we ought not make 
exceptions to the principle 
even though i could not vote for the bill in the form that 
passed out it is my hope and prayer that it will be used to test 
the continued validity of roe vs wade that it will be used to 
stop the senseless killing of millions of unborn children 
proponents of the abortion bill hope it will be challenged all 
the way to the supreme court leading to a showdown over the 1973 
high court ruling that legalized abortion 
the bill saunders chose to amend was another controversial bill 
one that would lower the penalty to a 25 fine for people who 
beat up flag burners his version of the bill stripped it of the 
flag burning provisions and inserted the abortion issue 
saunders said his amendment was the only chance the state had of 
passing an antiabortion bill 
i dont want any more abortions than we have to have he 
said 
the senate sustained roemers veto of the earlier bill saturday 
with a 2316 vote to override three short of the needed twothirds 
majority 
the pennslyvania measure approved in november requires a woman 
wait 24 hours before getting an abortion bans abortions based on 
the fetus sex and bans abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy 
except to save the life of the mother or prevent substantial and 
irreversible harm 
a doctor convicted under the sexselection ban or the 24week 
provision could be punished with up to seven years in prison and a 
15000 fine 
an even stricter abortion bill was passed in the us territory 
of guam but it has been blocked for now by court challenges that 
law makes it a felony to perform an abortion or aid in the 
procedure a misdemeanor for a woman to have an abortion and a 
misdemeanor for a person to solicit a woman to have an abortion 
as the senate began its work sunday some 1000 demonstrators 
gathered on the capitol steps and in the rotunda that separates the 
senate and house chambers a strong majority appeared to be backers 
of the antiabortion bill but there were also scores of abortion 
rights activists 
near the doors of the rotunda in black spray paint someone had 
scrawled the words stop killing the innocent a few feet away 
abortionrights advocates had taped a poster to the wall that read 
simply sustain sustain sustain 
about 300 to 400 of the antiabortion demonstrators some 
carrying bibles and singing hymns began a continuous march around 
the capitol in the 90degree heat were marching around the 
walls of jericho one shouted 
at 330 pm a sudden thunderstorm came up and sent many of the 
demonstrators scurrying for cover 
senate president samuel nunez said lobbying saturday and sunday 
was intense with thousands of telephone calls jamming switchboards 
people were even calling the house switchboard for us becaue 
they couldnt get through nunez said sunday morning our 
secretaries didnt keep any record of how many were for one thing 
and how many were for another 
i did get a call from a woman purporting to be representing 
the vatican i talked to that woman who wanted me to change my 
vote naturally i was suspicious and asked for her phone number i 
said i would call her back well she turned out to be a resident 
of mandeville and works with the friends of americas 
friends of the americas is a nonprofit organization set up by 
rep woody jenkins who is author of the abortion bill the 
organization aids nicaraguan refugees

teams of college engineers begin a race with the 
sun monday 
thirtytwo college and university teams take off from orlando 
fla for an 11day jaunt in solar powered cars hoping to prove 
the efficiency of their designs as the auto industry looks for ways 
other than gasoline to power vehicles 
the route covers more than 1600 miles of secondary state and 
county roads in eight states and the contestants are bound to 
attract some curious stares along the way 
the vehicles are a long way from any assembly line one of the 
chief considerations goes to wind resistance which means that the 
cars hug the ground are basically flat and have no styling 
excesses 
it wont necessarily be the fastest car that wins said 
general motors corp vice president donald l runkle instead it 
will be the car performing most efficiently 
the team that can adapt most consistently to the daily routine 
will have the best chance of coming out on top said runkle who 
heads the advanced engineering staff for the giant automaker which 
sponsors the rally along with the federal department of energy and 
the society of automotive engineers 
gm and other automakers worldwide have been researching new ways 
to power vehicles for years much of the research has centered on 
fuels other than gasoline including methanol methanolgasoline 
mixes ethanol and natural gas 
late last year gm unveiled its impact electric car its 
performance of 060 mph in about eight seconds and a cruising range 
of about 120 miles on a single charge impressed industry observers 
strategy for the race began during the weekend at the daytona 
international speedway in florida the teams went through 
qualifying heats to determine the order of start on monday 
we want to make sure they are all roadworthy gm spokesman 
dave sloan said friday 
cars are entered from a variety of colleges and universities 
ranging from tiny crowder college in neosho mo to the university 
of texas and massachusetts institute of technology teams from 
puerto rico and canada also are entered 
each team received 5000 from gm and 2000 from the energy 
department along with whatever funds could be raised through the 
school local and state governments or elsewhere 
thats only part of the investment for instance about 750000 
has been spent on the car from the university of michigan 
vehicles will start each day at 30 second intervals with the 
previous days winner going first average speeds are expected to 
be in the 30 mph range crews will be allowed to charge batteries 
for two hours before and after each days racing 
the winner will be the team with the least total elapsed time 
the course passes through florida georgia alabama tennessee 
kentucky ohio and indiana before winding up at the gm technical 
center in warren mich north of detroit on the afternoon of july 
19 
the top three finishers will be sponsored by gm in worldwide 
solar car competition later this year in australia gms sunraycer 
solar vehicle won the first worldwide solar car race in 1987 
the sunraycer is on display in the smithsonian institution

robbers do not need guns pencil and paper will 
do 
so say two accountants who have built a business of finding 
financial fraud 
put enough zeroes behind a number and its amazing how 
flexible morals become said james a smith a partner of smith 
sibley amp co accountants 
the firm which specializes in the practice known as forensic 
accounting is one of many hired by the federal government to help 
clean up the savings and loan industry 
smith and his partner kenneth sibley use traditional 
accounting methods tallying assets and estimating losses to 
detect the value of sampl property and uncover fraud 
it is very laborious numbercrunching meticulous 
attention to detail smith said 
but theyve had some anxious moments during a few audits 
once a distraught executive was told the home office had ordered 
him to hand over his books to smith amp sibley he began pacing 
around the office with a baseball bat 
he never swung the bat sibley said but it was close 
smith was introduced to forensic accounting via the watergate 
scandal 
he helped unravel a slush fund through which braniff airlines 
inc funneled money to pay bribes to gain south american landing 
rights accountants discovered braniff used the same fund for an 
illegal contribution to richard nixons 1972 reelection campaign 
over the years forensic accounting has grown to about 15 
percent of the firms work sibley is one of 3000 members of the 
national association of certified fraud examiners 
as part of a team working under contract with the resolution 
trust corp smith and sibley now help determine the value of 
assets held by insolvent thrifts that are under government 
conservatorship 
the partners have seen their forensic speciality take on more 
importance as companies especially small ones realize their 
profits are being stolen and call on the accountants for help 
fraud occurs in many small businesses because their owners do 
not take care to protect their assets they do not mind the 
store said sibley 
he likes to tell of the doctor who turned over all his 
billpaying to a nurse who used his charge account number to buy 
things for herself 
the doctor never bothered to look at the bills and only 
discovered he was being robbed when his accountant asked why his 
interest payments were so high 
but small businesses are not the only victims smith and sibley 
related the twisted tale of one crook 
a teller at a dallas bank was convicted of making false entries 
on the books of a savings and loan and sentenced to prison 
two months out of jail he was working for a construction 
company as a controller he would make out false invoices to 
fictitious vendors after the owner of the company signed the 
checks the thief would blot out the fictitious vendors name 
substitute his own and deposit them into his own account via night 
deposit 
the checks were always paid despite the obvious altering and 
600000 was stolen before the crime was discovered sibley said 
it was too late to save the business the losses broke the 
company 
the thief fled texas but turned up later in the offices of an 
international accounting firm 
he was again convicted and sent to the wynne prison in 
huntsville where he wound up participating in the prison farm 
accounting office according to smith amp sibleys history of the 
case 
not surprisingly a huge shortage was found in the prison 
accounting office 
convictions are unusual sibley said because many businesses 
want only to recoup their losses and wont go to court 
such reluctance he believes has led to increased white collar 
crime although sibley said he senses attitudes are changing 
management is more and more realizing that they have to send 
people to jail he said 
he believes the attention given to multibilliondollar savings 
and loan scandals has spurred law enforcement agencies interest in 
white collar crime 
in the past it has not been publicized sibley said and 
the lack of prosecution makes it more attractive 
sibley hesitated when asked for specifics about his firms 
methods of tracking money he preferred to talk in generalities 
about access to sales receipts bank records and numerous other 
sources 
documentation or in some instances lack of documentation 
builds the case sibley said

wine consumption in the us dropped 
sharply for the second straight year in 1989 with mississippians 
drinking the least and tipplers in the district of columbia the 
most a trade publication reported 
drinkers in california new york and washington the top three 
wineproducing states drank the most wine per capita but new 
hampshire was the only state to show a gain in consumption over 
1988 according to wines amp vines 
americans last year drank 211 gallons of wine per capita the 
lowest consumption of any major wineproducing nation and a 58 
percent drop from 1988 consumption in 1988 dropped 5 percent from 
1987 figures 
by comparison americans over 21 drank 337 gallons of beer 
216 gallons of distilled spirits and about 35 gallons of coffee 
adultonly wine consumption was 303 gallons per capita 
reflecting a national trend against alcohol consumption 
individual states posted figures showing as much as a 195 percent 
drop from 1988 that distinction went to arizona where a 
halfgallon less of wine per capita was consumed last year than in 
1988 
the domestic wine market including imports fell 52 percent to 
523 million gallons it was a 641 million gallon drop from a high 
point of 5871 million gallons in 1986 the report said 
domestic table wines fell 26 percent while production of 
domestic champagnes dropped 63 percent last year marked the 
fourth straight year of decline for foreign champagne sales in this 
country they were down 78 percent to 12 million gallons 
in 1985 champagne imports to the united states hit a peak of 
158 million gallons almost all of it from italy france and spain 
california wines accounted for 728 percent of all wine consumed 
in the us last year while the other 42 wineproducing states 
held 126 percent of the market the rest of the market 146 
percent were imports 
wines amp vines blamed the market drop on the continuing loss of 
ground of generic or jug wines nearly all of it produced in 
californias san joaquin valley and a 167 percent dip in wine 
cooler sales 
it was the second doubledigit loss in two years for the 
coolers sales phenomenon of the early 1980s that literally rescued 
california wine for several years in 1988 and 1989 cooler sales 
fell 333 million gallons falling from 21 percent of wine market 
share to 17 percent last year 
still the coolers mostly cheap white wine fruit juice and 
carbonated water represented one of six gallons of wine sold in 
this country last year 
there were at least three bright spots for the industry 
including a relatively weak us dollar and its builtin price 
advantage over imports 
blush varietals such as white zinfandel and white grenache 
prime fuels for the top selling white wine segment continued to 
gain market share while the booming premiums which cost over 3 a 
standard bottle increased 7 percent at a slower rate than 
previous postings 
us wine exports were up again in 1989 showing foreign sales 
increased to a miniscule 221 million gallons in 1989 from 169 
gallons in 1988 the top two markets are canada 57 million 
gallons and japan 55 million gallons

president bush and canadian prime minister brian 
mulroney said sunday their nations would begin negotiations on an 
air pollution agreement this month 
the announcement was foreseen a year ago when bush decided to 
seek new controls on the sources of acid rain an issue canada has 
been complaining about for a decade 
both houses of congress have passed different versions of 
legislation requiring utility smokestacks to reduce extensively 
emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides the principal raw 
materials causing acid rain 
environmentalists monitoring the economic summit welcomed the 
announcement and said it was inevitable 
in a session before the summit officially begins monday bush 
and mulroney set an informal timetable for talks to begin on an air 
pollution agreement 
william reilly administrator of the environmental protection 
agency will meet with his counterpart robert de cotret in 
ottawa canada on july 16 the leaders said formal negotiations 
should begin shortly after that they said 
i think this day will be long remembered in the history of our 
relationship for the significant departure it constitutes from past 
positions mulroney said he and other canadian leaders have been 
rebuffed in the past in their attempt to prod the united states 
into curbing pollutants 
a white house announcement said the talks with canada would 
cover monitoring of emissions exchange of information and 
settlement of disputes 
scientists on both sides of the border agree about half the acid 
rain falling in eastern canada originates from emissions generated 
by utilities and smokestacks in the united states because of wind 
patterns about a quarter of the acid rain falling in the 
adirondack mountains of new york states originates in canada 
former president reagan argued that not enough was known to 
conclude that acid rain was a serious problem canada said marine 
life in as many as 14000 lakes is in jeopardy 
environmentalists meanwhile denounced what they said was the 
failure of the seven summit nations to live up to the rhetoric of 
last years meeting in paris in which they pledged to protect the 
worlds environment 
the leaders agreed in 1989 to end production of chemicals that 
destroy the earths protective ozone layer said george t 
frampton president of the wilderness society 
the reality is that our forests are being cut just as fast as 
they were a year ago frampton said carbon dioxide and other 
greenhouse gases are being emitted into the atmosphere at just the 
same high volume or even greater than that of a year ago 
population growth and ocean pollution have continued unabated 
an environmental coalition of 150 groups is keeping a scorecard 
designed to hold governments accountable by publicizing their 
records frampton said 
the environmentalists have already ranked the countries 
attending the summit 
west germany was rated top followed by france britain canada 
the united states japan and italy 
the countries were ranked based on their policies on conserving 
energy and reducing the threat of global warming protecting 
biological diversity such as that found in tropical forests 
abating pollution of the oceans controlling population growth 
helping the cleanup of eastern europe and helping develoing nations 
germanys high score was the best of a bad lot said jay 
hair executive vice president of the national wildlife federation
