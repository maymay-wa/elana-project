voters in denver today were deciding whether to replace the 
nations fifth busiest airport while seattle residents considered 
clamping a ceiling on the tallest downtown in the west 
in pennsylvania and oregon residents are voting on statewide 
changes in the way they are taxed and two cities pittsburgh and 
erie pa are holding primary elections to replace mayors who 
developed the same rare disease 
and in tucson ariz school officials are hoping voters will 
pass a 398 million school bond package thats 10 times more 
expensive than one they rejected last year 
the election in denver culminates years of debate over whether 
to replace stapleton international airport and build the first 
major new us airport since 1974 
supporters of the nonbinding ballot issue including mayor 
federico pena say 60yearold stapleton is obsolete and 
overburdened opponents who hired political consultant roger ailes 
to produce their advertising say the new airport is unneeded and 
would be a waste of money 
although the cost of a new airport has been estimated at 17 
billion to 23 billion recent polls have shown that denver 
residents support construction by about a 21 margin 
federal transportation secretary samuel skinner predicted monday 
that the referendum would pass he also advised other cities to 
consider similar measures 
seattle residents were voting on a citizens ballot initiative 
that would set limits on downtown development for the next decade 
the measure would limit the size of new buildings to 450 feet 
about 38 stories the city now has more than 10 buildings taller 
than 450 feet the 76story columbia center is the west coasts 
tallest building 
backers of the initiative decry the manhattanization of 
seattle opponents say the measure would rein in economic 
development 
pennsylvania has the most active election schedule voters were 
considering a statewide ballot issue that would allow counties to 
impose an income tax the idea is to give local authorities leeway 
to lower property taxes but the measure has stirred strong 
opposition 
another measure on the pennsylvania ballot would legalize 
charity raffles and other nonprofit games of chance 
in pittsburgh mayor sophie masloff is trying to hold onto the 
office she inherited last year from the late mayor richard s 
caliguiri mrs masloff was appointed to the post after caliguiri 
died of amyloidosis a rare heart disease she has faced strong 
opposition from allegheny county controller frank lucchino 
six democrats and two republicans are vying to succeed erie 
mayor louis j tullio tullio announced that he was retiring after 
he contracted the same disease that killed caliguiri 
in oregon voters were considering a change in the property tax 
formula to assist about 100 public school districts with inadequate 
tax bases the change which is backed by gov neil goldschmidt 
would reset all districts tax bases to give them greater authority 
to raise taxes without seeking voter approval

china and the soviet union have normalized 
relations after a 30year rift chinese leader deng xiaoping said 
tuesday after welcoming soviet president mikhail s gorbachev to a 
summit at the great hall of the people 
xinhua chinas official news agency said the 84yearold 
senior leader of the worlds most populous nation declared the 
schism healed at his meeting with gorbachev at the start of the 
kremlin leaders second day in china 
gorbachev on monday apologized for the soviet role in three 
decades of sour relations and opened the first chinesesoviet 
summit since 1959 by declaring this period has come to an end 
skipping a scheduled wreathlaying at a monument surrounded by 
tens of thousands of students calling for democracy gorbachev went 
directly to the meeting with deng who has relinquished most of his 
official posts since launching the reforms that spurred chinas 
remarkable economic growth in the past decade 
all the world is concerned with our meeting deng told his 
guest at the start of their talks in a redcarpeted meeting room in 
the great hall just off tiananmen square taken over by the student 
demonstrators 
the key political problems in the world come from relations 
between the united states and the soviet union 
but he expressed satisfaction that gorbachev had embarked on a 
more conciliatory soviet foreign policy he said he has noticed 
there may be a turning point in competition between the united 
states and the soviet union 
the situation is changing from confrontation to dialogue 
deng observed 
deng welcomed the reformist soviet leader as comrade and 
gave him a lengthy handshake but he made no move to award 
gorbachev the bear hug he sometimes gives close friends 
the student leaders meanwhile held a news conference in the 
square urging gorbachev to take up their cause with chinese 
officials 
as a great political reformer we urge mikhail gorbachev to 
talk to the government on our behalf for humanitarian reasons 
wang dan a student leader from beijing university told reporters 
the soviets have sought to avoid any involvement with the 
students saying they regard the matter as a strictly internal 
affair for the chinese to handle alone 
but gorbachevs hosts repeatedly revised his schedule moving 
events to keep the soviet leader away from the demonstrators 
calling for democracy 
we regard this with necessary understanding foreign 
ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said of the schedule 
changes we have similar experience and have lived through some 
difficult times 
gorbachevs government has encouraged greater freedom of 
expression at home and has seen mass demonstrations in recent 
months even ethnic violence 
at a meeting with president yang shangkun the ceremonial head 
of state on monday gorbachev expressed sorrow and regret 
about the long period of animosity 
in a portion of his remarks broadcast by chinese television 
gorbachev said very probably we are also responsible for that 
period to a certain extent 
gerasimov said the two sides agreed at the outset they would not 
examine the causes of old wounds but would discuss the future and 
how to help with each others reform programs 
he said gorbachev was told that deng wanted to finish with the 
past and turn toward the future 
the gorbachev visit is the first by a soviet leader since nikita 
s khrushchev left angrily in 1959 after a frosty meeting with mao 
tsetung that led to the breakdown in relations 
mao rejected what he considered soviet revisionism following 
the death of josef stalin in 1953 and deeply resented what he 
considered soviet efforts to dominate the world communist movement 
china with more than a billion people and the soviet union 
fought border skirmishes in 1969 they have been at odds over 
afghanistan cambodia and what the chinese called soviet 
hegemonism 
both sides agreed gorbachevs meeting with deng would restore 
normal government relations and ties between the two communist 
parties they also expressed confidence about increased economic 
cultural and academic contacts 
in a banquet toast monday night gorbachev said the way 
toward this meeting was not an easy one it required from both 
sides wisdom responsibility and perseverance in removing the 
negative aggravations and prejudices that marred our relations for 
so many years 
yang agreed that sinosoviet relations traversed a tortuous 
course in the past and said today we have come to a new 
starting point 
gorbachev also said improvement of sovietchinese relations is 
not directed against any third country in the final analysis the 
entire world community stands to gain from that improvement 
the united states which benefited strategically from the split 
between the nations it once regarded as its main adversaries now 
says improved sovietchinese relations contribute to world 
stability 
occupation of tienanmen square by up to 150000 student hunger 
strikers supporters and bystanders disrupted the summit schedule 
from the start the square is the symbolic center of chinese power 
and the customary site for official welcoming ceremonies 
authorities threatened to clear it with force if the 
demonstrators refused to leave but were clearly reluctant to risk 
bloodshed on the visit by gorbachev whose tolerance of dissent has 
won worldwide praise 
officials moved the welcoming ceremony to the airport and 
gorbachevs motorcade which was to have passed the square took a 
detour when thousands of people surged past police lines onto the 
broad boulevard in front of the forbidden city 
the soviet presidents meeting with yang was delayed nearly two 
hours by the change in plans gorbachev was slipped into the great 
hall of the people through a side entrance rather than approaching 
from the side giving onto the plaza where the students were 
encamped

namibias transition to independence is 
likely to get back on schedule now that south african troops have 
returned to base and most swapo guerrillas have withdrawn to 
angola a un official says 
cedric thornberry a senior spokesman for the un monitoring 
force in namibia predicted monday that south africa would comply 
with a timetable calling for removal of all but 1500 of its 
soldiers by june 30 
the planned oneyear transition to independence was disrupted on 
april 1 the day it began when an estimated 1600 guerrillas of 
the southwest africa peoples organization crossed into northern 
namibia despite an arrangement for them to remain at their bases in 
angola 
south african officials say 316 guerrillas and 27 members of the 
security forces were killed in clashes that followed the incursion 
swapo leaders subsequently instructed their men to withdraw to 
angola 
on monday officials from south africa cuba and angola met at 
ruacana an angolan town near the namibian border to assess the 
extent of swapos withdrawal south africa has said the entire 
independence process could be in jeopardy if it determines that 
substantial numbers of guerrillas have failed to move to bases at 
least 100 miles inside angola 
us soviet and united nations officials attended the talks as 
observers 
south african military units which were supposed to be confined 
to base under terms of the un independence plan emerged to 
assist territorial police in pursuing the guerrillas the troops 
returned to base saturday 
south africa agreed to end its 74year rule over namibia as part 
of an agreement signed in december which also calls for a phased 
withdrawal of the estimated 50000 cuban troops in angola

weapons charges against an attorney who 
claimed authorities entrapped him in a federally financed 
undercover drug investigation were dismissed monday by a judge who 
found governmental misconduct in the case 
the judge said law enforcement officers should not have filed 
false charges against an undercover sheriffs deputy so he could 
hire attorney robin auld of durango to represent him as part of the 
operation 
filing the false affidavits was an impermissible taint upon 
the integrity and impartiality of the courts judge richard brown 
wrote 
auld said he was very happy with browns ruling but didnt 
want to comment further because of a possible appeal by keith 
cross the special prosecutor in the case 
a notice of claim seeking at least 1 million in civil damages 
has been filed on aulds behalf but the attorney has not yet 
brought a formal lawsuit the government plan had called for the 
undercover officer to pay auld in drugs for his legal services and 
then pressure auld to set up drug traffickers in southwest 
colorado testimony in previous hearings showed 
auld 43 refused to accept drugs but later took possession of 
an uzi machine gun testimony showed the prosecution charged he 
took the gun as payment auld contends he kept it as collateral 
the gun belonged to the durango police department on loan from 
the fbi according to court documents 
aulds trial was to have started next monday in durango 
brown who heard the case after 6th judicial district judges in 
durango disqualified themselves said law enforcement officials may 
have committed perjury when they filed the false charges as part of 
their operation 
this court is not aware of any case or statute which sanctions 
the filing of false and perjured documents in an official court 
proceeding as part of an undercover operation brown wrote 
the public has a right to demand and to expect that the courts 
will do their utmost to remain impartial and to promote the 
publics confidence in the integrity of the courts brown said 
it takes guts but its the right thing he brown wouldnt 
put up with the corruption of court records said hal haddon of 
denver aulds defense lawyer 
cross the special prosecutor said he will appeal 
if this decision stands it means the attorney never has to 
face a jury on fairly serious charges cross said 
cross said he considered the false affidavits before he charged 
auld with theft by receiving and possession of a dangerous weapon 
in my opinion there were no indictable offenses committed by 
the da or law enforcement officials cross said there is no 
question that two documents filed and sworn to werent true but i 
believe there is a difference in doing that and taking the stand 
and perjuring themselves 
the operation was conducted as part of a 70000 drug program 
funded by the federal government testimony showed

the house voted monday to go along with the 
senate and delay by 60 days the implementation of ethics 
regulations that a number of federal officials have blamed for 
their decisions to resign 
the rules were scheduled to take effect tuesday but the house 
action passed by unanimous consent delays the trigger date until 
midjuly a congressional source said 
the senate passed the same measure by unanimous consent last 
friday 
the ethics regulations were cited as the reason for the 
retirement last week of the national aeronautics and space 
administrations acting chief of the space station thomas l moser 
other officials at nasa and other federal agencies also have 
announced their retirements in recent weeks to avoid being covered 
by the new rules 
the regulations would ban federal contractors from hiring 
government officials who have supervised their competitors 
projects subject to maximum fines of 1 million and imprisonment 
of up to five years 
the administration sought the delay because people need to be 
trained and informed as to how the new rules which were published 
just last week would be implemented the source said 
rep john conyers jr dmich sponsored the delaying measure 
but wasnt present for the consent agreement the source said

the writer has covered lebanons civil war for 
its duration here is his report on the despair engulfing the 
country 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
when the civil war broke out in april 
1975 i wondered how many months it would last fourteen years 
later i wonder if it will ever end 
in 1975 my colleagues in the associated press and i huddled 
under desks as rockets tore through the office last week we were 
again sprawled beneath our metal desks as shells exploded around us 
the ap has been shelled out of four offices through the years of 
bombardment invasions and sieges car bombings and assassinations 
for the last two months army commander gen michel aouns 
mainly christian forces have battled the powerful syrian army and 
its moslem allies in a quixotic crusade to force the syrians out of 
lebanon and try to reunite a country dismembered into sectarian 
fiefdoms 
more than 350 people have been killed and nearly 1400 wounded 
in indiscriminate artillery rocket and tank barrages that began 
march 8 
that doesnt compare with the savage battles at the start of the 
war when more than 100 people were killed daily since the war 
began an estimated 150000 people have been killed twice as many 
have been wounded 
the economy is in tatters 
one quarter of the prewar population of 4 million has fled 
others are leaving every day now to start anew somewhere else with 
whatever assets they can salvage 
for many lebanese the latest fighting has forced them to cower 
in underground shelters without sleep electricity running water 
or decent food their children weep in fear 
it has been the final descent into terror and degradation 
since the war began ive seen the syrian army come and go and 
return the israelis invade and withdraw us marines come ashore 
to join french foreign legionnaires plumed italian bersaglieri 
troops and british paratroopers in an illfated effort to bring 
peace 
but lebanons warlords and the arab governments who for their 
own reasons aid and arm them defied them all to go on waging the 
suicidal conflicts that have left the country in ruins 
when the americans and the multinational force eventually 
withdrew in 1984 with hundreds of their men killed or wounded by 
suicide car bombers everyone thought things had hit rock bottom 
but the current fighting has been far more demoralizing because 
it has demonstrated with such destructive force that nothing has 
changed and probably never will 
on both sides of beiruts dividing green line christians and 
moslems speak of their disgust at the carnage and bemoan a future 
seemingly without hope 
beirut was once the most glamorous capital in the middle east 
and bustled with thousands of western businessmen and funseeking 
arab oil shieks lured by the great beachside casino and luxury 
hotels 
now it is shrouded in despair 
for nearly a decade and a half the lebanese have picked 
themselves up after every catastrophe and somehow found the will to 
rebuild patch up their lives and businesses and carry on 
that remarkable spirit is almost drained everyone has had 
enough 
the war with its undertones of medieval religious conflicts and 
endless factional feuds on both sides of the sectarian divide has 
become as incomprehensible to the average lebanese as it has long 
been to the outside world 
there are no heroes or villains no winners or losers any more 
only victims 
the carnage is allembracing presidentelect bashir gemayel 
prime minister rashid karami warlords legislators and poets have 
perished in the lebanese bloodbath along with thousand upon 
thousand of helpless civilians 
for the estimated 1 million christians the last few weeks have 
most traumatic they have been bombarded day and night in their 
shrunken coastal enclave north of beirut by syrias big guns 
beleaguered and outnumbered aoun has refused to back down from 
his battle to rid lebanon of syrian forces 
the syrians and their moslem allies want the christians who 
have dominated government the judiciary and the army since 
independence from france in 1943 to share power with the moslems 
for many christians particularly the dominant maronite catholic 
sect this means syrian overlordship and the surrender of their 
traditional privileges 
nothing has escaped the latest shelling churches hospitals 
schools apartment blocks factories power stations fuel depots 
and even shepherds in their fields in the hills above beirut have 
all been hit 
thousands of homes in west beirut including my apartment have 
been devastated every day we hear of friends killed neighbors 
buried beneath the rubble of their homes whole families wiped out 
we have no electricity or running water 
hospitals are running short of medicine 
the power stations ran out of fuel for their generators weeks 
ago the last fuel supplies went up in flames when syrian shells 
destroyed the main depot in east beirut 
the french the only europeans to significantly respond to 
aouns appeals for aid sent 6000 tons of fuel that was enough to 
provide power for about 2 million lebanese for two hours a day for 
10 days 
everyone has seen worse 
the current violence frightful though it is is nothing 
compared to the destruction wrought by the israelis when they 
invaded 1982 and besieged the moslem sector or compared to the the 
colossal losses of 197576 
christian sources say aoun has come to realize that his 
davidandgoliath war against the syrians is unwinnable he is 
having to make most of the concessions to help the arab league 
enforce a ceasefire and end the carnage 
many support the general who is aided by iraqi weapons for 
finally standing up to the syrians not just for the christians but 
also for moslems who would rather see them gone as well 
but many of aouns people are increasingly critical of why he 
decided to fight in the first place embarking on what many see as 
a reckless impetuous crusade against a foe 10 times as powerful 
but the 54yearold general a ustrained artillery officer 
many christians now call napolaoun cannot back down without 
surrending the besieged christians last card 
equally syrias president hafez assad beset by political and 
economic problems cannot meekly march his troops out of a country 
the syrians consider their own backyard without a loss of face in 
the arab world 
for the lebanese this means a future if such is the word 
that holds only more misery destruction and savagery

when the 50story seattlefirst national bank 
building was completed in 1969 it towered over the downtown area 
like a lone douglas fir over a stand of alder 
today the same building is lost in a skyscraper forest and 
critics of the citys manhattanization are pressing voters 
tuesday to approve size limits on new downtown buildings 
in a city often touted as one of the most livable in the nation 
much of downtown has been cast into shadow cut off from sunnyday 
vistas of mount rainier puget sound and the olympic and cascade 
mountains 
backers of tuesdays cap referendum for citizens alternative 
plan say they are trying to preserve a way of life most 
developers and business boosters fear seattles boom could be 
chased away 
the 500foot 42story smith tower the tallest building west of 
the mississippi river when it was built in 1914 was once a source 
of pride the 975foot 76story columbia center now the west 
coasts tallest has come to symbolize what some feel is runaway 
downtown growth at the expense of the rest of the city office 
space has virtually doubled in the past decade and traffic 
problems and other signs of congestion are increasing 
the citizens initiative would set limits on downtown 
development for 10 years and clamps a 450foot lid on new buildings 
city councilman jim street says he sees the main impact of cap 
as a message that the people of this city want better growth 
management peter steinbrueck an architect and cap campaign 
leader agreed that the major effect may be symbolic 
but john gilmore executive director of the downtown seattle 
association which opposes the initiative said the effect could be 
more than symbolic i dont think this is a message at all 
he said this is a 10year plan that controls what happens 
downtown 
caps potential effect is as unclear as the impact of its chief 
model proposition m approved by san francisco voters in 1986 
with buildings now under construction projects allowed under 
permits issued before the initiative was filed and the limited 
development permitted by cap the skyline could go up for years 
many observers say 
mayor charles royer a cap opponent says that in california 
there have been more than 200 of these slowgrowth or nogrowth 
initiatives and they really havent had much effect 
cap backers including the sierra club church council of 
greater seattle league of women voters puget sound council of 
senior citizens and allied arts of seattle inc have raised about

secretary of state james a baker iii says the 
soviet threat to stop destroying its ss23 missiles would violate 
an arms control treaty and appeared to be part of a publicity 
campaign to divide nato 
the soviets agreed to destroy the ss23s along with five other 
types of missiles in the intermediaterange nuclear force treaty 
that was signed in december 1987 and went into effect last june 
said baker 
this is a matter that was specifically negotiated when the inf 
treaty was negotiated he said 
the elimination of the ss23s on the part of the soviet union 
was debated back and forth for quite some time the soviets 
responded in effect that they would agree to eliminate these 
missiles and now they are doing so baker said sunday on the 
cbstv interview program face the nation 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze visiting bonn on 
saturday warned that if washington did not drop plans to modernize 
its shortrange lance missile the soviet union would respond by 
developing a new shortrange weapon or by retaining the ss23s 
which have a range near the 300mile limit imposed by the treaty 
the soviet union has deployed the ss23spider since 1985 as a 
replacement to the 1960s vintage scud missile and has about 75 
spiders in the soviet union and east germany according to the 
pentagon the inf treaty calls for the kremlin to destroy all the 
ss23s by october 1989 
the inf pact required the superpowers to destroy all missiles 
with ranges of 300 to 3000 miles but did not cover the lance 
which has a shorter range 
the united states has deferred until 1992 plans to modernize and 
replace the 88 lance missiles it has in west germany but has 
resisted west german and soviet pressure to begin immediate 
negotiations on that class of weapons 
baker repeated the us position not to negotiate the reduction 
or elimination of shortrange weapons with the soviets until 
completion of talks designed to reduced the significant warsaw pact 
advantage in conventional arms in europe 
what theyd much prefer to see is the entire denuclearization 
of europe baker said 
shevardnadzes comment baker said could be seen as a public 
relations ploy designed to weaken the north atlantic treaty 
organization 
it would be a terrible mistake if we fall into the trap of 
playing politics with western security he said and the 
russians would love dearly love to see that happen theyd love to 
see us do that and start trying to play that game 
we dont need to be concerning ourselves with shortrange 
public opinion victories 
baker welcomed the announcement by kremlin leader mikhail s 
gorbachev that the soviet union would remove 500 shortrange 
missiles from europe but urged moscow to eliminate more of the 
weapons in which the soviets enjoy a 16toone advantage over nato 
the soviets are coming our way said baker for a long 
time weve been calling on them to unilaterally reduce some of 
their shortrange nuclear weapons the way the nato alliance has 
over the past decade he said nato has destroyed 2400 
shortrange nuclear weapons without fanfare whereas gorbachev 
announced only that the soviets were removing 500 missiles from 
eastern europe into european portions of the soviet union within 
access of the potential eastwest battlefield 
so we say we say its a good step but its a very small one 
and a very modest one said baker 
the soviets have been modernizing their shortrange missiles for 
the past 10 years bakers deputy lawrence eagleburger said in a 
separate interview on the abctv program this week with david 
brinkley

a brash new breed of independent 
magazines and newspapers is setting a high standard for the 
communistrun competition which is scrambling to catch up with its 
rivals flashy design and bold content 
daring reports in such journals as reform a colorful weekly 
tabloid and kapu a cultural monthly have created a competitive 
atmosphere that has affected the older communist party organs 
making it tougher for state censors to muzzle reporting 
the new fondness for scooping the competition has spread to the 
broadcast media the result has been coverage that would have been 
unthinkable a few years ago such as last months televised 
interview with alexander dubcek the father of czechoslovakias 
1968 reform movement 
in the first week of may official radio broadcast an old speech 
by imre nagy premier during hungarys 1956 antisoviet uprising 
announcing that kremlin tanks had entered budapest 
official tolerance of independent journals is one of the most 
visible consequences of reforms introduced during the past year by 
the hungarian leadership which is attempting to bolster its 
popular support as it introduces a multiparty electoral system 
despite changes that have removed barriers to criticism of party 
policies and inspired more public participation in national 
affairs editors complain that their reports continue to be stifled 
by a chronic paper shortage and a state monopoly on distribution 
networks 
a new political weekly called world which is due out this 
month aspires to become a hungarian equivalent to time magazine or 
west germanys der spiegel 
but the printing and publishing vagaries of the east bloc 
require the glossy cover to be submitted three weeks in advance a 
drawback for a weekly that wants to chart the rapidly changing 
course of hungarian politics 
vilag founded by young journalists disillusioned with their 
jobs at the communist party youth weekly oetlet operates out of a 
former army barracks and was still waiting for telephones to be 
installed less than three weeks before its first issue was due out 
may 25 
ilona kocsi a deputy editor said the more open political 
situation has made vilag possible 
the staff is reformoriented and she said the weekly 
underwritten by a group of private investors would be independent 
peter toeke editor of the popular tabloid reform says he does 
not feel threatened by vilag because the newspapers 350000issue 
press run regularly sells out and is estimated to reach 1 million 
readers 
he described the publication he founded as centrist without 
being partisan and supportive of the reform wing of the communist 
party 
critics say reform practices fastfood journalism because it 
sandwiches politics between popular features fashion and gossip 
but toeke says that mixture is the reason for reforms success 
the effect of the independent media is felt by journalists at 
long established newspapers and journals 
even the weekly economic journal hvg one of the most outspoken 
before hungarys media landscape began to change is feeling the 
pressure 
the critical boldness characteristic of hvg in the past has 
become characteristic of essentially all the serious 
publications said endre babus a journalist at hvg 
babus said the weekly recently converted to private ownership 
was weighing whether to become a political weekly or to focus on 
economics to appeal to managers operating within hungarys 
increasingly marketoriented economy 
while the competition has had its pluses for some official 
media it has also inflicted some damage the communist party daily 
nepszabadsag has lost 200000 in circulation since the beginning of 
the year 
the afternoon daily mai nap is the only independent daily 
newspaper to have appeared so far but many of the independent 
groups and fledgling parties have announced their intention to 
establish their own dailies 
kapu a monthly devoted to culture and politics is considering 
a daily publication and has taken steps to overcome the paper 
shortage and post office distribution monopoly 
one of the shareholders of kapu is to be a west german paper 
manufacturer and the editor in chief zoltan brady said he has 
contacted other editors to explore the possibility of setting up an 
independent distributor 
since its first press run of 26000 issues in september the 
magazine has tested the outer limits of hungarys openness 
policies and its growing popularity is illustrated by publication 
now at 100000 
kapu was the first to publish the names of those executed after 
the 1956 revolt and it carried excerpts from the memoirs of a 
former romanian spy published in the west that series was halted 
however when romania threatened to break off diplomatic relations 
brady himself was long blacklisted had his passport revoked and 
spent 80 days in prison two years ago for a series he did on 
corruption

a herd of llamas and alpacas en route 
to the united states from the cold high andes of chile has been 
stranded for seven weeks in the heat of a barren caribbean island 
seventyfive of the woolly beasts have perished mostly from the 
heat and stress 
the 178 survivors are awaiting delivery to american buyers as 
trendy pets pack animals or breeding stock in a 2million export 
deal 
but they have been held up by us regulations on foot and mouth 
disease and have become the center of a feud involving 
animalwelfare activists the antiguan government and the us 
investors 
in all 268 llamas and alpacas were shipped but 15 died in a 
crating accident aboard a bolivian cargo plane on takeoff from 
chile 
after the remaining 253 arrived in the twin nation of antigua 
and barbuda about 250 miles east of puerto rico residents 
protesting their presence on barbuda blocked a quarantine station 
and forced the herd onto uninhabited billy island off antigua 
straight from the beginning it was a fiasco said john 
walsh regional director in boston of the londonbased world 
society for the protection of animals which monitors the 
commercial use of animals in my view it shows a lack of concern 
for the animals 
at one stage the beasts which belong to the camel family but 
have no hump were dying at a rate of two a day on billy island a 
hill of coral rock scrub brush and a few scrawny trees 
because llamas and alpacas live above the treeline in the andes 
they have no instinct to seek shade and succumbed in temperatures 
hitting the mid80s 
they really were just dropping like flies because of the 
heat said john schartner a scubadiving instructor hired to 
camp out on the island and care for the animals they didnt know 
enough to get in the shade most of them would just lie out and 
bake in the sun 
since then workers have built shelters with blue plastic 
tarpaulins to shade the herd and set up a supply line of hay and 
fresh water brought from antigua in 55gallon drums intravenous 
tubes and spray pumps were used to rehydrate the animals 
paula vachon of sarasota fla one of the four partners in the 
export deal who has been supervising the operation in antigua said 
only one animal had died this month a llama with a leg cut that 
got infected 
the llamas and alpacas were brought to antigua and barbuda by 
two florida businessmen david strickland and keith kerr another 
partner is kerrs wife diane 
strickland a sarasota developer has been doing business in 
antigua and barbuda for 17 years kerr who owns a construction 
company in palmetto fla has a 12acre private zoo that includes 
lions tigers cougars bears wolves bobcats and an 8yearold 
elephant 
strickland said the partners bought the exotic creatures in 
chile for 50 to 120 each and hoped to sell them for 6500 to 
15000 each the deal would have netted a profit of around 2 
million he said 
the international llama association estimates there are 25000 
llamas and 1000 of the smaller alpacas in the united states 
in recent years the graceful mildnatured creatures with 
thick woolly coats have become increasingly popular and valuable 
males typically sell for 10000 and breeding females 30000 but 
prices vary greatly a prize stud reportedly sold for 115000 last 
year 
strickland said the idea was to export llamas and alpacas to pay 
for both a wildlife park in antigua and a 450000 quarantine 
station the investors built on barbuda 
the project went awry when a barge carrying the llamas and 
alpacas arrived off barbuda on march 23 an unruly crowd formed and 
refused to allow the vessel to unload 
underlying the protest was local hostility to a cement company 
strickland owns with deputy prime minister lester bird of antigua 
and two other cabinet ministers the company uses sand from barbuda 
in construction 
the main problem for the animals now is that the exporters 
shipped them from chile and brought them to antigua and neither 
country is regarded by the us government as free of 
footandmouth disease a contagious virus that can devastate 
livestock 
the animals have been inspected by a veterinarian from the us 
department of agriculture but they cannot enter the united states 
without undergoing a 90day quarantine the only approved facility 
the harry s truman animal import center in fleming key fla is 
booked through the end of september with a shipment of chinese pigs 
llama association president fred bauer accused the exporters of 
trying to circumvent usda regulations by setting up an unauthorized 
quarantine station nothing seems to ring quite true with this 
deal he said 
francie stull who raises russian wolfhounds near austin texas 
bought 160 of the animals from the florida investors for more than 
1 million and has already presold 49 of them for about 500000 
she said she was unaware until this past september that antigua 
had not done the necessary screening to be declared free of 
footandmouth disease but had been assured there would be no 
problem in obtaining the status 
asked what was likely to happen to the animals she said my 
best guess is that they will be put in some kind of facility where 
they are comfortable and be used as a breeder herd for the next 
couple of years while we negotiate the red tape 
mrs stull said she had fully insured her animals but 
strickland said the rest of the herd was not covered he said the 
partners stood to lose 13 million if the animals cannot be 
brought into the united states 
the government here has agreed to allow construction of another 
quarantine station this one on a peninsula of antigua along with 
the promised wildlife park as a tourist attraction 
we dont want these animals to suffer anymore said 
government spokesman barry stevens theyve been brought here 
and theres nowhere else for the them to go now weve got to 
salvage the situation

the 16 americans who helped 
prosecute mohammed ali hamadi are looking past the verdict to the 
hijackers ultimate fate and are wary of political deals that might 
free him 
hamadi admits taking part in the twa hijacking four years ago in 
which 39 americans were held hostage 17 days but he denies killing 
robert stethem one of six us navy divers aboard 
the hijackers threw stethem 23 from the plane and a picture 
of his swollen bloodstained body appeared in newspapers throughout 
the world 
falk thomas spokesman for the frankfurt district court said 
west german authorities acted as representatives of the civilized 
world in prosecuting the young shiite moslem a verdict is 
scheduled wednesday 
the everpresent danger of reprisals against west germans formed 
the backdrop for the trial which began july 5 1988 
rainer hamm a prominent frankfurt lawyer who represents the 
americans said the danger was not likely to abate with the court 
weighing whether to impose the life prison sentence that 
prosecutors requested life in prison is the maximum penalty hamadi 
could receive under west german law 
hamm noted that west german relief worker markus quint who 
disappeared in lebanon on may 4 had reportedly been held by 
kidnappers seeking lenient treatment for hamadi no group claimed 
to have abducted quint who reappeared sunday 
the americans of course hope there are no secret deals that 
for example would have him hamadi deported back to his home 
country of lebanon toward the latter part of his sentence hamm 
said in an interview 
hamm represents chief flight attendant uli derickson and other 
crew members the navy divers and members of the stethem family 
many of his 16 clients testified at the trial 
frankfurt prosecutors formally notified all those who had been 
held on the plane and the stethem family of their legal right to 
take part in the case as coprosecutors and 16 decided to do so 
as their lawyer hamm frequently questioned witnesses and hamadi 
himself the torture of stethem by hamadi and his accomplice was 
the focal point of the long trial witnesses gave repeated accounts 
of the sadistic pleasure hamadi appeared to take in beating the 
diver and other passengers 
john testrake of richmond mo the pilot testified in 
september it appeared that one of the hijackers hamadi enjoyed 
beating the passengers to inflict violence when no violence was 
called for 
richard and patricia stethem attended every court session 
silently listening to accounts of their sons agonizing final 
hours only occasionally did they lose their composure mrs 
stethem unexpectedly walked out of the courtroom in april during 
testimony about details of her sons murder 
two other men also were subjected to savage beatings after the 
plane was hijacked june 14 1985 on a flight from athens to rome 
and diverted to beirut 
kurt carlson of rockford ill prayed to god to let him die 
after hamadi repeatedly struck him on the back with an arm rest 
the hijackers also viciously attacked clinton suggs of elkhart 
ind another of the navy divers 
more than 100 witnesses testified at the trial in a heavily 
guarded courtroom in frankfurts fortresslike preungesheim prison 
hamadi who prosecutors say is 24 years old is charged with air 
piracy and murder a central question in the trial was whether he 
was 21 at the time of the hijacking or should be sentenced as a 
juvenile 
he testified that the goal of the hijacking was to force the 
release of lebanese moslems imprisoned in israel shortly after the 
americans were freed israel released about 700 prisoners 
hamm said his clients fear that because of such blackmail 
situations as the reported quint kidnapping hamadi could get off 
more easily in germany than he would have if for example he were 
to have received a life term in the united states 
the united states requested hamadis extradition after he was 
arrested january 13 1987 at the frankfurt airport west germanys 
refusal strained the usually warm relations between the two 
countries 
two west germans were seized in lebanon within a week of the 
arrest and the kidnappers tried to arrange a trade the hostages 
finally were released 
rainer mueller a foreign ministry spokesman called the trial 
a special point of danger for our citizens in lebanon its known 
that the hamadi clan has certain influence in lebanon 
mueller said the number of west germans still in lebanon was 
small 
once the frankfurt courts decision is final hamm said hamadi 
cannot be extradited to another country for trial on the same 
charges 
the americans have the right to appeal if they are not satisfied 
with the verdict but hamm said they will be satisfied with the 
result of the trial if it corresponds to the sentence the 
prosecutor has requested

the sight is startling yet somehow 
reassuring the slightly built man in blue scrambling across a 
rugged beach turning over rocks to see if oil is underneath 
clyde robbins is not just one of the thousands of workers 
cleaning up the nations worst oil spill hes the coast guard vice 
admiral responsible for ensuring the work gets done 
when adm paul yost jr the coast guard commandant appointed 
him he described robbins as the toughest taskmaster in the coast 
guard 
the task facing robbins is formidable he encounters a daily 
crush of decisions on how best to cleanse alaskas scenic 
wonderland of nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil spilled when 
the exxon valdez struck a reef march 24 in prince william sound 
oil has fouled shores and islands and spread 450 miles southwest 
of valdez killing thousands of birds and hundreds of otters 
with mandatory retirement looming next year robbins sees the 
cleanup as the final exam in his 35year career 
id say its pretty close to the toughest if not the toughest 
assignment ive ever had he said 
its not the first time robbins the coast guards thirdranking 
officer has had to deal with the messy aftermath of an oil spill 
during his twoyear stint in the early 1970s as captain of the 
port of galveston texas robbins faced similar crises 
one involved a tanker that struck an oil platform and caught 
fire the chore of unloading the tanker without it breaking up and 
sinking was complicated by a hurricane 
it was like god was standing up there saying lets throw 
something else at him robbins recalled 
later a barge dumped millions of gallons of crude that washed 
up on the shores of galveston bay he said that cleanup was like 
a miniexercise leading up to this one 
robbins is a handson administrator 
i feel a very great responsibility to personally eyeball the 
sites and see how things are going said robbins who on thursday 
spent six hours visiting rocky islands normally inhabited only by 
seals 
his typical day begins at 6 am and ends at 11 pm 
he is a taskmaster but hes a good guy to work for said 
coast guard capt david zawadzki commander of the marine safety 
office in alameda calif who is serving as robbins chief of 
staff 
the taskmaster reputation is complimentary rather than 
derogatory said cmdr mike donohoe head of the marine safety 
office in memphis tenn he lets you know what he wants and he 
expects you to deliver 
alaska officials who work daily with robbins seem to agree 
hes out in the field very active said larry dietrich the 
department of environmental conservations man in charge in valdez 
i think hes been very straightforward 
even exxon officials whom he has criticized have respect for 
him 
his dealings with exxon have been tough but fair said otto 
harrison exxons top executive in valdez 
robbins projects an image of evenhandedness quickly 
challenging unsubstantiated allegations of spreading oil or 
questionable cleanup techniques while conceding he has his 
differences with exxon robbins is quick to defend the companys 
effort and commitment 
i have worked a number of spills in the past where the company 
did not accept the responsibility he said i think they have a 
moral obligation to do it the cleanup and i think they feel it 
too i wish we could avoid the fingerpointing certainly everybody 
is a little bit to blame 
robbins said complacency set in at all levels with a decrease in 
the number of spills in recent years 
then he said we got hit with this shocker 
robbins 58 grew up in the tiny farming community of columbia 
cross roads pa 
his goal was aviation but when he found he needed to go to 
college to qualify for navy flight school he was drawn to an ad 
that offered a free education in the coast guard academy 
after spending what he calls a boring 1 years at sea as 
required of all academy graduates robbins got to fly 
for the next 18 years he flew everything the coast guard had to 
offer from amphibious planes to helicopters to the executive jet 
used to fly the brass around 
his love of flying was inherited by his son jmes who flies 
c130s for the coast guard james is to be transferred to kodiak 
next week and robbins said hes looking forward to flying with him 
the alaska shoreline cannot be restored to its previously 
untarnished condition robbins said 
once the spill occurred the fat was in the fire he said 
these beaches are never going to be squeaky clean

tens of thousands of students demonstrating for 
democracy refused to vacate tiananmen square monday forcing the 
government to relocate its welcoming ceremony for mikhail gorbachev 
an elaborate ceremony had been planned to officially welcome the 
soviet president at the vast square in central beijing but 
authorities feared a major disruption by the students who vowed to 
give gorbachev their own welcome 
gorbachev was welcomed instead at the beijing airport where he 
arrived at noon 11 pm edt sunday for the first sinosoviet 
summit in 30 years he and his wife raisa were greeted by chinese 
president yang shangkun and a 21gun salute

them down 
education minister li tieying and minister of supervision yan 
mingfu who hold top party posts met with student representatives

chinese journalists have been sympathetic to the protests on 
sunday in an unprecedented act defying state censorship a liberal

mauritania is a schizophrenic 
country straddling the arab and black african worlds 
it has embraced arab brothers to the north in the new union of 
the great arab maghreb which has yet to yield major economic 
benefits and engaged in a bloody dispute with the blacks of 
senegal its southern neighbor and largest african trading partner 
onethird of mauritanias people are of arabberber extraction 
known as white moors they dominate the government and most of the 
economy 
another third are haratines or black moors mixedrace 
descendants of slaves who adopted berber customs and the final 
third are blacks from the senegal river region along the southern 
border 
even as it turns north to algeria tunisia and libya in hopes of 
turning the maghreb into a minicommon market mauritania looks 
with new interest to the south where two new senegal river dams 
have created agricultural opportunities 
in large measure disagreements about territorial and farming 
rights along the border river are at the root of recent ethnic 
violence in mauritania and senegal that has cost an estimated 260 
lives 
tens of thousands of people were repatriated to their respective 
homelands by an air shuttle established at the height of the 
trouble which began with a minor border incident in april 
the dispute with senegal comes at a time of political and 
economic change both of which could be affected by it 
mauritania an islamic state governed by the military committee 
for national salvation is making its first tentative steps toward 
democracy a few local elections were held in the past year and 
nationwide municipal elections are the next step 
lt col maouya ould sidiahmed taya the president said in a 
speech last month an ephemeral democracy is not what we are 
looking for a healthy efficient and durable democracy demands a 
change in our mentality and the eradication of ignorance and other 
social ills 
a multiparty system and real parliamentary democracy do not 
appear likely in the immediate future 
total democracy that depends on the situation said 
information minister mustapha ould abedarrahman the president is 
a man of his word each time the context allows development of the 
democratic process it happens but it is impossible to say how 
long total democracy will take 
the economy also is being restructured by agreement with the 
international monetary fund and the world bank about onethird of 
the governmentowned companies are being sold and others are being 
reorganized 
restructuring combined with a 15 percent devaluation of the 
currency has had its consequences many public jobs were eliminated 
and a government fund has been estabalished to help those affected 
find other work 
mauritania is a desert country and with the senegal river dams 
in operation the government is giving land to any individual or 
company willing to develop it 
that has lured many white moors never previously interested by 
agriculture and black farmers resent the intrusion 
an unknown factor is the impact of the 50000 mauritanians 
repatriated from senegal where most were small shopkeepers 
resettling them will be a financial burden on the government and 
their return also means loss of the money they had sent home 
another question mark is fishing which has overtaken iron 
mining as mauritanias largest income producer nearly all the 
fishermen were senegalese and nearly all fled leaving the industry 
in a shambles and fish markets nearly empty 
senegalese say a deepseated racism among white moors is at the 
heart of the conflict mauritania denies it 
in the 1960s violence by southern blacks who feared further 
arabization was put down harshly and even discussion of race was 
banned but problems continue in a nation that did not abolish 
slavery until 1980 
the government claims to have eradicated the african liberation 
forces of mauritania a black opposition group except for a few 
troublemakers based in dakar capital of senegal 
after an attempted coup by the groups military wing in 1987 
two army officers were executed and others were jailed 
fear of impending racial conflict has caused many black 
mauritanians to flee nouakchott for the southern border region 
where they are a majority

recent republican voter registration gains are 
easing the gops traditional opposition to legislation giving 
americans easier access to the voting booth 
a bill to make registration automatic whenever someone applies 
for a drivers license is moving through the house with 
republicans muting their longstanding complaint that easy access 
merely invites ballot fraud 
we have the historic opportunity to get rid of the hoops so 
many americans have to jump through to get registered declares 
the bills sponsor rep al swift dwash 
lawmakers say the aim is to increase voter turnout and open the 
nations elections to americans unable to leave work and stand in 
line at city hall or merely too forgetful to register 30 days in 
advance as required in some states 
advocates of change cite success in three states that allow 
voters to register on election day and they also point to north 
dakota which has abolished voter registration altogether 
critics however say the largely rural states that have easy 
registration lack much history of fraud at least compared with the 
checkered traditions of chicago and other machine bastions where 
ward bosses have counseled followers to vote early and vote often 
republicans signed on to swifts bill after democrats agreed to 
provisions making it easier for state and local officials to purge 
the rolls of people who have died or moved away 
gop members waved swifts bill through the house administration 
committee without a murmur of dissent two weeks ago and it is now 
headed for floor action 
although there are lingering gop dissenters many republicans 
now say their party stands to gain from expanded registration 
they point to the results of eased laws in many places 
including california where voters can register while ordering 
cheeseburgers at fastfood restaurants 
the people coming into the republican party in the largest 
numbers tend to be young professionals and executives who are very 
mobile says rep bill thomas rcalif 
he says the republican strategy is to ease the way for them as 
well as college students whose political outlook was shaped in the 
reagan era 
in the senate rules committee chairman wendell ford dky is 
drawing up a similar bill the unveiling is set for late july with 
no assurance of bipartisan support but that could change if the 
bill includes strong purging provisions designed to keep the 
rolls clear of voters who have died or moved elsewhere 
such purging provisions however are unwelcome among civil 
rights forces and are absent from a measure sponsored by sen alan 
cranston dcalif and being weighed by the senate judiciary 
committee 
that bill is sharply different from the house measure and has 
triggered a touch of the old partisanship that once haunted the 
issue 
sen mitch mcconnell rky says the cranston bill would 
open the democratic process up to vote buyers tombstone voters 
multiple voters and hordes of illegal aliens who could be rounded 
up on election day and paid to vote in our local state and federal 
elections 
proponents say complex registration requirements now in force in 
many states work the greatest hardship on minorities 
cranstons bill would require states where minority registration 
rates drop sharply below those for nonminorities to submit a plan 
for approval by the attorney general designed to overhaul their 
procedures 
one reason why house republicans may be just as glad to leave 
wrangling over voter registration to the senate is that they are 
saving ammunition for a debate over campaign finances expected 
later in the session 
democrats are calling for action to close what they call the 
soft money loophole under which state and local committees of 
political parties spend contributions to benefit presidential 
candidates 
the contributions are described as soft because they are not 
subject to federal limits and reporting requirements 
democraticsponsored legislation now in the hopper would change 
that

cowboys mainly ride the range to sell 
beer and cigarettes these days but the wild west still captures 
the imagination of foreigners even in the soviet union a rodeo 
promoter says 
stephen gander who once staged a rodeo for former president 
reagan hopes to have broncos bucking in a moscow arena by the end 
of next year 
the cowboy as profession may have been consigned forever to 
television advertisements but when you leave the borders the 
american cowboy is the thing that other people identify with 
gander said its the most recognized symbol worldwide for the 
united states 
gander 38 the producer of the worlds toughest rodeo is no 
stranger to extravaganzas in 1985 he sponsored a huge beach party 
in the middle of iowa by trucking in tons of sand to a grassy area 
off a freeway 
us officials say ganders rodeo would be one of the largest 
cultural exchanges between the two countries since reagan and 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachev signed an exchange initiative in 
january 1986 
if he can pull it off it will be the first of its kind in the 
soviet union said molly raymond deputy coordinator of the us 
information agency which helps organize cultural exchanges 
gregory guroff and vyacheslav sirotkin officials of the moscow 
circus which toured the united states last year were intrigued 
gander said 
i asked them are you familiar with rodeos and mr sirotkin 
said yes reagans favorite sport 
gander rode the circuit for eight years and has produced rodeos 
from portland ore to madison square garden during the past 
decade 
in 1983 gander coproduced a performance for reagan and more 
than 11000 guests including the soviet ambassador 
gander should get official approval soon from the soviet union 
said usia official chris kidder but a corporate sponsor is still 
needed 
then comes the hard part finding a way to move more than 100 
animals and equipment to the soviet union for a threetofourweek 
stay along with 70 cowboys and their gear 
its one thing to take a concert over there you just have 
your sound systems and thats it gander said 
but in this particular case were talking about saddles 
riding chutes and other equipment and maybe even a semitrailer 
truck to haul the animals 
eventually gander hopes to work out a reciprocal tour of us 
cities by either the cossack riders or the soviet horse theatre

mikhail gorbachev a new symbol of tolerance in 
the communist world arrived monday for a historic summit meeting 
overshadowed by an impasse between chinese officials and thousands 
of students fasting for democratic reform 
in a statement issued at a welcoming ceremony at beijings 
airport gorbachev noted he was arriving in the springtime a 
season of renewal and hope and expressed a wish that the first 
sovietchinese summit in 30 years would mark a watershed in 
relations between the two communist giants 
we in the soviet union follow with keen interest the 
transformations that are unfolding in china the 58yearold 
leader said in the statement he likely was referring to chinas 
decadeold economic reform rather than the students demands for 
greater openness and a voice in government 
the official welcoming ceremony traditionally staged in 
beijings tiananmen square was abruptly moved to the airport 
because tens of thousands of students including about 2000 hunger 
strikers and their supporters continued to occupy the square for a 
third straight day 
the students defied authorities who set several deadlines for 
clearing the broad plaza and insisted they would carry on their 
monthlong campaign 
out of respect for gorbachev the students moved to a far side 
of the famed square to leave room in front of the great hall of the 
people where the military ceremony had been planned they even 
used their banners to sweep up some of the litter from the protests 
but officials abruptly moved the ceremony on two hours notice 
and gorbachevs motorcade into the city was rerouted to avoid the 
demonstration however several thousand people most of them 
apparently not students charged into the street in front of the 
square where the motorcade was to have passed on its way to the 
official guest house where gorbachev is staying 
police shoved the people back clearing half of the broad 
boulevard soviet officials said gorbachev reached the house 
without incident taking a different route 
the soviet leader accompanied by his wife raisa arrived at 
noon 11 pm sunday edt for a fourday visit to beijing and 
shanghai he was greeted by president yang shangkun reviewed the 
military honor guard and received a 21gun salute 
gorbachev left moscow sunday and stopped overnight in the 
siberian city of irkutsk before flying to beijing to restore ties 
that broke off in 1959 after a decadelong alliance between the 
communist giants 
in irkutsk gorbachev told a crowd of soviets who gathered at 
the airport that his trip would signal a warmer relationship 
between the communist giants 
gorbachev said he did not want to talk about the years of 
tension between the countries but said our people and the 
chinese people preserved a feeling of respect and a wish to live 
like good neighbors his remarks were shown on the soviet tv news 
program vremya 
the main business of the visit is expected to take place tuesday 
when gorbachev holds talks with senior leader deng xiaoping and top 
party and government officials 
deng the venerable 84yearold revolutionary now frail and 
semiretired has steered his country through a period of economic 
reform that brought growth and westernization but along with the 
reforms came inflation and dislocation that the government is 
trying to control 
gorbachev also has spearheaded a movement to overhaul the 
centralized communist structure but his economic measures have 
been far more cautious and to date less effective than chinas 
the soviets however have moved more dramatically to ease 
restraints on public expression and have permitted competitive 
elections and a level of democratization practically unheard of in 
china 
as a result gorbachev is seen as something of a hero to many of 
the chinese students who have been demonstrating for a month to 
press their demands for democracy and freedom 
the last sovietchinese summit was in beijing between nikita s 
khrushchev and mao tsetung in 1959 as mao challenged the soviets 
leadership of the oncesolid communist bloc relations plummeted 
shortly afterward and the soviets pulled out thousands of 
technical advisers who had been helping rebuild china 
in the years since china endured the trauma of the cultural 
revolution and the soviets experienced what is now referred to as 
the era of stagnation but which is remembered here as a time of 
soviet adventurism in asia 
a series of border clashes along the sovietchinese frontier 
kremlin backing for the vietnamese occupation of cambodia and the 
soviet military drive into afghanistan all exacerbated what began 
as ideological differences 
the soviets eager for a role in asias development boom have 
trumpeted the summit as a renewal of a oncegreat friendship and 
have spared no opportunity to herald its historic significance 
taking a lesson from us and other western politicians they have 
staged a public relations campaign for the attention of the world 
media gathered in beijing 
the chinese were more subdued all along having pressed the 
kremlin to withdraw its troops from afghanistan pull back its 
forces from the chinese border and get the vietnamese out of 
cambodia before agreeing to a summit 
moscow claims to have met the conditions the last soviet troops 
left afghanistan in february the kremlin helped broker a 
vietnamese pledge to be out of cambodia by september and on 
monday the soviets were scheduled to begin withdrawal of some 
50000 troops along with tanks artillery and air forces from 
mongolia 
mongolia a soviet ally sandwiched between the two giants in the 
middle of their 4300mile border is believed to have more than 
65000 soviet troops posted along its chinese border

carlos menem swept to victory in 
presidential elections sunday capping a resurgence by the peronist 
party that had been suppressed by the military for most of the past 
three decades 
with results from 56548 of 75358 ballot boxes nationwide 
menem tallied 5913943 votes or 468 percent the interior 
ministry reported five hours after polls closed 
in second place eduardo angeloz of the ruling radical civic 
union got 4737246 votes or 373 percent it said 
ive defeated an adversary but ive regained a friend said 
menem who is governor of la rioja province menem 58 and 
angeloz 57 were law school classmates at the university of 
cordoba in the 1950s 
angeloz called menem to concede defeat and congratulate him 
angeloz who is governor of cordoba province told reporters he 
will continue working in my province and later ill see what i 
can do on the national level 
menem immediately tried to heal wounds from the long bitter 
campaign he told reporters in la rioja im going to ask him to 
work with me and well go together toward a proposal of national 
unity 
the vote count was to continue until 3 am 2 am edt 
it was not a direct election instead the voters cast ballots 
for 600 presidential electors menem needs 301 to avoid a contest 
within the electoral college that will meet aug 10 
the interior ministry did not release projections on electors 
but peronist spokesman cesar arias said party calculations indicate 
menem will receive the votes of up to 350 electors 
several thousand people gathered late sunday outside the 
peronists campaign headquarters in a downtown buenos aires hotel 
they sang the partys anthem and chanted the radical 
dictatorship is going to fall 
turnout among the electorate of 20 million was projected at a 
record 85 percent voting was calm and orderly across this south 
american nation of 31 million 
the two main contenders were trailed by nine other candidates 
preelection polls had indicated the centerleft peronists would 
win and menem would replace president raul alfonsin of the centrist 
civic union when his sixyear term ends 
the principal campaign issue in argentina once one of the 
worlds wealthiest nations was the economy which has been 
declining since the mid1940s and took a steep dip in recent months 
today we put our prejudices aside the issues have divided us 
for months but now we put them on the back burner and were all 
concentrating on one thing today we are changing history said 
medine ruilio a 53yearold painter 
alfonsins inauguration in december 1983 ended nearly eight 
years of military dictatorships the constitution bars alfonsin 
from seeking reelection the new president will be inaugurated 
dec 10 
argentines also are electing a vice president half the chamber 
of deputies one national senator legislatures in 14 of the 
nations 22 provinces and several thousand municipal officials 
menem and angeloz offered different visions of how argentina 
might overcome a chronic budget deficit tripledigit inflation 
rising unemployment and a 59 billion foreign debt 
in the 1930s beef and grain exports to europe placed the 
country among the worlds 10 wealthiest nations 
menem the candidate of labor unions and the working poor 
pledged to dramatically improve wages and hinted he might not 
continue payments on the foreign debt 
he has spoken vaguely of a productive revolution and 
social pact to spur employment slash the budget deficit raise 
the value of the national currency and curtail inflation 
angeloz the candidate of the middle class pledged to sell 
inefficient state industries maintain a free exchange rate spur 
exports and diminish the power of the 4 millionstrong general 
labor confederation union the cornerstone of the peronist party 
the biggest of the approximately 300 companies controlled by the 
government were nationalized by gen juan domingo peron when he was 
in power between 1946 and 1955 the year he was ousted by a 
military coup currently about 2 million argentines of a work 
force of about 11 million are employed by the state 
despite some acrimony campaigns were lackluster in comparison 
with 1983 when the mood was jubilant hopes were higher crowds 
were larger and the main issue democracy clearcut 
the election marked the first time an elected civilian replaced 
another since 1928 when hipolito yrigoyen succeeded marcelo t de 
alvear yrigoyen was overthrown by a military coup in 1930 
the peronist party claims 4 million members and has been the 
countrys biggest since it was put together by peron and he was 
elected in 1946 following his overthrow in september 1955 the 
party was banned and many of its leaders jailed or exiled until 
1973 when peron returned from spain and was elected more by an 
overwhelming margin 
following perons death july 1 1974 his wife isabel took 
over as president she was deposed by a coup in march 1976 and the 
military rulers jailed menem

the senate this week heads into what could be 
a close vote on the 7 billion fsx deal calling for joint 
usjapanese development and production of a nextgeneration 
fighter for japan 
debate over the controversial plan has pitted foes arguing that 
it will jeopardize american jobs and technological prowess against 
proponents stressing the need to maintain strong us defense 
cooperation with japan 
sen alan j dixon dill asserted that despite recent 
assurances from the japanese on a 40 percent us share in the fsx 
project and safeguards for sensitive technology this is still 
the same old deal a bad bad bad bad deal for america 
if the deal goes through dixon said we will be helping our 
fiercest economic competitor build a topnotch aerospace industry 
however sen richard g lugar rind calling for support of 
the agreement cited the critical importance of usjapan 
defense ties 
it is important that we stay together with japan that we 
maintain that cooperation and alliance he told the senate 
under the fsx deal general dynamics and japans mitsubishi 
heavy industries would jointly develop and produce the fsx an 
advanced version of the american f16 general dynamics has 
headquarters in st louis but most of the fsx work would be done 
at its f16 plant in fort worth texas 
the senates vote on a resolution to halt the fsx is tentatively 
scheduled for tuesday afternoon 
andy semmel an aide to lugar said i think its going to be 
extremely close he pointed to the 98 margin by which the senate 
foreign relations committee narrowly voted last thursday to support 
the deal 
a companion resolution of disapproval has been introduced in the 
house where it is awaiting action by the foreign affairs committee 
even if the resolutions were passed however a twothirds 
majority of both houses would be needed to override a likely 
presidential veto 
in other congressional action this week the house and senate 
will follow through on last months deficitreduction agreement 
with president bush when they consider the 117 trillion budget 
for fiscal 1990 
negotiators from the two chambers completed work on a final 
version of the plan last thursday and final passage of the 
spending plan is expected to be little more than an exercise in 
rubberstamping 
the budget for the fiscal year that begins oct 1 would hold

would be needed to keep up with cost increases 
at the same time it would boost beyond inflation federal 
efforts for science education and health programs 
the spending blueprint claims to reduce the federal deficit to 
997 billion just within the 100 million limit set in the 
grammrudman balancedbudget law 
by contrast with the budget bush and the democraticcontrolled 
congress are anything but in harmony on the issue of raising the 
minimum wage 
last thursday the house passed legislation that would increase 
the 335 hourly minimum wage to 455 by october 1991 the senate 
is poised to pass a similar measure this week and bush is already 
threatening a veto 
the white house prefers a version that would limit the increase 
to 425 by january 1992 its version also would impose a 
subminimum wage for six months as opposed to the 60day training 
wage favored by congressional democrats 
democrats seem unlikely to be able muster the twothirds 
majorities in both houses that would be needed to override a veto 
but they are pressing the issue anyway in an attempt to position 
themselves politically as the friend of the countrys wage earners

it was an unusual confession 
at a senate judiciary committee hearing on ways to increase 
voter registration senators said that large states were less 
suitable for liberalized procedures than some of the smaller more 
rural states because of vote fraud in large urban centers 
there was a bit of a debate about it almost literally on the 
theme of my state is more crooked than your state 
i think that historically my state has more vote fraud than 
your state said sen arlen specter rpa to sen mitch 
mcconnell rky 
i dont see how thats possible mcconnell shot back 
specter conceded that it is just possible that pennsylvania may 
have had more vote fraud than kentucky only because it has a longer 
history than kentucky 
but he added nodding to sen paul simon dill that he 
believes that philadelphia and chicago have probably had more vote 
fraud than any other two american cities put together 
and i say that with some deference to boston he added

secretary of state james a baker iii is 
rejecting calls for the panama canal treaty to be abrogated while 
the man in charge of the american troops sent to panama says 
diplomacy must be used to remove gen manuel antonio noriega from 
power 
i think it would be counterproductive baker said sunday on 
the cbs news program face the nation when asked whether the 
united states should consider voiding the treaty 
some members of congress have called for abrogating the treaty 
in view of noriegas intransigence the military ruler sought last 
week to nullify the results of an election that went against his 
handpicked candidates by a 3to1 margin 
baker said such an action would turn this into a united states 
vs panama and in effect versus some of the rest of latin america 
contest 
during a commencement address at the university of wyoming 
defense secretary dick cheney said diplomacy must be against 
noriega 
i think whatever you do is going to have to be done 
diplomatically cheney said it would help if the other latin 
american nations would come together and make it clear that they 
wont deal with a panamanian government headed by mr noriega 
cheney also praised bush for his decision last week to send us 
troops to panama 
i think it was a necessary move it was a step that a prudent 
man would take he said weve got some 40000 americans who 
live in panama weve got major obligations under the panama 
canal treaty 
a day earlier bush had used stronger language than either 
cabinet member when he exhorted the panamanian people to rise up 
against noriega though he stopped short of urging violence or a 
coup bush told reporters the people should do everything they 
can to have the will of the people respected they ought to just do 
everything they can to get mr noriega out of there 
under the canal treaty which was negotiated during the carter 
administration full control of the strategic waterway is to be 
turned over to panama 10 years from now over the next decade 
panamanian officials are to gradually assume a greater role in 
administering the canal 
the secretary of state said measures taken by the bush 
administration to support the panamanian political opposition and 
encourage noriegas departure from panama need some time to 
work 
i think its very important that the will of the panamanian 
people be given effect baker said we had an election here 
thats been stolen we have the will of the people being subverted 
and perverted so we ought to do everything within reason that we 
can to encourage this man noriega to leave to bring pressure 
on him to leave 
sen christopher j dodd dconn chairman of the western 
hemisphere subcommittee of the senate foreign relations committee 
said the united states should not completely rule out taking 
military action against noriegas regime if future circumstances 
warrant 
asked about the possibility of using us forces in panama dodd 
said you never say what youre not going to do and you never 
remove that arrow from your quiver if youre talking about 
military options clearly you have to retain the option to use 
military forces 
dodd appearing on abcs this week with david brinkley 
noted panama is not just any other country in the region its 
one of the vital links between east and west vitally important to 
us

a commission to coordinate the federal attack 
on aids has yet to sit down to work and a democratic congressman 
who helped create it blames president bush for being five months 
late in appointing members 
the white house defended the delay in appointing two additional 
members saying it is still staffing a new administration and says 
a list of names should be given to the president within the next 
two weeks 
congress created the bipartisan commission last year to 
coordinate the federal attack on aids although congress gave the 
president and house and senate leaders 45 days to select the 15 
members of the panel no one met the dec 19 deadline 
house leaders announced their five appointments in february and 
senate leaders only finished their five selections earlier this 
month 
bush must still appoint two members to serve along with the 
secretary of health and human services the surgeon general and the 
secretary of veterans affairs 
rep roy rowland dga who sponsored the legislation that 
created the commission said in an interview friday that bushs 
failure to make his appointments is holding up the work of the 
panel of medical scientific and legal experts 
as long as its not functioning were not addressing the 
problem and the number of aids cases that were aware of is going 
up exponentially said rowland a physician who was one of the 
five people selected by house leaders to serve on the commission 
we have no idea how many people have been exposed to the virus 
that dont have the disease yet he said theres just all 
kinds of things that we need to be dealing with from a policy 
standpoint that were not dealing with 
white house spokesman alixe glen said the appointments have been 
delayed because of the enormous task of staffing a new 
administration 
while this is a priority it has not moved as quickly as 
perhaps it should have she said however within the next 
couple of weeks names should be forwarded to the president 
the new commission was endorsed by the national academy of 
sciences and the institute of medicine in a white paper on aids 
that was presented to bush at the beginning of his administration 
rowland said the emergency supplemental appropriations bill up 
for final action in congress this week includes 400000 this year 
for the commission he said an additional 2 million has been set 
aside in the fiscal 1990 budget to fund the panels operations 
but until bush makes his appointments rowland said the 
commission simply cant function 
in addition to rowland the house appointees are diane ahrens 
head of the ramsey county minn board of commissioners who 
established an aids task force in st paul scott allen a baptist 
minister and coordinator of the aids interfaith network in dallas 
dr don c des jarlais coordinator of aids research for the new 
york state division of substance abuse services and donald s 
goldman a livingston nj attorney who has written and lectured 
on legal and ethical questions relating to aids 
senate appointees are larry kessler founder of the boston aids 
action committee dr june osborn dean of the school of public 
health at the university of michigan harry dalton a yale 
university law professor who is a recognized expert in aids legal 
issues dr charles konigsbert director of the health division of 
the kansas department of health and environment and eunice diaz

israeli leaders are under growing pressure to 
seek the release of convicted american spy jonathan j pollard but 
are playing down the case for fear of disrupting relations with the 
united states 
pollard a 34yearold american jew was sentenced to life in 
prison in march 1987 for selling us military secrets to israel 
his wife anne hendersonpollard is serving a fiveyear term for 
helping him 
israeli leaders have disclaimed responsibility saying pollard 
was run by a rogue intelligence operation in israels defense 
ministry 
many israelis feel their government must try to secure pollards 
release there are complaints that it betrayed pollard who was 
turned away when he sought asylum at the israeli embassy in 
washington after his exposure 
he is seen by israelis as having done something significant 
for israels defense there is a longstanding tradition in israel 
that you dont abandon people in the field said harry wall head 
of the israel branch of the new yorkbased antidefamation league 
since january a growing number of israelis have spoken out for 
pollard 
a 70member lobby has formed in israels 120seat parliament and 
passed a resolution urging president bush to pardon the pollards a 
petition drive demanding his release has collected 21000 
signatures and school children were organized to send drawings to 
pollard for passover 
we as jews are obligated to do everything in our power to work 
for the release of the pollard couple interior minister arye 
deri said after meeting last month with pollards parents and 
giving them a bible and other religious objects for their son 
pollards father morris a biochemist from south bend ind 
said he saw little sign of action to free his son but there are 
indications that israeli government officials are taking quiet 
steps 
people in the government tell us we are dealing with the 
matter behind the scenes but everything has to be terribly 
discreet said micaela ziv who heads a group called israelis 
for the pollards which sponsored the petition drive 
news reports say israel is setting aside 5000 a month to be 
given the pollards after their release 
officially the government blocks all inquiries the defense and 
foreign ministries refuse comment and avi pazner an aide to prime 
minister yitzhak shamir says i dont think we should discuss 
this subject publicly 
he said shamir did not raise the case during his april visit to 
washington 
a senior government official noted the renewed publicity comes 
as israel is depending on us help to negotiate an interim peace 
settlement with palestinians to ease international criticism over 
its handling of the uprising in the occupied territories 
this is not the time to start digging up the past said the 
official speaking on condition of anonymity both countries are 
facing historic decisions and their dialogue will have enormous 
importance for the future of the middle east 
but the pollard affair once described by israels senior 
statesman abba eban as the most difficult moment in the history 
of israels international relations lingers 
us protests last month reportedly forced the resignation of 
one of pollards handlers air force col aviem sella from a top 
position in the israeli electronics firm elop which is heavily 
subsidized by the government in early may us officials came to 
israel to discuss several unresolved matters in the case in which 
pollard an intelligence analyst for the us navy sold thousands 
of secrets to israel 
questions remain about how much israels three top leaders 
shamir finance minister shimon peres and defense minister yitzhak 
rabin really knew 
wolf blitzer of the jerusalem post newspaper writes in a new 
book the territory of lies that at least one of the three 
leaders probably knew that intelligence operative rafael eytan 
ran a spy ring in washington but was unaware of the details 
blitzer wrote that eytan and other contacts took the risk 
because they apparently assumed arrogantly and recklessly that 
they would not get caught 
eytan a protege of rightwing former defense minister ariel 
sharon recruited an american spy because he belonged to a school 
that sees relations with the united states as more adversarial than 
most said shai feldman a researcher at tel aviv universitys 
jaffee center for strategic studies 
some israelis apparently also felt washington was withholding 
reports on soviet weapons systems in arab countries the jerusalem 
post wrote after pollards capture in november 1985 that the 
information he sold should have been given to israel 
the government official who discussed the case said it does not 
affect usisraeli defense and intelligence relations now but 
that the scars still exist on the american side 
such a scar only hurts when you reopen it and we hope we 
dont have to do that he said 
a growing number of israelis feel otherwise 
in the southern negev desert the town of mitzpe ramon has 
adopted the couple and set aside an unfurnished house for them 
the pollards have helped israel and now israel must help 
them mayor shmuel cohen said

a 69 billion surplus in an aviation trust 
fund that is entangled in budgetbalancing contrivances would be 
released to pay for devices to detect plastic explosives in 
airliner luggage under legislation before a house committee 
the administration already has ordered airlines to buy and 
install 1 million thermal neutron devices in highrisk us and 
foreign airports even though the method of payment is not settled 
the first thermal neutron device which detects plastic 
explosives by bombarding luggage with neutrons is to be installed 
at john f kennedy international airport in new york in july 
airlines traditionally have paid for and operated security 
screening equipment at airports they use 
transportation secretary samuel skinner says airlines could 
recover the added expense by increasing international air fares 
about 1 a ticket but a house committee dealing with aviation 
issues wants to break into the bulging airport and airway trust 
fund and pay 270 million for plastic explosives detection and 
other airport security 
the house plan would not affect fares because the money is 
already there the result of previous collections of taxes on 
tickets aviation fuel and air freight the fund set up in 1971 
is intended to cover airport buildings runways and equipment 
although it does end up covering a large chunk of the federal 
aviation administrations operating expenses 
because of pressure to reduce the deficit neither the white 
house nor congress has been willing to dip into the aviation 
surplus which will hit 69 billion on sept 30 
the bush administration like the reagan administration before 
it says the fund grows because congress has been unwilling to use 
it to cover more of the general expenses of the faa which then has 
to come from general tax revenue 
a bill sponsored by rep james oberstar dminn says the trust 
fund money should be released for security expenses because the 
airlines are subjected to terrorism directed at policies of the 
united states government 
oberstars bill passed the public works committee with little 
opposition after the aviation subcommittee rejected a republican 
attempt to make the airlines pay at least half the cost of the new 
security devices the measure is expected to go to the house floor 
next month 
concern over plastic explosives swept world governments and the 
aviation industry after the dec 3 bombing of pan am flight 103 
over lockerbie scotland that killed 270 people authorities say 
the bomb was plastic explosives concealed inside a cassette tape 
player 
oberstars bill is the first attempt to give trust fund money 
directly to airlines and opponents say it could set a precedent 
that might lead to appeals for funds to replace aging airliners or 
correct other airline problems 
the bills supporters however see it as a first step toward 
spending trust fund money as it originally was intended on 
airports and the air traffic control system 
the fund now pays for 57 percent of faas expenses with the 
rest of the agencys 64 billion budget coming from general tax 
revenue 
the transportation department says that since 1982 396 
billion in federal funds have gone to aviation with 226 billion 
coming from the trust fund or from aviation users and 17 billion 
from general revenue or from all taxpayers 
legislative tinkering has allowed the surplus to grow even 
though more federal money is spent on aviation each year

the consumer product safety commmission should 
set performance standards for both adult and childsize bicycle 
helmets a private safety group says 
the group the national safe kids campaign says that federal 
standards would help reduce the 1000 deaths and halfmillion 
serious injuries each year in bicycle accidents 
members of the campaign said they were going to present a 
petition the cpsc today to require those standards 
if we are to prevent thousands of kids from being injured and 
killed each year while bicycling we must remove the barriers to 
helmet use herta feely campaign executive director said in a 
statement 
the campaign supported by the consumer federation of america 
and 34 other organizations recommends that all children and adults 
wear helmets when riding any bike 
people often dont use helmets because they feel they are not 
needed doubt their effectiveness or are confused over which ones 
to buy feely said 
until national standards are adopted bike riders should use 
helmets that have safety approval labels from the american national 
standards institute or the snell memorial foundation said campaign 
officials 
the ansi and snell standards test the ability of a helmet to 
absorb the impact of a collision conformity with either standard 
is voluntary and not all helmet manufacturers submit their 
products for testing 
bikerelated injuries and deaths have increased 27 percent over 
the last decade feely said 
martin r eichelberger campaign chairman noted that the safety 
commission has taken several steps to protect children from 
injuries and deaths from other products 
surely the federal government does not believe that brain 
trauma and permanent disability are an acceptable reality for 
americas children he said 
with this petition for a helmet standard we hope to 
demonstrate to the us congress and the bush administration the 
urgent need to reinstate the commission to its former level of 
effectiveness eichelberger said 
he said the campaign also has been working with helmet 
manufacturers to keep the price of helmets down and has reached 
agreements with bell helmets and kiwi and protec helmet 
distributors to make their products cheaper and more widely 
available

cleanup crews scoured hardened crude 
oil from beaches as federal investigators prepared to open an 
inquiry into the cause of the nations worst oil spill 
coast guard planes meanwhile crisscrossed the spill site in 
prince william sound to chart oilfree routes for fishing boats 
setting out for the halibut season today 
oil sightings will be relayed to fishermen by radio coast 
guard spokesman dennis hubbard said whatever weve got were 
using c130s helicopters whatever 
todays commerical halibut fishing is the first of several 
24hour periods that constitute the halibut season the annual 
halibut harvest in and around prince william sound has been 
estimated at 85 million 
officials already have canceled the herring season since the 
tanker exxon valdez ran aground in the sound on march 24 and 
spilled nearly 11 million gallons of crude 
the oil fouled island beaches and coastal shores in the sound 
then moved nearly 450 miles southwest of valdez to wide bay across 
from the southern end of kodiak island 
government and exxon officials plan a threeday test of a 
chemical dispersant designed to break down the beached crude and 
make it easier to retrieve the tests are to begin wednesday 
the chemical similar to a strong liquid soap will be applied 
to the beaches of ingot island in prince william sound allowed to 
soak then washed off after several hours with warm water sprayed 
from highpressure hoses 
coast guard vice adm clyde robbins said the chemical was less 
powerful than other types of dispersant the coast guard hopes the 
chemical will loosen oil from the shore and move it back into the 
water where it can be scooped up he said 
the national transportation safety board has scheduled five days 
of hearings beginning tuesday to investigate the cause of the 
spill more than two dozen witnesses are expected including coast 
guard personnel crew members from the tanker exxon valdez and 
exxon executives 
the board expects to issue a report on the accident by early 
next year spokeswoman drucella andersen said we hope to 
determine the probable cause and make some safety 
recommendations she said 
a panel of inquiry will consist of one board member to conduct 
the proceedings staff members and investigators to sift the 
evidence and representatives of each of the four parties having a 
direct interest in the proceedings 
those are the state of alaska exxon the coast guard and 
alyeska the operator of the 800milelong transalaska pipeline 
the panel chairman is lee dickenson the only transportation 
board member who will be in anchorage later in washington dc 
the full board will consider the evidence 
unlike a court of law ntsb rules specifically bar lawyers from 
posing questions instead representatives of each of the four 
parties question the witnesses directly as does dickenson 
one person who wont be at the hearings is the skipper of the 
exxon valdez joseph hazelwood 
he declined to testify but offered information in writing 
hazelwood has been charged with three misdemeanor counts that 
include operating a vessel while drunk his trial is scheduled to 
begin june 20 in valdez 
hazelwood who is free on 50000 bail faces 27 months in 
prison and 11000 in fines if convicted of the charges he also is 
the subject of an alaska grand jury investigation into the spill

close of 13580 yen the us currency opened at 13657 yen and 
moved in a range of 1365013695 yen

the governing liberal democratic party failed to persuade a 
senior lawmaker to accept the partys appointment for the 
premiership last week and it has not been able to find an

first time the dollar surpassed the 13600yen mark since sept 6

man there has cut griffiths hair a few times the snappy grill 
next door on main street really is the snappy grill 
i can die happy now i can give up the ghost said ms

deng the 84yearold paramount leader of china hugs some 
foreign dignitaries and shakes hands with others his choice of 
welcome is seen as a sign of his personal feeling toward the guest 
or their nation 
when soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze visited deng in 
shanghai last february he received a warm and lengthy handshake 
but no hug schevardnadze referred to the chinese leader as 
comrade but the socialist honorific was not returned 
of course there are some reporters who pay attention to this 
question said a bemused xing shugang a sovietologist at the 
chinese academy of social sciences they think it sets a 
standard 
xing said he places little importance on the highlevel 
greeting but for the record he expects no embraces when the two 
leaders meet tuesday 
a ministry of foreign affairs also weighed in with his opinion 
on the first encounter between deng and gorbachev the soviet 
leader will probably call deng comrade he said but i do not 
think deng will call him comrade in return 
before the final communique is issued at the end of the fourday 
summit every action by gorbachev and his chinese hosts will be 
dissected for hidden insight into the progress of the talks 
when the soviet leader arrived in beijing today president yang 
shangkun greeted him on the tarmac with a warm twohanded handshake 
but one western diplomat warned not to read too much into an 
embrace or the lack thereof 
its a bit misleading to say that deng bearhugged gorbachev 
so every thing is alright or to say deng didnt bearhug gorbachev 
so the summit is a flop he said

jin di has been on an odyssey of his own 
since fellow scholars in china asked him 10 years ago to do the 
seemingly impossible translate james joyces ulysses into 
chinese 
with few joyce scholars or books in his country to guide him 
jin has used his wanderings outside china and correspondence with 
an expert at yale to learn enough about the novel to begin to 
translate it into his native tongue 
after a year as a senior research fellow at the university of 
notre dame the 67yearold teacher of translation theory can now 
be found hunched over material from the james joyce collection at 
yales beinecke rare book and manuscript library 
he has been studying various translations to see how others in 
his field dealt with the almost scientific precision joyce used in 
telling the story of advertisementcanvassser leopold bloom 
jins translation of about a fifth of the work into chinese was 
published three years ago and a publishing house in beijing has 
agreed to publish his translation of selected portions from a 
little more than half of ulysses in 1990 
jin aspires to translate the entire book but said much 
depends on what i can do here 
there are no joyceans in china so if there are any questions 
i have nobody to discuss them with jin said one recent morning 
he will spend a semester at the university of virginia after his 
twomonth fellowship ends here at the end of may and then return 
to the foreign languages institute in tianjin where he has been a 
professor since 1977 
it was in 1979 that people at the tianjin academy of social 
sciences asked him to attempt the translation 
they thought it was outrageous this book which was so famous 
in the west was not at all known in china he said 
nobody had dared approach it both the translation and the 
reading linguistically it was almost impossible and the 
sociopolitical atmosphere had almost killed the possibility of it 
being translated into chinese he said 
jin said he hesitated when he received the request 
i didnt even know what western scholars had been doing since 
the second world war it was all a blank to us china had been 
closed to the west for 30 years he said 
he had read the work only once before in 1945 when someone 
he knew lent him a copy for a week 
i ended with some admiration of the great art of which i had 
some glimpses but i did not really understand what was in it he 
said 
jin started with one of the easier sections to translate the 
second episode in which stephen dedalus the hero of joyces first 
fulllength novel a portrait of the artist as a young man can 
be found teaching a class in roman history 
jin said he was at the point of abandoning the project when he 
met mary t reynolds a joyce scholar whose husband a yale 
economics professor was lecturing at a chinese university with 
her advice encouragement and books jin continued his project with 
renewed vigor 
ulysses which joyce wrote from 1914 through 1921 after 
having left his native dublin has been translated in its entirety 
into czech danish dutch french german hungarian japanese 
latvian spanish and swedish portions have been translated into 
greek italian and russian 
jin hopes to give his compatriots the same opportunity to enjoy 
ulysses which is the record of a single day june 16 1904 in 
and around dublin 
its really a pity that a fifth of the world cannot read this 
masterpiece

purchase of this small georgia town for 20 million makes her feel 
like barbara stanwyck in the big valley 
im big daddy now i mean im big mama i just bought me a 
town she said in an interview in junes vanity fair magazine 
ms basinger 35 bought braselton population 500 in march 
with a group of investors the town had been owned by the braselton 
family for 113 years and is near ms basingers hometown of athens 
for her money she got the towns water and sewer system an 
industrial park a shopping center a few small businesses and 
about 50 homes 
the interview did not directly address rumors that she will use 
the town as the site of a movie production company or turn it into 
a tourist center 
but ms basinger did point out that the town is 25 minutes 
from an airport its 53 miles from atlanta 
halfjoking she added see i want it to be like dollywood 
what do you think of the name kimwood 
ms basingers purchase has generated an incredible response 
from investors and developers and boosted property values said 
gary guyer the actress brotherinlaw and investment adviser 
it was strictly a business decision 100 percent business 
said guyer we had no idea there would be that much publicity 
worldwide 
you wouldnt believe the interest from developers from all 
over the world guyer said i cant see them all that land 
is already worth 30 million maybe 40 million 
the braselton family told reporters at the time of the sale they 
had had other offers in the five years the town had been up for 
sale but decided to go with ms basinger because the payment would 
be in cash other bidders had wanted 40 years to pay the deal off 
not an attractive offer for family members in their 70s 
ms basinger who has appeared in the natural and 9 
weeks described the deal differently in vanity fair 
to the younger braseltons i just put it straight i said 
these are the acres where we parked all summer long every summer

nationalist leaders in the baltic 
republics are calling on moscow to grant them economic independence 
and prosecute officials who had thousands of their countrymen 
killed or deported in the 1940s 
sixtyone of the three republics 89 deputies in the new 
congress of peoples deputies also asserted in a platform to be 
presented when the body convenes in moscow in 10 days that the 
countrys 15 republics have the right to set their own policies 
the first assembly of grassroots peoples fronts from the soviet 
republics of estonia latvia and lithuania stopped short of 
demanding overt independence for their oncesovereign homelands 
however the more than 400 activists who gathered in this 
estonian capital sunday called on moscow not to obstruct the 
restoration of state sovereignty in their homelands a wording 
some said was a legal prelude to independence 
for the first time the baltic fronts also appealed to the 
united nations and foreign governments to heed the aspirations of 
our nations to selfdetermination and independence and said their 
republics status should be resolved at the international level 
not in moscow alone 
latvian peoples front leader dinis ivans called the weekend 
gathering the two most important days in the history of the 
baltic movement 
vytautas landsbergis chairman of lithuanias sajudis mass 
movement said the assembly was a golden seed a seed which will 
feed our souls 
he said baltic deputies have agreed in principle to take the 
common position as a pledge setting the stage for creation of 
the first independent voting bloc among deputies 
they also will seek a mechanism to prevent unjust votes by 
the congress harming baltic interests landsbergis told a news 
conference that apparently means they will seeking veto power over 
legislation affecting their homelands 
the fate of latvia lithuania and estonia cannot be decided by 
a majority of deputies who have nothing to do with out countries 
he said 
on the final day of a twoday session the baltic assembly 
said president mikhail s gorbachevs drive for perestroika or 
reconstruction had failed to halt economic decline 
it asserted the right to choose the model of socioeconomic 
development balts feel is necessary apparently including 
capitalism 
the assembly rejected an economic plan advanced by moscowbased 
officials that would cede control over food and consumer products 
to the 15 soviet republics but maintain control over energy and 
more than half of heavy industry 
instead in a declaration of economic independence it called 
for baltic residents to be given complete control over their 
economies by early next year 
legislators in lithuania and estonia are to consider economic 
reform later this week an estonian draft law gives the tallinn 
government control over virtually all industries but defense 
in lithuania activists said reforms declare all resources 
property of the republic and proclaim the right to issue a 
local currency 
much of the debate over the weekend concerned the forcible 
absorption of the baltic states by josef stalin in 1940 following a 
secret deal with nazi germany 
the assembly called on the soviet government to renounce the 
molotovribbentrop pact and label stalins policy in the baltics 
genocide 
by admitting it made a deal with adolf hitler the kremlin would 
acknowledge that almost a halfcentury of rhetoric about the baltic 
states voluntary inclusion in the soviet union was a lie 
the peoples fronts called on moscow to publish a list of 
officials responsible for political killings and deportations after 
the 1940 soviet takeover and to create a court similar to the 
nuremburg tribunal that tried nazi war criminals after world war ii 
the resolution claims hundreds of thousands of baltic residents 
were killed or deported after the soviet takeover 
in four resolutions including an appeal to all congress 
deputies the 61 new baltic lawmakers called for radical 
perestroika and asserted each republics right to 
selfdetermination 
the new lawmakers branded unconstitiutional a government decree 
that provides prison terms or fines for criticizing government 
officials 
they demanded the abolition of a special graybereted police 
force created to put down demonstrations and called for a ban 
against the use of chemical agents against civilians as was done 
during the armys suppression of an april protest in soviet georgia 
twenty people were killed in the georgian unrest 
some delegates said a hardline faction of lithuanians sought a 
declaration of the baltic states right to secede from the soviet 
union but that estonians and latvians opposed it because it would 
menace gorbachevs political standing

us immigration officials stood and prayed for 
ferdinand marcos to be allowed to return to the philippines a 
videotape shows 
harold ezell western regional commissioner of the us 
immigration and naturalization service asked the officials from 
several western states to join him in the prayer during an aug 3 
party at marcos mansion overlooking honolulu the honolulu 
advertiser reported sunday 
the videotape of the threehour party also shows ezell embracing 
marcos and dancing with marcos wife imelda while ezells wife 
danced with the ousted philippine president said the newspaper 
which did not reveal the source of the videotape 
eat your heart out ezell called out as he danced with mrs 
marcos to the beat of dont throw my love away 
official us policy since marcos fled to exile here in 1986 has 
been to have philippine president corazon aquino decide if marcos 
will be allowed to return mrs aquino has repeatedly refused 
marcos requests to return home citing national security 
ezells subordinate district immigration director william 
craig said the party has turned out to be a magnificent 
blunder for the agency which he soon regretted and which caused 
him to consider resigning 
but an internal ins investigation concluded there was no 
wrongdoing and resulted in no disciplinary action craig said 
we all agreed that that was possibly lousy judgment and if we 
had to do it again no craig told the newspaper 
the marcoses and about 70 others in their entourage here are 
under craigs jurisidiction according to an agreement worked out 
by the reagan administration to bring marcos to the united states 
in october the couple was indicted on racketeering charges that 
they looted more than 100 million from the philippines to buy art 
and real estate in new york 
marcos 71 has since been hospitalized in honolulu for heart 
and respiratory ailments and prosecutors have conceded he is too 
ill to stand trial they are proceeding with criminal charges 
against mrs marcos 59 
during the party the ins officials were given plaques of 
appreciation for their work for the upliftment of philippines 
people and were given autographed copies of their photographs with 
the marcoses the advertiser said 
craig said he has tried to be evenhanded with the marcoses and 
their entourage and said there was no connection between the 
questions raised about the party and his decision to review the 
immigration status of several marcos associates 
ins officials in washington have repeatedly declined to answer 
questions about the matter the advertiser said

the dollar climbed to an 18month high against the 
yen today amid political confusion in japan while stock prices 
declined on the tokyo stock exchange 
the dollar closed at 13680 up 100 yen from fridays close of 
13580 yen it was the highest close since the 13685 yen on nov 
16 1987 the dollar now has climbed 236 yen in the past three 
trading days 
after opening at 13657 yen the dollar continued upward despite 
repeated dollar selling by japans central bank traders said it 
peaked at 13695 yen in late morning 
currency dealers attributed the dollars rise to confusion over 
the governing partys inability to find a successor to prime 
minister noboru takeshita who has announced he will resign to take 
responsibility for an influencepeddling scandal 
last week the liberal democratic party failed to persuade 
senior lawmaker masayoshi ito to head the government and so far 
has not been able to find an alternative candidate 
i would not be surprised if the dollar continued to surge 
until it hits the 140yen mark said masato sanjo a dealer for 
manufacturers hanover trust in tokyo 
until the political situation at home settles down the yen is 
likely to continue to lose ground he said 
on the tokyo stock exchange the nikkei stock average of 225 
selected issues lost 15004 points or 044 percent closing at 
3371629 it lost 21516 points on friday 
the uncertainity about prospects for the political situation 
and unstable yendollar rates apparently sidelined many investors 
today said a dealer at a major japanese brokerage speaking on 
condition that he not be further identified 
volume traded on the first section of the exchange where most 
major shares are listed was 250 million shares considerably lower 
than average 
until the fluctuation of exchange rates settles down stock 
prices are unlikely to regain upward momentum said another 
dealer for a major japanese brokerage also requesting anonymity

chander singh nimgule remembers coughing 
on the choking smell of red pepper the night of dec 2 1984 he 
also remembers his horror as a deadly gas released from a union 
carbide plant at bhopal spread 
when we got up to look there were many dead bodies around 
us the 49yearold nimgule said of the leak that killed more 
than 3300 people 
i was beginning to lose my consciousness i gave the money i 
was carrying to my wife and went to a corner so they wouldnt see 
my dying 
nimgule survived the methyl isocyanate leak but suffers from 
labored breathing and a persistent cough his two younger children 
suffer from tuberculosis 
nimgule two other victims a doctor and a translator were in 
west virginias chemical valley this weekend as part of a 
threemonth tour of the united states to protest the indian 
governments settlement of lawsuits with union carbide for 470 
million the indian government originally asked for 3 billion 
each wore bright red buttons reading bhopal settlement 
stinks while speaking saturday at west virginia state college 
nearby was a sprawling plant where union carbide once had an 
operation similar to the one in bhopal india 
the people of bhopal have rejected this settlement said 
satinath sarangi a freelance journalist who is the tour translator 
and coordinator 
union carbide has claimed a saboteur put water into a methyl 
isocyanate tank triggering a chemical reaction that spewed poison 
gas into the night air over bhopal carbide critics say the plant 
had numerous safety systems that were either broken down or poorly 
designed 
death estimates have reached as high as 10000 and indian 
doctors say 30 to 50 people die monthly because of the methyl 
isocyanate exposure more than 200000 people were injured 
the chemical company operated a sister plant to the one at 
bhopal at institute shutting down the agricultural unit for five 
months after the indian accident so it could check on plant safety 
systems and install new ones 
union carbide sold the unit to rhonepoulenc in december 1986 
when it left the agricultural products business it still operates 
other units in institute and at other sites in the kanawha valley 
where a string of more than two dozen chemical plants stand along a 
15mile stretch of the river

walters were among guests at services marking the first anniversary 
of the crash that killed 24 children and three adults aboard a 
church bus and left many of the 40 survivors with severe burns 
you relive it quite often said garnett who with his wife 
operates owen county life squad at owenton if anything it gets 
more clear as time goes on 
the bus burst into flames after colliding with a pickup that 
police said was being driven on the wrong side of interstate 71 by 
a drunken driver 
the crash occurred near carrollton about 100 miles northeast of 
radcliff the post town outside fort knox the driver of the 
pickup larry w mahoney faces trial in november on 27 counts of 
murder and one count of drunkendriving 
at a community memorial service that capped a day of 
remembrance a minister said that in some ways today is worse 
than others for the injured and families of the dead 
its the first anniversary combined with mothers day of all 
things said rev david a seamands a professor at asbury 
theological seminary in wilmore 
that first anniversary is the toughest he said just when 
you think youre getting a handle on it you get ambushed and 
that hole in your heart is as big as a canyon 
the memorial service was the last of three ceremonies sunday 
the first drawing several hundred people and the last two more than 
1000 apiece 
the first was the unveiling of a black granite monument at the 
cemetery where many of the victims were buried engraved on the 
monument are names of those who were aboard the bus 
the monument was unveiled by six children including four crash 
survivors aaron conyers 16 harold dennis 15 carey aurentz 15 
and katrina muller 14 two others were children of crash victims 
john r pearman jr whose father drove the bus and charles j 
kytta iii whose father was youth minister at the church that owned 
the bus radcliff first assembly of god 
then came a ceremony in which members of a survivingfamily 
support group thanked individuals and organizations that helped 
them in the past year 
the names of the victims were read and family members placed a 
yellow rose for each on one of 27 wreaths of yellow carnations 
gov wallace wilkinson and his wife martha then placed roses 
on a larger wreath of yellow roses and white carnations 
earlier the pastor of the radcliff church rev w don 
tennison said a prayer for laws that would make it too costly to 
get into an automobile drunk 
president bush sent a telegram that called drunken driving a 
national tragedy and said laws against it must be strictly enforced 
while reserving judgment against any individual until the 
judicial process has run its course we must guard against 
complacency about the overall problem the telegram said 
for the garnetts and ms walters of gallatin county life squad 
in warsaw it was a return visit they attended a candlelight vigil 
here in december and said they had kept in contact with the 
children they transported last may 14 
highway accidents are common in their business but the enormity 
of the carrollton crash keeps it vivid said garnett 
we may deal with a child every so often but nothing like 
that he said twentyfour kids is just overwhelming

outmanned and without reinforcements a father 
struggles valiantly for an unpopular cause on the opposite side in 
the conflict are his son and nephew 
his brother physically unable to carry on has retired from the 
fight 
no its not the latest installment of the civil war story 
north and south 
its part of the continuing saga of eastern airlines where 
father and son and in some cases husband and wife are divided 
while the carriers fate is played out in courthouses and 
boardrooms 
youve heard so much about the eastern family and 
literally thats true in many cases said company spokesman 
robin matell 
matell said the company keeps no statistics on the numbers of 
relatives among the nearly 30000 employees it had before more than 
17000 union members walked out march 4 
but easterns policy of hiring relatives has been a tradition 
unlike other corporations which bar close relatives from working 
together that difference may be contributing to the relatively 
calm atmosphere of the strike 
the unions claim texas air corp chairman frank lorenzos only 
goals since buying eastern three years ago have been to bust unions 
and strip assets from the 6decadeold airline lorenzo sought 
bankruptcy protection five days into the strike 
its a highly personalized strike in which livelihoods and 
futures are at stake but there has been virtually no violence and 
more taunting than animosity between strikers and picket 
linecrossers 
i figure everybody chose where they want to be and everybodys 
got to do what theyve got to do said steve hrytzay iii a 
striking machinist union stock clerk with nine years experience 
hes a thirdgeneration eastern employee and joins his first 
cousin jr on the picket line 
jrs father roy hrytzay heads easterns print shop his 
workforce is down to onethird its prestrike size and as in most 
company offices nonunion employees have been shifted into new jobs 
for which they have little training 
yet his shop has been busier than ever cranking out training 
manuals for new pilots and flight attendant recruits and other 
materials including a daily briefing sheet 
you wont meet a harder worker said eastern spokesman james 
ashlock roy hrytzay declined to be interviewed he is 53 a 
machinists chief steward before promoted into management 
his brother steve jr 55 retired march 1 saying high blood 
pressure and his age made retirement on the strikes eve pragmatic 
he had been secretarytreasurer of machinists district 100 
the strike hasnt caused any family friction steve hrytzay 
said just concern 
my brother and i have always been close he said i worry 
about him now because i know theyre working them long hours 
eastern pilot ron cole said the many eastern intermarriages are 
an asset in the airline business 
you are in a profession where you are away from home a lot 
cole said schedules get changed at the last minute you usually 
have to work holidays there is a lot of pressure on family life 
and it provides a better understanding of the problems if you both 
work for the airline 
cole a union activist also said the family nature of easterns 
workforce has contributed to the surprising solidarity of its

in an unusually critical statement mexico 
has urged panamas government to heed the will of its people who 
international observers say rejected the rule of gen manuel 
antonio noriega in last weeks election 
a communique issued on sunday by the foreign ministry expressed 
profound dismay over what is occurring in panama 
independent foreign observers say forces loyal to noriega rigged 
the may 7 election and that the opposition presidential candidate 
won the government nullified the election results on wednesday 
the same day pronoriega thugs beat the top three opposiition 
candidates 
the mexican foreign ministry said the events distance that 
sister country from the democratic community of latin america 
and that the situation was aggravated by a high level of 
confrontation and violence that has resulted in public violation of 
human rights 
mexico staunchly defends the priniciples of nonintervention in 
other countries and usually does not publicly criticize other 
nations 
the foreign ministers of the organization of american states are 
to meet wednesday in washington to discuss the situation in panama 
the foreign ministrys communique said the oas could defend 
democracy in the hemisphere best through support for human rights 
but could not become a court of last resort for electoral 
processes in the american countries 
it is regrettable that the panamanian situation has been 
aggravated by the personal attitude of gen noriega whose moral 
and ethical reputation is one of discredit and who until now has 
placed his personal interests over those of the panamanian 
people it said 
the statement urged panamanian officials to show proof of 
political maturity and try to solve their internal conflicts within 
the framework of respect for popular will and human civic and 
political rights of the panamanians 
the panama canal treaties under which the united states is to 
turn full control of the waterway over to panama at the end of 
1999 should be fulfilled the statement said 
noriega has claimed that washington indicted him on 
drugtrafficking charges last year and began working for his ouster 
as a pretext for justifying its planned abrogation of the treaties

sunny weather and strong legs got the city through 
a morning rush hour today despite a 24hour bus and subway strike 
that had millions of londoners finding new ways to get to work 
only 11 subway trains and 10 doubledecker buses operated during 
the morning rush hour as train operators staged an unofficial 
strike and bus drivers carried out a legal protest both were 
striking for more pay 
a sixth of the trains on british rails southern region were 
canceled because of an overtime ban by train drivers and because 
some staff were unable to get to work the railroad said 
those who came in cars found traffic heavy and slow but fears 
of horrendous traffic jams did not materialize 
i think people were expecting it to be bad and it was bad but 
we have had worse congestion said mary ann randle of the 
automobile association 
many pedestrians accustomed to letting others navigate were 
seen consulting maps or asking other walkers for directions 
the buses and subway alone account for some seven million 
passenger journeys a day

it shot suds not slugs but a handcarved 
soap pistol looked real enough to get a convicted robber a brief 
taste of freedom 
roy kenneth sanford 23 was captured sunday while walking in a 
pecan grove south of perry said houston county sheriff cullen 
talton 
sanford escaped saturday after he pulled what looked like a 
semiautomatic weapon on three guards and ordered another inmate to 
open a cellblock door 
at first glance it looked like the real thing talton said 
of course when you looked close you could tell it wasnt 
he even used an eye from a shoe like you run shoelaces 
through to make the barrel look real we recovered the gun 
too 
the gun had been carved from two bars of soap and painted black 
talton said 
sanford serving time for armed robbery and kidnapping was also 
one of seven inmates who escaped the houston county jail two months

an anticorruption crusader today defeated more 
than two dozen other candidates to win a parliamentary seat despite 
running afoul of the kremlin for associating top government 
officials with a corruption probe 
preliminary returns showed criminal investigator nikolai ivanov 
won 61 percent of the vote in leningrad said lyudmilla imanenko 
deputy head of the tass news agency in the countrys secondlargest 
city 
in sundays second round of voting for 198 remaining seats in 
the 2250member congress of peoples deputies ivanov was pitted 
against more than two dozen other candidates to represent leningrad 
the congress created by president mikhail s gorbachev 
convenes on may 25 and will chose the president and a new sitting 
legislature or supreme soviet 
ivanov and his partner telman gdlyan are known throughout the 
soviet union for a lengthy probe of corruption in the republic of 
uzbekistan gdlyan won a parliamentary seat in the first march 26 
vote receiving almost 87 percent of ballots in a moscow district 
but ivanov ran afoul of the kremlin in the last days of his 
campaign by saying in a debate televised in leningrad that the 
names of politburo member yegor k ligachev and other top officials 
came up in his continuing corruption probe 
in the eastern ukrainian city kharkov officials said 
preliminary data showed editor vitaly korotich of the 
reformoriented ogonyok magazine had easily defeated nine other 
candidates with 80 percent of the vote 
strong showings by ivanov korotich and reform candidates in the 
restive baltic republics continued a trend set in the march 
elections which favored reformist and antiestablishment 
candidates 
that ballot was the first nationwide multicandidate election in 
the soviet union in 70 years 
in estonia klara hallik a lecturer and expert on ethnic 
relations at tallinn polytechnical institute won 5074 percent of 
the vote she was backed by the estonian peoples front 
in neighboring latvia voters handed reformer maveriks vulfsons 
a narrow victory in a riga district peoples front officials in 
the republic said their candidates won five of the six races there 
voters in kiev narrowed a slate of 33 candidates to two 
economist vladimir chernyak a leader of the ukrainian peoples 
front will face editor vitaly karpenko of the official newspaper 
vecherny kiev in a third vote said local election official lydia 
voronova 
the peoples front grassroots movements seek economic 
independence from moscow 
in moscow olympic weightlifting champion yuri vlasov was 
seeking a seat from the lublinsky region reformist playwright 
mikhail shatrov and afghanistan war hero alexander rudskoy were 
among the candidates in the kuntsovsky district 
in the religious center zagorsk wellknown news commentator 
alexander bovin and conservative editor anatoly ivanov were among 
the candidates 
in the march elections voters embarrassed dozens of local 
communist party and government officials in leningrad kiev moscow 
and other major cities 
most of those who lost in march did not run again 
the new parliament will choose the president and a new sitting 
legislature or supreme soviet but many of its functions and 
procedures have yet to be decided 
repeat elections were held in 195 districts where voters were 
given a choice of only one or two candidates on march 26 and 
refused to elect anyone 
in three districts of armenia elections were held sunday 
because fewer than half the voters went to the polls in march 
ivanov and gdlyan became national heroes last summer when an 
article they wrote for korotichs magazine led to a dramatic 
confrontation on nationwide television korotich handed gorbachev a 
list of delegates to the june communist party conference who were 
implicated in bribery 
but recently the kremlin has come down hard on the prosecutors 
the leadership of the supreme soviet attacked the two in a 
statement published election eve in the communist party daily 
pravda accusing them of trying to interfere in the work of a 
specially formed commission looking into complaints about their 
investigative practices

tamil guerrillas bombed a military 
truck killing 10 indian peacekeeping soldiers in the northern 
jaffna peninsula sri lankan military officials said today 
one guerrilla was killed and two were wounded when survivors of 
the sunday night attack opened fire said officials who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
meanwhile the extremist sinhalese peoples liberation front 
denied reports its leader is ill and seeking government permission 
to go abroad for treatment 
tamil civilians in vavuniya quoted travelers as saying the tamil 
tiger guerrillas set off a remotecontrolled bomb when the indian 
soldiers truck reached mirusuvil east of jaffna the town is 
nearly 200 miles north of the capital colombo 
they said the dead man was a local leader of the liberation 
tigers of tamil eelam 
the vavuniya residents said three civilians also were killed 
when their bus was caught in the crossfire but military officials 
said they know of no civilian deaths 
on saturday at least 12 indian soldiers and 18 tamil rebels 
were killed in fighting near nedunkernie 45 miles southeast of 
mirusuvil an indian high commission spokeswoman said on condition 
of anonymity 
tamil guerrillas have been fighting since 1983 for a separate 
homeland in northern and eastern sri lanka where they form a 
majority of the population since then at least 9000 people have 
died mostly sinhalese civilians massacred by the separatists 
attacks on civilians have tapered off since the tigers largest of 
the guerrills groups opened peace talks with the government this 
month 
indian peacekeepers were sent to sri lanka in july 1987 to 
enforce a peace accord but the guerrillas after initially 
accepting the accord reneged and began attacking indians 
tamils say the predominantly buddhist sinhalese who comprise 75 
percent of sri lankas 16 million people discriminate against 
them like indians most tamils are hindu 
the government peace overtures have prompted a backlash among 
extremist sinhalese such as the peoples liberation front who say 
too many concessions have been made officials blame front 
guerrillas for the deaths of 3500 people mostly sinhalese 
government officials and supporters since 1987 
on monday colombo newspapers received a front statement denying 
its leader rohana wijeweera wants to seek medical treatment in 
britain 
wijeweera 46 reportedly suffered a heart attack recently 
on thursday a british broadcasting corp correspondent in 
colombo said he received two telephone calls from a front member 
who said his group was ready to begin peace talks if wijeweera was 
allowed to travel to london for medical treatment

a judge gave amherst college the cold 
shoulder tossing out a lawsuit that tried to halt an annual 
snowball fight between students at amherst and the nearby 
university of massachusetts 
hampshire superior court judge john f moriarty said it was 
beyond the powers of a court comprised only of human judges to 
keep students from engaging in hijinks 
amherst had asked the court to order the university of 
massachusetts to keep its 25000 students from throwing snowballs 
at those attending the private college which has 1500 students 
they contended that the snow battle has led to vandalism and 
several thousand dollars of damage to college property an amherst 
student was hospitalized last december after being hit in the eye 
with an icy missile 
in a decision filed friday moriarty said it was beyond the 
powers of the court to stop criminal acts before they take place 
also he added most university students are technically 
adults although at least some of them obviously retain juvenile 
propensity so not even their parents can be held responsible 
for their offcampus antics 
umass chancellor joseph duffey called the verdict literate and 
written with a bit of whimsy and said it was the kind of classic 
document every college administrator should have framed and hung on 
the wall

here are excerpts from the toasts of soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev and chinese president yang shangkun 
at a state banquet tonight in the great hall of the people 
gorbachev 
the way toward this meeting was not an easy one it required 
from both sides wisdom responsibility and perseverance in removing 
the negative aggravations and prejudices that marred our relations 
for so many years 
the current decade has unveiled chinas new image to the world 
soviet people applaud and understand the enthusiasm that impels 
your country in its desire for modernization in all spheres of 
social life 
the strides toward industrialization transformation of agrarian 
relations releasing of the peoples consciousness and initiative 
enrichment of the intellectual culture of the chinese society all 
this has been brought about by bold and farreaching reforms which 
are followed with keen interest all over the world 
we wish the leaders and the people of china every success in 
resolving the problems they face in this path and ensuring steady 
progress of their socialist motherland 
socialism is entering a new stage in its development where full 
use will be made of its creative potential 
but it is no less true the world remains fragile and vulnerable 
the risk of an ecological disaster is growing since nature is 
no longer capable of neutralizing the waste of the technological 
civilization and needs urgent help 
there remains a most pressing problem of eliminating hunger and 
poverty of overcoming the economic underdevelopment of many 
countries 
humanity is now at a crossroads the next few years will be 
critical in determining whether humanity will be able to travel 
along the road of light and to curb the looming threats or 
civilization will slide toward its end 
we believe in a happy outcome in a better future 
both the soviet union and china are independent in terms of 
decisionmaking each has its own priorities our views are not 
always identical yet there exists a broad area in which such 
interaction is both possible and appropriate the improvement 
of sovietchinese relations is not directed against any third 
country in the final analysis the entire world community stands 
to gain from that improvement

and since then china has undergone great changes 
despite various difficulties twists and turns we may still 
encounter on our road of advance we are confident that we will 
overcome all difficulties free ourselves from poverty and 
backwardness and attain our anticipated goals so long as we adhere 
to leadership by the communist party and to the socialist road 
persist in reform and the open policy and continue to blaze new 
trails by relying on the united struggle of the chinese people 
the chinese people have followed your reform with interest and 
wish you success

president bush is unveiling a package of 
anticrime proposals that include a permanent ban on imports of 
semiautomatic assaultstyle rifles a crackdown on criminals using 
guns and 1 billion for new prisons officials say 
bushs crimefighting package which he was to announce in a 
speech on the capitol steps today is focused on tougher treatment 
of criminals through increased enforcement efforts and stiffer 
sentences 
he also has decided to make permanent a temporary suspension he 
imposed in march that stopped semiautomatic assaultstyle rifles 
from coming into the country officials said in advance of the 
address 
the weapons banned will be those that have come to be used for 
criminal rather than sporting purposes as determined by an ongoing 
review by the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms said an 
agency official who declined to be identified 
current law provides that only sporting weapons can be imported 
but the standards now will be tightened and enforced to exclude 
that many previously allowed in will be excluded the official said 
other administration sources have said bush is calling for a 
death penalty for drug kingpins a position he advocated in his 
election campaign last year and for those who commit terrorist 
acts against americans abroad 
bush also is seeking 1 billion from congress for prison 
construction and enlargement enough to provide capacity for up to 
29000 new prisoners deputy white house chief of staff andrew card 
jr said sunday 
the 1 billion would be spent over the next four years 
officials said bush also is asking for more money for law 
enforcement officers and prosecutors and will advocate stiffened 
penalties for those who use guns use of assaultstyle weapons 
would bring even harsher sentences 
included in the plan is money for 375 additional atf agents 300 
fbi agents and 150 deputy us marshals 
but the most intense attention has focused on whether the 
president would extend the suspension of imports of the 
semiautomatic rifles the guns are a favorite of street criminals 
becoming more prevalent especially in drugrelated crimes but some 
models are used by hunters as well according to gun owners 
card said that while the president was still reviewing the final 
package his speech at todays ceremony honoring slain police 
officers would state an intention to make that import ban permanent 
card said the president would advocate a hard look at 
restricting domestically produced weapons many of which are 
virtually identical to the banned imports but the president 
apparently decided not to ban sales in the domestic market at this 
point 
bush on march 14 imposed a temporary ban on imported 
assaultstyle weapons including sovietdeveloped ak47s and 
israelimade uzis 
he launched a survey by the bureau of alcohol tobacco and 
firearms to review whether any of these weapons are imported for 
sporting purposes under current law that is the only permissible 
reason for which they can enter the country the review is to be 
completed in about midjune 
card told reporters in lexington ky as bush prepared to 
return to the capital after a threeday swing through texas and 
mississippi that the review would determine which of the models 
would be permanently barred 
well see what definitions these weapons fall under said 
card 
the definition issue promises to be a sticky one especially 
since many of the imports have the same characteristics as 
domestically produced rifles 
during his 1988 presidential campaign bush called for 
converting unneeded military bases into state and federal prisons 
and for using money seized from drug dealers to help pay for 
additional prison space proposals also expected to be reflected 
in the new package 
the crime problem is not easily solved by one bill alone 
card said well also be looking for the states to do some 
things this is not the doall and endall this is just a 
significant beginning 
bush returned to washington on sunday morning after attending 
church in versailles ky he spoke at graduations friday and 
saturday in texas and mississippi 
in kentucky he spoke at a 13 million dinner saturday night 
for gop sen mitch mcconnells 1990 reelection 
bush also during the trip issued a call to the people and 
national defense forces of panama to rise up and oust that 
countrys ruler gen manuel antonio noriega 
bush stopped short of specifically calling for a coup but said 
the panamanians should get noriega out 
the bush administration has denounced noriega for rigging last 
sundays election and when noriega nullified it accused him of 
throwing away the results because his candidate lost despite the 
fraud

about 3000 students on a hunger strike camped in 
tiananmen square for a third day today forcing chinese authorities 
to change welcoming ceremonies for soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev 
about 140000 supporters of the hunger strikers crowded into the 
square officials met with more than 50 students but protest 
leaders said the delegation did not represent the demonstrators 
yan mingfu a member of the ruling communist party central 
committee secretariat told students at the meeting that the 
monthlong movement was patriotic but said there has been a 
negative impact on the dignity of the country according to the 
official xinhua news agency 
the students who met with officials were from statesanctioned 
unions which have been rejected by the prodemocracy student 
movement 
students at tiananmen said the officials made no promises before 
the talks broke off after three hours 
we have no choice but to continue the hunger strike until the 
government gives in said a student leader from the northern 
communications college 
the students reported over a loudspeaker in tiananmen that 
70000 of 220000 workers at the capital steel plant went on strike 
today in support of the prodemocracy movement 
they carried signs saying they would do their best to 
support the students said a beijing medical union student 
the students had hoped to pressure the government into 
concessions by threatening to disrupt a welcoming ceremony for 
gorbachev who arrived today for the first chinesesoviet summit in 
30 years 
but when it became clear the square could be cleared only with 
force the ceremony was held at the airport instead of at the great 
hall of the people beside the plaza 
most of the students who admire gorbachevs domestic reform 
campaign moved to the opposite side of the vast square early today 
in deference but they refused to leave altogether and new groups 
of students and several dozen teachers joined them throughout the 
day 
maybe i will set myself on fire one sobbing female 
hungerstriker screamed into a loudspeaker that the strikers ran 
off car batteries 
the decision to move gorbachevs welcome clearly embarrassed the 
government but also indicated its determination not to give in to 
student demands 
about 80 of the 1800 students who began to fast on saturday 
afternoon in the shadeless square had been taken to hospitals 
suffering from dehydration sunstroke and exposure said doctors 
who stood by with ambulances 
medical students handed out glucose salt tablets and packets of 
traditional chinese medicine to strikers who felt faint 
water and salt supplies were running short the medics said and 
they issued urgent appeals for money 
the strikers spirits were raised in the afternoon by the 
appearance of several thousand intellectuals led by beijing 
university teachers and including writers and scholars 
long live the teachers students yelled you give us 
infinite strength 
one 44yearold chemistry teacher said we think the students 
have raised reasonable requests and we think the government should 
have a dialogue with them as equals 
he said 90 percent of the universitys teachers back the student 
movement the biggest ever to confront the communist government 
the hunger strikers were surrounded by nearly 30000 supporting 
students from more than two dozen beijing schools thousands of 
local residents flooded the square and some gave speeches of 
support 
students have been marching and holding sitins marches and 
class boycotts since april 15 to demand democracy in their 
authoritarian nation 
hundreds of police moved into public buildings around the square 
throughout the day but did not reemerge to confront the crowd 
hungerstrike leaders said they had not been in contact with 
authorities since talks broke down sunday night 
the government has rejected student demands to recognize the 
organizations and broadcast the discussions 
the students want a dialogue on the governments failure to 
enforce constitutional guarantees of free speech and press on 
economic and political reforms and on a reevaluation of the 
student movement 
officials of the beijing institute of science and technology 
arrived with wicker baskets of steamed bread for those students not 
hunger striking 
most of the strikers lay on the ground or sat propped against 
each other smoking reading and sleeping 
my stomach doesnt hurt anymore its numb said a student 
from the central nationalities institutes english department

the army today blew up or sealed 13 houses of 
palestinians suspected of killing alleged collaborators with israel 
or attacking soldiers and police in the west bank 
the move came a day after the cabinet voted 206 to approve a 
plan for elections in the occupied west bank and gaza strip to 
choose palestinian representatives for talks with israel on an 
interim settlement 
prime minister yitzhak shamir considers the plan a step toward 
permanent peace but many palestinians criticize it for not linking 
balloting to the eventual creation of an independent palestinian 
state 
in the occupied lands palestinians observed a general strike 
today to protest the displacement of more than 600000 palestinians 
after israel was founded on may 15 1948 
in the west bank village of beita residents stoned seven jewish 
settler who were hiking the army said the settlers fled to a 
nearby hill and repeatedly fired in the air before soldiers rescued 
them no injuries were reported 
settler leader benny katzover charged mondays hikers showed too 
much restraint they had five guns the fact that no arabs were 
wounded is a sign of weakness katzover said on israel radio 
also monday new army figures showed 61 palestinians have been 
killed by plastic bullets since the ammunition was introduced in 
august 
gen ehud barak the army deputy chief of staff was quoted by 
israel radio as saying the plastic bullets helped reduce the number 
of palestinians killed in army gunfire from 204 in the first eight 
months of the uprising to 151 in the following eight months 
the associated press has counted 474 palestinian deaths most 
when israeli soldiers fired on stonethrowers since the rebellion 
began in december 1987 twentyone israelis also have died 
in the west bank the army blew up six houses today in the city 
of nablus the refugee camps of balata and arrub and the village 
of deir nidham troops sealed four houses in nablus and three in 
hebron 
the homeowners in nablus were accused of killing two alleged 
collaborators the army said arabs have killed more than 40 
palestinians in the uprising 
suspects in arrub allegedly fired at an army unit in february 
1988 but the bullets struck a local woman who died of her wounds 
the deir nidham man allegedly stabbed and injured a border police 
officer in february 
western nations including the united states have condemned 
house demolitions and sealings as a violation of the right to due 
process because punishment usually comes before suspects are tried 
an army spokeswoman could not say what legal proceedings were 
being taken against those whose houses were destroyed or sealed 
today 
more than 170 houses have been demolished and more than 70 
others sealed during the uprising according to army figures 
maj gen amram mitzna army commander of the west bank 
defended the practice 
these are murder gangs and some of them got their orders from 
outside to carry out murders of people considered to be helping 
israel he said on israel radio we wont allow this to happen 
we will punish them severely 
in southern israel meanwhile additional police were deployed 
to prevent attacks on palestinians from the gaza strip driving to 
their jobs in the israeli coastal cities of ashkelon and ashdod 
hundreds of israelis from the two cities in the past week have 
stoned arabowned cars to avenge the slaying of an army sergeant 
and the disappearance of a second soldier both blamed on 
palestinians 
on sunday three masked assailants entered an ashkelon bakery 
and beat two palestinian workers who were hospitalized briefly

the supreme court today agreed to resolve a 
dispute stemming from the federal governments efforts to protect 
american workers from hazardous chemicals 
the court said it will hear the bush administrations argument 
that a federal appeals court wrongly required that additional 
information be supplied to employees 
at the same time the justices turned away arguments by 
nonmanufacturing employers that labeling and other 
employeeeducation requirements were imposed improperly on them 
the reagan administration in 1983 published a final standard for 
evaluating and communicating chemical hazards to employees in the 
manufacturing sector 
after the philadelphiabased 3rd us circuit court of appeals 
ruled that the standard was applied too narrowly government 
regulators applied it in 1987 to nonmanufacturing employers as 
well from drycleaners to the construction industry 
the standard requires chemical manufacturers and importers to 
label chemical containers and send safety information to all 
customers those customers are required to ensure that the 
container labels remain affixed to make safety information 
accessible to employees in their work areas 
employers also are required to prepare a written 
hazardcommunications program that among other things contains a 
list of the hazardous chemicals used in the workplace and to train 
employees on the proper use of such chemicals 
several of the provisions in the 1987 standard were disapproved 
by the office of management and budget which reviewed the standard 
under the paperwork reduction act of 1980 
but the 3rd circuit court later ruled that omb was unauthorized 
to disapprove of any provisions in the standard the appeals court 
restored the 1987 standard to the form in which it was issued 
in two appeals denied review today the associated general 
contractors of america the construction industry trade 
association the national grain amp feed association and other 
employers contended that the occupational safety and health 
administration improperly extended the hazardcommunication 
standard to nonmanufacturers 
in a third appeal federal regulators argued that the appeals 
court wrongly limited ombs authority to revise the standard it 
was the only appeal granted review making the high courts review 
a narrow one 
sweeping new standards for worker exposure to nearly 400 
hazardous materials took effect earlier this year in the first 
overhaul since passage of the occupational safety and health act 17 
years ago 
the new standards cover about 21 million american workers 
the cases are associated general contractors vs osha 881070

the supreme court today agreed to review a 
ruling that makes it easier for disabled children to win some 
federal welfare benefits 
the justices said they will hear a bush administration appeal 
aimed at overturning a ruling that could force the government to 
reevaluate benefits for more than 250000 children 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals last august ruled in favor 
of disabled children seeking supplemental security income benefits 
from the department of health and human services 
the benefits are provided to the disabled of all ages 
an adult is considered disabled if he or she is unable to 
engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any 
medically determinable physical or mental impairment lasting at 
least a year 
children under 18 are considered disabled if they suffer from 
any medically determinable physical or mental impairment of 
comparable severity 
the philadelphiabased 3rd circuit court said the definitions 
were being interpreted by hhs in a way that illegally made it more 
difficult for children to qualify 
the appeals court said that if an adults medical condition does 
not meet one of those listed in hhs regulations he or she is 
entitled to an individual assessment to determine the extent of the 
functional impairment 
the hhs rules do not permit such individual determinations for 
children the appeals court said 
if a childs medical findings do not meet or equal the 
listings the child may not be found to be disabled regardless of 
the severity of the actual impairment the appeals court found 
it ordered hhs to revise the rules to give children the 
opportunity for individual evaluations comparable to those for 
adults 
administration lawyers said treating adults differently makes 
sense because they are evaluated with regard to their ability to 
work 
the appeals court ruling was triggered initially by the case of 
brian zebley a pennsylvania boy who suffers from congenital brain 
damage that has caused retardation and other problems the 
government cut off his supplemental benefits when brian turned 4 in 
1982 
legal papers submitted to the high court did not list a hometown 
for the boy 
government lawyers said the 3rd circuit court ruling has broad 
impact because the case has been turned into a classaction lawsuit 
potentially involving disabled children nationwide 
the governments appeal said the appeals court ruling could 
force hhs to reevaluate more than 250000 cases in which children 
have been denied benefits between 1983 and 1988 hhs estimates the 
cost of the reevaluations alone would be more than 41 million 
the case is sullivan vs zebley 881377

six people convicted of trespass for their 
participation in a 1986 protest demonstration at a houston abortion 
clinic lost a supreme court appeal today 
the justices without comment turned away arguments that state 
courts wrongly refused to consider as a defense that the trespass 
was justified to protect fetal life 
the appeal sought among other things the overturning of the 
courts 1973 roe vs wade decision which said women have a 
constitutional right to abortion 
the justices already have under study a missouri 
abortionregulation case in which they are being asked to reverse 
or substantially limit the landmark 1973 ruling 
in the case acted on today james c bobo margaret fall harper 
david ray marshall marjorie nelson leon spivey and john d white 
were convicted of criminal trespass in connection with a sept 20 
1986 demonstration at the west loop clinic in houston 
in all 18 people were arrested for chaining the clinics front 
door from the inside blocking an emergency exit with a van 
chaining themselves to waiting room chairs and refusing to leave 
until police came three hours after their entry 
the protesters sang chanted banged on the walls and prayed 
during the demonstration 
the six protesters who appealed were sentenced to probated jail 
terms and fined from 650 to 1000 
the justices previously have rejected similar appeals by 
antiabortion protesters who have participated in various 
rescues at abortion clinics in other states 
the case is bobo vs texas 881536

the supreme court today refused to hear an 
appeal by two sioux indian tribes seeking land they surrendered to 
the federal government 121 years ago 
the court without comment rejected arguments that the tribes 
were forced illegally in 1987 to accept financial compensation for 
the land given up in 1868 
the tribes contend that the 1987 settlement was agreed to by a 
lawyer who no longer represented them 
the sioux indian nation signed an 1868 treaty with the 
government giving up land in north and south dakota nebraska 
wyoming and montana 
by 1890 the sioux had split into a number of different tribes 
today there are eight tribes 
the tribes asked the indian claims commission in 1950 for 
compensation for the land they had surrendered 
after 30 years of administrative and legal proceedings the 
commission awarded the sioux 439 million but that award did not 
end the case 
left to be decided was how much money the government could 
deduct for compensation already paid to the tribes 
the us claims court in 1987 accepted a stipulation of facts 
that reduced the money owed the sioux by 37 million the sum 
included 27 million the government had paid for the land plus 
expenditures for education food and other provisions 
agreeing to the stipulation on behalf of the sioux was arthur 
lazarus a district of columbia lawyer who had represented the 
tribes since their claim was filed in 1950 
the two largest tribes the oglala sioux and the rosebud sioux 
protested that they had not renewed their contract with lazarus and 
that he no longer represented them 
they said they did not give their consent to the 37 million 
stipulation 
but the us claims court remarking that the tribes wanted land 
and not money rejected efforts by the two tribes to withdraw from 
the overall 402 million settlement 
it is too late in the game to do this now the claims court 
said 
a federal appeals court here upheld the claims court ruling last 
november we agree with the claims court that in these 
circumstances the tribes were required to do something more than 
not renew their attorneys contracts if they wished to terminate 
their attorneys authority to represent them the appeals court 
said 
the two tribes noting that lazarus and other lawyers who worked 
with him were awarded 42 million in legal fees said they should 
have the opportunity to be represented by the attorney of their 
choice 
the bush administration urged the supreme court to reject the 
two tribes appeal if the tribes did not want lazarus to 
represent them and to engage in ordinary activities on their behalf 
such as agreeing to factual stipulations they should have retained 
separate counsel earlier justice department lawyers said 
the case is oglala sioux vs us 881380

a high school drill team instructor faces a 
reprimand or dismissal after allegedly baring her breasts to female 
students to demonstrate the results of augmentation surgery the 
principal said 
we have taken appropriate action said james king principal 
of northbrook senior high school he said only that the school 
district had made a recommendation to deal with complaints against 
instructor danette arrington 
but a northbrook teacher who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the drill team students were told friday that ms arrington 
would not be returning to school 
there was no immediate comment from ms arrington she has an 
unlisted telephone number she told the houston chronicle she would 
have no comment 
ms arrington who has instructed the drill team and taught 
associated dance classes at northbrook for two years told 
officials she had a valid reason for showing her breasts to three 
classes of drill team students on may 8 
spring branch superintendent hal guthrie said ms arrington 
reportedly was explaining her breast augmentation surgery to her 
class 
she had a close relationship with the students and apparently 
decided to discuss this with them he said 
you know how kids are said the teacher who spoke 
anonymously they said she did it because they asked her to 
guthrie said the district believes in strong communication 
with our students but the incident as described to me goes beyond 
what the school district is willing to accept 
king said he had talked with drill team members and their 
parents in checking out complaints 
the teacher who spoke anonymously said many faculty members are 
upset about the incident because they think it reflects poorly on 
their profession 
i just couldnt believe that she did that in a school 
setting she said

thousands of peronists danced in 
the streets early today to celebrate carlos menems election to the 
presidency the return to power of the party of labor and the 
working poor 
sundays election marked argentinas first transfer of power 
between civilian governments in 61 years and capped a long comeback 
for the populist peronists who had been banned for 25 of the past 
34 years 
with 90 percent of the vote counted menem received 7206916 
or 472 percent to the 5663175 or 37 percent garnered by 
menems strongest competitor eduardo angeloz of the ruling radical 
civic union there were 12 candidates in all 
those votes earned menem 309 of the 600 electoral college votes 
eight more than needed according to projections by the independent 
news agency diarios y noticias 
angeloz menems former law school classmate conceded defeat 
ive defeated an adversary but ive regained a friend 
menem said 
menem the charismatic 58yearold governor of la rioja 
province called for national unity immediately after declaring 
victory 
the campaign had been divisive and he must cope with a country 
in economic decline and a restive military 
i am not more capable than anyone else but im not less 
capable menem said the important thing is to get the country 
moving 
the interior ministry estimated that 82 percent of the 20 
million eligible voters cast ballots 
voters also chose a vice president half the members of the 
chamber of deputies one senator legislatures in 14 of the 
nations 22 provinces and several thousand municipal officials 
in sunday elections peronists took 66 of the 127 seats at stake 
in the national chamber of deputies and with 124 seats total 
peronists were just four seats short of a majority according to 
diarios y noticias 
the peronists already control the biggest bloc in the senate and 
most provincial legislatures and governorships 
the presidential inauguration was set for dec 10 the last day 
of the sixyear term of president raul alfonsin who is barred by 
the constitution from seeking reelection 
alfonsin took office in december 1983 ending a brutal military 
dictatorship that lasted nearly eight years

all the luck possible i leave defeated but will continue 
working in my province and later ill see what i can do on the 
national level 
voting was calm and orderly in the south american nation of 31

but there were no charges of fraud 
polls had predicted that the centerleft peronist party would 
win party supporters danced in the streets outside menems 
campaign headquarters in buenos aires even before victory was 
assured 
menem who encourages people to call him carlitos is 
extremely popular among the working class 
menem and angeloz had offered different proposals for how 
argentina once one of the worlds wealthiest nations might 
overcome a chronic budget deficit tripledigit inflation high 
unemployment and a 59 billion foreign debt 
menem pledged to dramatically improve wages and said he might 
negotiate to suspend payments on the foreign debt 
he has spoken vaguely of a productive revolution and 
social pact to spur employment slash the budget deficit raise 
the value of the national currency and curtail inflation 
angeloz the candidate of the middle class pledged to sell 
inefficient state industries maintain a free exchange rate spur 
exports and diminish the power of the 4 millionstrong general 
labor confederation union the cornerstone of the peronist party 
elements in the armed forces have staged three insurrections 
against alfonsin menem endorsed the concept of reconciliation 
but said he would not pardon officers convicted of human rights 
abuses for their actions during the 197683 military dictatorships 
dirty war on leftist subversion or block pending trials of 
other officers 
the peronist party was founded by gen juan domingo peron who 
came to power in 1946 and was ousted by a military coup in 1955 
the military banned the party and jailed or exiled many of its 
leaders until 1973 when peron returned from spain and was elected 
by an overwhelming margin 
following his death on july 1 1974 his wife isabel took over 
as president she was deposed by a coup in march 1976 and the 
military rulers jailed menem

an oklahoma couple sentenced to two years in 
prison for their ill childs death because they relied on prayer 
and divine intervention rather than seek medical care lost a 
supreme court appeal today 
the justices without comment turned away arguments that kevin 
and jamie ann funkhouser of purcell okla wrongly were convicted 
of seconddegree manslaughter 
the funkhousers threemonthold son benjamin died july 15 
1983 at home he had been ill for about two weeks but his parents 
did not seek medical attention for the boy 
they are members of the church of the first born which relies 
on divine intervention for healing sickness to the exlusion of 
medical assistance elders twice visited the sick child to pray for 
him and anoint him with oil 
the funkhousers each were convicted and sentenced to two years 
in prison according to court records they began serving the terms 
last dec 28 
unlike previous similar appeals rejected by the nations highest 
court the funkhousers appeal did not argue that their prosecution 
and conviction violated religious freedom 
the funkhousers instead argued that they were denied a fair 
trial and deprived of equalprotection and dueprocess rights 
because they were charged with seconddegree and not firstdegree 
manslaughter 
oddly enough they had sought to be prosecuted for firstdegree 
manslaughter a more serious crime the reason the availablity of 
a key defense 
under oklahoma law a parent charged with firstdegree 
manslaughter cannot be convicted of failing to provide medical 
treatment for a child if instead the parent in good faith selects 
and depends on spiritual means alone through prayer 
but the oklahoma court of criminal appeals ruled in the 
funkhousers case that a parent charged with seconddegree 
manslaughter is justified in failing to provide medical care for a 
child only if such religious reliance is something which a 
reasonably careful person would do under similar circumstances and 
conditions 
lawyers for the funkhousers said the instructions jurors 
received containing the reasonably careful person wording not 
included in firstdegree manslaughter cases obliterated the 
defense 
the case is funkhouser vs oklahoma 881541

the supreme court today rejected an appeal by 
a massachusetts newspaper barred from seeing a court document 
during a muchpublicized murder prosecution 
the justices without comment let stand a state court decision 
that keeping the document secret did not violate the publics 
constitutional right of access in criminal trials there was no 
recorded dissent 
raymond green a supervisor at the belchertown state school in 
rural western massachusetts was murdered on the school campus aug 
4 1986 there was no arrest in the case for 11 months 
kenneth phoenix a school employee was arrested july 3 1987 
on murder charges state police searched phoenixs belchertown home 
that same day 
after phoenix was arraigned in court but before he was formally 
indicted a reporter for the transcripttelegram a newspaper 
published by newspapers of new england inc in holyoke mass 
asked to see the search warrant and supporting police affidavit 
a state judge agreed to release the warrant that was issued 
allowing police to search phoenixs home but she impounded the 
16page affidavit in which police offered justification for the 
search 
a state appeals court upheld that order after the 
transcripttelegram appealed and the massachusetts supreme 
judicial court ruled last dec 22 that the judge had acted properly 
although acknowledging the affidavit is a public document and 
the public has a right to attend criminal trials the state court 
said the affidavit in question has no integral relationship with 
any particular pretrial proceeding to which the public enjoys a 
first amendment right of access 
the state court also said releasing the affidavit at the time 
the newspaper sought it could have jeopardized phoenixs right to a 
fair trial 
no constitutionally guaranteed right to access to the 
affidavit existed at the time the plaintiff requested it and the 
district court judge did not abuse her discretion in impounding the 
affidavit the state court ruled 
noting that phoenix already had been convicted by the time of 
its ruling the state supreme judicial court ordered that the 
affidavit be made public it subsquently was released 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for the newspaper said 
release of the document did not make its constitutional challenge 
moot 
the dispute over the right to inspect affidavits in support of 
search warrants is not only capable but likely of repetition the 
appeal said 
it added the decision in this action leaves the public with 
no constitutionally guaranteed right of access to important 
judicial proceedings 
but massachusetts prosecutors urged the justices to reject the 
appeal 
search warrant affidavits are generally available to the press 
and the public they said although occasions will continue to 
arise where particular affidavits are temporarily impounded to

the supreme court today refused to free puerto 
rico officials from paying 126 million to two companies involved 
in an abandoned housing project in the island commonwealth 
the court without comment turned down arguments by 
commonwealth officials that the lawsuit against them should be 
thrown out 
compania de desarrollo cooperativo cdc a public agency 
created by the puerto rico government to help finance cooperative 
projects was ordered to pay the money to usi properties co and md 
construction co 
under agreements in 1978 usi properties sold land to md 
construction for a housing project called ciudad cristiana cdc 
agreed to help finance the construction and to sell the houses to 
individual buyers 
after 480 of the proposed units were completed in 1982 cdc cut 
off financing the agency said the land was contaminated with 
mercury and commonwealth officials in 1985 ordered the area 
evacuated 
a federal jury ordered cdc to pay 12 million to usi properties 
and 114 million to md construction 
the verdict followed a complex series of legal maneuvers in 
which usi properties sued both md construction and cdc in federal 
court 
the puerto rico agency said usi properties should not have been 
allowed to sue md construction in federal court because the two 
companies were in fact partners in litigation on the same side 
of the dispute 
usi properties was allowed to sue md construction in federal 
court rather than in commonwealth court in puerto rico on 
grounds the two companies were incorporated or had main offices in 
different jurisdictions 
cdc argued that usi properties main place of business is puerto 
rico but a federal judge ruled that the companys main office is 
in new york because it has administrative offices there 
therefore the federal judge said usi properties could sue md 
construction based in puerto rico in federal court rather than in 
puerto ricos commonwealth court 
the judge also rejected charges that usi properties and md 
construction were in collusion in the lawsuit the 1st us circuit 
court of appeals upheld that ruling last october 
the case is compania de dessarrollo cooperativo vs usi 
properties 881428

the energy department conducted a 
nuclear weapons test under the desert at the nevada test site 
shortly after dawn today and pronounced it a success 
the shot had an explosive yield of less than 20 kilotons 
placing it in the lower range of tests conducted at the remote 
desert site energy department spokesman jim boyer said all tests 
are listed as having an explosive force of less than 20 kilotons 
or 20 to 150 kilotons 
the test codenamed palisade and conducted at 610 am was 
very successful with no problems boyer said 
the nuclear device was buried 1100 feet beneath the surface of 
yucca flat about 85 miles northwest of las vegas 
a subsidence was reported at 659 am indicating the ground 
had caved in at the point of detonation and sealed any radioactive 
gases in the earth 
palisade was the fourth announced test this year and the 691st 
announced shot at the site since testing began in nevada in january 
of 1951 
the last previous test was ingot on march 9 twelve tests were

the supreme court today rejected a bush 
administration appeal aimed at giving the government more power to 
control rents for federally subsidized housing 
the court without comment refused to review a decision 
favoring landlords in washington state 
at issue is an interpretation of the housing subsidy law adopted 
by former president reagans administration in 1981 the law 
provides subsidies for those people who cannot afford to pay the 
full amount of their rent 
the department of housing and urban development in 1981 said the 
government could control rents by requiring local surveys of what 
landlords were being paid for nonsubsidized comparable housing 
the surveys were to substitute in some cases for a system of 
rent increases pegged to an inflation formula adopted in 1974 for 
subsidized housing 
the substitution of the market survey approach was challenged in 
a federal lawsuit in 1983 by rainier view associates owners of 
subsidized housing in bremerton wash 
hud officials said rainier view must conduct a study of housing 
in the vicinity to support its bid for higher rents 
rainier view said it was entitled to an inflationbased hike 
geared to its rising costs the landlord said the government was 
reneging on a 20year contract it signed with rainier view in 1980 
guaranteeing that rents would keep pace with rising costs 
a federal judge ruled in favor of hud but the 9th us circuit 
court of appeals reversed the decision last june 
federal law does not permit hud to abandon entirely the 
formula method it chose and to adjust rents solely on the basis of 
a market survey the appeals court said 
administration lawyers said the ruling could mean an additional 
50 million in subsidies in states within the 9th circuit courts 
jurisdiction arizona alaska california hawaii idaho montana 
nevada oregon and washington 
if the appeals court ruling were adopted nationwide the cost 
would be more than 200 million the governments appeal said 
the additional subsidies will have to be paid for by taxpayers 
or by trimming other aspects of the housing subsidy program the 
government lawyers said 
lawyers for rainier view associates and another washington 
housing developer mayer built homes accused the government of a 
hypocritical attack on the subsidy program 
saving money is commendable but not at the expense of 
contractual rights and of the larger view of the public interest 
the landlords lawyers said 
cutting subsidies will prompt developers to desert the program 
they said adding the depletion of our already small inventory 
of housing for the elderly the handicapped and the disadvantaged 
cannot be in the public interest 
the case is us vs rainier view associates 881515

a us hydrogen bomb was crushed by sea pressure 
when it fell into the pacific ocean off japan 24 years ago and its 
nuclear material has dissolved harmlessly on the sea floor the 
united states has told japan 
the material poses no environmental hazard the us defense 
department said in a report given to the japanese embassy in 
washington on friday 
a copy was given to the associated press today after cabinet 
members said japan would check for possible environmental dangers 
the foreign ministry later formed a team to evaluate the us 
report and decide whether more studies are needed the experts come 
from the defense agency the coast guard the environmental agency 
and the fisheries authority 
the only country ever attacked with nuclear weapons japan is 
sensitive to the nuclear issue since the 1965 accident was 
disclosed last week several demonstrations have been held and 
opposition members of parliament have pressed the government to get 
a full explanation from washington 
japan also still was asking whether the aircraft carrier 
ticonderoga had been sailing to a japanese port when one of its a4 
skyhawks accidentally fell into the sea while carrying the 
onemegaton bomb 
this country bans nuclear weapons from its territory but is 
thought to look the other way in the case of port calls by us 
vessels likely to be carrying nuclear bombs the navy does not 
comment on whether its ships carry nuclear weapons 
japan asked the united states for an explanation last week after 
details of the 1965 accident were disclosed in washington by 
william arkin a researcher for the liberal institute of policy 
studies 
arkin said the b43 bomb was not in danger of exploding but its 
33 pounds of plutonium could threaten the environment as the 
structure of the bomb deteriorated 
the defense department report said the bomb was not built to 
withstand the tremendous pressure of the 16000foot depths in 
which it sank and its nuclear materials had leaked into the sea 
the high explosives that would trigger a nuclear blast also 
would have been gradually neutralized by exposure to water the 
report said 
this action will assure that no nuclear or high explosive 
detonation can ever occur in the environment now or in the 
future it said 
nuclear weapons specialists at the us national laboratory had 
tested the unspecified type of nuclear material by dissolving it in 
sea water the report said 
these tests show that the material will dissolve in a 
relatively short time because of its high density the solute 
would have settled very quickly to the floor of the ocean along 
with other sedimentation therefore there is no environmental 
impact it said 
foreign minister sousuke uno responding in parliament to 
opposition questions on the incident said japan accepted the 
american report saying there was no environmental danger 
but i think it necessary to have experts from the concerned 
ministries consider the pertinent issues such as environmental 
pollution uno said 
he and chief cabinet secretary keizo obuchi both said the 
question of whether the ticonderoga had docked in japan was still 
unanswered 
we consider the us side gave a trustworthy explanation of 
the us evaluation of the incident obuchi told a news 
conference 
asked whether the ship had gone on to dock at the japanese port 
of yokusuka obuchi replied we have no confirmation at present 
but we are inquiring now 
on saturday about 500 people demonstrated in tokyo calling for 
the elimination of nuclear arms and for an end to the usjapan 
security treaty under which about 60000 us troops are based in 
japan 
the treaty calls for consultations between the two countries if 
nuclear weapons are introduced into japan and since there has been 
no us request for such consultations the japanese government has 
always said it believes the united states is complying with japans 
antinuclear policy 
in 1981 the united states described the accident as one of the 
two most serious ever involving us nuclear devices the other 
was the loss of the submarine thresher in the atlantic in 1968 
but implied it occurred 500 miles from land 
in fact the bomb sank about 80 miles off an inhabited island in 
okinawa prefecture in far southern japan

the supreme court ruled today that people who 
sue over alleged police brutality must prove only that the officers 
involved acted unreasonably not maliciously and sadistically 
the court unanimously reinstated a charlotte nc mans 
allegations that he was the victim of excessive force by five city 
police officers in a 1984 incident 
chief justice william h rehnquist writing for the court said 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals wrongly dismissed dethorn 
grahams civil rights suit after finding that he had failed to 
prove the police acted maliciously and sadistically 
under a 1973 supreme court decision that standard of proof is 
required for prison inmates suing officials over alleged physical 
abuse 
but rehnquist said a different standard applies in the context 
of an arrest or investigatory stop of a free citizen 
such incidents the high court said today should be judged with 
a focus on the fourth amendments requirement that police conduct 
be reasonable 
most other federal appeals courts already had adopted the 
reasonableness standard for cases such as grahams but the 4th 
circuit courts ruling until today had set a different 
precedent for maryland north carolina south carolina virginia 
and west virginia 
graham a diabetic sued charlotte and five police officers over 
a nov 12 1984 incident near his home 
grahams lawsuit said he was at home working on an automobile 
when he felt a diabetic reaction caused by a reduced level of 
sugar in his blood coming on 
the suit said graham had a friend drive him to a nearby store 
and then rushed in to pick up some orange juice to supplement his 
blood sugar 
graham rushed out of the store without waiting in a long 
checkout line and asked his friend to drive him to another 
friends house according to court documents 
a police officer who saw graham enter and leave the store 
pursued the car and pulled it over 
grahams lawsuit said that in the ensuing minutes graham was 
treated so roughly by the five police officers that his foot was 
broken his wrists cut by handcuffs and his face hurt 
a federal judge threw out the suit and the 4th circuit court 
upheld the dismissal 
the supreme court today returned grahams case to the appeals 
court with instructions to restudy it under the less stringent 
reasonableness standard of proof 
we reject this notion that all excessive force claims brought 
under federal civil rights law are governed by a single generic 
standard rehnquist wrote in reversing the 4th circuit courts 
ruling 
in addressing an excessive force claim analysis begins by 
identifying the specific constitutional right allegeldy infringed 
by the challenged application of force he said 
most times rehnquist said the constitutional right will be the 
fourth amendments ban on unreasonable search and seizure or in 
the prison and jail context the eighth amendments ban on cruel 
and unusual punishment 
justices harry a blackmun william j brennan and thurgood 
marshall agreed with most of rehnquists opinion but objected to 
the courts ruling that all excessiveforce suits growing out of 
arrests and investigatory stops must be scrutinized under a fourth 
amendment analysis 
writing for the three blackmun said the court should not have 
gone as far as to say that a substantive due process standard 
never should be used in such cases 
the five officers named in grahams suit were identified in 
court records as ms connor rb townes t rice hilda p matos 
and mm chandler 
the case is graham vs connor 876571

trains loaded with tanks and missile systems began 
leaving mongolia today in the second stage of a partial withdrawal 
of soviet troops officials said 
it coincided with the first day of soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachevs visit to china to improve relations at the first 
chinesesoviet summit in 30 years 
soviet troops were sent to patrol the mongolian border with 
china in the mid1960s when relations between the communist rivals 
broke down 
now we dont have such conditions a defense ministry 
spokesman said at a news briefing 
over the next two years about 50000 troops will be withdrawn 
about 75 percent of the force deployed in mongolia maj gen yuri 
markelov said 
their withdrawal is part of an overall reduction of 500000 
soviet troops promised by gorbachev at the united nations last 
december 
about 50000 servicemen 5000 tanks 1000 infantry vehicles 
190 aircraft and 130 helicopter gunships will be withdrawn from 
mongolia markelov said 
tass said more than 820 artillery systems will be dismantled 
it said the pullout has been brought about by new political 
thinking and better relations in the region 
last year an infantry division was withdrawn from mongolia 
markelov said this year a tank division and other military units 
will be pulled out and next year one infantry division and one 
tank division will be recalled he said 
the troops were stationed in mongolia at the request of the 
government and the withdrawal is also at the request of the 
mongolian government he said mongolia is a sovereign country 
and can determine itself the degree of security that is needed 
markelov said there was one serious clash between soviet and 
chinese troops in 1969 and several minor incidents but he said he 
did not have exact data or casualty figures 
the officer said it was coincidental that the withdrawal was 
taking place as gorbachev visited china 
the soviet union began withdrawing troops from hungary on april 
25 and cuts are expected to begin shortly in east germany and 
czechoslovakia

the supreme court today gave prison officials 
sweeping power to limit what inmates may read and who may visit 
them 
voting 63 in a case from kentucky the justices said officials 
are not required to explain why they bar an inmate from having 
visitors 
the court rejected arguments that the state by establishing a 
system permitting visits endowed inmates with a new right to see 
outsiders prisoners do not have a right in such cases to due 
process for example a hearing or an explanation when they 
are denied a visit by someone the court said 
by the same 63 split the justices overturned a ruling by a 
federal appeals court here that limited authority of officials to 
censor reading material behind bars 
where the regulations at issue concern the entry of materials 
into the prisona regulation which gives prison authorities broad 
discretion is appropriate said justice harry a blackmun for the 
court 
blackmun said regulations must be upheld as long as they are 
reasonably related to legitimate penological interests 
the court upheld the power of wardens to ban any publication at 
federal prisons they believe is detrimental to the security good 
order or discipline of the institution ormight facilitate 
criminal activity 
in other actions today the court 
ruled that people who sue over alleged police brutality must 
prove only that the officers involved acted unreasonably not 
maliciously and sadistically the court unanimously reinstated 
a charlotte nc mans allegations that he was the victim of 
excessive force by five city police officers in a 1984 incident 
agreed to review a ruling that makes it easier for disabled 
children to win some federal welfare benefits 
refused to hear an appeal by two sioux indian tribes seeking 
land they surrendered to the federal government 121 years ago the 
court without comment rejected arguments that the tribes were 
forced illegally in 1987 to accept financial compensation for the 
land given up in 1868 the tribes contend that the 1987 settlement 
was agreed to by a lawyer who no longer represented them 
among the prisoners who challenged the publications rule is jack 
henry abbott a convicted murderer and bank robber who achieved 
notoriety after he was befriended by norman mailer and other 
prominent writers and editors 
six weeks after abbott was freed in a workrelease program in 
1981 he stabbed to death an aspiring actor outside a new york city 
restaurant where the victim was working as a waiter 
abbotts book on prison life in the belly of the beast was 
critically acclaimed 
the supreme court today ordered further hearings to determine 
whether prisoners should be allowed to read any of 46 publications 
officials want to ban 
but the justices said the officials do not have the burden of 
proving any of the publications threaten security order or 
rehabiliation at the prison 
among the publications on the list for example was an issue of 
the call a leftwing newspaper that included an article charging 
inhumane treatment by racist guards in federal prisons 
todays ruling is a victory for the justice department which 
urged the high court to overturn a ruling by the us circuit court 
of appeals here 
department officials cited uprisings in 1987 by inmates from 
cuba in two us prisons as evidence that information from the 
outside can have grave consequences in a prison 
the government said that between sept 1 1986 and aug 31 
1987 some 1700 publications were withheld out of 18 million sent 
to federal inmates 
in the kentucky prison visits case the justices overturned a 
ruling by the 6th us circuit court of appeals 
most states joined in urging reversal of the appeals court 
ruling state officials said numerous regulations ranging from job 
assignments to telephone privileges could be jeopardized if the 
court restrained the power of officials to regulate outside visits 
the kentucky case arose from a lawsuit by inmates at a state 
reformatory in lagrange 
the state settled the suit by agreeing in 1980 to continue an 
open visitation policy at the prison 
in 1985 an inmates mother was denied the right to visit him 
because she had brought to the prison with her a man previously 
barred for smuggling contraband there were other similar instances 
as well 
todays rulings were in line with several recent high court 
decisions that buttress the power of prison officials to enforce 
various rules for example the court in 1987 upheld a rule that 
prohibits correspondence between inmates in different prisons 
in both rulings today blackmun was joined by chief justice 
william h rehnquist and justices byron r white sandra day 
oconnor antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy 
dissenting were justices thurgood marshall william j brennan 
and john paul stevens 
in a third case involving prisoners rights the court 
unanimously permitted a prison inmate to challenge in federal court 
a 1958 washington state court robbery conviction for which the 
sentence has expired 
the high court in an unsigned opinion said federal courts have 
authority to decide whether mark edwin cooks 30yearold 
conviction was used unfairly to stiffen prison sentences he 
received for more recent crimes 
the cases are thornburgh vs abbott 871344 kentucky vs

an explosion and fire killed two sailors on 
the 24yearold aircraft carrier uss america in the third deadly 
blaze on a us warship in 25 days 
one of the two killed saturday night may have died while looking 
for his crewmate after hearing the explosion a relative said 
the latest deaths occurred in a pump room for jet fuel as the 
norfolkbased carrier cruised hundreds of miles off north carolina 
said lt cmdr mike john a navy spokesman 
firefighters on the vessel extinguished the blaze with no 
additional casualties the atlantic fleet said in a statement 
a team of about 10 navy investigators including structural and 
fuel experts left this morning to fly to the america to assess 
damage and determine the cause of the explosion john said 
neither john nor lt cmdr steve burnett another navy 
spokesman would speculate on possible causes of the blast but 
they said the oilfueled carrier would continue its mission a 
sixmonth deployment to the mediterranean sea and indian ocean the 
1047footlong america which was commissioned in 1965 left 
norfolk on thursday with a crew of about 5000 
at this time we see no reason to cut the mission short 
john said the vessel is able to continue 
burnett said he was uncertain how the carriers air operations 
might be affected by the damage 
john said the investigators would determine whether to repair 
the vessel during its deployment or wait until it returns to port 
an april 19 explosion and fire in a gun turret killed 47 sailors 
aboard the norfolkbased battleship uss iowa off puerto rico on 
may 9 six sailors died in an engine room fire on the supply ship 
uss white plains in the south china sea 
six flagdraped coffins containing the bodies of the white 
plains sailors arrived sunday at alameda naval air station calif 
it is highly unusual for the navy to have three fatal shipboard 
fires in less than a month said navy lt paul jenkins but the

here in brief are the highlghts of mondays 
actions by the us supreme court 
 
prisoner rights 
 
the court gave prison officials sweeping power to limit what 
inmates may read and who may visit them 
voting 63 in a case from kentucky the justices said officials 
are not required to explain why they bar an inmate from having 
visitors 
the court rejected arguments that the state by establishing a 
system permitting visits endowed inmates with a new right to see 
outsiders prisoners do not have a right in such cases to due 
process for example a hearing or an explanation when they 
are denied a visit by someone the court said 
by the same 63 split the justices overturned a ruling by a 
federal appeals court here that limited authority of officials to 
censor reading material behind bars 
where the regulations at issue concern the entry of materials 
into the prisona regulation which gives prison authorities broad 
discretion is appropriate said justice harry a blackmun for the 
court 
the cases are thornburgh vs abbott 871344 kentucky vs 
thompson 871815 maleng vs cook 88357 
 
police brutality 
 
the court ruled that people who sue over alleged police 
brutality must prove only that the officers involved acted 
unreasonably not maliciously and sadistically 
the court unanimously reinstated a charlotte nc mans 
allegations that he was the victim of excessive force by five city 
police officers in a 1984 incident 
chief justice william h rehnquist writing for the court said 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals wrongly dismissed dethorn 
grahams civil rights suit after finding that he had failed to 
prove the police acted maliciously and sadistically 
the case is graham vs connor 876571 
 
disabled 
 
the court agreed to review a ruling that makes it easier for 
disabled children to win some federal welfare benefits 
the justices said they will hear a bush administration appeal 
aimed at overturning a ruling that could force the government to 
reevaluate benefits for more than 250000 children 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals last august ruled in favor 
of disabled children seeking socalled supplemental security income 
from the department of health and human services hhs the 
benefits are provided to the disabled of all ages 
the circuit court said definitions of disability were being 
interpreted by hhs in a way that illegally made it more difficult 
for children to qualify 
the case is sullivan vs zebley 881377 
 
indian claims 
 
the court refused to hear an appeal by two sioux indian tribes 
seeking land they surrendered to the federal government 121 years 
ago 
the court without comment rejected arguments that the tribes 
were forced illegally in 1987 to accept financial compensation for 
the land given up in 1868 the tribes contend that the 1987 
settlement was agreed to by a lawyer who no longer represented them 
the case is oglala sioux vs us 881380 
 
rent control 
 
the court rejected a bush admnistration appeal aimed at giving 
the government more power to control rents for federally subsidized 
housing the court without comment refused to review a decision 
favoring landlords in washington state 
at issue is an interpretation of the housing subsidy law adopted 
by former president reagans administration in 1981 the law 
provides subsidies for those people who cannot afford to pay the 
full amount of their rent 
the department of housing and urban development hud in 1981 
said the government could control rents by requiring local surveys 
of what landlords were being paid for nonsubsidized comparable 
housing the market survey approach was challenged in a federal 
lawsuit in 1983 by rainier view associates owners of subsidized 
housing in bremerton wash 
rainier view said it was entitled to an inflationbased hike 
geared to its rising costs 
the case is us vs rainier view associates 881515

a 39yearold economist monday 
became the youngest president in yugoslavias history taking over 
as head of a collective presidency that faces unprecedented 
economic woes and ethnic tensions 
janez drnovsek a virtually unknown lawmaker from northern 
slovenia won 56 percent of votes in his republic in a watershed 
ballot in april that gave yugoslavia its first directly elected 
president 
previously presidents were chosen by regional parliaments and 
just one candidate was put forth by communist authorities 
under the countrys rotating presidency introduced in 1974 the 
countrys six republics and two autonomous provinces take turns 
every year filling the top post this time the highest office went 
to slovenia 
drnovsek replaces raif dizdarevic who is retiring from 
political life 
we will strive to improve yugoslavias relations with 
developed nations particularly with europe drnovsek said in his 
inaugural speech today 
he delivered his address in the slovene language rather than 
serbocroat spoken by most yugoslavs and normally used in 
political speeches 
in a speech recently drnovsek who worked in industry and 
banking declared that democratization has begun and cannot be 
halted 
he said he would push for further reforms at a time yugslvia 
faces mounting pressure for the introduction of a multiparty 
system and closer ties with the west ethnic minorities are 
clamoring for greater autonomy 
he also faces serious economic problems unemployment is at 15 
percent living standards have plunged by one third in the past 
decade and inflation surpassed 500 percent this month 
slovenias multicandidate elections were a first for a yugoslav 
republic but similar ballots were later held in the republic of 
montenegro and other republics were expected to follow suit later 
this year

civil fines heaped on top of criminal 
penalties sometimes may be a form of unconstitutional double 
jeopardy the supreme court ruled unanimously today 
the justices said such was the case when the manager of a new 
york city medical laboratory was hit with 131170 in civil fines 
for defrauding the federal government of 585 on medicare bills 
the constitution protects people against being tried twice for 
the same crime and against multiple punishments for the same crime 
but before today the nations highest court had never said 
specifically that a civil fine may amount to punishment for 
purposes of doublejeopardy analysis 
writing for the court justice harry a blackmun said a civil 
sanction that cannot fairly be said solely to serve a remedial 
purpose but rather can be explained only as also serving either 
retributive or deterrent purposes is punishment 
blackmun added a defendant who already has been punished in a 
criminal prosecution may not be subjected to an additional civil 
sanction to the extent that the second sanction may not fairly be 
characterized as remedial but only as a deterent or retribution 
the justices sent back to a federal judge in new york city the 
case of irwin halper who runs the new city medical laboratories 
halper was convicted in a criminal prosecution of submitting 
inflated claims for medicare reimbursement he was sentenced to two 
years in prison and fined 5000 
government officials then also sued halper under the false 
claims act a law enacted during the civil war to combat fraud 
against the union army by defense contractors 
in that civil or noncriminal case halper was fined 
131170 the fine was based on an assessment of 2000 for each of 
65 separate charges of overbilling plus 1170 for twice the 
actual loss suffered by the government 
the government said halper billed blue cross and blue shield of 
greater new york for 12 per patient for a service that medicare 
reimbursed at 3 
us district judge robert w sweet originally reduced the civil 
fine against halper to 17170 and subsequently cut it to 1170 
when the government protested the first reduction 
in todays decision blackmun agreed with sweet that the civil 
fines amounted to punishment 
although most civil fines for defrauding the government do not 
rise to the level of punishment blackmun said in a particular 
case a civil penalty may be so divorced from the governments 
damages and expenses as to constitute punishment 
blackmun said it would be up to judge sweet to determine the 
size of the civil sanction the government may receive without 
crossing the line between remedy and punishment 
the justice said the government should be given a chance to make 
an accounting of its damages and costs 
what we announce now is a rule for the rare case blackmun 
said the case such as the one before us where a fixedpenalty 
provision subjects a prolific but smallgauge offender to a 
sanction overwhelmingly disproportionate to the damages he has 
caused 
the case is us vs halper 871383

on the first day of a historic summit disrupted 
by student protests mikhail s gorbachev said today that the 
soviet union must share the blame for a cold war that divided the 
two countries for three decades 
very probably we are also responsible for that period to a 
certain extent the soviet leader told chinas president yang 
shangkun 
chinas leaders moved the welcoming ceremony to the airport from 
a central beijing square to avoid a confrontation with tens of 
thousands of rebellious students camped out on the plaza for a 
third day 
in remarks broadcast on chinese television gorbachev expressed 
sorrow and regret for the bad blood of the past and said this 
period has come to an end 
gorbachev 58 arrived today for the first sinosoviet summit 
since nikita khrushchev met mao tsetung in 1959 in acrimonious 
talks that contributed to rapidly deteriorating relations 
the two nations nearly went to war after border fighting broke 
out in 1969 and have since been at odds over the soviet 
intervention in afghanistan moscows backing of vietnams 
involvement in cambodia and what china has called soviet 
hegemonism 
both sides agree that gorbachevs meeting tuesday with 
84yearold senior leader deng xiaoping will normalize government 
and party ties and help spur economic cultural and academic 
contacts 
the way towards this meeting was not an easy one gorbachev 
said at a later banquet speech it required from both sides 
wisdom responsibility and perseverance in removing the negative 
aggravations and prejudices that marred our relations for so many 
years 
gorbachev also stressed that the improvement of sovietchinese 
relations is not directed against any third country in the final 
analysis the entire world community stands to gain from that 
improvement 
the united states which in the past has benefited strategically 
from the sinosoviet split has welcomed their rapprochement 
saying it will contribute to stability in the region and world 
but the summit got off to a rocky start as up to 150000 people 
half of them students occupied tiananmen square chinas symbolic 
seat of power in a massive protest for a more open and democratic 
society 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov in a 
briefing the demonstrations would disrupt plans for gorbachev to 
lay a wreath on a monument to revolutionary heroes in the center of 
the square tuesday 
physically its impossible the place is taken up by 
demonstrators he said 
gerasimov said the soviet side understood chinas difficulties 
in coping with the students we have similar experiences and have 
lived through some difficult times he said 
the demonstrators including about 2000 students in the third 
day of a hunger strike defied police orders to vacate the square 
forcing authorities to cancel a planned welcoming ceremony outside 
the great hall of the people next to the square 
student leaders on saturday delivered a letter containing 6000 
signatures to the soviet embassy requesting that gorbachev address 
students 
gorbachevs motorcade route from the airport which was to have 
passed by the square also had to be changed when thousands of 
people surged past police lines and spilled out onto the sixlane 
street in front of the forbidden city 
gorbachevs meeting with yang was also set back by almost two 
hours because of the change in the welcoming ceremony site it took 
place in the great hall next to the square but it was unclear 
whether gorbachev saw the demonstrators 
soviet spokesman gennady i gerasimov shrugged off the schedule 
changes saying they were made upon the proposal of the chinese 
side we are only guests here 
asked if the visit was being overshadowed by the student 
protests he said the summit is incomparable and a much more 
important event than actions taken by students 
he noted that each country has its own internal problems and 
the soviet union has its share 
the month of prodemocracy sitins marches and other student 
protests are the largest and most serious chinas communist leaders 
have ever faced 
gorbachev laughed and joked with yang during in the first 
minutes of their meeting the 81yearold yang who like many older 
chinese studied russian in his youth when the kremlin was beijings 
ideological mentor greeted the soviet leader in russian and was 
praised for his skill in the language 
later in a welcoming banquet in the great hall yang noted that 
sinosoviet relations traversed a tortuous course in the past 
today we have come to a new starting point 
gorbachev in a statement issued upon his arrival said the 
spring season and its feelings of renewal and hope were consonant 
with our mood we hope that the meetings and talks we are going to 
have with the chinese leaders will mark a watershed in relations 
he said people of the soviet union follow with keen interest 
the transformations that are unfolding in china likely referring 
to chinas decadeold economic reform 
chinese officials say they will use the summit to press the 
soviets to use their influence over vietnam to help end the 10year 
cambodian conflict 
more than 1000 soviet chinese and foreign journalists are 
covering the visit which will be highlighted tuesday by 
gorbachevs meeting with deng 
gorbachev will also hold talks with communist party general 
secretary zhao ziyang and premier li peng

disabled people protesting the bush 
administrations challenge of a ruling requiring wheelchair lifts 
on new transit buses say they hope their efforts will encourage the 
handicapped to fight for their rights 
about two dozen disabled people demonstrated outside the us 
courthouse on sunday night against the administrations request 
that the 3rd us circuit court of appeals reconsider a feb 13 
ruling 
the full panel heard arguments today 
disabled people and their advocates had lauded the february 
ruling as a means to put the handicapped in the economic 
mainstream but that turned to disappointment last month when the 
federal government asked the entire panel to rehear the case 
the bush administration has given a lot of lip service to 
mainstreaming said bob kafka of austin texas 
although disabled people have won victories for accessible 
transportation in several cities the decision by the appeals court 
was the first national triumph 
we know were going to be going to the supreme court said 
fred stark of jersey city nj 
the case was brought by the american disabled for accessible 
public transit known as adapt and other groups 
joe carle an adapt member from dallas said handicapped people 
want the the disabled and their advocates to demonstrate their 
disappointment with the appeal 
those at the courthouse said the issue of accessible public 
transportation is part of a greater concern that handicapped people 
have the same rights as people who are not disabled 
its not proper for the hospital to give us the will to live 
but society not to accept us said mike newhall of cape cod 
mass 
carle said protests in other cities have been successful in 
getting lifts on some buses and disabled people hope that strategy 
will help now 
he pointed to dallas and denver as cities where officials have 
taken notice of protests by disabled people 
in the 21 decision in february the court ordered the us 
department of transportation to rewrite regulations that allow 
communities to offer only paratransit service such as van 
rides to the disabled the court said the 24hour reservations 
that van riders need hinder spontaneous use of mass transit they 
said all new buses must be equipped with the lifts 
transit officials have criticized the decision saying the 
costly lifts are rarely used 
in its petition the government said transit agencies across the 
country would pay a total of 90 million annually for the lifts

the sudanese government has again stalled 
a train load of emergency food for civil warplagued southern 
sudan sources said monday 
diane weathers a spokeswoman for the uns world food program 
said the government raised a lastminute objection to the departure 
of the train laden with 1500 tons of food 
the train already delayed for a month was to have left muglad 
in southwestern sudan this week for aweil a governmentheld town 
about 180 miles farther south 
under an earlier arrangement with the united nations the 
government and rebels from the sudan peoples liberation front had 
agreed that half of the food would go to aweil with the remainder 
being dropped off at rebelheld towns along the way 
theres been some quibbling over dropoff points ms 
weathers said the rebels wanted a 5050 split but the 
government objected to that 
the new delay was the latest in a series of setbacks that have 
plagued operation lifeline sudan a united nations effort to save 
100000 people threatened with starvation 
the 132 million program had aimed to stockpile 100000 tons of 
food in southern sudan by the end of may but has managed to 
deliver less than half that amount so far 
un officials have described the operation as a race against 
time and seasonal rains that begin in may and turn roads and 
airfields into quagmires until november 
the goal is to prevent a repeat of last years disaster when up 
to 500000 people died in the fighting in sudans 6yearold civil 
war or perished of starvation and disease in isolated villages 
the heavy rains already have begun halting a truck convoy bound 
for the rebelheld town of torit and forcing the cancellation of 
flights by c130 cargo planes 
the c130s were breaking up the rainsoftened runway at torit 
ms weathers said although flights by smaller planes continue from 
entebbe uganda 
carlton james a spokesman for the united nations childrens 
fund in nairobi acknowledged a new delay in the trains departure 
but said he did not know its cause 
ive heard that the government has objected james said 
but if i told you all the rumors ive heard about that train it 
would add up to a real litany of woe 
a spokesman for another un agency participating in the 
lifeline sudan project also said the train had been delayed by the 
government that source who spoke on condition he not be 
identified said highlevel negotiations were under way to try to 
break the impasse 
the train had been supposed to depart april 15 but was delayed 
for nearly a month when railroad crews refused to travel through 
the embattled area without an armed escort 
barges loaded with food also are stalled at malakal on the nile 
river because of what ms weathers described as a security 
impasse they are carrying between 6000 and 7000 tons of 
supplies destined for southern towns including bor and juba 
sudans southernmost provincial capital which has been under siege 
by the rebels for more than two months 
ms weathers said a truck convoy organized by the french branch 
of doctors without frontiers was stalled by impassable roads at 
kapoeta another rebelheld town a few miles north of the kenya 
border it left kenya on may 7 bound for torit but had to be 
unloaded at kapoeta when it could go no farther

supporters of nearly 2000 students on a hunger 
strike for democracy focused their efforts monday on supplying them 
with water and salt tablets but fears for their health intensified 
if this continues and the temperature rises i am worried 
about the consequences a doctor from the no 1 medical institute 
said 48 hours after the strike began 
dozens of students had been carried out fainting by monday and 
were taken to hospitals by ambulances a harsh sun in the unshaded 
square took a further toll on the students many covered their 
heads with jackets 
the red cross donated medicine for the strikers and doctors 
joined medical students who have been looking after their 
classmates 
we dont have enough salt said a sixthyear student at the 
beijing medical university 
some students are not even willing to drink water in order to 
show their determination and some of those who are carried off say 
they will come back when they are better said a postgraduate 
student from the peking union medical college who was giving first 
aid most are going on nothing but spirit 
at one point a cry went up from one section of students 
bring a bottle bring a bottle medics rushed over with water 
but soon came running back carrying an unconscious student he was 
placed in an ambulance 
</TEXT>

music also helped keep the strikers going and drowned out the 
rising clamor of arguments among students whose bodies weakened and 
nerves frayed 
a group of students from the beijing normal university walked 
among the prone strikers singing spirited music accompanied by an 
accordion 
down with profiteering down with profiteering oppose 
corruption they sang to the tune of frere jacques 
a loudspeaker hooked up to two car batteries broadcast both 
messages from the strike leaders and music a mixture of patriotic 
songs and the theme from the james bond movie goldfinger

bands of about a dozen students each roamed nearby streets 
shouting their message of democracy to passersby most also carried 
cardboard boxes and appealed for donations to buy food for the 
nonfasting students and pay for unofficial student publications 
without the people we have no movement people people we need 
your support pleaded one collection team 
students announced over a loudspeaker that about 27000 had 
been donated over the monthlong democracy movement 
thats not much compared with the amount of money officials 
make from illegal profiteering sneered the announcer

neatness was not the strong suit of the student protesters not 
until monday previous protests left tiananmen square littered with 
papers plastic containers and broken bottles 
this time students went to work with brooms made of banners 
wadded around poles they swept huge quantities of litter into 
piles after most of the students moved early monday from the center 
of the square to the eastern portion 
the move was made in order to give space on the west for a 
government ceremony welcoming soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
for the first sinosoviet summit in three decades but the gesture 
was wasted because the government moved the welcoming ceremony to 
the airport 
and it didnt take long for the new strikers camp to be just as 
littered with bottles newspapers and other debris

northern irelands local 
elections wednesday may help measure how much the gunmen both 
catholic and protestant have hurt their political allies 
no real power is at stake but sinn fein officials concede they 
have been damaged by the civilian deaths inflicted by the irish 
republican army while the rev ian paisleys democratic unionist 
party has been embarrassed by the arrest of former allies who 
allegedly were seeking a south african arms connection 
roads schools and housing figure in the race for 566 seats on 
26 councils but passions seldom stray far from the core conflict 
between protestants who favor british rule and catholics who want a 
united ireland 
hatred is mostly what motivates politics says paul bew a 
professor of political science at queens university in belfast 
it is the catholic candidate that brings out the protestant vote 
and the protestant vote that brings out the catholic 
thus elections in northern ireland with roughly 900000 
protestants and 600000 catholics often are dismissed as sectarian 
headcounts and usually less than 1 percent of the vote crosses 
religious lines 
yet in the district of fermanagh there has been some talk of 
limited votetrading between catholic members of the social 
democratic and labor party and protestants of the official unionist 
party 
enough of it may happen to affect the situation says john 
okane of the sdlp in fermanagh 
in local elections in 1985 sinn fein took 118 percent of the 
vote while the larger antiviolence sdlp polled 178 percent 
among catholics the sdlp usually outpolls sinn fein 21 
sinn feins electoral strength was growing bew said until a 
string of ira atrocities began with a bomb that killed 11 
protestants at enniskillen on nov 8 1987 
despite an appeal by sinn fein president gerry adams to the ira 
to be careful and careful again the incidents continued in 
the last on april 12 the ira tried to blow up a police barracks 
in the heavily catholic border town of warrenpoint the blast 
killed a 19yearold catholic woman and damaged one in six houses 
the democratic unionists suffered a further embarrassment on 
april 24 when three members of the ulster resistance movement were 
arrested in paris where they allegedly were seeking to swap a 
stolen model of a blowpipe missile for south african arms 
paisley and the dups deputy leader peter robinson had 
appeared at ulster resistance rallies but paisley said those links 
had since been severed 
since october the british government has banned broadcast 
appearances by sinn fein members and has compelled all candidates 
to take an oath that they do not support violence the broadcast 
ban is waived during the election campaign 
sinn fein candidates took the oath but the party has not 
renounced the strategy of using both violence and the electoral 
process to further its goal of ridding northern ireland of british 
rule 
despite that combination of official crackdown and ira bungling 
we hope and expect to hold our vote said sinn fein spokesman 
richard mcauley 
sinn fein has a hard core of votes which arent going to 
go away said sidney elliott a political scientist at queens 
university opinion surveys have found that sinn fein attracts its 
heaviest support from the young and the unemployed while the sdlp 
is more middleclass 
there really isnt much of a floating vote between sinn fein 
and the sdlp whereas government policy is predicated on the 
assumption that there is says bew sinn feins problem is 
their own mistakes not any strategy of government to 
ameliorate conditions 
the dups vote share fell from 243 percent in 1985 to 117 
percent in 1987 while the more moderate official unionists rose 
from 295 to 378 percent 
both parties demand that sinn fein like the ira be outlawed 
and they want tighter security along the border with the irish 
republic the dup proposes hot pursuit of the ira across the 
frontier 
the dup has been hurt by defections of council members who want 
an even tougher line

on opposition candidates in an attempt to assassinate one of them 
what happened was a noriegadirected attempt on the life of 
one of the candidates davis said before departing panama on 
president bushs orders 
witness reports and the type of wounds sustained by guellermo 
ford an opposition candidate for second vice president showed 
that the attack was designed to kill him 
ford and his two fellow opposition candidates were attacked by 
pipewielding thugs on wednesday at the end of a political parade 
that called for recognition of an opposition victory in may 7 
elections 
davis said he could not reveal details of the evidence and said 
he did not know why ford was targeted 
davis credited fords bodyguards one of whom died in the 
attack with saving fords life 
after the news conference davis left for howard air force base 
to depart the country he was recalled by bush last week after 
opposition candidates were beaten in the streets of panama city 
he said he would return to panama when conditions permit the 
reestablishment of normal relations between the united states and 
a legitimate government in panama 
davis said noriega not the panama defense forces is the 
problem and that it may be up to progressive elements within the 
defense forces to take care of it 
meanwhile american children at military bases returned to 
school today but work was suspended for panamanian teachers 
preparing for the opening day of the school year 
the us schools had been closed friday while dependents were 
moved onpost at bushs order and resumed today 
a message from the us southern command said parents who had 
moved from their homes to the bases would be responsible for 
getting their children to classes 
the panamanian school year was scheduled to begin may 22 for 
660000 primary secondary and university students and teachers 
were to report today until the school year was postponed for 
security reasons 
the most cautiously independent newspaper la estrella took the 
opportunity to publish an editorial that said the annulment of last 
weeks elections had provoked a series of discomforts which does 
not permit classes to begin in a normal way 
the newspaper also published a front page picture of ford 
entering church to applause from members of the congregation 
the caption did not mention that the service turned into a 
virtual opposition rally with the congregation chanting 
justicia justicia and passing out leaflets calling for a 
24hour general strike against noriegas regime on wednesday 
the caption did say such scenes were repeated all over 
panama 
an opposition leader sunday rejected any proposals for a junta 
saying the opposition won the may 7 elections and the victory 
should be recognized 
exit polls by the roman catholic church and surveys by 
opposition pollwatchers had opposition candidate guillermo endara

at panama citys cristo rey church a militant opposition 
stronghold the congregation jumped to its feet and cheered when 
oppositon vice presidential candidates ford and ricardo arias 
calderon walked in to take seats in front pews 
endara was greatly improved today and will probably be released 
from the hospital tuesday a medical bulletin said 
 
the church has not been as influential as it is in nicaragua or 
el salvador and its support for fair elections is a new element in 
panamanian politics 
the rev javier villanueva who celebrated mass at cristo rey 
church said the church is neither of the opposition nor of the 
government the church is where it should be 
there were brief protests at churches in the capitals poor 
neighborhoods of san miguelito and rio abajo and in the cities of 
colon and david 
churches that sympathize with the opposition have been attacked 
in the past but no police were visible and no incidents were 
reported 
opposition supporters at many churches handed out leaflets 
describing alleged government beatings of civilians and calling for 
the general strike on wednesday 
read photocopy and pass along our newspaper said a 
handwritten note on one leaflet the opposition press has been 
closed down in panama for more than a year 
the crisis showed no sign of easing although outside churches 
it was a normal lazy sunday 
the opposition works monday to friday and so do we said a

consumer advocate ralph nader won a warm 
response from a senate panel today when he called for legislation 
to immediately ban use of the pesticide alar on apples 
nader said congress should ban alar by name unilaterally and 
immediately 
he told the senate subcommittee on toxic substances that there 
is now a convergence of interest between consumers who dont 
want alar on apples and apple growers hurt by plummeting apple 
sales 
nader maintained the only opposition to an immediate ban comes 
from suppliers of alar or daminozide 
stopping just short of saying he will introduce such a measure 
sen john warner rva noted that congress can act much more 
quickly on such matters than the environmental protection agency 
which announced over the weekend that it has started a procedure 
that could lead to an alar ban in about 18 months 
what congress can do one day it can undo the next said 
warner we could simply pass a law tomorrow unilaterally banning 
alar and put that behind us 
apples are a major agricultural product in warners state and he 
noted that sales have been hurt severely by consumer reaction to a 
series of news reports focusing on assertions that alar poses a 
serious cancer risk particularly to children 
it would bring back a measure of confidence in the consumer 
particularly the housewife struggling with children warner said 
of legislation i think we need some swift decisive action to 
restore confidence in the marketplace

new radars now being tested could help lessen 
the danger of one of the nations biggest weatherrelated problems 
flash floods 
while the drama of tornadoes and hurricanes tends to get more 
attention flash floods are the major cause of weatherrelated 
deaths in the united states reports elbert w friday the 
director of the national weather service 
they claimed over 1800 lives in the 1970s and another 1000 
so far this decade he reported 
but with nexrad next generation weather radar that could 
change as better storm information is coupled with land analyses 
and computer programs in the next few years 
its more than a pipe dream the reality of nexrad is here 
rafael bras of the massachusetts institute of technology which 
operates a radar similar to the new nexra system told a recent 
meeting of geophysicists 
i believe our way of predicting floods in the future will 
change because our sources of data are changing he said at a 
meeting of the american geophysical union in baltimore 
now being tested in norman okla nexrad could begin to be 
installed around the country by this fall said weather service 
spokesman donald witten 
the new radar system is expected to incorporate a computerized 
program to warn local weather offices when too much rain falls in 
too small an area in too short a time said witten 
deaths from flash flooding have increased in recent years a 
trend attributed to increasing development in lowlying areas near 
rivers and streams 
the development of the better warning system comes just a 
century after the johnstown pa flood disaster 
it was may 31 1889 when waters of the south fork reservoir in 
western pennsylvania swollen by two days of steady rain broke 
through an earthen dam and cascaded down the conemaugh valley into 
johnstown killing at least 2500 people 
today parts of floodprone appalachia are protected by an 
automated flood warning system operated by the national oceanic and 
atmospheric administration 
but while iflows integrated flood observation and warning 
system covers 179 counties in seven states flooding remains a 
hazard in many other areas too many for human forecasters to keep 
track of and issue detailed warnings 
a reorganization of the national weather service is expected to 
reduce the agency to 115 local forecast offices scattered across 
the nation during the 1990s 
there might be 1000 points of flooding for each office to 
keep track of said flood analyst john schaake of the weather 
service 
but over the next decade or so nexrad next generation weather 
radar will be installed at those offices and that can make the 
difference said bras 
while current radar systems can see where storms are nexrad 
will allow meteorologists to track wind movements and estimate 
rainfall over much of the area 
bras using similar radar at mit has combined the readings with 
detailed analyses of water runoff and stream flow patterns in the 
souhegan and squanhacook river basins in new hampshire in an 
experiment to see if flooding can be better predicted 
first he said he developed detailed topographical maps of the 
river basins including estimates of the slope to calculate rates 
of runoff and the velocity of streamflows in the region 
weather records for the area allowed him to calculate how 
saturated the soil was to see how much water would be absorbed and 
how much would flow through the soil into lowerlevel streams and 
creeks 
with all these calculations in a computer bras explained he 
was able to estimate the stream flows and flood heights when the 
advanced radar detected storms over the two river basins in a 
series of experiments the projections came very close to actual 
water levels recorded on the scene bras said 
such projections could speed warnings to areas downstream of 
heavy rains or sudden snowmelts two major causes of flash flooding 
in the united states

us immigration officials have granted 
political asylum to a cuban family from florida that was stranded 
in canada for nearly five months after a sightseeing trip a 
newspaper reported today 
the buffalo news reported today that carlos fajardo and his 
family will return to the united states tuesday 
the newspaper quoted a source close to the case as saying the 
fajardos would stay in buffalo for a couple of days and then head 
to miami 
the family has survived on charity in niagara falls and fort 
erie ontario while waiting for permission to reenter the united 
states their exile began dec 23 while on vacation when they 
traveled north to view snow and crossed into canada they were 
denied reentry because they could not prove us citizenship 
later immigration officials determined that the family had a 
history of immigration fraud 
benedict ferro district director of the federal immigration and 
naturalization service had said that allowing the family to return 
home would be an affront to millions of people waiting to enter the 
country legally 
but after a march application for asylum and subsequent ins 
investigation ferro said he could overlook history of fraud 
because the family had a legitimate fear of being persecuted if 
returned to cuba 
mr fajardos claim is clearly not frivolous ferro said 
last month indeed if it is rising to the level of a 
wellfounded fear of being persecuted we will grant him asylum 
the source told the newspaper the fajardos would try to 
reestablish their boatbuilding business in miami

nuclear power plant operators from around the 
world gathered in moscow on monday to form a new association to 
share safety information and prevent a repetition of accidents such 
as the 1986 chernobyl disaster 
representatives of more than 300 power stations in 30 countries 
including the united states the soviet union france and britain 
signed a charter inaugurating the world association of nuclear 
operators 
charter members represent about 115 of the 130 power companies 
that produce electricity from nuclear reactors 
several major nuclear accidents including chernobyl showed 
that there were problems in communication soviet atomic energy 
minister nikolai lukonin a cochairman of the new association 
told the session these problems have become global problems 
the association was conceived after the april 1986 fire and 
explosion at chernobyl in the ukraine killed at least 31 people and 
sent a poisonous cloud of radioactivity into the atmosphere 
after chernobyl it became necessary to form a system of sharing 
safety information to prevent future accidents lukonin said 
the other cochairman lord walter marshall of britains central 
electricity generating board said sharing information was 
essential to prevent accidents such as chernobyl and the 1979 
nuclear waste spill at three mile island in pennsylvania 
the nuclear community has learned its lesson in painful 
ways he said if utilities had acted together these accidents 
might not have happened 
chernobyl has created determination among nuclear operators to 
work together he said 
the association already has established regional headquarters in 
atlanta moscow paris and tokyo a communications center will be 
operated in london to transmit information to member utilities 
marshall said 
according to the charter its mission is to maximize the 
safety and reliability of the operation of nuclear power plants by 
exchanging information encouraging comparison emulation and 
communication among its members 
marshall said nuclear power only benefits mankind if safety 
is kept at the highest possible level 
he said the ultimate responsibility for safety rests with the 
organizations that operate the plants each has a responsibility 
to learn from others and avoid making mistakes made elsewhere 
marshall said 
the twoday meeting ends tuesday with election of a president 
and arrangements for the next general assembly in two years 
many soviets have become afraid of nuclear power since the 
chernobyl accident and soviet officials have canceled or curtailed 
several plants because of stricter standards 
officials closed two nuclear generators at an armenian power 
plant located near a geological fault after the dec 7 earthquake 
in northern armenia

czechoslovakia on monday attacked 
a decision by hungary to halt a controversial joint dam project on 
the danube branding it a onesided attack on bilateral 
agreements and international law 
hungarys decision saturday to halt construction of its dam at 
nagymaros is the latest action to sour relations between the two 
warsaw pact allies 
the slovak government in a statement carried on the state news 
agency ctk said it was puzzled and surprised by the move 
especially because of what it said was a hungarian drive to 
accelerate work on the project under an agreement signed in 
february 
this is a onesided step by the hungarian government the 
statement said although it has full authority to decide things 
on its territory it contradicts the valid czechoslovakhungarian 
contract and international law 
the dam is part of a project agreed to in 1977 to build canals 
and power stations off the danube in hungary and czechoslovakia 
prague has invested 11 billion to date in its gabcikovo dam 
and power station which is due to come on line this summer 
official criticism of the hungarian decision to halt 
construction and launch a twomonth review of it followed an attack 
in the communist party daily newspaper rude pravo 
in recent months the project had become an instrument for the 
opposition forces to cast doubts on past decisions of the countrys 
leadership rude pravo said 
in this atmosphere it added it will be difficult for the 
experts reviewing the nagymaros project to be objective 
the hungarian move highlights the contrasting politics in the 
two nations 
while opposition groups and political reform have gained 
increasing hold in hungary czechoslovakias authorities have 
rejected any role for unofficial organizations in its more cautious 
restructuring 
relations soured visibly over hungarian tvs unprecedented 
broadcast last month of an interview with former czechoslovak party 
leader alexander dubcek architect of the prague spring reforms 
in 1968 
the interview was dubceks first with official east bloc media 
since he was expelled from the czechoslovak communist party in 1970 
in the purge of almost half a million members by the current party 
leader milos jakes 
hungary ignored czechoslovak protests about the first broadcast 
with dubcek in midapril and transmitted a longer part of the 
threehour interview april 26 
journalist andras sugar who conducted the interview said in 
budapest last week he has received dozens of letters from slovaks 
who tuned in and approved of the broadcast 
hungarian communist party leader karoly grosz and jakes played 
down their political differences emphasizing pragmatic 
cooperation when grosz last visited prague in midfebruary 
but the nagymaros decision seems certain to cloud even economic 
cooperation while czechoslovakias decision to welcome romanian 
president nicolae ceausescu this week contrasts markedly with 
recent hungarian diplomacy 
hungary and romania are locked in a fierce dispute over the fate 
of the estimated 17 million ethnic hungarians in romania budapest 
has made increasingly outspoken attacks on ceausescus tough 
policies not just on ethnic issues but on human rights in general

the last soviets in afghanistan seem a 
forlorn group sticking close to their fortresslike embassy and 
complaining of waning influence even with the rulers their armed 
forces supported 
at the height of the red armys nineyear involvement in the 
afghan civil war an estimated 115000 soviet soldiers were in the 
country along with hundreds of political and military advisers 
fewer than 275 soviets remain and many are present only to feed 
and sustain the few officials left behind having failed to win the 
war for the marxist government it sponsored the kremlin has 
switched positions to that of peacemaker 
soviet military forces began pulling out of afghanistan on may 
15 1988 under a unmediated agreement 
since completing the withdrawal feb 15 moscow has been beating 
the diplomatic bushes from washington to islamambad and beijing 
urging that arms supplies to the moslem guerrillas be stopped and 
peace talks started 
the insurgents who began fighting after a communist coup in 
april 1978 have vowed to continue the war until the government 
falls 
we made mistakes we dont deny this said yuli m 
vorontsov the soviet first deputy foreign minister and ambassador 
to kabul afghanistan needs a respite from this war we need to 
stop pushing arms and start pushing them to the negotiating table 
in moscow on monday the soviet union once again accused the 
united states and pakistan of failing to comply with the agreement 
pravda the communist party newspaper said the americans and 
pakistanis signed the accord already having decided not to 
fulfill it for them the main goal was to gain the withdrawal of 
soviet soldiers from afghanistan 
it accused pakistan of sending thousands of its soldiers to help 
the guerrillas and of planning strategy for the insurgents 
soviet officials regularly criticize the two nations for 
continuing to supply arms to the insurgents 
although the geneva agreement calls for noninterference in 
afghanistan it does not specifically address supplying weapons 
the united states has said it will continue arming the guerrillas 
as long as the kremlin supplies weapons to the afghan military 
animosity developed as soon as the red army arrived in 
afghanistan in december 1979 
taxi drivers curse their battered moskvich cars merchants on 
chicken street a thriving strip of carpet shops antique dealers 
and food stores selling russian caviar and vodka speak of hatred 
for the soviets 
were glad theyre gone carpet dealer mohammad ghulam said 
whle washing the blue mercedes he parks in front of his shop 
they were not welcome here life has been better since they 
left 
government and military officials speak approvingly of the 
soviets but also try to keep their distance 
lets be honest a foreign ministry official said privately 
even though the soviet union gave us a lot of assistance there 
arent many afghans who consider the soviet union as a friend 
soviet representatives remaining in kabul spend most of their 
time inside their fortress in western kabul whose security has 
been compared to that of the us embassy in beirut 
the embassy compound is surrounded by a high wall equipped with 
double steel gates and remotecontrolled tv cameras 
supplementing the strong gate is a zigzag pattern of concrete 
blocks afghan soldiers in wooden guardhouse and on the road 
outside quickly pointing their automatic rifles at approaching 
visitors 
aside from contacts with afghan government officials the most 
common business of the embassy seems to be dealing with western 
reporters who seek background briefings 
over tea and bowls of nuts and raisins the soviets speak with 
some candor about their situation and the afghan military 
soviet bombs and missiles are being used to defend jalalabad 
which has been under guerrilla siege since early march a soviet 
military airlift is flying up to 50 planeloads of food and weapons 
a day to the eastern city 
a senior soviet official said however that he and his 
colleagues had trouble getting their views across to the afghans 
its like trying to plant a tropical plant in siberia he 
said we have the besttrained people but they have their own 
ideas about what they want to do and in which direction they want 
to go

at least 94 house democrats and 69 republicans 
had one or more of their aides working on their reelection 
campaigns last year while being paid from public money national 
journal said in its latest issue 
the washingtonbased magazine said in its may 13 edition that 
the practice may have been a violation of house rules 
the magazine said its investigation found that in 67 cases 
campaign managers for democrats running for reelection to the 
house received at least some income from official sources during 
the last half of 1988 it said 47 of these campaign managers were 
employed in the members district offices 
it said at least 39 republican campaign managers were drawn from 
the house staff 
overall the magazine said at least 40 percent of the 408 house 
members who sought reelection last november had one or more of 
their chief congressional aides serving in a top campaign post 
national journal said some of the aides took leave to do the 
political work but others worked for campaigns during vacation or 
after hours 
the magazine said the possible violations stem from the 
longstanding ambiguity in the house rules over the proper line 
between official duties and election work 
house regulations bar aides from campaign work during official 
work hours but the magazine quoted michael henry jr assistant 
chief of the houses finance office as saying there is no way 
for our office to determine if a staffer is doing campaign work 
the magazine said rep mike espy dmiss wrote to the house 
ethics committee on oct 3 asking if his use of office aides in his 
campaign raised any problems 
rep julian dixon dcalif chairman of the committee and rep 
john t myers of indiana the ranking republican replied on oct 
18 that there are no formal rules prohibiting a house aide from 
doing campaign work 
the letter however cited general guidelines and house rules 
which should be observed when this is done they suggested that 
espy keep separate documentation for the hours worked in each 
area 
the magazine said members who keep such records are not required 
to make them public 
national journal said robert bush who was espys administrative 
assistant last year served without salary as his campaign manager 
and received nearly 8000 from the campaign for reimbursement of 
travel and supplies 
karen hinton espys congressional press secretary held the 
same title for the campaign she received 2550 a month in house 
salary and nothing from the campaign the magazine said

about 240 black employees of 
mobil oil stopped work monday to protest the us companys failure 
to negotiate with their union prior to announcing the sale of its 
south african holdings the union said 
the chemical workers industrial union which represents about 80 
percent of mobils 1500 black employees in south africa said nine 
installations in johannesburg and other communities were affected 
by the work stoppage 
chris bonner a union official in johannesburg said she had not 
heard from shop stewards about whether the protest might continue 
tuesday she also said she did not know what effect the stoppage 
had on mobil operations 
there was no immediate comment from mobil 
the union plans to poll its members later this week to determine 
if they support a nationwide strike against mobil because of its 
refusal to negotiate the terms of its disinvestment 
the company announced april 28 it was selling its holdings in 
south afrivca to the general union mining corp a conglomerate 
known as gencor that owns a petroleum subsidiary 
mobil said gencor would not change employment practices and 
would honor all existing arrangements with the union but union 
officials nonetheless were angered saying mobil had rebuffed past 
attempts to open negotiations by insisting there were no plans for 
disinvestment 
the union had approached mobil and several other foreign 
companies in south africa asking for 12month advance notice of 
any pullout guarantees of job security amd full disclosure of the 
terms of sale 
scores of us companies have withdrawn from south africa in the 
past five years citing economic considerations and pressure from 
the antiapartheid movement

some students were a little blearyeyed 
after their long flight from japan but classes started on schedule 
today at the first fully accredited japanese high school in the 
united states 
the school in the eastern tennessee hills is intended for the 
children of japanese executives in the united states but all but 
one of the first class of 24 students came from families in japan 
school opened with a halfhour of christian values teaching and 
then classes started promptly at 840 am said hiroshi jo 
director of tennessee meiji gakuin high school 
i think theyre doing ok some of the kids have jet lag jo 
said 
last year meiji gakuin university in tokyo bought the former 
tennessee military institute in sweetwater for use as a japanese 
school the school is for students in grades 1012 
japanese executives in this country have said their children 
sometimes find it difficult to get into their native countrys 
colleges after getting their high school diplomas in the united 
states 
there are 71 japaneseowned operations in tennessee including a 
nissan auto plant in smyrna in central tennessee and a new 
nippodenso manufacturing usa auto parts plant in maryville not far 
from sweetwater 
so far however the school is attracting students from families 
in japan who want their children to have the experience of living 
abroad jo said he said he expected that to change and that most 
of the students eventually would be from japanese families working 
in the united states

congress forced by public opinion to deny 
itself a pay raise is about to go through an annual ritual that 
calls attention to how much it gets on the side 
the total is likely to match or exceed the 98 million reported 
last spring an amount 30 percent above the previous year in 
honoraria fees chiefly paid for making speeches 
under selfimposed rules members are allowed to take no more 
than 2000 per appearance senators may keep no more than an 
amount equal to 40 percent of their salaries or 35800 and house 
members no more than 30 percent or 26850 
the rest congress gives to charities last year members 
reported giving away 23 million and keeping 75 million during 
1987 
how much was accepted in 1988 comes clear soon senators will 
make public their financial disclosure forms on friday house 
members on monday 
the forms disclose speech fees and such matters as what stocks 
the members bought sold and own 
a move is gathering momentum to ban honoraria 
president bush said last month he would propose a ban when he 
resubmits a congressional pay raise proposal to congress but he 
said there was no point in recommending a raise again any time soon 
in light of the battering congress took in january when a public 
outcry forced it to vote down a 51 percent pay increase 
the commission that had proposed the pay raise coupled its 
recommendations with a call on congress to eliminate honoraria 
that call was endorsed last month by a commission bush created to 
study ethics issues 
the potential for abuse or the appearance of abuse is obvious 
to the public and public faith in the integrity of the members it 
elects is threatened by the steady growth in this practice the 
commission said 
it noted that speech fees are often paid by groups with a 
material interest in pending or anticipated legislation 
last year the defense industry alone paid more than 500000 in 
speaking fees to members of congressional committees that deal with 
defense issues 
when congress voted to reject the proposed pay raise it did 
nothing to crack down on honoraria 
common cause a private group that has campaigned for tougher 
ethical standards says more than 245 newspapers have editorialized 
for a ban calling the fees legalized bribery legislative 
prostitution and lobbyists payola 
rep barney frank dmass chairman of the house judiciary 
subcommittee that is considering new ethics laws said he favors a 
ban although he would allow members to continue such moonlighting 
activities as teaching a course in law school 
they started out legitimate but unfortunately some people 
abuse them frank says of honoraria some people solicit them 
ive stopped taking them 
a number of congressional freshmen also have decided not to 
accept honoraria they may have been mindful of last falls 
election results the six incumbent members of congress who were 
defeated all had ethical problems of one kind or another

the rate of coal mining fatalities matched a 
record low pace in the first quarter of 1989 while the rate of 
deaths in the noncoal mining sector was up from the same period 
last year the government said monday 
the labor departments mine safety and health administration 
reported 12 coal mining deaths in the first three months of this 
year compared with 11 during the same period last year but 
because of an increase in the number of hours worked in coal mining 
over last year the agency said the fatality rate matched last 
years record low of 003 for every 200000 hours worked 
for all of 1988 there were 52 reported coal mining deaths and 
48 noncoal mining fatalities the lowest ever reported 
the rate of nonfatal injuries in coal mining that involved lost 
work time in the first quarter was 736 injuries for 200000 
employee hours down from 832 in the first quarter of 1988 and 
below the 801 rate for all of last year 
in the noncoal sector there were 16 deaths in the first 
quarter up from 11 in that period of 1988 nonfatal injuries 
involving lost work time occurred at a rate of 416 for every 
200000 employee hours worked up from the 388 in the first three 
months of 1988 and 412 for all of last year

transportation secretary samuel skinner 
predicted monday that denver voters in a referendum tuesday will 
approve construction of the nations first major new airport in 15 
years and he suggested that other cities would be well advised to 
follow suit 
calling the denver plan the most creative aviation development 
project in many years skinner said local and federal officials 
including himself were sticking their necks out to support the 
project which is estimated to cost between 17 billion and 23 
billion 
owners of businesses who would be affected by abandonment of 
denvers 60yearold stapleton airport have hired political 
consultant roger ailes to help with a campaign against the new 
airport which is to be financed primarily from airport revenue 
ailes was the media wizard behind george bushs presidential 
campaign last fall 
skinner in a speech to a privatization conference said the new 
airport would make denvers economy the most exciting in the 
country 
its the right thing to do the creative exciting dynamic 
necessary thing to do skinner said adding that he expects the 
referendum on the airport to pass 
polls released last weekend by both denver newspapers indicate 
voters favor passage of the referendum by a 2to1 margin 
skinner noted the success of dulles international airport 
outside washington in attracting economic growth to virginia 
suburbs 25 miles from the capitol 
with the rapid growth of air travel the aviation industry is 
becoming increasingly concerned about the limited capacity of the 
nations airports the last major airport to open was the 
dallasfort worth international airport in 1974 
new airports have been discussed for new york chicago atlanta 
and los angeles but aviation industry experts say it will take 10 
years or more to build any airport once planning is begun 
the new denver airport would be built 17 miles from stapleton 
on the northeast edge of the city 
i just wish everybody in this country thought as big as the 
people in denver do on the new airport skinner said

a judge has ducked a chance to step into 
the middle of the annual snowball fight between students of rival 
colleges 
superior court judge john f moriarty tossed out a lawsuit in 
which amherst college sought to force the university of 
massachusetts trustees to stop their students from throwing 
snowballs at winters first snowfall 
moriarity said a court doesnt have the power to hold college 
trustees responsible for the offcampus antics of students with a 
juvenile propensity 
amherst officials contended that in the past three years the 
1500student private college has sustained 9352 in broken 
windows when students from the 25000student state university 
surged across the town common in december an amherst student was 
hospitalized after being hit in the eye with an icy missile 
amherst college has a security force of 10 and as such is not 
equipped to deal effectively with 2000 rioters from another 
institution the lawsuit said 
in his decision friday moriarty took a cold view of the 
property damage 
there have during the past several years been some true 
bullies among the crowd of students from the university he said 
but he added that students would have to be sued or prosecuted as 
individuals for specific acts 
most university students are technically adults although at 
least some of them obviously retain juvenile propensity he said 
so not even their parents much less university trustees can be 
held responsible for their offcampus antics 
amherst college president peter r pouncey said monday the 
college may appeal

president bush declaring that it was time to 
take back the streets announced today a 12 billion anticrime 
package highlighted by a ban on certain imported semiautomatic 
assault weapons and restrictions on domestic models 
bush said he would make permanent a 2monthold suspension on 
importation of the semiautomatic assaultstyle rifles if a 
government review finds they are not for sporting purposes as is 
required under current law 
the president outlined his proposals at a police memorial 
service outside the capitol before a raindrenched crowd of 
thousands huddled under umbrellas and plastic sheets or standing 
unprotected 
the audience included more than 700 relatives of the 161 
officers killed in the line of duty nationwide last year also 
present were uniformed officers from around the country 
bush turned away an aide offering an umbrella during the 
drizzling rain if it doesnt start clearing up he joked 
were issuing snorkels to everybody out there 
although many usmade models of semiautomatic weapons are 
virtually identical to their foreign competitors bush decided not 
to apply the same ban to the domestic market 
instead he took on the controversial issue from a different 
approach he proposed legislation to block manufacture transfer or 
sale of gun magazines capable of holding more than 15 rounds 
the president said that during the heated debate over 
guncontrol and semiautomatic weapons he has heard many opinions 
and voices including those of crime victims and families 
we gather today to respond to those voices and to honor the 
fallen by launching a new national strategy a partnership with 
americas cities and states to take back the streets he said 
bush noted the debate over how to distinguish criminally used 
assault weapons from those used for hunting and sport 
there is substantial controversy and debate on this point but 
one thing that we do know about these assault weapons is that 
they invariably are equipped with unjustifiably large magazines 
he said 
an administration official who briefed reporters on the package 
earlier shrugged off questions about why the domestic market was 
being treated differently than the imports when the weapons have 
the same firpower 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said only 
that existing import laws provide for a crackdown on the 
foreignmade models while new legislation which would likely 
involve a thorny and drawnout congressional battle would be 
needed for the domestic guns 
in trying to determine what set semiautomatic assault weapons 
apart administration officials found the large detachable 
magazines were a common factor 
thus domestic weapons while not banned from sale would be 
restricted by the 15round magazine ban 
the fact of the matter is nearly half the households in this 
country have guns the guns are already out there and the 
overwhelming majority are legitimately owned for legitimate 
pruposes bush said in his speech 
however he said 80 percent of all firearms used by felons are 
stolen or otherwise obtained unlawfully so let me be very clear 
about our response the right to own guns is not a license to harm 
others he said 
the presidents anticrime package contained several measures 
aimed at stiffer enforcement more federal officers and a crackdown 
on gun use among criminals 
among the provisions he proposed 
doubling the current fiveyear minimum sentence for using a 
semiautomatic firearm in commission of a crime 
the math is simple bush said anyone who uses a 
semiautomatic for crime or so much as has one on them during a 
crime will do an automatic 10 extra years in federal prison no 
probation no parole 
implementing the death penalty and designating the use of a 
firearm as an aggravating factor for determining whether the 
death penalty should be imposed 
spending 1 billion for new prison construction 
authorizing 825 new federal agents and staff in the bureau of 
alcohol tobacco and firearms us marshal service and fbi 
bush said our police need more help and im here today to 
tell you that were prepared to match rhetoric with resources and 
call on our cities and states to do the same 
blocking the practice of pleabargaining away charges of using 
a gun in commission of a federal crime bush urged state and local 
governments to similarly reform their laws so that anyone using a 
gun would be prosecuted for that charge 
requiring juveniles to be tried as adults for cases considered 
serious drug offenses under the armed career criminal statute 
strengthening laws against criminal access to firearms by 
expanding the existing ban on sales to people convicted of violent 
crimes to cover anyone convicted of violent misdemeanor offenses 
adding 1600 positions in the us attorneys office 
identifying government properties and facilities that can be 
converted to jails and prisons 
offering a 5 percent bonus to drug law enforcement grants to 
states that follow his standards on stiffening penalties for use of 
a gun in committing a crime 
on the assault weapons matter bush ordered the bureau of 
alcohol tobacco and firearms two months ago to review uses of 
imported semiautomatic assault weapons to determine if they are 
used for other than sporting purposes current law allows the 
imports for only that purpose but because of the sticky definition 
questions many have been allowed in that will be banned after the 
review administration officials said

the us industrial operating rate rose 
moderately to 839 percent in april but factories remain under 
less strain than when the year began the government said monday 
although the federal reserve boards report showed industry 
using more of its capacity last month it revised its figures for 
the first three months of the year to show less activity than 
previously reported 
this fits in with the general pattern of slowness said lyle 
gramley chief economist of the mortgage bankers association of 
america 
the capacity rate hit its most recent peak of 843 percent in 
december a 10year high the rate held steady in january and 
slipped in both february and march 
the report shows relatively sluggish growth but continued 
growth said economist david wyss of data resources inc a 
lexington mass consulting firm thats what you want to see at 
this stage of the business cycle 
economists had been concerned that the steady upward march of 
the rate through last year signaled intensified inflationary 
pressures a year ago the rate was 827 percent economists say an 
85percent rate clearly signals a pickup in inflation 
as operating rates near full capacity factories find it 
difficult to produce enough to meet demand that in turn can lead 
to shortages and price increases 
since march 1987 the central bank has been trying to ease 
inflationary pressures by raising interest rates mondays report 
is the latest in a series of government statistics indicating the 
strategy appears to be working particularly in housing which is 
sensitive to interest rate fluctuations 
total utilization appears to have eased slightly since 
january the central bank said adding the easing has 
shown up in many industries especially buildingrelated 
industries 
at manufacturing plants the operating rate rose a slight 01 
percentage point to 840 percent 07 percentage points lower than 
in january 
the rate at factories producing durable goods big ticket 
items expected to last three or more years rose from 824 percent 
to 826 percent in april reflecting increases at auto plants 
aerospace manufacturers and both electrical and nonelectrical 
machinery factories the rate slipped at factories producing 
primary metals such as steel and at fabricated metals plants 
at plants manufacturing nondurable goods the rate edged up 
from 861 percent to 862 percent last month 
in the mining sector which includes oil and gas drilling the 
operating rate jumped from 816 percent to 827 percent the 
highest since december economists said the increase likely was in 
response to crude oil prices which have risen steeply in recent 
months 
at utilities the rate held steady at 821 percent 
in a second report monday the federal reserve said the pace of 
industrial production rose 04 percent in april after holding 
steady in march and falling 03 percent in february the first 
decline in a year 
the feds industrial production index stood at 1411 percent of 
its 1977 base 42 percent higher than a year ago 
production rose 04 percent at manufacturing plants making both 
durable and nondurable goods output from mines and oil wells 
jumped 12 percent following a 10 percent rise in march but was 
still 14 percent lower than a year ago production at utilities 
edged up 01 percent after falling 05 percent a month earlier

solidarity leader lech walesa stumping 
for the opposition monday used the site of a famous peasant 
uprising against russia to urge farmers to vote for his candidates 
to the national assembly next month 
walesa wearing a folk costume with a feathered cap urged the 
crowd of 5000 not to boycott the elections as some are planning 
dont stand aside walesa said poland belongs to you and 
you have to make it better 
the visit to the countryside on pentecost monday a traditional 
farmers holiday was the latest campaign swing by walesa in 
solidaritys fight to elect its slate to the national assembly in 
balloting june 4 the first democratic voting in postwar poland 
walesa is a muchsought guest speaker by candidates for the 
solidarity citizens committee the group he set up to direct the 
oppositions campaign 
the crowd spread out at the raclawice battlefield near krakow in 
southern poland where peasant legions armed with scythes and 
commanded by tadeusz kosciuszko defeated a czarist army in 1794 
likening walesa to kosciuszko a hero of the american 
revolutionary war and the 1794 uprising against russia activists 
conferred on him the honorary title commander the title used 
by kosciusko during the uprising 
wearing a long white embroidered jacket and a fourcornered red 
hat with a peacock feather walesa arrived in an open horsedrawn 
carriage walking ahead of him were similarly dressed farmers 
carrying longhandled scythes 
walesa also held a scythe during his ride but when he mounted 
the speakers platform he laid it aside 
i am putting down the scythe so we can talk in a peaceful 
way he said 
poland has had its difficult path and you all know this but 
it is beautiful and can be even more beautiful 
sometimes you had to take up scythes and sometimes like 
today you have to turn the scythes into votes he said those 
votes are just as essential for poland 
at stake are 161 seats for which the opposition is allowed to 
run in the sejm the existing 460seat parliament and 100 seats in 
the senate a new legislative body that will be the first in the 
east bloc chosen entirely by democratic methods 
leaflets at the rally accused walesa of aiding the government 
and urged a boycott but the solidarity leader was interrupted with 
applause when he faced such charges head on 
it cannot be said that walesa was bought by the government 
i wasnt sold to anybody he said but i cannot always 
clench a knife between my teeth and chase the government because 
it wouldnt be nice 
he told people to support solidaritybacked candidates and also 
to look at the candidates for the 65 percent of the sejm being 
contested by people from the communist party and its allies 
among them are both really wonderful people and people who are 
much worse so we can also have influence on that you have to 
cross them out and leave the people who are better he said 
walesa struck a mild tone in the speech compared to a strongly 
anticommunist antirussian speech that preceded him local rural 
solidarity leader stefan jagla said raclawice in 1794 taught 
russia a lesson that they remember to this day 
the russian flag is all red and since the time when they 
adopted that flag there has always been bloodshed jagla said 
reminding listeners of the sovietgerman nonaggression pact at the 
start of world war ii let us hope that all of poland will turn 
white one day when it is taken over by white solidarity 
but walesa told the crowd that todays communists are not the 
same as the communists of the 1950s 
unlike stalinist times he said they dont imprison us and 
they allowed pluralism in poland the ruling system is the same 
but the people in it are different 
the hillside and field where the crowd sat was abloom in 
solidarity banners many men wore their sunday suits and women were 
in colorful peasant kerchiefs 
farmers with sunburned faces complained the state doesnt pay 
them enough for their milk and livestock that machinery is in 
short supply and that taxes are too high 
the party has stolen enough money now its time to stop 
them said marian popiolek of raclawice

the engineer and brakeman of a 
runaway train that killed four people and leveled a row of suburban 
homes had been cited previously for safety violations 
investigators said 
the 69car freight train carrying a sandy mineral used to make 
potash jumped the tracks at 90 mph friday morning when it failed to 
make a curve along a residential neighborhood trains normally slow 
to 30 mph for the curve 
engineer frank holland who survived the crash had been cited 
for exceeding maximum authorized speed while guiding a train on 
march 31 1986 and for failing to properly connect brake lines 
between locomotives on feb 13 1988 said james kolstad national 
transportation safety board acting chairman holland was listed as 
stable with a collapsed lung at st bernardine medical center 
brakeman allan r riess 42 of bakersfield who was killed in 
the crash had been cited for failing to take action in a case of 
an engineer exceeding authorized speed on oct 7 kolstad said 
sunday 
the conductor of the runaway southern pacific train es crown 
of bakersfield who also was killed had no violations on his 
record kolstad said 
it is not unusual after a number of years on the line for 
trainmen to have violations on their record ntsb spokesman ted 
lopatkiewicz said today 
investigators today were interviewing crew members and workers 
who loaded the train cars with sandy sodium carbonate a mineral 
used to make potash in rosamond he said 
southern pacific spokesman jerry pera declined to comment on the 
crew safety violations today saying the ntsb had asked the 
railroad not to talk about it while the investigation was under way 
salvage workers were lifting the last of the locomotives onto 
flatcars for movement out of the area pera said damage to the 
train and track was about 38 million 
the railroad plans to rebuild the embankment cut away for the 
salvage effort and replace the ruined portion of track the tracks 
could be back in service late tuesday pera said 
investigators also considered faulty brakes and possibly 
overloaded cargo hoppers as possible causes 
crew members may not have known how heavy their freight train 
was and may have miscalculated the braking capability during their 
descent from a 4109foot mountain pass lopatkiewicz said 
faulty brakes were found in one of four leading locomotives and 
one of two trailing engines in place to help slow the train down 
the grade lopatkiewicz said 
brakes were applied so hard during the fatal plunge that some 
were still hot more than 24 hours later he said 
the braking malfunction was possibly compounded by train cars 
loaded with more cargo than indicated on a shipping document 
lopatkiewicz said 
the document indicated that each of the hopper cars had about 
a twothirds load but we have witnesses that say some of the cars 
were loaded up to the edge he said 
the crew could have been handling the train under conditions 
they werent aware of and it would not have reacted the way they 
expected 
investigators planned to create a computer simulation program to 
evaluate how the train would have behaved under various conditions 
the spokesman said 
one locomotive recorder revealed that engineers began braking 
10 miles before the train jumped the tracks and had applied 
emergency brakes eight miles before the crash but the train 
continued to pick up speed 
shortly before the crash a crew member radioed an emergency 
distress call that the train was out of control at 90 mph 
investigators expected to spend about a week surveying the 
wreckage lopatkiewicz said 
six homes were leveled and five others damaged by freight cars 
and mounds of the sandy potash component 
also killed were stepbrothers jason h thompson 9 and tyson 
white 7 whose home was buried beneath a stack of box cars 
eight people were treated for injuries including three other 
members of the crew

state and federal officials today signed 
an agreement launching a 30year program to clean up millions of 
gallons of waste produced over 45 years at the hanford nuclear 
reservation 
gov booth gardners office also announced a 14month 
investigation to determine if the generation of liquid waste from a 
hanford plutonium processing plant should be halted sooner than 
planned 
the pact was signed after changes were made to cover cleanup of 
any hazardous waste that occurs when eight closed reactors are 
decommissioned 
the changes in the agreement were disclosed as gardner and 
representatives of the us department of energy and environmental 
protection agency signed the pact 
this agreement means that at long last we can begin a 
massive effort to clean up the 45 years of accumulated chemical and 
nuclear wastes at hanford gardner said 
energy secretary james watkins in a letter said cleanup was 
of utmost importance 
the agreement properly emphasizes the priority the department 
must attach to environmental compliance and cleanup efforts at 
hanford watkins wrote

du pont pharmaceuticals announced monday it 
has won food and drug administration approval for a preservative 
that triples the time livers and pancreases can be kept alive 
outside the body before transplant 
the company and scientists that developed the solution say it 
will allow more of these organs to be transplanted and give doctors 
more time to find the best match for recipients ensuring greater 
chances the patient will survive 
while previously livers had to be transplanted within 10 hours 
and pancreases within eight hours of being removed from a donor 
livers preserved in du ponts solution can be kept alive for more 
than 30 hours and pancreases up to 28 hours said dr folkert 
belzer of the university of wisconsin 
the solution also can preserve kidneys for up to 40 hours the 
same amount of time as conventional methods said belzer a 
professor of surgery who led the team of university of wisconsin 
researchers who developed the solution 
the new preservative tested in clinical trials at hospitals and 
transplant centers throughout the country has now allowed us the 
same safe preservation time for the liver and the pancreas which 
was previously only available for the kidney belzer said at a 
news conference with du pont officials 
the result he said is that transplantations of these organs 
dont require the haste and urgency previously needed this 
improves the safety of the transplant surgery since it can be 
scheduled with a full wellrested staff and assures better 
functioning organs after transplant 
the result is better postoperative recovery which reduces 
hospital time for the patient and lowers the overall cost of the 
operation belzer said 
the average hospital stay previously was six weeks for liver and 
pancreas transplant patients but belzers solution reduced that to 
about 20 days including one or two days in intensive care he said 
also longer preservation time allows patients to wait at home 
sometimes more than 1000 miles from a transplant center for a 
donor to be found instead of having to relocate temporarily often 
far away from their families to an area near a center 
though officials say there remains a critical shortage of organs 
for transplant extending the time they can be preserved will 
ensure that fewer are wasted said joseph mollica vice 
president of du pont pharmaceuticals 
last year 9123 kidney transplants 1680 liver transplants and 
243 pancreas transplants were performed in the united states 
according to the united network for organ sharing based in 
richmond va 
however about 14850 people are currently waiting for kidney 
transplants 738 are waiting for liver transplants and 223 people 
are waiting pancreas transplants according to the network 
the preservative was developed with financing by the national 
institutes of health and du pont it will be available on a 
commercial basis beginning june 1 company officials said 
researchers also are testing to determine whether the solution 
or a modification of it can extend the life of hearts and lungs for 
transplant

trainloads of soviet tanks and artillery started 
leaving mongolias border with china on monday the same day 
president mikhail s gorbachev arrived in beijing for the first 
sinosoviet summit in 30 years 
a soviet defense ministry spokesman said the timing of the two 
events was coincidental 
maj gen yuri markelov said the pullout is the second stage of 
a partial withdrawal from mongolia that in the next two years will 
involve 50000 troops that is about 75 percent of the force that 
has patrolled the border since the 1960s when relations between 
the soviet union and china reached their lowest point 
now we dont have such conditions markelov said at a news 
briefing 
the withdrawal is part of the overall reduction of 500000 
soviet troops that gorbachev promised the united nations in 
december 
about 50000 servicemen 5000 tanks 1000 infantry vehicles 
190 aircraft and 130 helicopter gunships will be withdrawn from 
mongolia markelov said 
the official tass news agency said more than 820 artillery 
systems will be dismantled 
it said the pullout has been brought about by new political 
thinking and better relations in the region 
last year an infantry division was withdrawn from mongolia 
markelov said this year a tank division and other military units 
will be pulled out and next year one infantry division and one 
tank division will be recalled he said 
the troops were stationed in mongolia at the request of the 
government and the withdrawal is also at the request of the 
mongolian government he said mongolia is a sovereign country 
and can determine itself the degree of security that is needed 
he said there had been one serious clash between soviet and 
chinese troops in 1969 and several minor incidents but he said he 
did not have exact data or casualty figures 
the soviet union began withdrawing troops from hungary on april 
25 and cuts are expected to begin shortly in east germany and 
czechoslovakia

a diplomatic dispute has developed between the 
united states and south korea over use of the word murderers in 
a state department condemnation of the death of a south korean 
student 
south korean diplomats have asked the united states to explain 
its comments made last week in response to reporters queries 
about the death of lee cholkyu in the southern city of kwangju 
students opposed to the government of roh taewoo who have been 
conducting protests to demand an investigation of lees death 
claim authorities killed the student dissident and distorted 
results of his autopsy 
doctors reported finding signs that lee had drowned but they 
said their autopsy conducted under supervision of college 
professors and opposition lawmakers did not show any sign of 
torture 
the state department last week called lees death a deplorable 
event we do not know who may have committed this atrocious act 
the statement said president roh had called for a full 
investigation of the case and we hope the murderers will be 
exposed and severely punished 
south korea contacted us after the statement appeared in 
several of korean newspapers said a us official they asked 
for a correction said the official who spoke on condition he 
not be named 
at the departments daily briefing for reporters monday a 
korean journalist asked whether the united states plans to retract 
the word murderers 
deputy state department spokesman richard boucher responded that 
we of course do not intend to prejudge the outcome of the 
investigation 
pressed again boucher said im not taking a position on how 
the tragic death occurred 
lee sang kyu a spokesman for the south korean embassy said it 
was very unusual for the state department to issue such a 
statement we told them they were prejudging the results he 
said

reformers won more seats in the new soviet 
parliament in a second round of voting according to results 
released monday with the most resounding victory going to a 
criminal investigator who alleged corruption at the highest levels 
prosecutor nikolai ivanov won the leningrad seat in sundays 
election with 61 percent of the vote against 33 opponents two days 
after saying in a televised debate that his investigation touched 
on politburo member yegor ligachev he made no specific charge 
but prodemocracy activists in the soviet unions secondlargest 
city opposed ivanov saying he used stalinist methods in his 
investigations 
other victors were reformers barred from the ballot on their 
first try including editor vitaly korotich whose magazine ogonyok 
has infuriated conservatives with sensational reports on the past 
and present 
the reformers success continued a trend started in the first 
round of elections march 26 which were the first nationwide 
multicandidate elections in the soviet union in 70 years repeat 
elections were held in 195 districts where voters were given a 
choice of only one or two candidates on march 26 and more than 50 
percent refused to elect anyone 
candidates backed by the prodemocracy peoples fronts in 
estonia latvia and the ukraine claimed victories peoples front 
officials in latvia said their candidates won five of the six races 
there 
korotich was tossed off the ballot in moscow in the first round 
by an election commission stacked with party hardliners he was 
elected this time in the supposedly conservative city of kharkov in 
the ukraine with about 80 percent of the vote against nine other 
candidates said lyudmilla merko assistant director of kharkovs 
electoral commission 
ivanov became the focus of debate in the closing days of the 
campaign in leningrad as the democracyoriented coalition that 
defeated top party officials in the first round mounted a campaign 
against the frontrunner ivanov was calling for a national 
commission to investigate corruption but his opponents said he 
would use illegal methods to coerce confessions 
ivanov and his partner telman gdlyan are famous throughout the 
soviet union for a lengthy investigation of corruption in the 
republic of uzbekistan gdlyan won a parliamentary seat in march in 
moscow 
gdlyan reportedly gave a 45minute speech on highlevel 
corruption at a closed meeting of the newly elected moscow deputies 
on may 3 and president mikhail s gorbachev reacted by suggesting 
that he had better be right 
i hope you sleep tonight gorbachev said according to 
several people at the meeting if you are right thats one 
thing but if you are lying this will not turn out to be the best 
day of your life 
on saturday the presidium the countrys highest executive 
body attacked ivanov and gdlyan in the party newspaper pravda 
accusing them of interfering with an investigation into their 
alleged abuses of power 
the soviet supreme court also has demanded that the soviet 
procurator generals office investigate whether gdlyan should 
remain on the job because of a botched investigation of an eminent 
estonian scientist the scientist died in jail and the court 
earlier this month overturned his conviction 
several key conservatives lost sunday including anatoly ivanov 
editor of the monthly molodaya gvardia the journal is noted for 
such articles as this months interview with josef stalins 
agriculture minister who defended the purges of the 1930s as 
necessary even though millions were killed 
the molodaya gvardia editor lost in the monastery town of 
zagorsk journalists alexander bovin and alexander krutov moved 
into a runoff election scheduled for sunday the quick turnaround 
will allow winners to take their seats when the new congress of 
peoples deputies opens may 25 
latvian prosecutor janis djdnitis a hardliner voted most 
unpopular latvian in a poll by a youth newspaper last year 
received 6 percent of the vote in a riga district reformer 
maveriks vulfsons won said janis trikulis a television editor 
klara hallik a college lecturer on ethnic relations backed by 
the estonian peoples front defeated both the editor of a 
communist party youth magazine and a student who called for 
withdrawal of soviet troops from the baltic 
a leader of the ukrainian peoples front economist vladimir 
chernyak advanced to the runoff against vitaly karpenko editor 
of the official newspaper vecherny kiev said lydia voronova a 
kiev election official 
in moscow one reformer won and another lost 
olympic weightlifting champion yuri vlasov considered to have 
a radical platform advanced to the second round along with 
journalist v shinkaretsky in the lublinsky region but glasnost 
champion and playwright mikhail shatrov lost in the kuntsovsky 
district to afghanistan war hero alexander rudskoy and a 
moskovskaya pravda editor v logunov those two advance to the

party and government officials by denying them seats in the new 
parliament candidate politburo member yuri f solovyov ran 
unopposed in one leningrad district and still lost

soviet tv news was 30 minutes into a lifeless 
report on president mikhail s gorbachevs visit to china when it 
switched from reporting formal greetings on monday to photographs 
of 150000 demonstrators 
the report did not explain that the protesters at beijings 
tiananmen square are seeking a more democratic society even though 
that is one of gorbachevs stated goals for the soviet union 
the first half hour of coverage featured several minutes of 
reporters backs and gorbachevs plane arriving in the distance 
and more than a minute of the soviet national anthem punctuated by 
an artillery salute 
but then the camera switched to scenes of teeming chinese 
streets and the reporter noted by tradition the ceremony of 
meeting a highranking guest takes place on the steps of the great 
hall of the people on tiananmen square 
but life sometimes differs from diplomatic protocol the 
reporter continued today the square looked like this 
cameras then focused on masses of demonstrators calmly packed 
into the square 
since nearly all their signs were in chinese it was difficult 
for soviet viewers to understand the point of the protest 
however one banner said in russian welcome to the initiator 
of glasnost gorbachevs policy of glasnost or openness in the 
media is one chinese protesters want their own leaders to adopt 
further comments and interviews with chinese citizens all 
concentrated on improving chinesesoviet relations 
the chinese people welcome gorbachev from the bottom of our 
hearts and souls said one man 
the evening newspaper izvestia said chinese students have been 
protesting recently but said nothing about the welcoming ceremony 
for gorbachev being switched from the great hall of the people to a 
nearby site gorbachevs motorcade route also was changed and his 
meeting with president yang shangkun delayed because of the protest 
most soviet coverage of the summit the first between a chinese 
and soviet leader in 30 years concentrated on improving relations 
between the superpowers izvestia and soviet tv also reported that 
other nations welcomed the rapprochement 
gorbachevs statement that the kremlin has been partly to blame 
for three decades of bad feeling was not reported

eight explorers caught a 
ride back to civilization on monday after walking to the north pole 
to call attention to the threats facing its fragile ecology 
three aircraft met the adventurers at the north pole and carried 
them to eureka where they were to travel to a larger plane to 
their base camp in resolute by late monday 
bad weather prevented a plane from picking up the team after it 
reached the north pole on sunday said wendy white an expedition 
spokesman in ottawa but aircraft and support team caught up with 
the explorers on monday 
the international expedition called icewalk planted a un 
flag at the north pole at 438 am edt on sunday organizers said 
its enough to know weve done it british explorer robert 
swan icewalks leader said in a message sent out by radio and 
released here but its not over yet not until we are out of 
here 
the team included darryl roberts 23 of new york city who 
organizers said is the first american to walk to the north pole 
swan who walked to the south pole with two other men in 1986 
became the first man to walk to both poles 
the adventurers left cape aldrich on ellesmere island in 
canadas northwest territories on march 20 they made their journey 
to draw attention to the environmental hazards such as pollution 
and the global warming that are facing the fragile arctic 
the expedition was hampered by warmer than expected spring 
temperatures that produced some open water 
the expedition covered a 457mile direct route but making a way 
through the ice and drift along the way made it closer to a 
620mile trek 
icewalk has a highpower public relations operation promoting it 
and corporate sponsorship supporting its 4 million budget 
it differs from other arctic expeditions because it uses only 
human power to travel and take supplies along in sledges carrying 
some 250 pounds of cargo each they dont use dogsleds or 
skimobiles 
the icewalk team includes eight men from britain canada the 
united states the soviet union japan australia and west germany

nonprescription sunglass companies will be 
shedding light on their eyewear with food and drug administration 
approval monday of a uniform labeling system 
the labeling which is voluntary will tell consumers how much 
protection overthecounter sunglasses provide from harmful 
ultraviolet light 
information on ultraviolet or uv rays generally has not been 
available for nonprescription sunglasses and the fda said price 
and darkness of lens does not guarantee uv protection 
the labeling will provide consumers with uniform information on 
the protection provided from both uva and shorter wavelength uvb 
rays and will recommend uses depending on the amount of protection 
excessive exposure to ultraviolet light can cause a painful 
injury called photokeratitis which is similar to snow blindness 
and has been associated with cataracts which cloud the lens of the 
eye and damage to the retina 
the labeling was developed by the sunglass association of 
america and the fda 
under the labeling system sunglasses that block at least 70 
percent of sunlight uvb 20 percent of uva radiation and 60 percent 
of visible light will be recommended as cosmetic sunglasses for 
aroundtown use 
general purpose sunglasses block 95 percent of uvb rays at 
least 60 percent of uva radiation and from 60 percent to 92 percent 
of visible light under the labeling system their shades range 
from medium to dark and are recommended for use in a sunny 
environment such as boating driving flying or hiking 
sunglasses classified as special purpose block at least 99 
percent of uvb 60 percent uva and 97 percent of visible light and 
are recommended for use in bright sunshine such as on ski slopes 
and tropical beaches 
the fda warned that sunglasses should not be used for protection 
against uv from tanning lamps or other artificial tanning sources 
special goggles are required for protection from the penetrating uv 
light in these sources

charismatic presidentelect built a rapport with workers that 
returned the peronist party to power after a long absence 
the 58yearold governor of tiny la rioja province on sunday 
became the first peronist to be elected president in 16 years the 
last one was party founder juan d peron who returned from an 
18year exile to win 64 percent of ballots in 1973 
on sunday night supporters filled a broad downtown avenue to 
sing chant and jump for joy many carried blue and white argentine 
flags bearing pictures of a smiling menem with shoulderlength 
hair and muttonchop sideburns reminiscent of a 19th century 
political caudillo 
not a necktie was in sight as factory workers and gauchos 
cowboys from the rich pampas sang the peronist anthem peron 
peron how great you are 
menems election is a return to our roots said truck driver 
alejandro galindez 27 as he and his girlfriend joined the 
flagwaving crowd 
menem has addressed only vaguely how he might pull argentina 
once one of the worlds wealthiest nations from its 35 percent 
monthly inflation 59 billion foreign debt unemployment and 
social tensions 
in his victory speech he called for national unity and 
urged the forces of production businessmen farmers workers 
everyone to put aside differences and set the country in 
motion 
menem pledged to put an end to the argentina where some live 
well doing nothing and others live badly although they work all 
day 
as he spoke menem was flanked by his wife zulema 46 daughter 
maria eva 17 and son carlos 21 
menem who likes to drive race cars and be photographed with 
showgirls was born and raised in la rioja a poor arid and 
sparsely populated province of 200000 some 688 miles northwest of 
buenos aires the principal products are olives grapes and jojoba 
the son of syrian immigrants who came to argentina early in the 
century and built a prosperous vinyard and winery menem was 
educated in provincial public schools 
graduating from law school in 1955 one of menems first cases 
was the defense of peronists arrested following the military ouster 
of peron in september 1955 
although the peronist party was barred from political activity 
menems law office quickly became a provincial peronist meeting 
place and he was arrested for participation in a political 
demonstration 
a natural showman menems star rose rapidly and after almost 
two decades of work with the party he was elected to the first of 
his three terms as governor of la rioja in 1973 
although his parents were moslems menem converted in 1964 to 
roman catholicism the religion of most argentines and required by 
the constitution for all presidents his wife also of syrian 
origin has said she prefers to remain a moslem 
its easy for me to communicate with people menem has said

prime minister miklos nemeth of hungary 
said monday that poland has taken the lead in political reforms but 
that his country was ahead of its warsaw pact ally in reforming the 
economy 
nemeth met with polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski and prime 
minister mieczyslaw f rakowski and had deep discussions on 
ways to achieve democratic reforms nemeth told a news conference 
what was very useful to me was to learn about the experiences 
of the polish hosts in the preparation for the switch over to 
pluralism said nemeth who arrived sunday for his 24hour trip 
pluralism is a word often used by east bloc officials to signify 
democracy 
the hungarian leader said the polish governments accord with 
the solidarityled opposition were a historic event 
the april 5 pact resulted in the legalization of the independent 
trade union after a sevenyear ban and provide for partially 
democratic elections in june to the national assembly 
nemeth said that hungary was ahead of poland in implementing 
economic reforms such as reducing state subsidies to enterprises 
he called for more joint ventures between the two countries but he 
said poland had taken the lead politically 
when asked if the two sides had discussed the situation in east 
germany and czechoslovakia east block nations that are resisting 
reform nemeth said the leadership of each country is responsible 
to its own people 
but he criticized hungarys neighbor romania for its treatment 
of hungarian german and other minorities 
hungarianromanian relations in the last year have 
deteriorated due to no fault of ours nemeth said when asked if 
the two sides had discussed romania 
he said romania does not guarantee its citizens basic human 
and civil rights and that little progress had been made in 
settling their differences

state and federal officials signed a 
landmark 30year agreement monday to clean up radioactive and 
hazardous waste at the hanford nuclear reservation the 
governments most contaminated weapons complex 
a citizens group charged that the pact doesnt provide the money 
to do the job 
with 5 billion cubic yards of waste the 560squaremile hanford 
reservation is the us department of energys most contaminated 
weapons production site hanford produced much of the plutonium for 
the nations nuclear weapons arsenal 
estimates of the cost of cleaning up wastes that date to the 
world war ii manhattan project run to 50 billion 
ken morgan a doe spokesman in richland said the agency has 
agreed to seek the money to meet milestones in the agreement but 
hasnt set specific figures 
the agreement calls for removing billions of gallons of 
radioactive waste with work to be completed by the year 2018 
key items include disposing of more than 14 million gallons of 
waste by converting it into a concretelike substance by 1994 
removing liquid waste from dozens of old storage tanks many of 
which have leaked by 1995 and building a 1 billion plant to 
convert radioactive waste into a glasslike substance for shipment 
to a national highlevel waste dump by 1999 
this agreement means that at long last we can begin a 
massive effort to clean up the 45 years of accumulated chemical and 
nuclear wastes at hanford said gov booth gardner 
energy secretary james watkins in a letter said cleanup 
agreement properly emphasizes the priority the department must 
attach to environmental compliance and cleanup efforts at 
hanford 
but critics said the agreement doesnt guarantee congress will 
appropriate the money 
this is fertile ground for cynicism said jim thomas of the 
spokanebased hanford education action league without 
congressional support for money the agreement is not worth the 
paper its written on 
the bush administration has proposed spending 367 million in 
1990 for waste management and environmental restoration at hanford 
the last plutonium reactor at hanford was shut down last year 
but several plants at hanford are still processing irradiated fuel 
stockpiles into nuclear weapons material the stockpile is expected 
to be exhausted by the mid1990s

an unmarried pakistani man an iranian 
mother living in west germany and a bachelor from kuwait were 
announced monday as among 20000 winners of a ticket to the 
american dream 
the lucky winners of the state departments first visa 
lottery randomly granting entry into the united states were 
chosen earlier by computer from among 32 million foreign 
applicants for us immigrant visas in march 
i cant imagine another country opening up its borders for 
this kind of opportunity said rep howard l berman dcalif 
and the chief house sponsor of the legislation that created the 
lottery last fall 
during a modest ceremony in a private computer firms cinder 
block warehouse in this washington suburb berman opened three 
lottery winners envelopes selected at random from long rows of 
bluefaced file cabinets 
the first winner he said was a 36yearold man without wife or 
children from the pakistani village of khazana the pakistani 
embassy said there are two villages named khazana both near the 
northwestern border with afghanistan 
the second envelope opened by berman yielded the application 
form of a 45yearold woman from iran now living in west germany 
with her only child the third winner was identified as a single 
27yearold kuwaiti man 
the winners names will be kept secret until they are officially 
notified by the nearest us diplomatic post in their home 
countries the process could take several months officials said 
if they havent heard by october they should know they 
havent been selected said frances jones of the state 
departments consular affairs office 
visas for the 20000 winners will be effective over the next two 
years 10000 for entry in the fiscal year beginning next oct 1 
and the remaining 10000 in fiscal 1991 which starts oct 1 1990 
notice of the visa lottery which was relayed to citizens of 162 
foreign countries by radio television newspaper and even 
messengers riding outrigger canoes produced scenes resembling 
riots at some us embassies and consulates around the world from 
senegal to sicily and morocco to malaysia 
in cairo the embassy was forced to shut down and police were 
summoned to handle a crowd of 2000 seeking visa information the 
embassy in dacca bangladesh reported that everyone from 
university professors to rickshaw drivers inquired about applying 
officials in casablanca morocco distributed 5000 information 
sheets in three days 
berman said the overwhelming response during the monthlong 
application period in march was testimony to where the american 
dream stands for the people of the world 
berman who represents los angeles said his father joseph 
berman 81 immigrated from poland in 1920 got a degree from new 
york university and settled in california in the 1930s as a textile 
wholesaler to clothing manufacturers the elder berman still lives 
in orange county calif 
bermans legislation was intended to improve the geographical 
balance among immigrants current law which imposes an annual 
ceiling of 270000 immigrants worldwide favors certain countries 
such as mexico korea india and the philippines because preference 
is given to applicants whose relatives already live in the united 
states 
the visa lottery was open to virtually anyone except those from 
13 countries that used more than 5000 immigrant slots each last 
year 
the lottery winners are not covered by the 270000 immigrant 
ceiling but they still must satisfy the same basic eligibility 
requirements that apply to all prospective immigrants 
anyone with a dangerous contagious disease a criminal 
conviction or membership in the communist party or other forbidden 
political organizations will be excluded 
those who are awarded a visa and enter the united states can 
apply for citizenship later if they meet strict criteria ms jones 
said

secretary of state james a baker iii said on 
monday the changes taking place in the soviet union are real and 
truly revolutionary and that soviet leaders are now singing 
out of our hymn book 
baker also said that he believes the west has nothing to fear 
from warmer relations between the soviet union and china which he 
said could enhance world stability 
but baker also said that the soviets unilateral reductions in 
shortrange nuclear arms in europe announced during his 
conversations in moscow last week with soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev represent only a very small step 
this is something the united states has been wanting the 
soviets to do for a very long time baker said noting the 
significant imbalance in such weapons between nato and the warsaw 
pact 
but he faulted gorbachevs proposal as failing to offer to 
dismantle or destroy the 500 shortrange missiles involved or 
even to take them out of europe 
he said that while they will be pulled out of the territory of 
warsaw pact nations they will remain in new positions in the 
european part of the soviet union 
commenting in an appearance on capitol hill before a constituent 
forum sponsored by sen christopher dodd dconn baker said the 
significance of his moscow meetings is that the united states is 
now reengaged with the soviets across the entire spectrum of 
issues facing the two superpowers 
during a threehour meeting with baker last thursday gorbachev 
outlined at length his plans for restructuring the soviet economy 
and the difficulties he is encountering 
baker was effusive in hailing that restructuring in comments 
that appeared significantly less restrained than his 
somewhatguarded approach earlier in the bush administration 
what is going on in the soviet union is truly revolutionary 
when you consider the economic and political system they have had 
for the last 70 years baker said 
its light years away from where they were a few years ago 
he said its important to recognize that what is going on is 
real 
but baker again cautioned that the success of change in the 
soviet system rests not on what the west can do to help but on how 
soviet citizens respond to what is really fundamental change 
he said again that the west should conduct normal twoway trade 
with the soviets but should not subsidize it in any way 
responding to questions baker was asked why the united states 
is not responding more fully to gorbachevs foreign policy 
initiatives but is instead waiting to see what happens 
i would argue with you that we are not just waiting baker 
replied 
generally speaking we have reengaged across the full range of 
issues the russians are coming our way theyre singing out of our 
hymn book 
they are unilaterally reducing military forces he said 
weve been calling on them to do this for years theyre 
saying that their economic and political system has failed theyre 
having elections theyre trying to open up politically and 
economically 
clearly they are coming in our direction and we ought to 
welcome that baker said 
but dont let down our guard he added 
asked about gorbachevs summit meeting in beijing the first 
such event in 30 years baker said he does not believe it 
represents a threat to western interests 
i dont see the risk of a rapprochement of the type that took 
place years ago when the chinese and the soviets were pretty much 
in opposition to the united states he said 
i think it could be healthy for world stability he said of 
the meeting it helps to remove troops from either side of the 
sinosoviet border 
i dont think we should be worried about the visit and we in 
fact are not baker said

the soviet union accused the united states and 
pakistan on monday of ignoring virtually the entire agreement on 
afghanistan since the first soviet soldiers left one year ago 
pakistan and the united states practically fully ignored their 
obligations on all points of the geneva agreement leading to the 
withdrawal of the soviet soldiers said the communist party daily 
pravda 
it charged that the two countries signed the agreement already 
having decided not to fulfill it for them the main goal was to 
gain the withdrawal of soviet soldiers from afghanistan 
the agreement was signed by pakistan the united states the 
soviet union and afghanistan on april 14 1988 and the first 
soviet soldiers were withdrawn on may 15 1988 the last left 
afghanistan on feb 15 nine months later

were in the country before the withdrawal more than 13000 soviet 
soldiers died and 35000 were wounded 
moslem guerrillas supported by the united states and pakistan

since the withdrawal but have failed pravda said the army of 
afghan president najib was fighting better and had better spirit

fight with antimarxist afghan guerrillas and planning the 
guerrillas strategy it charged that pakistan was trying to turn 
afghanistan into a satellite 
after the withdrawal our southern neighbor found itself 
facing a widening direct military aggression on the part of the 
pakistani military and reactionary regimes cooperating with them 
pravda said 
the communist party daily said pakistans course posed a 
serious threat to regionial peace and international security 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman vadim perfiliev at a regular

the us marshals service started evicting 
tenants monday from 300 public and private housing units where 
illegal drugs sales were suspected 
we matched up eviction orders with intelligence 
information indicating that those are the centers of drug activity 
crack houses said steve boyle spokesman for the us 
marshals service 
the bush administration has decided to take on the districts 
drug problem and earlier this month unveiled a program that 
includes evicting drug offenders from federally funded housing 
projects 
in the district of columbia the marshals carry out evictions 
ordered by the dc superior court boyle said mondays action 
while not part of the federal plan was partially in response to 
the federal focus on drugrelated crime in the district 
we took a look at our resources and decided that we could use 
our eviction rule to deal with the problem locally he said 
although boyle conceded that the antidrug evictions were not a 
cureall he said the objective was to return control of the homes 
to the owners and to give neighbors a break from the drug 
trafficking 
a total of 1625 apartments in the city are awaiting evictions 
he said those are typically the result of legal actions initiated 
by the owners of rental property against renters who failed to pay 
their rent or damaged the property about 300 of the residences 
have been identified as crack houses 
about 20 percent of the residences involved in the evictions 
were public housing while 80 percent were private apartments said 
boyle 
authorities said the evictions will continue over the next few 
days until the 300 families on the list have vacated their homes

cyprus is suing an indiana art dealer for 
the return of ancient mosaics looted from a cypriot church after 
the island was invaded by turkey a deputy state attorney general 
said monday 
this is considered a test case and we are lucky it is being 
held before an american court we have full confidence in american 
justice said michael kyprianou who will represent the cyprus 
government before an indiana state court in the case starting may 
30 
cyprus is determined to use all legal means in order to secure 
the return of our countrys cultural heritage and the case brought 
against ms goldberg is proof of this determination kyprianou 
said 
the kanakaria mosaics named for the church they graced date 
from the sixth century and depict the virgin mary cradling the 
infant jesus they are considered unique and the ghetty museum 
reportedly has offered indiana dealer peg goldberg 20 million for 
them 
ms goldberg maintains she has legal title because she bought 
the mosaics for 1 million from aydin dikmet a turkish dealer 
based in munich 
the cyprus government and the orthodox church of cyprus which 
have lodged the case jointly argue the title is invalid and the 
mosaics were stolen during systematic plundering of churches in 
northern cyprus 
these mosaics priceless examples of byzantine art are 
irreplaceable aspects of our countrys cultural heritage they were 
literally ripped off the walls of the church sometime after the 
turkish invasion of cyprus kyprianou added 
turkey seized the northern part of the eastern mediterranean 
island in july 1974 after a shortlived coup by supporters of union 
with greece 
athanasis papageorgiou the acting director of cypriot 
antiquities who will fly to indiana with kyprianou said that 
unfortunately since the 1974 invasion several gangs of turks have 
been removing wall paintings mosaics and icons from churches in 
the turkish occupied region and trying to sell them abroad 
some looted treasures has been recovered with the help of 
interpol he said 
abbot paul of macheras will fly to indiana to represent the 
orthodox church which he said is the physical owner of the 
mosaics and other looted treasures 
the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe announced 
last week it will send a special mission to cyprus next month to 
investigate the extent of the destruction of the islands heritage 
in the turkishoccupied region 
a report submitted to the assembly last week said 30 churches in 
turkishoccupied cyprus were stripped of their icons wall 
paintings and other liturgical objects and have been converted into 
mosques 
the report said another 17 churches were used by the turkish 
army and 45 were converted to stables or warehouses

the rothschild banking dynasty 
which has its roots in frankfurts jewish ghetto plans to reopen 
an office in this financial capital after an 88year absence the 
city treasurer said monday 
mayer amschel rothschild the son of a jewish moneychanger in 
the frankfurt ghetto started the family financial empire in the 
18th century 
rothschild family members later expanded the banking business to 
vienna london naples and paris building strength with the help 
of huge international loans the frankfurt office was closed in 
1901 as the citys role as a financial center temporarily waned 
we are especially pleased that a banking house that was 
founded here during the jewish epoch is now returning said city 
treasurer ernst gerhardt we feel it is a special honor 
he said rothschild plans to open an office with about 20 people 
this summer 
its a representative office of the two houses london and 
zurich gerhardt added nm rothschild and sons is located in 
london while rothschild bank ag is based in zurich the 
rothschilds also have a bank branch in paris gerhardt said the 
rothschilds eventually hope to found a full branch office in 
frankfurt with several hundred employees 
frankfurt is expected to take on even greater prominence when 
european community countries eliminate internal trade barriers in 
1992 
the rothschilds once were the leading financial family in 
frankfurt 
last november west germanys only museum devoted to jewish life 
and culture opened in the rothschild palace on the banks of the 
main river in frankfurt 
exhibits range from documentation of the jewish traditions in 
the city to the horrors of the nazi holocaust that claimed the 
lives of 6 million european jews 
rothschild knows where its coming from and frankfurt knows 
which traditions it has that was left unsaid during the 
discussions gerhardt said of the lengthy talks leading to the 
banks decision but it never caused a problem 
we see it as a sign of the orientation of old jewish families 
who remember frankfurt he added 
the rothschilds had lived in frankfurt since the middle ages and 
the familys original house was destroyed by allied bombers during 
world war ii 
the family gained prominence by financing such massive projects 
as european railroads and the british military campaign that led to 
the final defeat of napoleon bonaparte at waterloo in june 1815 
its political and financial power reached enormous heights 
during the first half of the 19th century 
members of the family also have become philanthropists art 
patrons and sportsmen 
the associated press tried to contact rothschild bank in zurich 
for further comment but the swiss office was closed for a holiday

the bush administration will strictly police 
industry efforts to find substitutes for ozonedepleting chemicals 
to make sure proposed replacements are safe an environmental 
protection agency official said monday in announcing the policy 
change 
william rosenberg assistant administrator of air and radiation 
told a house hearing that the agency will now require chemical 
firms to report results of health and safety tests of the 
substitutes and would not hesitate to order additional testing if 
warranted 
rep john d dingell dmich chairman of the house energy and 
commerce investigations subcommittee said throughout the hearing 
that he was concerned the epa was rushing to approve alternatives 
to chlorofluorocarbons cfcs without ensuring their safety 
the congressional general accounting office sharply rebuked epa 
two months ago saying the agency was relying too much on voluntary 
cooperation by the chemical industry to provide epa with test 
results on proposed substitutes 
it is a bit of shift said epa spokesman chris rice it 
means were taking the affirmative step of requiring firms to 
report data on toxicity of cfc substitutes 
an epa source speaking only on condition he not be named said 
we were taking lot of grief we didnt think the grief was 
justified and were taking the path of least resistance 
rosenberg also insisted at the hearing that the united states 
would not create a new environmental problem by rushing to 
approve substitutes that were unsafe to humans or the environment 
dingell held the hearing to assess progress of the montreal 
protocol an international agreement that commits the united states 
and other signers to a 50 percent reduction in production and 
consumption of cfcs by 1998 
president bush has said the united states prefers to negotiate 
with signatory countries a total phaseout by the end of the 
century if safe alternatives are available 
dingell appeared angry when rosenberg said he didnt know 
whether the bush administration would continue to back a total 
phaseout if safe alternatives are unavailable 
isnt that the kind of question you should know the answer to 
before we go negotiating dingell asked 
rosenberg said the administration still planned to siphon off 
245 billion over the next three years from profits of companies 
making cfcs a deficitreduction proposal that has infuriated 
chemical producers 
the epa official said he expects that without the measure 
manufactures of cfcs would reap windfall profits as production 
declined in accordance with the montreal agreement while demand 
remained high until substitutes were massproduced 
dingell argued that japan instead of taxing its cfc 
manufacturers is giving them subsidies 
the japanese are going to be able to compete much better on 
cfcs dingell said they tend to be very smart folks the 
japanese when competing with the united states 
cfcs are chemicals that are nontoxic when released into the 
atmosphere but 10 to 100 years later when they rise 1520 miles 
to the stratosphere their chemical bonds break apart 
scientists say their chlorine atoms destroy ozone allowing more 
of the suns ultraviolet rays to reach earth causing more skin 
cancer and eye cataracts and suppressing human immune systems

the state department on monday criticized a 
bill that would cut off aid to cambodian opposition groups fighting 
to end vietnams occupation of their country 
the bill sponsored by sen claiborne pell dri chairman of 
the senate foreign relations committee would stop aid to factions 
headed by prince norodom sihanouk pell want to stop the funding 
out of concern that the money would strengthen the khmer rouge one 
of sihanouks coalition partners which killed up to 2 million 
cambodians when it ruled the country in the 1970s 
the bush administration believes us aid to the coalition 
should be increased in a bid to ensure that vietnam fulfills a 
promise to end its 10year occupation of cambodia by september 
the administration shares fully the strong concern of congress 
regarding the khmer rouge said state department spokesman 
richard boucher we are unalterably opposed to their taking 
control again in cambodia 
but the best way to achieve this boucher added is through a 
negotiated settlement which would include effective measures 
including an international peacekeeping force to constrain the 
khmer rouge 
sihanouk and the noncommunist resistance are central to the 
successful negotiation of a settlement by weakening the 
noncommunist resistance the prospect of a political settlement is 
reduced and the chances of civil war increased as does the threat 
of a khmer rouge return to dominance boucher said

antidrug groups have started a petition 
drive to get a tougher marijuana law on the books in alaska the 
only state where smoking a joint at home is legal 
for 14 years alaska law has not prohibited adult use or 
possession of less than 4 ounces of marijuana in ones home in the 
rest of the country marijuana use at home can bring penalties 
ranging from a citation to six years in prison 
opponents of alaskas law say it sends the wrong message to 
young people in a state where alcoholism and drug abuse rates are 
among the highest in the nation 
but repeated attempts to restore criminal penalties have failed 
when the legislature adjourned its 1989 session last week three 
such bills were stuck in committee although they can be taken up 
again next year 
the antidrug groups petition drive is aimed at getting a new 
law on the 1990 ballot 
the time has come for us to take this matter into our own 
hands said marie majewske a retired teacher and leader of the 
initiative 
when you have students from 60 different high schools in the 
state coming up with a resolution unanimously to ask the 
legislature to recriminalize marijuana it seems to me thats a 
real cry for help she said theyre asking for help and were 
just sitting by and doing nothing 
part of the difficulty in changing alaskas liberal approach 
toward marijuana is that it resulted from court order not 
legislative design 
alaskas supreme court ruled in 1975 that the states marijuana 
laws were unconstitutional in prohibiting possession of small 
amounts at home the ruling was based on the alaska constitutions 
strong privacy clause adopted by voters in 1972 
the court said that while the state had a right to protect the 
public health and welfare its interest in prohibiting the use of 
marijuana did not justify intruding upon an individuals privacy at 
home 
possession outside the home is illegal having less than an 
ounce in public is punishable by a fine of up to 100 having more 
than 1 ounce but less than 8 without intent to sell can bring a 
1000 fine and 90 days in jail 
the supreme court said evidence of marijuanas health dangers in 
1975 was inconclusive but added that proof of a health threat could 
justify a ban on possession at home 
as a result legislative efforts have centered on new evidence 
of marijuanas dangers with such issues as lung cancer addiction 
or mental harm 
some legislators dispute the findings and say marijuana is no 
more harmful that many legal drugs 
we dont treat all of our drug problems the same clearly 
said sen pat pourchot we have different standards for alcohol 
and nicotine use than we do for marijuana 
the alaska attorney generals office concluded in a bill 
analysis that recriminalizing home use of marijuana would result in 
only a few hundred cases a year 
but it said the cases would be costly to prosecute because the 
defendants would likely be middleclass people who can be 
expected to vigorously resist having a criminal record 
backers of recriminalization say it is hypocritical to tell 
young people that marijuana is bad for them while the state allows 
their parents to get stoned at home 
by legalizing any amount of marijuana youre putting it on the 
same side of tobacco and alcohol and were having enough problems 
with those now majewske said 
doug mcvay a spokesman for the national organization for the 
reform of marijuana laws in washington said prohibition does not 
stop marijuana use and alaskas approach allows users to avoid 
associating with criminals by growing small amounts at home 
in the other states there is no means for access to marijuana 
except through the black market or by resorting to violating the 
law he said 
for majewske the issue is alaskas children i just finally 
reached a point where i just found too many of our bright kids 
losing interest and their passion for life because of the joint 
they take on the weekend she said

iraq has repaired its warbattered deep 
water persian gulf oil terminal and will start oil exports from it 
next month a cabinet minister said monday 
two of the four loading jetties at the bakr port have been fully 
repaired and are operational transport and communications minister 
mohammad hamza said exports begin june 1 at 800000 barrels per 
day he said 
restoration of the full prewar export capacity of 16 million 
barrels daily will take at least four more months hamza said 
during the eightyear iraniraq war the terminal was badly 
damaged and iraq was forced to export oil by piping it through 
turkey and saudi arabia and transporting it by truck through 
jordan the war halted with a unmediated ceasefire on aug 20 
still under repair however are the undersea pipelines 
connecting southern oil fields to the northern persian gulf 
terminal 30 miles southeast of umm qasr shipping sources said 
the shattalarab waterway iraqs main outlet to the sea is 
still clogged with war debris iraq is clearing a 15mile stretch 
around basra of unexploded shells and wrecked ships but work is 
slow because of the lack of technical expertise and the large 
number of unexploded shells diplomatic sources said 
a joint effort between iraq and iran to clear the waterway is 
one of iraqs principal demands in peace talks with its neighbor 
ten new jetties have been built in the umm qasr port since the 
ceasefire and iraq signed contracts with a local company to build 
13 others in khour alzubair terminal about 10 miles north 
shipping officials said 18 wrecked ships were cleared from the 
port which has returned to its prewar capacity of eight million 
tons of cargo yearly the new jetties will bring capacity up to 12 
million tons a year sources said

foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher said monday that west germanys position must carry 
special weight in the decision on whether to upgrade nato 
shortrange missiles 
in an interview with radio luxembourg he pressed his campaign 
for quickly convening a superpower disarmament forum aimed at 
reducing shortrange missiles based in europe 
most nato shortrange rockets are based in west germany and 
bonn officials have requested that the upgrade project be postponed 
genscher said that along with the americans west germans make 
the largest contribution to nato defenses and therefore it is 
perfectly normal for the west german governments view to carry a 
corresponding weight in the matter 
the united states and britain want full alliance support to be 
shown at the nato summit in brussels may 2930 for the shortrange 
upgrade project known as modernization 
west germany however holds firm to its position that the 
superpowers should be working to reduce the weapons before moving 
to upgrade them and the shortrange issue now threatens to 
dominate the 16nation nato summit 
the western alliance devised a plan five years ago to replace 
aging lance nuclear missiles by 1995 with new rockets that would 
have more than triple the range 
a goahead vote on modernization had been expected at the 
summit but west germany insists the decision be put off for at 
least two years 
chancellor helmut kohl and genscher instead want the united 
states and the soviet union to open talks on reducing the 
shortrange forces but washington has tied those negotiations to a 
balance of nato and warsaw pact conventional armed forces 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has begun pulling back 
50000 kremlin troops and 5000 tanks from eastern europe as a 
gesture toward reducing soviet bloc predominance but us 
officials contend the wests troops will remain widely outnumbered 
west germanys call for interim negotiations on shortrange 
weapons broke with nato policy and some alliance nations expressed 
a measure of support for bonns position widening the 
interalliance gap 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze stepped up the 
pressure on washington last week when he threatened a possible 
breach of the 1987 intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty if nato 
goes ahead with modernization 
he likened the planned lance replacement missiles to the 
kremlins ss23 which is being dismantled under the inf treaty 
he said the kremlin would be forced to consider halting the 
ss23 destructions or developing a new missile to replace it 
the ss23s have a range of about 300 miles which is the 
threshhold between the short and intermediaterange categories 
the new missiles nato plans as lance replacements would have 
about the same range

the supreme court on monday refused to kill a 
lawsuit by a washington state prison inmate who says his rights 
were violated when authorities conducted a rectal search 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that washington 
gov booth gardner and prison officials may be sued 
lanford d tribble an inmate at the state penitentiary in walla 
walla challenged a policy requiring prisoners to undergo rectal 
searches when transferred to a special prison unit for security 
reasons 
tribble was moved to the special unit in january 1986 after 
guards discovered contraband in the cell he shared with two other 
inmates 
he was searched by a physicians assistant after he was 
handcuffed behind his back and placed in leg irons chained around 
his waist 
tribble said the search violated his privacy rights and was 
intended as punishment 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals ruled last year that such 
searches do not violate the constitutional rights of prisoners if 
conducted for reasons of prison security or are reasonably 
related to a legitimate penological need 
but the appeals court said evidence exists that indicates the 
searches at the washington prison were intended for other reasons 
tribble has presented evidence that the prison staff do not 
search clothing hair hands or any body cavity other than the 
rectal cavity the appeals court said this evidence is most 
telling of the actual purpose of the digital rectal search policy 
one can draw an inference that a search limited to the rectal 
cavity may be done for punitive purposes because prisoners can 
smuggle contraband by concealing it elsewhere the appeals 
court said 
the appeals court noted that routine rectal searches for 
prisoners transferred to the special unit were abandoned after 
tribble sued the new policy authorizes searches only when there is 
a reasonable suspicion an inmate is hiding contraband in his rectum 
state and prison officials generally are immune from such 
lawsuits the supreme court has held that officials are shielded 
from suit unless they violate clearly established statutory or 
constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have 
known 
the case is gardner vs tribble 881259

an environmental group urged president bush on 
monday to halt us trade in elephant ivory in order to protect the 
animals declining numbers 
defenders of wildlife said it sent a letter to bush urging him 
to direct interior secretary manuel lujan to impose an immediate 
ivory trading ban and to provide money and equipment loans to the 
african nations most affected by such a ban 
in the letter rupert cutler president of the group said an 
estimated 300 african elephants a day are killed by poachers a 
rate he said will practically guarantee the extinction of the 
elephant by the end of the century 
lujan last week said he told us representatives to an 
international conference next october to push for increased 
protection of the african elephant 
he said the united states at the meeting will urge that the 
elephant be placed in a more protected classification under the 
international endangered species treaty thereby prohibiting any of 
the 101 treaty nations from engaging in the commercial trading of 
ivory 
lujan said he had instructed department officials to recommend 
whether to change the african elephants classification from 
threatened to endangered under the us endangered species 
law 
last year the united states imported 32 million worth of ivory 
most of which originated with the african elephant

a man who was wrongly diagnosed as 
having aids says the error cost him his job his home and his 
girlfriend and nearly led him to suicide 
michael peoples 34 believed for 12 days that he had aids 
because of a mixup in the laboratory at the veterans administration 
hospital and learned the truth on march 7 the same day he said he 
had resolved to kill himself 
a lab technician assigned the same number to two patients 
hospital spokesman craig koller said monday we regret it very 
much its something we acknowledge took place and were very 
concerned about 
peoples said he now lives in a columbus shelter for the homeless 
since his girlfriend kicked him out and he lost his job 
peoples told the columbus dispatch he was notified feb 23 he 
had aids he said he was so depressed by the diagnosis that i 
wrote a suicide note and decided i was going to carry it out the 
day before my birthday march 8 
koller said the hospital was trying to contact peoples and his 
employer a temporary service company where he tagged shipping 
crates as well as his girlfriend to help rectify this 
koller said the lab technician probably will not be punished 
it was an error that was caught and rectified the procedure 
that allowed this to happen was investigated and subsequently 
revised he said 
i would say this is a very rare occurrence it has never had 
happen before our lab service does close to 2 million lab tests a 
year 
koller would neither confirm nor deny peoples claim that a 
doctor at the hospital told peoples sister and son about the aids 
diagnosis before the error was caught and before peoples could tell 
them himself 
it is against all of our policies and procedures to give out 
such information to anyone other than the patient koller said 
peoples who had entered the hospital for treatment of 
alcoholism told the newspaper that before the error was corrected 
his former fiancee called his employer believing she had been 
exposed to the virus 
peoples said his employer did not admit the aids diagnosis cost 
him his job the employer said his job had been filled while he was 
in the hospital peoples said 
the newspaper did not identify peoples former employer his 
former fiancee or his girlfriend

global warming by the year 2010 could require the 
building of 86 more power plants at a cost of 110 billion so that 
americans can run their air conditioners a new study says 
the study was conducted by dri mcgraw hill energy group of 
lexington and atmospheric and environmental research inc of 
cambridge 
using computer models researchers concluded that global warming 
would raise average annual temperatures nationwide two degrees by 
2010 and the drain on power would require the building of 86 new 
midsize power plants nationwide 
that would result in about a 4 percent increase in electricity 
costs the study found 
global warming also known as the greenhouse effect is caused 
by solar heat trapped under gases in the atmosphere carbon dioxide 
and other pollutants associated with burning fossil fuels are 
considered chief causes 
the study looked only at carbon dioxide as a factor but 
scientists have pointed to many others including chemicals used in 
air conditioners 
some scientists say global warming could raise temperatures four 
to nine degrees by 2050 and melt polar ice caps and cause sea 
levels to rise causing severe droughts and storms and disrupting 
the earths biological systems 
the study which will be presented thursday at the edison 
electric institute in seattle bolsters arguments that ignoring 
global warming could be expensive 
we didnt know whether or not the kind of changes that these 
atmospheric scientists were talking about really would make much of 
a difference said larry makovich a study author it does i 
think put some hard numbers to it 
researchers found that higher temperatures bring lower heating 
needs in the winter but power plants are built to handle peak 
demand and exceptionally hot summers would drive the peak 
significantly beyond current levels makovich said 
the predicted need for new plants poses a dilemma for utilities 
said george loehr acting executive director of the northeast power 
coordinating council 
building conventional plants means stoking the greenhouse 
gases while nuclear power plants are becoming increasingly 
unpopular he said 
that leaves conservation as the most attractive option he said

the state department denounced on monday as 
outlandish a soviet threat to consider retaining some nuclear 
missiles outlawed in a 1987 treaty if nato proceeded with a program 
to upgrade shortrange weapons 
a department spokesman richard boucher also dismissed reports 
the united states was working out a compromise with west germany 
which opposes the modernization program for the 88 lance launchers 
and their 700 or so missiles 
i dont see any sort of compromise shaping up but we are 
certainly continuing discussions the us official said 
boucher said president bush was in touch with west german 
chancellor helmut kohl and that gerhard stoltenberg the west 
german defense minister probably would be here on friday for 
further talks 
in contrast to the us criticism secretary of state james a 
baker iii saluted the economic reforms undertaken by soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev as truly revolutionary 
baker who was in moscow last week said soviet leaders were 
singing out of our hymn book 
appearing at a session sen christopher dodd dconn arranged 
with some constitutents baker said warmer relations between the 
soviet union and china were not of concern to the west and could 
enhance world stability 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze visiting bonn on 
saturday warned that if the united states did not drop plans to 
more than triple the range of the lance missiles to more than 250 
miles the soviet union would respond by developing a new 
shortrange weapon or by retaining ss23s which have a range of 
about 310 miles 
the treaty signed here in december 1987 by thenpresident 
reagan and gorbachev provided for the destruction of all us and 
soviet nuclear missiles in the intermediate range from 300 to 
3500 miles 
on sunday baker said shevardnadzes threat to suspend 
destruction of ss23 missiles would violate the 1987 treaty and 
could be part of a publicity campaign to divide the north atlantic 
treaty organization 
this is a matter that was specifically negotiated when the inf 
treaty was negotiated baker said 
the elimination of the ss23s on the part of the soviet union 
was debated back and forth for quite some time the soviets 
responded in effect that they would agree to eliminate these 
missiles and now they are doing so baker said sunday on the 
cbstv program face the nation 
on monday the state department through boucher stepped up the 
attack saying we think shevardnadzes remarks are an outlandish 
statement one day the soviets announce small unilateral 
reductions the next day they are talking about breaking a recently 
concluded treaty 
the us official apparently was referring to gorbachevs 
announcement last thursday while meeting with baker in moscow that 
the soviets would withdraw 500 shortrange nuclear warheads from 
eastern europe 
baker publicly described the move as a modest one designed 
in part for public relations he said the warsaw pact held a 
sizable advantage over the united states in shortrange missiles 
and had modernized most of them 
during negotiations that preceded the 1987 treaty the soviets 
resisted including the ss23s but relented they have 200 missiles 
in the category all are supposed to be destroyed by dec 1 and 
none have been so far said a us official who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
boucher said the ss23s undoubtedly were covered by the 1987 
treaty and shortrange missiles were not covered he said a look 
at the text would confirm the us position 
we find it especially ironic that the soviets threaten to

the soviet union began deploying the ss23spider in 1985 as a 
replacement for the 1960svintage scud missile 
boucher said the soviets had no legal right to choose not to 
observe part of the treaty 
the united states under reagan decided not to observe various 
limits of the 1979 strategic arms limitation treaty but boucher 
said that accord had not been ratified by the senate 
its clearly not a welcome development that the soviets should 
threaten to break treaties which have already been negotiated and 
concluded he said i would hope the soviets would think very

certainly not helpful their making statements like this

iran rejected an invitation to a 
meeting of islamic affairs ministers in saudi arabia in what 
appeared to be a worsening of already strained saudiiranian 
relations diplomats reported monday 
iran and the kingdom are engaged in a war of words over the 
iranian quota for the annual hajj in july when moslems from around 
the world converge on saudi arabia for pilgrimage to islams 
holiest shrines at mecca and medina 
the diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said iran was 
angry because saudi arabia was adhering to a quota system initiated 
last year they said iran might boycott the pilgrimage as it did 
last year 
the iranian daily jomhuri reported monday that differences had 
almost been resolved when the saudis rejected all previous 
agreements and started everything anew irans official islamic 
republic news agency said 
irna monitored in cyprus quoted the paper as blaming the saudi 
royal family one group within the family was adamant that iranian 
numbers be limited the report said 
in april 1988 saudi arabia broke diplomatic ties with iran it 
cited demonstrations by iranian pilgrims during the hajj season of 
1987 in which clashes with saudi police left 402 people dead it 
also noted irans repeated attacks on persian gulf shipping lanes 
during the iraniraq war 
saudi arabia last year started limiting each country to 1000 
pilgrims per million of population 
the invitation to iran for the fourth conference of islamic 
ministers of endowments and religious affairs was issued after iran 
took part in an islamic foreign ministers conference in saudi 
arabia in march 
relations at that conference of the 46member organization of 
islamic conference were cordial 
a major item on the agenda of the coming fourday conference 
will be coordination and cooperation among islamic states in 
confronting atheistic destructive trends and distortion campaigns 
by enemies of the islamic faith 
all majority sunni and minority shiite sects among the worlds 1 
billion moslems participate in islamic meetings 
but iran the only nation with an overwhelming shiite majority 
stayed away from such meetings after the war with iraq started in 
september 1980 hostilities ended with a ceasefire last summer

president bush on monday proposed reviving the 
death penalty for treason espionage and other capital offenses 
already on the books and extending it to such crimes as terrorist 
killings 
the execution provisions were included in a package of 
anticrime proposals unveiled by the administration as part of 
bushs plan to crack down on violent crime 
under the proposal congress will be asked to amend federal law 
so that deathpenalty provisions for treason espionage 
assassination of the president and top federal officials and other 
murders comply with supreme court procedural requirements laid down 
in the 1970s 
these statutes were never amended to reflect changes in death 
penalty laws mandated by the high court to eliminate what the 
justices held were arbitrary and discriminatory applications of the 
death penalty 
in order for a death sentence to be constitutional you have 
to have procedures and standards that are not currently 
incorporated in existing federal law for these crimes said a 
justice department official who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
the unenforceable death penalty also applies to a variety of 
killings including aircraft hijackings train wreckings and bank 
robberies resulting in death and the murder of federal officials 
it applies too to mailing dangerous articles and to the 
interstate transportation of explosives that result in death 
to inject fairness the high court requires special sentencing 
proceedings during which the jury must consider if there are 
sufficient aggravating circumstances to warrant the death penalty 
the jury must then weigh aggravating factors against mitigating 
circumstances to determine whether to impose the death penalty 
in addition to seeking revival of the death penalty for existing 
capital crimes the administration is proposing to impose it for a 
variety of murders including homicides committed by hired killers 
hostage takers or terrorists of american citizens or to further 
racketeering 
the death penalty would also be imposed for murders committed by 
federal prisoners serving life sentences the killing of foreign 
officials or internationally protected persons and kidnappings 
resulting in death 
the only death penalty provisions in federal law that the 
justice department contends meet supreme court guidelines were 
enacted last year as part of the larger antidrug legislation 
that legislation imposes the death penalty for murders committed 
to further drug conspiracies the socalled drug kingpin 
provisions include the death penalty for murders ordered by drug 
dealers as part of their business 
reviving the death penalty for espionage and treason may not 
pass constitutional muster 
in 1977 the supreme court overturned a georgia law that 
provided the death penalty for rape ruling that executions for 
crimes that do not involve the taking of a life are 
unconstitutional 
such proposals will spawn a black hole of litigation against 
the death penalty warned richard burr director of the death 
penalty project of the naacp legal and educational defense fund 
inc 
it creates a black hole into which an enormous amount of human 
and financial resources are poured because the death penalty 
creates very legitimate and constitutional problems burr said 
these problems have caused the supreme court to hear and decide 
10 deathpenalty cases every term it has sat since 1976 he said 
these problems just dont go away

halting production of f14 jetfighters will 
create problems for the navy in the next 10 years the assistant 
chief of naval operations said monday 
vice adm robert f dunn expressed concerns that defense 
secretary dick cheneys proposal to cancel orders in the fiscal 
1990 budget for 12 new f14 fighter jets will force the navy to 
wear out its current fleet of f14s too soon 
cheney who was required to cut 10 billion from the defense 
budget said the f14s were too expensive reports indicate that 
the new planes cost 360 million 
the present budget does not include f14s in it because of 
affordability reasons dunn told the senate armed services 
subcommittee on projection forces and regional defense 
im afraid that stopping that production at this time 
however will put us in jeopardy toward the end of the century 
when were banking on the navy atf advanced tactical fighter 
coming in to replace it 
dunn said an insufficient number of f14s will force the navy 
into transferring them from carrier to carrier as those ships 
deploy using up the service life of those we have back home that 
much sooner 
the navy currently has 477 f14 tomcats exceeding the 458 the 
service requires dunn said but barring new production by 2000 
the service will be short 56 f14s the vice admiral said basing 
his information on data from the office of management and budget 
last week rep george hochbrueckner dny said that an 
analysis prepared for him by the congressional research service of 
the library of congress found that the navy will have 110 fewer 
f14s at the end of fiscal 1996 
no matter how you slice the bushcheney budget it comes up 
dangerously short in navy aircraft the conventional weapons 
america needs and uses in real life said hochbrueckner 
the congressman is from long island where the plane is 
manufactured by grumman corp of bethpage ny

massachusetts is opening another front in its 
battle against the seabrook nh nuclear plant 
the state in hearings that began monday is questioning whether 
an evacuation plan was adequately tested in a drill last june 
new hampshire yankee which operates the 6 billion plant was 
allowed to write the emergency plan after massachusetts refused to 
help with the drafting massachusetts also refused to participate 
in the drill 
the threemember atomic safety and licensing board of the 
nuclear regulatory commission began hearings on the plan in march 
and started a second phase this week on the practice run held last 
june 28 and 29 
massachusetts is asking the board to reject the plan 
in addition assistant attorney general john traficonte said 
monday were going to try to prove that things did not happen 
the way they should have and that the way the exercise was 
structured was not sufficient to test the plan 
the 12 utilities that own the plant need approval of the plan to 
obtain a fullpower operating license as early as this fall 
the plant finished in 1986 is 21 miles across the state line 
from massachusetts which has 50000 to 100000 people within 10

two federal agencies announced plans monday to 
improve bicycle safety including increasing the use of helmets 
which officials say are worn by fewer than one in 10 riders 
officials of the consumer product safety commission also said 
they are evaluating several types of bicycle helmets to determine 
effectiveness in preventing injuries and will consider a petition 
from safety groups to set uniform federal standards 
anne pavlich commission spokeswoman said the agency is testing 
the effectiveness of hard and soft helmets 
an engineer for the commission john preston said testing 
indicates that helmets without a hard shell may be just as 
effective in absorbing the energy of a fall or collision as those 
with a hard shell 
since bicycle helmets usually have large open areas for 
ventilation they are not generally required to resist penetration 
by sharp objects the way motorcycle helmets are he said 
the comission and the national highway safety administration 
signed a memorandum monday that sets up communication between the 
two agencies on bicycle safety research and seeks to coordinate 
local and national efforts to increase public understanding of 
bicycle safety requirements 
a group of safety and consumer groups organized as the national 
safe kids campaign petitioned the safety commission on monday to 
set performance standards for both adult and childsize bicycle 
helmets the group said federal standards would help reduce the 
1000 deaths and halfmillion serious injuries each year in bicycle 
accidents 
the safety administration estimates that fewer than 10 percent 
of bicycle riders wear helmets the agency said many bike accidents 
can be prevented with increased attentiveness by cyclists and 
motorists 
preston said the product safety commission had planned a major 
bicycle safety project for 1989 but it was cut back because funds 
were not available 
he said the agency next month plans to review separate voluntary 
standards set by the american national standards institute and the 
snell memorial foundation the snell standards are slightly more 
stringent both standards test the ability of a helmet to absorb 
the impact of a collision 
preston said it is possible that helmets that meet tough impact 
standards may not be the best for common lowspeed accidents and 
that other design factors might also affect a riders safety 
the biggest problem though is lack of use he said you 
can meet the highest standards but it wont do any good if you 
cant convince kids that wearing a helmet is a cool thing to do

the government played the hero monday in a drama 
to save a theater where william shakespeare performed reprieving 
the archaeological site for a month with a 165 million pledge to 
a building developer 
the reprieve hours before bulldozing was to begin followed a 
nightlong protest vigil on the muddy site of the rose theater and a 
morning of meetings by the environment department the statefunded 
english heritage and developers who want to build an office block 
environment secretary nicholas ridley told the house of commons 
the government intervened because knowledge unearthed in the last 
two to three days shows the remains are far more important than 
thought before 
the rose found five months ago in excavations for the building 
is the only elizabethan theater ever discovered its more famous 
neighbor the globe has disappeared 
it was for this special reason and on this one occasion that 
it seems right that the government should have financed the delay 
so that forces determined to preserve it should have the right to 
do so said ridley who is responsible for ancient monuments 
the delay will enable developers and their architects to work 
with english heritage and his ministry on various options he 
said we all hope that the theater can not only be preserved 
but made permanently available to the public 
but in sharp questioning from legislators he said i could 
not forecast the outcome of what will be decided 
from the site of the continuing vigil shakespearean actor ian 
mckellen told bbctv we will only be happy and leave when the 
minimum requirements are achieved when access for it is available 
for anybody who wants to see it 
the developers imry merchants already have financed five 
months of excavations they say they will the preserve the theater 
by burying the remains under tons of sand and gravel 
archaeologists say this would damage the fragile remains and keep 
them from public view 
ridley did not mention a figure but a spokesman for his 
department said the government and english heritage would 
contribute up to 165 million to any costs of the months 
delay 
a spokesman for the developers who also spoke on condition of 
anonymity said he could not estimate the cost 
in the commons anthony beaumontdark of the governing 
conservative party said the government rather should spend money on 
living theater 
he said if every archaeological find were preserved london 
would be composed of the ruins of rome 
ridley answered if we were to deny archaeology i suppose we 
were to deny stonehenge 
lawmaker simon hughes whose district includes the site on the 
south bank of the river thames asked ridley for assurance that 
piles will not be driven through the site but he received none 
the developers plan to drive concrete piles 180 feet deep at the 
site where surviving bricks and mortar clearly map the theaters 
two stages walls and auditorium 
opponents of the plan include laurence olivier dame peggy 
ashcroft dustin hoffman dame judi dench derek jacobi edward fox 
and kate omara

despite a substantial increase in the defense 
budget almost 100000 companies stopped doing business with the 
pentagon over a fiveyear period said a private report released 
monday 
the center for strategic and international studies found that in 
1982 more than 138000 companies provided manufactured goods to 
the defense department but by 1987 the number had dropped to less 
than 40000 
some of the 80000 went out of business including about 
20000 small businesses the report said most of the 80000 
firms however simply quit doing business with the defense 
department and opted for other customers 
the report described the dropoff as remarkable in light of 
the increase in the defense procurement budget from 549 billion 
to 87 billion in constant fiscal 1989 dollars 
the study deterrence in decay the future of the us defense 
industrial base attributed the decline to predatory pricing 
tactics used by the larger companies in some instances those 
companies lowered prices below marginal costs making it impossible 
for the smaller companies to compete 
in addition the report found that in comparison to other 
industries defense is not a highly profitable business 
return on sales in defense overall has been about the same as 
in commercial manufacturing falling from 49 percent in 1980 to 
38 percent in 1986 the report said 
among the recommendations the report urged better oversight of 
defense industries to reduce costs improved planning programming 
and budgeting and incentives for companies in industries that are 
disadvantaged internationally in competitive defense markets 
specifically sen john mccain rariz a cochair of the 
report and a member of the senate armed services committee 
suggested that congress and the pentagon bite the bullet as 
to how were going to get into multiyear procurement multiyear 
budgeting so that those people who have left the defense industrial 
base would have some kind of predictability 
sen jeff bingaman dnm the other cochair who also serves 
on the armed services panel recommended additional spending on 
defense industrial base information systems removing the barriers 
between the civilian and military sectors of the economy and 
improved coordination between the civilian and national security 
departments and agencies 
the 12month study was done by the centers staff as well as a 
39member steering committee that included representatives of 
academia former pentagon officials the defense industry and 
members of the congressional armed services panels and their staff

george bush received 156000 from a blind 
trust worth just under 1 million in his final year as vice 
president his financial disclosure forms showed monday 
bush and his wife barbara also accepted more than 21000 in 
gifts ranging from country music tapes to running shoes the report 
said 
it indicated they have assets of 109 million other than real 
estate in addition their house in kennebunkport maine not 
required to be listed is estimated to be worth about 1 million 
bringing their likely net worth to 2 million 
vice president dan quayle filed a far less detailed disclosure 
statement showing assets held by him and his wife marilyn in 1988 
when he was a senator representing indiana of at least 440000 
and possibly 740000 or more principally stock in his 
familyowned central newspapers inc 
during his campaign quayle valued his net worth at slightly 
under 1 million 
the presidents new forms showed a 156 percent return on the 
trust that bush a former texas oil executive set up in 1981 when 
he became vice president it was the first time the trusts exact 
value 998000 at yearend had been disclosed 
bushs salary as vice president last year was 115000 
the report bushs first as president also showed he paid off 
earlier this year 49000 in three loans he took out in 1979 
against life insurance policies 
quayle reported his holdings brought in income of between 
18500 and 52000 he also reported fees for speeches of 52797 
of which he donated 17304 to charities to keep within the 
federal limit on honoraria his salary as a senator was 89500 
computing his worth is complicated by the fact that the quayle 
familys major assets his 99 shares and his wifes 40 shares in 
central newspapers inc have no set market value since the 
company is privately owned and the stock not traded according to 
his press secretary david beckwith 
beckwith said that quayle was not required to fill out a 
disclosure form for 1988 but did one anyway he said the one the 
vice president files next year is likely to follow bushs lead in 
providing greater detail 
bush put at 31000 the value of his share of a houston barge 
company a business venture with secretary of state james a baker 
iii and commerce secretary robert mosbacher bush earned 11962 
last year on the investment the financial document showed 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater said that bush a 
former texas oil executive intends to put his interest in the 
barge company which leases four liquid petroleum barges to gas 
companies in the gulf of mexico into his blind trust 
federal law does not require the listing of real estate on the 
disclosure forms bush and his wife own the house in kennebunkport 
part of a 35 million estate owned principally by bushs mother 
and an empty lot in houston 
some of the details in the report were disclosed when bushs 
income tax forms were made public on april 13 
however other details such as the value of his holdings and 
the list of gifts did not show up on the tax forms 
in the past for instance bush indicated the value of his blind 
trust only as over 250000 fitzwater said that because bush 
has proposed new ethics legislation which would require more 
detailed information on assets the president had decided to list 
the specific amount of the trust rounded off to the nearest 1000 
other assets listed by bush include 1000 in a white house 
savings account 3000 in an interestbearing checking account in 
kennebunkport 28000 in an individual retirement account for 
himself and 2300 in a companion ira for mrs bush 
the forms also show a life insurance policy on mrs bush with a 
cash value of 13000 
they show that as of dec 31 bush had about 6000 in a regular 
checking account in a washington bank and about 5000 in a 
checking account in houston 
he also listed an 18000 deferred compensation arrangement 
that he will get at age 65 this june from the zapata corp the 
nowdefunct offshore oil drilling company he set up in texas in the 
late 1950s 
federal law requires that all gifts worth more than 100 be 
reported 
while the president and his wife may keep any gifts from 
domestic sources gifts from foreign sources cannot be kept if they 
exceed 180 in value 
some of the gifts reported by bush and his wife for 1988 ten 
country and western casette tapes from mca records worth 100 two 
sets of horseshoes worth 218 from art bellows of the triangle 
corp of stamford conn a 425 pen set from peter bentley of 
parker pens janesville wis and two neckties worth 150 from 
roberto goizueta an executive of the cocacola co atlanta 
also a cowboy hat and jacket worth 124 from the houston 
livestock show two pair of walking shoes from the rockport co 
valued at 184 two pair of running shoes from avia worth 100 a 
porcelain vase worth 120 from li changchun an official in chinas 
liaoning provincial government 
mrs bush reported a tiffany gold watch worth 7800 from the

japan formed a commission monday to investigate 
possible radiation from a us hydrogen bomb lost in the pacific 24 
years ago the pentagon says pressure crushed the bomb and the 
nuclear material dissolved 
in a report friday the pentagon said the 1megaton bomb could 
not have detonated at the time of the accident because the system 
was designed not to arm or receive an arming command under this 
accident circumstance 
the defense department told japan in the fourparagraph report 
there is no environmental impact from the dissolved nuclear 
material which it said would have settled quickly to the ocean 
floor 16000 feet below 
it did not specify the material in the bomb but when details of 
the accident were disclosed last week in washington researcher 
william arkin at the institute of policy studies said it held 33 
pounds of plutonium 
that estimate was revised monday to 55 pounds said shannon 
fagan of the environmental group greenpeace which worked on the 
project with arkin 
an a4 skyhawk carrying the bomb slipped off the aircraft 
carrier ticonderoga in 1965 about 80 miles off an inhabited island 
in okinawa prefecture in far southern japan the location 
previously had been kept secret 
japan the only country ever attacked with nuclear weapons is 
especially sensitive on nuclear matters in addition to the 
question of radiation the newly revealed accident raises the issue 
of whether the united states sidesteps the japanese ban on nuclear 
weapons within its territory 
at the time of the accident the ticonderoga was said to be 
bound for the us naval base at yokosuka at the mouth of tokyo bay 
keizo obuchi the chief cabinet secretary was asked by 
reporters monday whether the ship had docked at yokosuka he 
replied we have no confirmation at present but we are inquiring 
now 
japans antinuclear policy was not proclaimed until 1968 three 
years after the accident 
foreign minister sousuke uno told a parliamentary committee 
japan accepts the us evaluation that the material poses no 
environmental danger but said an investigation was necessary to 
allay public fears 
later monday the foreign ministry appointed experts from 
several agencies to evaluate the us report and decide whether 
more studies were needed the experts are from the defense agency 
coast guard environmental agency and fisheries authority 
news of the lost bomb brought out demonstrators who demanded 
elimination of nuclear weapons and an end to the usjapan 
security treaty under which about 60000 us military personnel 
are based in japan 
the japan congress against atomic and hydrogen bombs which 
supports the opposition socialist party said the united states was 
making fools of the japanese 
a statement by its secretarygeneral koichi akamatsu said the 
government should ban all us ships and planes unless they are 
certified as not carrying nuclear weapons the us navy refuses to 
say whether its vessels carry nuclear arms when they enter japanese 
waters 
monday was the 17th anniversary of the us turnover of okinawa 
to japanese rule the occasion was marked by peace rallies on the 
island which was the scene of heavy fighting in world war ii 
japanese tv showed thousands of people listening to antinuclear 
speeches 
the pentagon report responded to a request by japan for 
clarification after reports of the accident a copy was provided to 
the associated press on monday 
it said nuclear weapons specialists from the us national 
laboratories had tested the nuclear material by dissolving it in 
sea water 
because of its high density the solute would have settled 
very quickly to the floor of the ocean along with other 
sedimentation it said therefore there is no environmental 
impact 
it said the bomb was not designed to remain intact under the 
heavy pressure of great ocean depths and the nuclear material would 
have leaked out of the crushed casing

presidentelect carlos menem said 
monday he will not press to take office ahead of schedule but his 
advisers worry about how bad the economic crisis will become by 
inauguration day in seven months 
an 11 percent drop in the value of argentinas currency soon 
after foreign exchange houses opened monday was a reminder that 
economic problems need attention but most of the loss was regained 
during the day 
the austral has lost 86 percent of its value against the dollar 
since early february inflation was 96 percent in february 17 
percent in march 334 percent in april and is projected at 40 
percent for may 
under the constitution elections must be held at least four 
months before inauguration and the president has leeway in setting 
the date critics said president raul alfonsin chose may 14 because 
he thought the economy could be held together only until then 
were respectful of the law on timing said menem whose 
peronist party defeated alfonsins radical civic union in the 
elections sunday and is to be inaugurated dec 10 for a sixyear 
term 
he said he would address the nation within 15 days and announce 
his cabinet within a month 
speaking with reporters in la rioja province where he is 
governor menem said his aides will be in permanent contact with 
the government to make the transition smooth and he hoped his 
election would end political certainty and stabilize economic 
markets 
menem 58 got 474 percent of the vote compared with 37 percent 
for eduardo angeloz of alfonsins party and 310 of the 600 
presidential electors the interior ministry said 
it said 99 percent of the votes had been counted but did not 
give totals or the turnout figure which was estimated at 82 
percent of those eligible 
earlier monday the ministry said menem had 7502800 votes and 
angeloz 5886464 with 94 percent of the ballot boxes counted and 
candidates of several smaller parties got a total of 14 million 
peronists won 21 more chamber of deputies seats than in the 
previous election for a total of 127 half the membership of 
254member chamber the ministry said alliances with the christian 
democrats and leftist intransigent party should provide regular 
majorities 
the party picked up a seat in the 46member senate giving it 
23 and will have the tiebreaking vote of vice presidentelect 
eduardo duhalde the peronists also won 17 of the 22 provincial 
governorships in elections in september 
alfonsins party lost 14 deputies and now has 93 seats dante 
caputo foreign minister and president of the un general 
assembly led the radical slate and is assured of a seat in the 
next congress 
in washington deputy state department spokesman richard boucher 
said these elections took place in an atmosphere of free and 
open debate and under procedures in accord with argentine 
constitution 
vatican radio expressed regret about the negative values it 
said motivated menems campaign it said the campaign stressed the 
economic crisis in this predominantly roman catholic country and 
tended to lay all argentinas problems on the fragile shoulders 
of the alfonsin government 
inflation has driven real wages down about 30 percent so far 
this year and the government has kept public utility rates 
artificially low aggravating an already serious budget deficit 
menem has promised pay increases 
no payments have been made on the 59 billion foreign debt since 
last year argentina is 25 billion behind on the interest 
the balance of payments surplus from which argentina derives 
most of its foreign currency is likely to be substantially below 
last years 36 billion because of smaller grain havests due to 
drought 
domingo cavallo a harvardtrained economist who may be the next 
treasury secretary said there are many things that have to be 
done simultaneously and for that im talking of a complete program 
that has to have a date of application which in principle dr 
menem could only do after dec 10 
but as the situation is so anguishing there would have to be a 
way of putting it in motion by the government of dr alfonsin 
before that date 
radical civic union leaders indicated monday they would work 
with menem whose views on economic policy sometimes clash with 
alfonsins 
while alfonsin would sell stateowned industries to reduce the 
deficit menem would try to increase their efficiency menem 
opposes export taxes which alfonsin has used to generate revenue 
menem has not ruled out foreign exchange and price controls 
however alfonsin has used both to restrict inflation

millions of commuters outmaneuvered a oneday bus 
and subway strike in london on monday using staggered schedules 
bicycles and their feet to go about their business 
only 11 of the citys scores of subway trains and 10 buses 
operated during the morning and evening rush hours as train 
operators held their third unofficial strike and bus drivers struck 
in a pay dispute 
a sixth of the trains on british rails southern region also 
were canceled because of an overtime ban by the unions and because 
some employees were unable to get to work the railroad said 
traffic jams were kept to a minimum because many drivers 
staggered their trips some leaving home at daybreak and others 
departing from their jobs in midafternoon 
we obviously saw traffic a little heavier because of the 
general transport problem but thanks to commuters staggering their 
journeys we had very little real problem on londons roads said 
an automobile association spokesman 
many commuters found different ways to get to their jobs in 
sunny weather traveling by riverboats along the thames on 
bicycles and afoot 
the sidewalks were packed with pedestrians and a steady stream 
of rail commuters walked across the bridges over the thames leading 
from the main waterloo train station into central london 
a few stopped along the way to bathe in the sunshine or to wipe 
their brows 
the buses and subways carry about 7 million passengers daily 
london buses said service on about 250 of its routes was halted 
leaving only three in use in central london some 11700 drivers 
and conductors and 2600 engineers were striking for more pay 
on the london underground with 248 subway stations 2500 train 
drivers staged their third wildcat strike since april 5 to protest 
costcutting measures 
the drivers also are demanding more money for working on trains 
that they eventually will operate alone after the planned phasing 
out of conductors who open and close doors

the savings and loan crisis has forced the 
head of the federal deposit insurance corp to neglect his job as 
the main regulator of commercial banks and expose them to financial 
danger the head of a house subcommittee said monday 
rep frank annunzio dill one of the sampl industrys 
staunchest defenders as chairman of the house financial 
institutions subcommittee complained in a letter to fdic chairman 
l william seidman that his agency has been turning over too many 
of its duties to state bank examiners 
i do not intend to stand by and allow your agency to create an 
examination crisis in which the taxpayers will have to pay hundreds 
of billions of dollars to solve a commercial bank crisis 
annunzio said congress cannot afford to permit any additional 
slackening of bank examination and supervision 
since feb 6 when bush announced his sampl bailout plan the fdic 
has diverted more than onefourth of staff of 2029 bank examiners 
to seize supervisory control of 220 insolvent or nearly insolvent 
sampls 
in the interim annunzio said the fdic has told state banking 
commissioners of significant reductions in its examinations of 
most banks and has canceled training programs for state examiners 
you testified that we are confident we can handle both 
longterm and shortterm savings and loan supervisory roles 
without undermining our bank supervisory activities annunzio 
said in his letter to seidman these statements were made at the 
same time you were abdicating your supervisory responsibilities 
under sampl legislation approved by the senate and two house 
committees the fdic would be given expanded powers to regulate 
thrift institutions formerly under the authority of the federal 
home loan bank board 
annunzio said he was going to hold hearings to reconsider 
that new authority in the wake of what the fdic has told state 
banking officials about limiting its examinations to only the 
most critical bank cases 
alan whitney an fdic spokesman said a response to annunzios 
letter had not yet been prepared but added were confident that 
we can demonstrate that our statements were accurate 
whitney conceded that examination schedules have been delayed 
and that some training sessions for state examiners were postponed 
we never denied this assignment that the president asked us to 
undertake in february is putting a strain on our people and would 
have some effect on our operations he said 
but were confident that the examination of commercial banks 
has not suffered because of it added no problem bank has had 
its examination delayed by as much as a day 
the fdic already has shifted back to bank examinations some of 
the 550 examiners it had devoted to the most troubled sampls in march 
and through most of april whitney said 
prior to assuming its new role in the sampl crisis the fdic had 
planned to expand its examination staff by 200 people this year 
with the increased powers it is being given under the new 
legislation it plans to add another 450 to 600 whitney said

the strike monday by los angeles teachers is 
by far the largest teacher walkout this school year apparently 
illegal and a rarity in its proximity to the end of the school year 
we were planning to be legal but technically i guess were 
not catherine carey a spokeswoman for the teachers union 
united teacherslos angeles said in a telephone interview monday 
the union represents 32000 teachers librarians nurses and 
counselors in the nations secondlargest school district with 
about 22000 of them duespaying members of the union the district 
has 594000 students 
the strike is the largest by teachers since 28000 chicago 
teachers struck in the 198788 school year affecting 430000 
students 
according to the national education association the nations 
largest teachers union only seven states allow teachers to strike 
without the risk of penalties hawaii illinois minnesota ohio 
oregon pennsylvania and wisconsin 
an additional 13 allow teachers to strike at the risk of being 
penalized they are florida indiana iowa maryland 
massachusetts nebraska nevada new hampshire new york north 
dakota oklahoma south dakota and tennessee 
its pretty murky carey said when asked to describe 
california laws governing teacher strikes 
she said strikes were allowed if the union and school board 
first went through mediation and a factfinding process and 
teachers honored a mandatory 10day cooling off period after the 
factfinder issued a report 
such a report was due monday in the los angeles impasse but the 
factfinder requested a twoday extension the union had set a may 
30 strike deadline which would have allowed the 10day cooling off 
period but moved the deadline to monday when superintendent 
leonard britton refused to authorize pay for teachers who failed to 
turn in final grades by monday 
he kind of moved things up on us carey said we were 
planning to be legal well let the powers that be and the 
courts decide whether were legal or illegal if its deemed 
illegal were willing to pay the penalty 
the california public employee relations board said last week 
that teachers would be violating the law if they struck monday but 
school officials have given no indication that they plan to take 
legal action against the strikers 
carolyn wallace an official at the neas national headquarters 
here who tracks teacher strikes said there had been 68 nationwide 
as of april 20 
its very rare she said when asked about the timing of the 
los angeles strike which came five weeks before the end of the 
school year 
the public policy research foundation a conservative 
organization that publishes a newsletter on developments in public 
employee unions said its preliminary data showed there have been 
71 teacher strikes this year in 12 states not including the los 
angeles walkout there were 19647 teachers involved in all of 
those strikes combined fewer than in los angeles and 250337 
students were idled according to the foundation which counts 
students as being affected by a strike only if schools are closed 
for more than one day 
wallace said the foundation figures include strikes by 
nonteaching support personnel

ambassador arthur davis recalled by 
president bush left panama on monday and accused gen manuel 
antonio noriega of trying to assassinate an opposition vice 
presidential candidate 
davis said attacks by pipewielding thugs at a rally wednesday 
were aimed at guillermo ford candidate for second vice president 
the attack was meant to kill him davis said before leaving 
for howard air force base to fly home 
he called the attack a deliberate noriegadirected attempt 
and said there is clear evidence noriegas goons did it 
later at andrews air force base outside washington davis said 
a member of the socalled dignity battalion leaned into fords 
car with a pistol and fired away 
you dont put a gun into the side of an automobile and fire 
unless youre planning to kill somebody he said one of fords 
bodyguards was slain 
asked about the link between the dignity battalion and noriega 
panamas de facto leader davis replied well theyre his men 
nobody else ordered it except noriega the dignity battalions are 
under his control 
ford told journalists in panama theres no doubt in my mind 
that they really tried to shoot me but said he had no 
independent knowledge that any one person ordered it done 
im not saying davis is wrong he said im just giving 
you my version 
bush ordered davis home after panama nullified the results of 
the may 7 presidential election 
the government stopped the vote count and nullified the 
election claiming a 21 edge for its candidate carlos duque 
handpicked by noriega 
figures from exit polls and opposition poll watchers gave 
opposition candidate guillermo endara and vice presidential 
candidates ford and ricardo arias calderon an edge of about 31 
davis cited witness reports and the nature of wounds suffered by 
ford and his bodyguards but would not reveal the source of any 
other evidence that noriega ordered ford killed 
the ambassador left the embassy in charge of the deputy chief of 
mission john maisto he said he would return when conditions 
permit the reestablishment of normal relations between the united 
states and a legitimate government 
he said noriega not the panama defense forces he leads is the 
problem and it may be up to the military to get rid of him 
i know there are honorable professional officers and soldiers 
in the pdf who deplore the cowardly use of violence against their 
own unarmed people davis said it must be quite a decision for 
them to continue working when they see what happened on may 10 
davis would not say whether he would recommend direct us 
military intervention if diplomatic efforts or elements within the 
defense forces could not oust noriega 
he said he hoped a special meeting of the organization of 
american states set for wednesday in washington would insist the 
results of the elections be honored and issue a strong 
condemnation of the noriega regime 
panamas opposition has said the oas should put a political and 
diplomatic quarantine on panama if the government does not 
recognize an opposition victory 
in washington the state department said a growing list of 
countries condemning panama included argentina belize canada 
costa rica dominica el salvador west germany guatemala japan 
mexico norway peru the philippines spain trinidad great 
britain uruguay and venezuela 
president carlos andres perez of venezuela offered noriega 
asylum gen noriega has not asked us for asylum but if that is 
the solution for panama then venezuela will open its doors said 
perez a harsh critic of the general 
arias calderon opposition candidate for first vice president 
said monday he hoped for a solution from within the military 
i believe the independence of a growing number of the military 
will be a contribution to the solution he said we have allies 
within the military people who want a change i personally do not 
view the military as enemies 
endara ford and calderon were beaten at the end of a political 
parade wednesday davis said quick action by fords bodyguards 
saved his life 
hospital officials said endara the only one of the three 
hospitalized probably would be released by wednesday 
the opposition has called a oneday general strike for wednesday 
to protest the voiding of the election 
in an apparent attempt to derail the protest the government 
announced wednesday would be payday for 140000 public employees 
their payday normally would have been monday 
american children at military bases returned to school monday 
the schools closed friday while american dependents moved onto 
military bases for safety 
under the panama canal treaties of 1977 panama is to get 
complete control of the canal on dec 31 1999 and us bases are 
to close 
noriega who is under indictment on drug charges in the united 
states contends the accusations are a ploy to get rid of him and 
keep the canal

the army put 700000 palestinians in the 
occupied gaza strip under indefinite curfew monday and ordered all 
gazans working in israel to return to the seaside area immediately 
a military spokesman said 
soldiers blew up or sealed the homes of 15 arabs suspected of 
antiisrael attacks 
the curfew order followed clashes in gaza on monday between 
stonethrowers and soldiers at khan yunis refugee camp 
40yearold fadel ahmed ihnadik was fatally shot in the chest arab 
hospital officials said 
his death raised to 475 the number of palestinians killed since 
the uprising against israeli rule began in the occupied west bank 
and gaza strip more than 17 months ago twentyone israelis also 
have been slain 
military officials gave no reason for the order to laborers from 
gaza the first of its kind in the uprising many palestinians 
employed in israel prefer to spend the night near their jobs rather 
than return home where they can be caught in strikes or army 
curfews 
under the curfew gazans must remain at home unless told 
otherwise under similar curfews residents have been allowed a 
twohour shopping period later 
if people are supposed to be under curfew they should not run 
around and that pertains to those working in israel too a 
military spokesman said and the curfew would continue until 
further notice he spoke on condition of anonymity 
palestinians in gaza city began shouting allahu akbar god 
is great from windows soon after the curfew was announced over 
army loudspeakers an arab reporter said 
soldiers wounded at least 24 palestinians in half a dozen 
confrontations monday with soldiers in the gaza strip hospital 
officials said 
in one clash at khan yunis a 6yearold girl was reported shot 
in the left shoulder and a 50yearold man was in serious condition 
with a gunshot wound in the back doctors said 
at least 11 other people were wounded in the camp and about 26 
were injured by rubber bullets or tear gas inhalation doctors 
said the army said it was checking the casualty reports 
troops demolished four houses and sealed nine others to punish 
palestinians accused of attacking israeli troops or killing 
suspected collaborators with israel the army spokesmans office 
said 
six sealed homes were in nablus the west banks largest city 
the citys 120000 residents were put under curfew to prevent 
protests the army said 
later monday two houses were demolished in the aqabat jabr 
refugee camp that houses 3000 palestinians near the west bank town 
of jericho 
the military said the houses belonged to members of a guerrilla 
squad suspected of killing an arab policeman last year because he

a senate investigating committee on monday 
accused the indian health service of purposely trying to impede the 
panels probe of allegedly misappropriated funds and other 
irregularities within the agency 
sen dennis deconcini dariz said none of eight other 
government agencies being investigated by his special committee has 
been as difficult to deal with 
the indian health service has been singularly uncooperative 
with our committees investigation he said sen thomas daschle 
dsd said the agencys actions amounted to stonewalling 
officials of the health service were scheduled to testify 
monday but deconcini said the committee was not ready to begin its 
questioning because the agency had not supplied requested 
information until friday 
dr everett rhoades the services director told reporters 
after the committee meeting that the agency should have been more 
forthcoming and said the committees march 2 letter requesting 
documents had not come immediately to his attention 
by the time he learned of the letter he said the amount of 
work involved in meeting the request was astronomical 
the material was out in the field rhoades said it took 
time to gather nonetheless he said he had directed his 
subordinates to give the committee everything it wanted 
rhoades said his agency has always been cooperative 
the special committee of the senate select committee on indian 
affairs has been conducting a wideranging investigation of 
indians the federal agencies that serve them and private 
industries with whom they do business 
during three weeks in february and last week the panel has 
brought under intense questioning the heads of the government 
agencies with responsibilities to native americans 
deconcini said that all the other agencies came forth 
voluntarily but that if the committee does not receive 
cooperation from this point forward we will consider subpoenaing 
ihs for documents and testimony 
he said documents the committee requested 10 weeks ago were not 
delivered by the health service until friday night less than 72 
hours before this hearing 
he said the 7000 pages of documents came in stacks without an 
index and seemingly unorganized 
this weekend the committee received information suggesting 
that a possible witness may have been subjected to pressure not to 
fully cooperate with the committee said deconcini we clearly 
need to investigate this allegation further 
among the witnesses who did appear before the committee monday 
was the deputy inspector general of the criminal division of the 
department of health and human services larry morey who said 
complaints he has investigated alleging misuse of funds indicated a 
possible pattern of abuse at ihs 
he said 70000 designated for an alcohol abuse program for 
indians was used for a retreat for top officials from the ihs 
office serving albuquerque nm 
he said the case was new and still under investigation but not 
unusual among the kinds of complaints his office has received 
ken ballen chief counsel for the committee said committee 
investigators have determined that the retreat was held at a resort 
near santa fe and included massage therapy for the participants 
only two of whom were tribal officials 
after the hearing rhoades defended the gathering as an 
educational experience for ihs officials who need to change how 
they regard themselves before they can help others 
he said about 50 people participated in the program designed to 
promote wellness 
massage therapy is a widely accepted treatment modality for 
alcoholism he said

space shuttle atlantis returned to 
its launch site here monday night after a 2day odyssey atop a 
nasa boeing 747 jetliner that was forced to make three bad weather 
stops 
the jumbo jet touched down here at 809 pm minutes after 
sunset 
atlantis and its fiveperson crew landed at edwards air force 
base calif last monday after a fourday space mission that sent 
the magellan spacecraft on the way to explore the planet venus 
bolted atop the 747 atlantis left edwards on saturday for what 
is normally a sevenhour flight with one refueling stop to the 
kennedy space center here 
but bad storms over central texas forced the 747 to land at 
biggs army air field near el paso texas it sat on the ground 
there saturday and sunday nights waiting for the weather to clear 
the flying duo took off monday morning and landed at dallasfort 
worth international airport waiting there for a few hours while 
forecasters assessed the weather between texas and florida 
with a threat of thunderstorms in central florida nasa decided 
to fly the 747 into warner robbins air force base near macon ga 
and again look at the weather 
officials were just about to give up on getting here monday and 
the 747 crew even began removing its bags for an overnight stay in 
georgia but with the florida clouds clearing nasa sent a t38 jet 
plane to survey the flight path 
given the allclear the crew reloaded its bags on the plane and 
it took off for the 90minute final leg landing on a 15000foot 
runway near the shuttle launch pad 
the delay in returning atlantis could hasten the day when nasa 
decides to again return shuttles to earth on the runway here all 
landings have been in california since 1985 when a shuttle blew a 
tire here at touchdown officials have said they will continue to 
return shuttles to wideopen and safer edwards until new brake and 
steering systems have been thoroughly tested 
atlantis now will be readied for another planetary mission to 
propel the galileo spacecraft toward jupiter in october

the famed 21 clubs secret wine cellar where 
prohibition guests downed drinks behind the protection of a 
4000pound secret door opened monday night as a sanctuary for 
wellheeled diners 
inside a single table set with sparkling silver and a floral 
centerpiece sat amid floortoceiling racks of wine bottles and a 
wooden booth where highliving mayor jimmy walker used to knock 
back a few in the 1920s 
but intimacy nostalgia and a sixcourse supper dont come cheap 
in the exclusive midtown manhattan restaurants onetable sanctum 
prices start for dinner at 350 a head and that includes a 
selection of wines we would recommend said ken aretsky chairman 
of the 21 club 
getting to the cellar however is no elegant trip 
guests must pass through the groundfloor bar into the bustling 
kitchen down a steep flight of steps to the basement and through a 
narrow hallway to a suspiciouslooking recess off to the side 
fiftyfive years ago the recess was hidden by pipes and hams 
aretsky said 
a tap on the wall indicates nothing unusual but when chief 
sommelier matt siegel sticks a long slender steel rod into a tiny 
hole voila the secret 4000pound brick door opens 
diners have one more secret door to go before reaching the 
cellar and a table that can accommodate up to 12 gourmets 
during prohibition federal agents once searched 10 hours for 
the first door siegel said 
they knocked on the walls and lit matches to find a draft 
but never found it he said proudly

underground scottish nationalist group that it firebombed a quarry 
in an antinuclear protest

damaged a stonecrushing plant in glensanda quarry near oban on the 
west coast of scotland was accidental said a spokesman for the 
northern police region 
after the fire an anonymous caller to the domestic press 
association news agency in london claimed to represent the scottish 
national liberation army and said the group bombed the quarry

waste was untrue

soviet refuseniks could suffer if the us 
eases its human rights pressure on the soviet union a former 
refusenik who waited 18 years to secure an exit visa told vice 
president dan quayle on monday 
if you want to open the society you must press them to their 
obligations yuli kosharovsky 47 once the longestterm jewish 
refusenik in the ussr told quayle and rep chris smith rnj 
during a halfhour meeting here 
smith a member of the helsinki commission helped kosharovsky 
in his battle to receive permission to leave the soviet union 
the three discussed human rights antisemitism and larger 
eastwest issues kosharovsky a former engineer said the soviet 
union must make its emigration law conform with its international 
obligations 
i expressed the main idea we must judge russians not 
according to propaganda but as to real deeds said kosharovsky 
the former radio electronics engineer presented quayle with a 
list of eight refuseniks with whom he shares personal ties 
he quayle was really interested in understanding how the 
whole process of perestroika works kosharovsky said in 
practical terms for ordinary people perestroika doesnt go over 
theres not enough food not enough goods 
kosharovsky who had worked until 1968 with intercontinental 
ballistic missiles quit his highsecurity job in 1968 and began a 
threeyear wait to apply for an exit visa 
beginning in 1971 he was systematically denied the right to 
leave on the basis of national security soviet authorities 
imprisoned him more than 200 times and accused him of agitating 
prisoners against the soviet regime he held a series of menial 
jobs all the while teaching hebrew at his apartment and organizing 
classes in other cities 
they couldnt break my spine so they kept us in as miserable 
condition as possible kosharovsky said i was told all the 
time maybe the next day is your last day the soviet kgb is very 
good they know how to get the soul of a person 
the bearded hebrew teacher represented soviet refuseniks at 
spaso house in moscow when former president ronald reagan met with 
mikhail gorbachev during the 1988 summit kosharovsky said despite 
a series of kgb searches he kept a postcard of smith reagan and 
thenvice president george bush on his wall 
it was my talisman really he said 
keep your courage and hope alive remember we both serve a 
god of miracles smith who first became involved in 
kosharovskys case in 1982 had written on the back 
kosharovsky finally won his visa march 10 of this year as a 
result of continued pressure from reagan bush members of congress 
and the national conference on soviet jewry 
kosharovsky arrived in israel on march 12 with his family and 
plans to continue to press for soviet emigration from his new home 
he cautioned that glasnost the new soviet openness and the 
economic reforms promulgated through perestroika remain on shaky 
ground 
us political language makes mr gorbachev as bold as he is 
he wants to be acceptable to the family of western democracy the 
whole process of political reform is so unstable the reforms so 
inconsistent with what came before he said 
kosharovsky said the socalled new religious freedom really is 
more a matter of authorities turning their heads the other way 
authorities dont interfere but they dont recognize 
religion he said 
although more soviet jews are winning exit visas said 
kosharovsky the authorities perpetuate the institution of 
longterm refuseniks they try to manipulate the emigration 
smith reiterated his support for the jacksonvanik amendment 
that ties trade to human rights despite bushs recent proposal to 
ease it to encourage greater trade between the superpowers 
my feeling is its an important and fundamental element of our 
policy to press it i think its important we keep it on the books 
if a true pattern emerges of liberalization then jacksonvanik can 
be waived as we do for hungary and poland smith said

more than 20000 teachers in the nations 
secondlargest school district went on strike monday demanding 
more pay and more say in running schools 
more than onefourth of the districts 554000 students stayed 
home or walked out of class at the 600 schools in the 
700squaremile los angeles district it was the first strike in 19 
years for the district which has five weeks of classes remaining 
about 500 hastily hired substitutes and another 500 
administrators joined teachers who crossed picket lines and regular 
substitutes 
teachers were asked by their union to withhold grades and 
attendance records from the district which demanded the files by 
monday or threatened to dock pay 
incidents such as blocked entrances and a substitute teacher 
running her car into a fence were reported but there were no 
arrests or injuries 
students who reported to class had a slow day thanks to absences 
or exoduses by their peers the entire student body walked out at 
belmont high school and an estimated 300 to 400 students walked out 
of north hollywood high school the district said 
were going to be stuck in a gym all were gonna do is sit 
and vegetate said maureen lim a 15yearold hamilton high 
school freshman as teachers marched in front of the building 
district spokeswoman diana munatones said of the districts 
594000 reported students 40000 were not enrolled full time this 
semester of the remaining 554000 students 430000 or about 72 
percent showed up for roll call on monday the district earlier in 
the day forecast substantially greater absences nearing the 50 
percent mark 
school board president roberta weintraub said 20000 to 22000 
teachers failed to report out of 32000 
munatones said later that the board increased substitute 
teachers pay by 30 to 167 daily she did not explain where the 
money for the extra pay came from but said it was because of the 
extreme emergency conditions 
weintraub said the district has made the best offer and the 
ball is in the unions court 
wayne johnson president of united teacherslos angeles which 
represents 22000 of the districts teachers nurses and 
counselors called administrators promises to keep schools 
operating with substitutes a joke at best 
johnson said more informal talks would take place but no formal 
negotiations were set 
im hopeful that it wnt go more than two or three days he 
said of the strike 
the district most recently offered a 215 percent raise over 
three years it also offered to set up councils giving teachers a 
greater role in the curriculum the union says administrators would 
still have too much power since teachers are the ones blamed when 
students perform poorly 
teachers salries range from a beginning 23440 to 43319 for 
those with doctorates 98 extra course units and 19 years 
experience 
the teachers want a 21 percent raise over two years and relief 
from unpaid duties such as playground patrol and staff meetings in 
march they overwhelmingly rejected an offer for a 20 percent pay 
raise over three years 
negotiations by then had deadlocked and the dispute was 
submitted to a state factfinder who will present a report 
wednesday 
state schools chief william honig accused the union of striking 
too hastily in order to use grades to force a settlement 
senior david stillman sitting idle on the steps of hamilton 
high where he will be valedictorian said i am upset with the 
teachers for using us a pawns i agree with what the teachers are 
doing but not how they are doing it 
at castle heights elementary school michael pollak dropped off 
5yearold son joshua and said he hoped for the best 
i dont anticipate any trouble he said i suppose im 
like most parents and want the strike to be resolved as quickly as 
possible so my childs education is not disrupted 
the situation was quiet there but elsewhere the district 
claimed school entrances were blocked by strikers substitutes 
faced threats of broken car windows and milk and trash trucks 
refused to cross picket lines at venice high school 
glue was found in locks at birmingham high school a substitute 
ran her car into a fence at roosevelt high school

president bush proposed a 12 billion 
anticrime plan monday to build more prison cells toughen 
sentencing for gunrelated crimes and ban semiautomatic ammunition 
clips of more than 15 rounds in an effort to take back the 
streets from criminals 
he declined to call for a ban on usproduced semiautomatic 
assaultstyle rifles a favorite weapon of drug traffickers but 
said he would make permanent a ban on many of their imported 
counterparts 
in measures expected to be popular with law enforcement 
officials he called for a minimum 10year sentence for using 
semiautomatic weapons during a crime and an end to the dropping of 
gunuse charges through plea bargaining 
he also recommended more money for federal law enforcement 
agents and prosecutors and an expansion in the number of federal 
crimes calling for the death penalty 
both sides in the guncontrol debate objected to parts of the 
package 
but bush said it would send a message to criminals were 
going to take back the streets 
for far too long a privileged class of violent and repeat 
offenders have calculated that crime really does pay that our 
criminl justice system is a crapshoot where the risks are worth the 
rewards well its time we change the odds and up the stakes 
enormously the president said in a speech at a national peace 
officers memorial service 
bush stood in the rain at the capitol before an audience that 
included more than 700 relatives of the 161 officers killed in the 
line of duty nationwide last year also present were uniformed 
officers from around the country 
two democratic senators quickly found fault with bushs 
proposal howard metzenbaum of ohio saying he was disappointed 
that the president chose to limit his action on semiautomatics to 
imported weapons and ernest hollings of south carolina declaring 
that if bush were serious about the recommendations he would have 
said where the money was going to come from 
the national rifle association the nations largest gun lobby 
applauded bushs proposals to get tougher on criminals but 
criticized his steps to restrict assault weapons 
we dont see a heck of a difference between a 15round 
magazine and three fiveround magazines other than about the two 
seconds it takes to change from one to another said james baker 
the nras chief lobbyist in washington thats not going to have 
an effect on criminals 
an administration official commenting on condition he not be 
named said some money was already in the budget for prison 
construction and some would be shifted from other law enforcement 
areas but most would have to come from a cushion of 
discretionary funds built into the budget compromise worked out 
by the white house and congressional leaders 
some of the presidents proposals such as the ban on clips more 
than 15 rounds require congressional legislation while others 
could be covered by administrative action most assaultstyle 
weapons used by criminals are equipped with 20round magazines the 
bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms says 
bush in his proposals for making federal sentences for various 
crimes tougher and surer made no mention of changing the federal 
furlough system which allows some convicted felons including drug 
offenders to go home on weekend passes during the presidential 
campaign bush repeatedly criticized the furlough program in 
massachussetts the home state of his democratic opponent gov 
michael dukakis 
in remarks awaited with great anticipation by both gun owners 
and guncontrol advocates bush said he would make permanent his 
ban on imports that the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms 
says are not for sport 
that requirement is already contained in federal law but before 
his announcement in march of a temporary ban such guns had entered 
the country by the thousands largely because of difficulty in 
defining whether they were for sporting or other use in march 
bush ordered the agency to review and resolve the issue 
as to why bush made a distinction between imports and domestic

the executive committee of the plo said 
monday a peace plan approved by the israeli cabinet was a farce 
that ignored palestinians right to a independent homeland 
the 15member committee also called the plan flawed saying it 
did not include israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories 
addressed the plan to jordan and ignored the palestine liberation 
organization as the representative of the palestinian people 
the committee sees that this proposal does not concern the 
palestinian people because it fails to recognize their existence as 
a nation the committee said in a statement after a meeting at 
their headquarters in tunis tunisia 
it said palestinians in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
would continue their 17monthold uprising the violence has killed 
475 palestinians and 21 israelis 
the arabiclanguage statement was sent to the associated press 
in nicosia the committee is lead by plo chairman yasser arafat and 
includes representatives from various palestinian groups 
israels cabinet on sunday voted 206 to approve prime minister 
yitzhak shamirs election plan for the occupied lands 
the plan rejected negotiations with the plo and sidestepped 
controversial points such as foreign supervision of the elections 
participation of 140000 arabs in east jerusalem and a timetable 
for the balloting 
israel has been under world pressure to adopt a peace plane 
since the plo decided last november to renounce terrorism and 
recognize israels right to exist 
the plo statement said shamirs plan did not take into account 
all the international resolutions including un security council 
resolutions 242 and 338 calling for withdrawal of israeli forces 
from arab lands occupied since the 1967 arabisraeli war 
in a further challenge of arab and international will the 
israeli government addressed this perfidious proposal to the 
jordanian government which had formally disengaged itself from the 
occupied west bank and recognized the palestinian state the 
statement said 
it said world opinion supported the idea that the palestinian 
people were entitled to selfdetermination and the best framework 
for negotiating this goal is an international middle east peace 
conference 
the proposal by the israeli government exposes the essence of 
the call for elections as being no more than a farce designed to 
deceive world opinion and consolidate the occupation accompanied 
by an escalation of its ironfist crackdown against the palestinian 
people and the intefadeh uprising it said

commercial fishermen headed to sea for 
the start of the halibut season monday hoping to steer clear of 
oil from the exxon valdez spill by following routes charted for 
them by the coast guard 
federal investigators meanwhile gathered for hearings on the 
cause of the march 24 disaster and the first otters treated in 
valdez for injuries from the spill were released back into prince 
william sound 
the coast guard made surveillance flights for three days 
charting drifting oil for the fishing boats very few areas where 
halibut fishing takes place had any free floating oil and it looks 
good said cmdr mike donohoe 
bob trumble a biologist with the international pacific halibut 
commission in seattle said that alaska has several thousand 
vessels licensed for halibut but many probably wouldnt be 
participating on monday the first of possibly four 24hour halibut 
periods because they are taking part in the oil cleanup 
the number of halibut fishing periods set by the commission 
depends on how many fish are caught the yearly quota could be 
caught in just three openers 
trumble said that along with steering vesels clear of oil state 
and federal inspectors will check the catch to ensure no tainted 
fish wind up on anyones table 
everyone is making a major commitment to make sure all the 
fish that are harvested are safe and pure he said 
the pollution led the state to cancel or postpone herring black 
cod and shrimp harvests in the sound and it closed some herring 
fishing grounds 
the halibut season was at risk until may 9 when federal 
officials decided to go ahead with mondays 24hour opener 
after determining that most of the gulf of alaska halibut grounds 
were not affected by the spill 
more than 60 million pounds of the large flounderlike fish 
were caught off alaska last year and sold for 745 million 
members of the national transportation safety board scheduled 
five days of hearings beginning tuesday in anchorage to investigate 
the cause of the spill 
the tanker strayed from shipping lanes on a clear calm night 
and tore its hull on a charted reef in prince william sound 25 
miles from the southern end of the alaskan pipeline at valdez the 
ship bled 109 million gallons of oil fouling hundreds of miles of 
shoreline 
more than two dozen witnesses were expected to testify 
including coast guard personnel crew members from the exxon valdez 
and exxon executives 
the skipper of the exxon valdez joseph hazelwood declined to 
testify but offered information in writing to the board 
hazelwood has been charged with operating a vessel while drunk 
and goes on trial june 20 he is free on 50000 bail he faces two 
years three months in jail and 11000 in fines if convicted 
the ntsb panel of inquiry includes representatives of the four 
parties with a direct interest in the proceedings the state of 
alaska exxon the coast guard and alyeska which operates the 
800mile alaskan pipeline 
ntsb spokeswoman drucella andersen said the boards report will 
take up to a year we hope to determine the probable cause and 
make some safety recommendations she said 
in prince william sound seven otters that had been taken to the 
otter rehabilitation center in valdez for oilrelated injuries were 
released monday near simpson bay northwest of cordova the coast 
guard said 
center director randall davis said the otters fur once again 
will fully insulate the animals 
the otters were tagged with radio transmitters to allow federal 
biologists to track their movement

movie producer robert evans on monday won the 
right to invoke his fifth amendment right against 
selfincrimination during a preliminary hearing on a slaying linked 
to his film the cotton club 
a witness implicated four defendants in the 1983 slaying of new 
york theatrical producer roy radin but never mentioned evans name 
municipal judge patti jo mckay had threatened to jail evans who 
is not charged in the killing for contempt for refusing to testify 
about it 
but mckay on monday said she was swayed by arguments from evans 
attorney who cited a report in saturdays los angeles times that 
evans has been linked by two potential witnesses to the radin 
killing 
the court finds that mr evans may properly invoke his right 
against selfincrimination she said 
the judge added an exception evans must answer whether he knew 
radin a question posed by the prosecutor last friday 
she said answering that question could not incriminate evans 
however his lawyer robert l shapiro said his client should not 
answer even that question 
mckay sent the issue to supervising municipal court judge david 
horwitz who after meeting with evans and his lawyers in chambers 
ruled the producer didnt have to answer that question either 
the preliminary hearing is to determine if there is enough 
evidence for the defendants to stand trial 
the first witness was carl pizak who worked as a security guard 
for defendant karen delayne laynie greenberger and for former 
hustler magazine publisher larry flynt who is not a defendant 
pizak testified that all four defendants were involved in 
radins killing and that it was related to a theft of cocaine and 
money he said he helped the defendants dispose of the murder 
weapons 
evans producer of such hits as the godfather love 
story and chinatown was in the midst of negotiations with 
radin to raise money for the cotton club when radin disappeared 
and was found slain 
the two had been introduced by greenberger 
no charges were filed until last year when a former 
brotherinlaw of hustler magazine publisher larry flynt came 
forward with information 
the case has become hollywoods most watched reallife drama as 
new developments provided links to flynts publishing empire and 
the underworld of colombian cocaine dealers 
greenberger is reputed to be a cocaine dealer with ties to the 
network of imprisoned colombian drug kingpin carlos lehder 
her codefendants are former flynt bodyguards alex lamota marti 
william molony mentzer and robert ulmer lowe lowe is fighting 
extradition in maryland

strains stress and headaches over 
disagreements among allies are nothing new in the atlantic 
alliance but this time theres a difference no more mr bad guy 
across the table 
for 40 years internal discord in the north atlantic treaty 
organization always has yielded to common concern about the 
perceived menace from moscow 
now that perception has changed two generations of soviet cold 
warriors have given way to a masterful political salesman and 
mikhail s gorbachevs wares are making it more difficult for the 
bush administration to sell its argument for modernizing natos 
shortrange nuclear missiles 
as president bush prepares for natos 40th anniversary summit at 
the end of may the missile dispute looms as a dominant issue so 
far it defies compromise with the united states and great britain 
opposed to immediate negotiations and determined to modernize the 
missiles while the west german government of chancellor helmut 
kohl insists on talks now 
bush says he thinks the missile differences can be settled that 
a lot of it is just smoke and that well have a smooth summit 
this alliance is not going to fall apart the president 
said it is going to stay together and be strong and well work 
it out bush has tried personally by telephone secretary of 
defense dick cheney and secretary of state james a baker iii have 
too 
as cheney observed its not the first time weve had 
differences youve got 16 sovereign nations with different 
viewpoints different political situations at home 
but gorbachev knows an opening when he sees one when baker met 
him in moscow last thursday the soviet president upped his ante a 
bit saying he plans to cut about 500 weapons from the warsaw pact 
arsenal its a token the soviets are believed to have about 
10000 nuclear weapons from bombs down to shells in the european 
balance nato has about 4000 that can be used at short range 
baker called the surprise move a small step but a good one he 
also said that nato has scrapped five times that many nuclear 
weapons over the past decade 
nevertheless the timing of gorbachevs ante can only add to the 
european pressure the administration is trying to withstand by 
definition shortrange missiles are the ones that go off in the 
neighborhood and to the germans that means germany east or west 
there is wide public support for negotiations to get rid of the 
missiles in west germany and that leaves kohl little room to 
maneuver on the issue 
bush will be in brussels may 2830 for a nato summit followed 
immediately by a visit to bonn for separate conferences with kohl 
the two men spent a half hour on the telephone on may 5 but 
neither budged gorbachev is to visit bonn june 1215 
by the numbers the administration has a solid case because the 
soviet union has a lot more to give or barter away we believe 
the vast soviet superiority and warsaw pact conventional forces 
must be reduced before we can discuss reductions in short range 
nuclear missiles white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
said in summation of the administration stand 
but numbers arent everything and the net result is to cast the 
united states as the intransigent party the side that wont even 
negotiate thats an unfamiliar and uncomfortable posture 
twenty years ago president richard m nixon traveled to europe 
on much the same route bush will take at the end of this month and 
with a similar mission nato was in crisis then too president 
charles de gaulle had pulled france out of the military structure 
of nato 
nixon told the allies that he would be entering negotiations 
with the soviet union on a wide array of issues and he promised 
full and genuine consultation before and during those 
negotiations 
thats almost the opposite of the problem facing bush as he 
heads for rome brussels bonn and london 
in an appraisal of us foreign policy this year nixon said 
hed once been told that fear not love holds alliances together 
he said fear of the soviet union has waned and what love may 
exist between economic competitors in the west is a very weak glue 
to hold an alliance together 
a top administration official summed up the difference another 
way in one word

it became the catchphrase of the television 
season louise mercers voyeuristic inquiry of recently divorced 
new singles group members any sexual problems 
louises recurring laugh line on nbcs dear john almost 
didnt come with the nowtrademark raisedeyebrow english accent 
in the beginning they didnt know if i should play it as 
english or use an american accent said carr who has done an 
american accent on english television the decision wasnt made 
until just before i tested its better for me you dont have that 
added pressure of how to pronounce your words 
louises accent is one vestige of the roots of dear john 
which is based on a shortrun english series 
carr plays the leader of a queens ny community group that 
serves the needs of newly single people including john lacey judd 
hirsch a schoolteacher whose wife ran off with his best friend 
he soon befriends several members of the group including louise 
louise is inquisitive independent warm and loving said 
carr she really cares about these people she loves the group 
more than carrs accent was incorporated into the show because 
she was pregnant so was louise carr and her husband american 
actor mark arnott the return of the secaucus seven had a 
son dashiel in february 
i wasnt pregnant when we did the pilot said carr the 
costuming was fabulous it wasnt apparent until the end i stayed 
small until the eighth month then i exploded i just looked 
buxomly and matronly people just thought i was putting on a little 
weight it was so nice they kept me employed i only missed three 
shows they wrote in my pregnancy and louise has become a single 
parent well have more on that next season 
woody harrelson of cheers made a guest appearance as the 
babys father 
carr had come to the united states from england with the new 
york and los angeles production of charles dickens nicholas 
nickleby 
by the time we finished the play id been here a year she 
said i played different roles such as fanny squeelas miss 
snevelici and peg sliderskew by the time we got to los angeles 
there was a lot of interest in me 
in that naive way i thought i was going to be a hollywood star 
in a minute it doesnt work that way at all its very difficult 
i thought it would be easier if i met agents and casting people so 
they would know me when they came to london then i met mark in my 
agents office and six months later we got married 
carr made her film debut at the age of 8 in gary coopers last 
movie the naked edge 
its hard to remember much about it she said gary cooper 
looked quite ill my mother put me in a neat cardigan but it got 
torn because i had to look more povertystricken they tore a hole 
in it it was a wonderful way to make extra cash my family was 
poor i kept pestering them for dance classes it was a way to pay 
for my classes 
she made her professional stage debut at 15 in a touring 
production of agatha christies the spiders web she 
originated the role of mary mcgregor in the west end production of 
the prime of miss jean brodie and made her film debut in the 
role 
she played one of the maids in upstairs downstairs the 
british production that became a big hit on pbs in the 1970s she 
played an american in a bbc production of a noel coward short 
story what mad pursuit 
doing an american accent in london is one thing but doing it 
here is another thing she said i had a dialogue coach i was 
supposed to be from iowa but i think i sounded like i was from 
chicago i was brought up in a cockney area and i had to have that 
accent knocked out of me my sister still talks cockney i wonder 
what sort of accent my son will have

against a backdrop of political turmoil 
irans leaders are grappling with the thorny question of who will 
rule the islamic republic after ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
the signs are that because no one has the aging revolutionary 
patriarchs charisma or religious authority no one man will take 
his place and that iran will be led by a council of three to five 
members 
the leadership question was thrown open in april after khomeini 
forced his designated heir ayatollah hussein ali montazeri to 
resign following his criticism of iranian policies 
parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani who is the frontrunner 
in presidential elections later this year is likely to be a 
candidate for the collective leadership which would embrace irans 
various factions 
other possible candidates include ayatollah ali meshkini 
radical chairman of the 83member assembly of experts ayatollah 
ahmad jannati a leading member of the 13man council of guardians 
chief justice ayatollah musavi ardebili a centrist and khomeinis 
son ahmad who is showing increasing signs of political ambitions 
after years in his fathers shadow 
khomeini 88 and ailing has named a 20man committee of irans 
leading political clerical and legal figures to settle the 
leadership question and to draft amendments to the december 1979 
revolutionary constitution a move that could have farreaching 
political consequences 
he said the constitution contained imperfections and flaws 
he did not specify them but warned that any delay in the 
amendments will result in plagues and bitter consequences for the 
country and the revolution 
the committee is expected to present its recommendations in 
advance of the presidential elections to be held between july 22 
and aug 22 before incumbent ali khameneis second fouryear term 
runs out in september he cannot run for a third term 
the result of that poll will affect the future course of 
khomeinis decadeold islamic revolution and the power of the 
countrys theocracy which radicals fear is in danger from the 
liberalization sought by more moderate leaders 
this has fueled a radical resurgence in the wake of the aug 20 
ceasefire in the war with iraq that has triggered purges of 
socalled liberals and the executions of hundreds of political 
dissidents 
the current swing toward the antiwestern radicals dates from 
feb 14 when khomeini issued his death sentence on the british 
author salman rushdie on grounds that he blasphemed islam in his 
novel the satanic verses 
but khomeini in the past has thrown his weight behind one 
faction or another every few months in a delicate balancing act 
that prevents any group from becoming too powerful 
some analysts suspect khomeini may already be swinging back 
toward rafsanjanis socalled pragmatists 
one of the constitutional committees tasks is to decide whether 
to scrap or downgrade the post of prime minister and broaden the 
executive powers of the presidency 
rafsanjani the only declared candidate for the presidential 
election so far is supported by the hardpressed middle class the 
powerful bazaaris or merchant community and some of the 
conservative religious establishment 
the populist speaker polled 13 million votes in last years 
parliamentary elections the highest single tally in the ballot 
another possible entry in the presidential race is 
prosecutorgeneral musavi khoeiniha a middleranking cleric who 
led the militants who stormed the us embassy in tehran in 
november 1979 
the incumbent khamenei who backs rafsanjani noted that the 
leaders who drew up the constitution after shah mohammad reza 
pahlavi was ousted sought to ensure that power would be dispersed 
and not concentrated in view of their bitter experience of the 
concentration of power under the former regime 
the radicals oppose centralizing power but ayatollah abolqassem 
khazari an influential figure noted recently some powers 
should be concentrated if the legislative branch is vigilant 
there can be no move toward a dictatorship 
the radical revival torpedoed rafsanjanis efforts to build 
bridges with the west to end irans isolation and left him 
politically exposed 
but the speaker who has survived earlier reverses has in 
recent weeks publicly taken a much more radical position 
protecting his flanks from hardline rivals led by interior minister 
ali akbar mohtashemi 
how long he will identify with the radicals is open to question 
he has changed positions many times trimming his sails to the 
prevailing political winds until he is able to reassert himself

hastings kamuzu banda president of 
malawi is a man enamoured of the finer things of life and much 
taken with english ways 
from under his homburg hat he rules with a stern hand a land in 
which the police and prison guards are unarmed and the us embassy 
has no marine security 
banda himself rides around in an open limousine without the 
heavily armed bodyguards that accompany most other african leaders 
you dont get the impression banda expects to be shot said 
a british diplomat who has lived in lilongwe the capital for two 
years 
said to be in his 90s banda is a short spry man with a 
brooding face that rarely smiles 
he rules as presidentforlife over one of the worlds poorest 
nations a country of 8 million people with an annual per capita 
income below 150 among africas lowest 
but bandas salary is equivalent to 77000 a year about 70 
times that of an unskilled malawian worker 
his official salary is but a fraction of his income however he 
controls the countrys biggest trading investment and real estate 
conglomerate press holdings a group of private companies that 
account for 30 percent of all economic activity in malawi 
banda has seven mansions spread around a country the size of 
pennsylvania it costs the state the equivalent of 19 million a 
year to run them 
his favorite is a british baronialstyle mansion on a hilltop 
outside blantyre malawis commercial capital it is known as 
sanjika and its huge banquet hall is adorned with scottish 
memorabilia collected by banda when he worked as a medical doctor 
in edinburgh 
banda has referred to himself as a black scotsman but his 
people know him as ngwazi conqueror the statecontrolled media 
routinely refer to him as our dynamic and farsighted leader 
but banda runs a oneparty state and wields power as if it were 
a monarchy he is strongly anticommunist 
no east bloc countries have been allowed to open embassies in 
malawi a mountainous nation in southern africa nor are there 
diplomats from radical arab governments or liberation movements 
but israel and south africa whose diplomats are shunned in most 
african countries are represented 
bandas diplomatic trade and aid ties with south africa have 
earned him the condemnation of many other african leaders 
banda is victorian and it shows 
women including western tourists are prohibited from wearing 
slacks and skirts must cover the knees men with long hair risk 
being refused entry by immigration officials or they may be offered 
a haircut at the airport 
at his birthplace in central malawi banda built the kamuzu 
academy where greek and latin are taught by british teachers and 
some 350 black pupils wearing boaters and blazers live under a 
spartan regime 
the academy is known as the eton of africa although the 
secondary education costs the equivalent of 6000 a year the 
pupils pay the standard national fee which amounts to about 100 
and banda pays the rest 
banda himself was educated in the united states studying at 
wilberforce academy in ohio and at indiana and chicago 
universities he is a scholar of classical literature and an elder 
of the presbyterian church of scotland 
after living in the united states and britain for 40 years 
banda returned to the former british colony of nyasaland in 1958 
he was arrested by colonial authorities in 1959 as the leader of 
the territorys only black nationalist movement he spent a year in 
detention but following his release led nyasaland to 
independence as malawi on july 6 1964 
banda has ruled ever since in an authoritarian style that has 
brought charges of human rights violations from such international 
organizations as amnesty international but raised little internal 
opposition 
malawis economy rests on a shaky foundation of tobacco tea 
sugar and peanut exports to britain and the united states with 
agriculture accounting for 40 percent of the gross domestic 
product estimated at 7885 million 
only 10 percent of malawians live in towns some 56 percent are 
seriously malnourished infant mortality among africas highest 
is running at 153 per 1000 births and average life expectancy is 
47 years africas lowest 
as if its own problems werent enough malawi has taken in at 
considerable cost 650000 to 800000 refugees from the civil war in 
neighboring mozambique 
still some progress is being made 
malawi embarked on a program of economic reforms dictated by the 
international monetary fund last year in return the imf and world 
bank extended a 160 million credit for an importliberalization 
program that has put malawian factories back in full production for 
the first time in more than three years

a harvard hopeful put his best foot forward by writing his essay 
with a pen held between two toes promising in the words of campus

we get bathing suits with the vassar logo reports vassar

some tiedyed underwear the theme this year seems to be clothing 
perhaps reflecting the values of this generation 
what it definitely reflects is high school hype at its most 
hopeful kids brought up on tv glitz and puffery clamoring for 
primetime notice beneath a pile of admissions folders 
increasingly each year the admissions staffs at nations top

printed portfolios time magazine mockups proclaiming the 
applicant man or woman of the year and endless coils of videotape 
showing the aspirant icedancing building a sailboat addressing 
the local rotary performing a vivaldis concerto for 
contrabassoon 
the admissions officers at several of the nations top schools 
all had hilarious often pathetic tales to tell of student 
selfpromotions and almost all were up to the tops of their 
wastepaper baskets with videotapes which they agreed seldom made 
any valid contribution to an application 
all had the same doleful message it takes a heap of hype to 
offset a mediocre academic record 
also there are subtle changes taking place or about to take 
place in the admissions process 
some schools such as vassar and tulane are getting away from 
the formal interview with an applicant 
at a growing number of colleges the wellrounded student is now 
considered something of a square peg as vassars montoya points 
out we have shifted from attracting wellrounded students to 
building a wellrounded class 
the challenge now is to put together a class melding students 
with extraordinary talent from different backgrounds a promising 
violinist a top athlete a shakespearespouting computer whiz a 
streetsmart pool shark with a passion for pure math 
and alas alumni clout is vanishing from the admissions scene 
even if an applicants surname can be envisioned on a new library 
the verdict often is goodbye mrchips 
often the admissions office mail brings food fudge fruitcakes 
datenut bread pecan cookies chocolates decorated with harvards 
veritas shield or tulanes green wave 
georgetown received homemade bread from a student who promised 
not to loaf a wedge of wisconsin cheddar with the plea 
help get me out of the land of cheese and an artichoke from a 
girl urging the committee to peel away the leaves of this 
application and find the true heart of the matter 
lois conrad tulanes dean of admissions was sent a boomerang 
painted in the school colors asking for happy returns and a 
charming music box from which a tiny car emerged pulling a ribbon 
inscribed tulane bound to the tune of way down yonder in new 
orleans 
vassar got a morse code message in a bottle which when decoded 
was a cry of help ive been abandoned in a high school with an 
incompetent guidance counselor another candidate taped 2 to her 
application not enough to constitute a bribe she explained 
but enough for a cup of coffee to relax you when you sit down to 
consider my case 
some of the slicker public relations ploys betray the hand of an 
overanxious parent the computer skills of a secretary or business 
partner or the grab em by the lapels advice of the burgeoning 
bookshelf of howto guides professing admissions expertise 
when youre in this business it isnt extraordinary to get on 
a daily basis all kinds of attentioncraving devices says 
william fitzsimmons dean of admissions and financial aid for 
harvard and radcliffe where some 14000 apply for 1600 places in 
the freshman class i do think some of these guidebooks have 
misled students stunts and gimmicks can jeopardize an application 
disclosing a lack of judgment or hiding positive factors 
at yale where l2000 applied for 1200 openings worth david 
complained of seeing a good deal more pr tricks than wed like 
people out there writing books and acting as independent counselors 
are encouraging kids to package and promote themselves 
some of this makes sense if you hide your talents how will 
anyone know but kids forget the most important part of any 
application is the record of what courses you took in school how 
you did in them and what your teachers say about your performance 
this is a heck of a lot more important than what shoes you wear to 
an interview or whether you remember to send a thankyou note 
thankyou notes are big this year 
all of a sudden we are flooded with them david groans 
the guidebooks say sit down and write a thankyou note to your 
interviewer and the kids of course want to touch all bases 
in this mediamesmerized age nothing beats home video for 
colorizing the ego and making every applicant famous for 15 minutes

ive got a whole box of videos sitting right here sighs 
conrad at tulane which was in the final stages of putting together 
a freshman class of 1425 from among 7200 applicants she cited a 
few titles the bridge beyond yonkers in review live 
interviews on christmas the final judgement 
oops she says that last one has judgment spelled wrong 
which isnt going to help but then videos rarely do we dont have 
the time or the facilities to give them the consideration the 
effort deserves 
mit where 6600 apply for 1050 openings also has been 
inundated with videotapes these can backfire by being a sort of 
overkill laments michael behnke director of admissions but 
we try not to hold it against them some are poorly done the most 
common take the form of a tour of my life 
you get this poor kid opening a door and saying hi this is 
my room 
come on in and meet my computer heres my bookcase then he 
wanders around and introduces mom and dad and the dog its all 
kind of silly and a little pathetic 
georgetown sifting through 11000 folders to assemble a class 
of 1320 tries to discourage videotapes theyre bulky to store 
and difficult for the committees of our five separate schools to 
view and pass around says letitia peterson associate dean of 
admissions 
vassar where the fall class of 600 was chosen from a pool of 
4350 doesnt accept videocassettes at all 
before the video craze conrad says tulane used to get some 
very elaborate portfolios and collages students would display 
clippings of every bake sale they ever participated in and long 
lists of awards and blue ribbons the ones i always chuckle at are 
perfect attendance certificates 
this year a young lady sent georgetown a hollowedout goose egg 
after an ivy league recruiter at her high school put thumb and 
index finger together and intoned goose egg when asked about 
the impression made by a wellrounded student im the ultimate 
goose egg she confessed but promised to focus her varied 
interests in one direction if accepted 
in rare cases applicants fraudulently have claimed to be 
handicapped or a member of a minority or from some exotic 
background to gain preference 
a tulane aspirant tried tracing his family tree back to 
cherokee indians 
harvards fitzsimmons recalls a foreign student who applied for 
six or seven years always with a different ploy one year he was 
very poor then he claimed to be the son of the prime minister and 
next the son of an alumnus he filled out his own teacher and 
counselor reports with very little effort to disguise his hand 
writing and one year used green ink for everything 
lately a number of top colleges have been questioning the value 
of interviewing each applicant 
our next faculty meeting on admissions will be looking at 
exactly that question says vassars montoya not all students 
shine in an interview the feeling is that a halfhour does not 
tell us as much as the fouryear academic record or recommendations 
from those who have seen the student in action 
tulane has gotten away from the formal interview in favor of 
group information sessions conducted by alumni across the country 
but a personal appearance is paramount for admission to what is 
undoubtedly the nations choosiest freshman class the drama 
division at the new yorks juilliard school each year more than 
800 sometimes as many as 1000 audition for only 25 openings 
competition is spurred by the success of such recent graduates 
as william hurt elizabeth mcgovern christopher reeve stephanie 
zimbalist kevin kline who won an oscar this year and also by the 
statistic that 80 percent of the alumni are actively working in 
film or theater 
at auditions held in february in chicago new orleans san 
francisco and at the lincoln center campus each applicant presents 
a twominute classical and a twominute contemporary monologue to a 
panel of fulltime professionals actors directors voice coaches 
and movement specialists 
shakespeare and the greek dramatists are popular in the 
classics says auditions coordinator barbara degast and 
anything from chekhov and shaw to sam shepherd is fair game for the 
contemporary part many are selfwritten and some fit singing and 
dancing into the combined four minutes we dont accept videos 
except in the rare case of a swiss student who couldnt get to an 
audition 
all of the admissions officers showed compassion tolerance and 
a gentle sense of humor about the youthful dreams rising from their 
inbaskets gimmicks and all 
sometimes a gimmick is ingenious enough to qualify as 
supplemental material or at least as david concedes it 
brings a little amusement into a long day 
the robotic finger beckoning mits behnke demonstrated skill 
in carving and figuring out the dynamics it actually moved at the 
joints without executing an obscene gesture 
tulane was intrigued by a beautifully executed treasure map 
that showed real knowledge of cartography and l7th century piracy 
and with an engineering applicant who turned a very complex math 
equation into to a love story an amusing soap opera about the 
relationshiained rain forest an ocean fresh 
and saltwater marshes rolling plains and desert a kind of 
earthbound space colony 
next year eight men and women will begin a twoyear stay in 
this tiny selfsufficient paradise to test just how the world 
outside works and how mankind can avoid destroying its fragile and 
interlocking ecosystems 
kathleen dyhr a 39yearold spokeswoman for the project called 
biosphere ii is one of the 14 candidates she says the chosen 
eight probably will be single probably four women and four men 
marrieds can apply but unless both are especially qualified one 
likely would be denied 
the candidates already know each other well in their everyday 
lives on the outside so it is doubtful that romance will bloom 
under glass but if it does it is presumed it will be discreet 
there is overall a duty to mission and the candidates will be 
chosen for their dedication there wont be any psychological 
testing since there is stress enough in this geonaut business as 
it is 
although the interior design is still tentative each 
biospherian will have an individual apartment with a ground floor 
and a mezzanine small but private unlike the rest of the 
biosphere the walls of the habitat will not be transparent each 
apartment will have its own kitchenette although because of a 
need for food control the main meal of the day will be centrally 
prepared and served 
there will be a recreation room a small gym laboratories 
offices and a library 
if dyhr is selected shell have to give up cigarettes no open 
flame in the biosphere it burns up oxygen 
to test the basic living quarters abigail alling a 29yearold 
biosphere worker spent five days in march living in a test module 
where she harvested her own food from her own garden cooked her 
own meals and monitored her tiny environment a 15000cubicfoot 
chamber smaller than a moving van she said of her experience it 
is truly a paradise inside its like a tropical garden 
but five days is not two years no one knows what stresses will 
crop up 
the project is organized on the same basis as a scientific 
expedition with which most applicants have had experience there 
will be a group leader but there will also be family and outside 
guidance available by telephone in short they will not be alone 
stranded in space if professional conflicts cannot be adjudicated 
on the inside they will be from the outside 
youre going to have problems wherever you have people 
dyher says but if you have eight individuals who are really 
interested in what they are doing youre going to have the best 
chance of everything working together 
their days will be full besides running scientific experiments 
the volunteers will be completely on their own raising their own 
food on a 24000squarefoot terraced farm where they will reap 
bananas papayas tomatoes cucumbers wheat and corn there will 
be pygmy pigs chickens and milk from pygmy goats enough to 
provide each of them a balanced daily diet of about 2500 calories 
there will be coffee bushes enough for a couple of cups each 
per week and grapevines enough for a ceremonial glass of wine now 
and again besides theres always papaya or banana brandy 
when the last of the eight steps through the door sometime 
before september 1990 it will be closed for more than 700 days 
not so much as a newspaper or quart of milk will cross the 
threshhold of this solarpowered earthship news movies 
television will be piped in 
but biosphere ii which covers 2 acres and has 5 million cubic 
feet of space has a larger purpose than mere survival it may 
provide the pattern for future space stations and become a 
marketable biosphere for other purposes from the protection of 
endangered species to the education of ecologists a laboratory for 
how the planet works 
it is being financed by edward p bass a wealthy texas oil man 
and supporter of several environmental organizations such as the 
world wildlife fund bass is sinking 30 million into the project 
which is located on his 2500acre sun space ranch in this corner 
of ariizona where the santa catalina mountains roll down to the 
sonorran desert and tucson to the southwest 
it is no easy task this latterday genesis just take the 
insects which they grow and breed in an insectarium on the ranch 
grounds some 250 species will be chosen to do the myriad 
minichores in biosphere ii they have been collected from all over 
biosphere i which is planet earth 
bugs will pollinate the plants break down dead plant material 
so fungi and other processors can recycle it and provide food for 
the birds and fishes a few butterflies are being added for 
aesthetics 
cockroaches termites earthworms and millipedes are welcome 
because they enhance the soil houseflies however need not apply 
they are useless 
when the life sciences people mentioned termites the 
engineers started jumping up and down says project director 
margaret augustine they were afraid the termites which have been 
known to digest concrete would eat their way through the sealant 
that keeps the glass dome airtight 
that led to tests with the termites the scientists decided to 
use and the creation of a worst case termite scenario they 
created a little termite sandwich in the center of which was some 
favorite termite food the sealant was deemed safe when the 
termites would not chew through to the inner prize 
so much for termites what about lights in the human quarters at 
night they screened off the human quarters against the bugs

even the scientists came to crosspurposes in designing this 
little world botanists wanted wind for pollination entomologists 
did not want their bugs sucked up by big fans the people in the 
middle were the engineers constantly revising plans compromising 
it is the professional nature of engineers and architects to 
keep the outside world out now suddenly they had to devise ways to 
keep the wild world in as for the scientists they were used to 
having the whole outdoors as a laboratory now they have to be 
satisfied with a very confined indoors 
consider hummingbirds great little pollinators but a pair of 
hummingbirds need the nectar of 3200 flowers a day for energy 
scientists had to be sure there would be that many in bloom every 
day of the year 
at the outset no one thought what would happen to the airtight 
bubble with the air heating up and expanding during the day it 
would explode the glass so the engineers devised external 
inflatable lungs that would store the excess until it cooled for 
return to the biosphere 
with a closed water supply engineers also had to devise 
exterior tanks to cool the liquid in short this small world in 
some cases is too small for its own good 
nevertheless it will be the same air and water yearround the 
oxygen is breathed in by humans and animals who breathe out carbon 
dioxide which is breathed in by the plants and used in 
photosynthesis which produces more oxygen 
biosphere ii is built on a hill to take advantage of the natural 
proclivity of water a stream begins on an 85foot mountain that 
dominates the rain forest it then flows through the plains and 
grasslands of the savanna down to the 25foot deep ocean with its 
coral reef and then to the salt and freshwater marshes drying up 
before it reaches the desert 
the waterladen air then is drawn and climbs the mountain where 
natural cooling and condensing coils bring it down as rain and dew 
to feed the stream again 
the desert required a compromise there was no way to reduce the 
humidity so dr tony burgess of the university of arizona 
patterned the deserts after those of baja california where the 
cactus and other plants have learned to live with ocean fog 
perhaps the most difficult design was dr walter addeys for the 
salt and freshwater marshes he built prototypes one in the 
basement of the smithsonian institution where he is director of the 
marine systems laboratory and another in a greenhouse of 
washingtons old soldiers home the problem was the proximity of 
the fresh and saltwater species the result is a miniature florida 
everglades 
the marsh may have been one of the most fragile of the systems 
because of the life that lives in the mud explains kathy dyhr 
but in the prototypes he found they had virtually no species 
extinctions except for the mosquitoes to which everyone raised a 
cheer but walter said thats not so great because we need them for 
the fish so they put up signs that said dont swat the 
mosquitoes 
in a world without chemicals the biosphere settlers will rely 
on ladybugs lacewings marigolds and crop rotation to control 
pests human and animal waste and compost becomes fertilizer 
the earth has its problems says carl hodges of the 
university of arizona who designed the human habitat weve got 
acid rain problems dirty air problems and weve got carbon 
dioxide increasing at an alarming rate right now we dont have a 
research tool where we can control the global parameters like co2 
and the quality of the atmosphere i see the big payoff of 
biosphere ii as learning how to do a better job of stewardship of 
biosphere i 
the rain forest and its towering mountain and stream are the 
design of dr ghillean prance director of the kew royal botanical 
gardens of london in association with the new york botanical 
garden he patterned it after the dwindling rain forests of the 
amazon 
dr peter warshall of the university of arizona patterned the 
savanna grasslands after those of south america australia and 
africa plants and animals from those areas create the grasslands 
in biosphere ii 
in all some 3800 species of plant and animal life are being 
invited to the party and as in the original eden snakes says 
dyhr we may need a python in there if we put in rodents which 
help aerate the soil and carry seeds there will be no large 
predators however not enough room an ocelot needs two acres to 
range for food there might be some mouse deer to help eat the 
grasses 
of almost as much interest as the individual biomes are the 
ecotones or tension areas where one biome yields reluctantly to the 
next in these areas where welldefined habitats change 
scientists hope to learn how desert encroaches on more productive 
areas what happens when fresh water turns brackish what goes on 
when climates change 
the idea of a biosphere a living creation of nature with its 
own logic its own rules is not new probably the first to 
consider earth and its environment as a biosphere was a soviet 
scientist vi vernadsky in 1926 the idea was further developed 
by james lovelock and lynn margolis who postulated after darwin 
that the environment helps mediate species variation 
in the beginning or near it they suggested that oxygen was 
sparse and so most of the early creatures were anaerobic bacteria 
that didnt need oxygen but they gave off oxygen and in the 
process poisoned their own environment so they had to retreat into 
the mud 
biosphere ii may teach mankind enough so it does not suffer the 
same fate

editors note after two years of scientific barhopping a 
university of minnesota anthropologist has discovered that 
countryandwestern music can be hazardous to ones sobriety that 
jazz tends to leave folks in their cups that small dance floors 
dim lights and live bands all make people drink faster when it 
comes to boozing jim schaefers an expert he once spent his 
weekends drinking jim beam out of a toilet plunger 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
jim schaefer is taking all the fun out of 
drinking in fact hes got it down to a science 
check out the bar is it linear rectangular 
horseshoeshaped schaefer zeroes in on the serving counter of 
yet another minneapolis watering hole do you have an opportunity 
to be facetoface how do people clump when its crowded lets 
look at the lamps how many footcandles of light is it noisy a 
decibelmeter would be nice 
welcome to the wild kingdom of barroom anthropology 
there are 656 bars in the twin cities and jim schaefer has 
bellied up to a big share of them of course he didnt do all that 
barhopping for fun 
well not entirely 
as director of the university of minnesotas office of alcohol 
and other drug abuse prevention the lanky anthropologist wanted to 
find out how lights music and other environmental cues influence 
the way people drink 
two years and five dozen bars later schaefer has discovered 
that countryandwestern music can be hazardous to ones sobriety 
that jazz tends to leave folks in their cups that small dance 
floors dim lights and live bands all make people drink faster 
turn up the volume throw in lots of seats hang some action 
photos on the walls and there you have it jim schaefers 
prescription for hangovers by the dozen aspirins by the score 
but theres no use crying in your beer just take off that 
neckerchief and put on a tie dress codes help people stay sober 
so do upscale settings drunks violate the decorum schaefer 
says 
add a jukebox but keep the volume low so people can talk 
clear lines of vision help too as do frosted beer mugs an equal 
ratio of men and women and for some reason landscape paintings 
shes acting single im drinkin doubles 
im gonna hire a wino to decorate our home 
what made milwaukee famous has made a loser out of me 
country classics all but prior to hitting the honkytonks 
schaefer had always assumed that fast drinking and fast music went 
handinhand the fact is in moody emotional settings people 
drink more he says 
jazz is hot and melancholy country has very rich 
corevaluebased lyrics it reflects reallife dilemmas your 
cheatin heart lucille blue eyes cryin in the rain wed 
hear these 20 or 30 times a night 
to gauge the effects of all that lyin and cryin graduate 
students carried tape recorders into cowboy bars in montana where 
schaefer began his teaching career the students staked out tables 
near the jukebox while willie and waylon wailed away in the 
background the young scientists tapped the table each time a 
customer took a swig 
at the university of minnesota where schaefer now works he 
corroborated his findings teaming up with sociologist richard 
sykes for the most comprehensive academic study of barroom behavior 
ever done for two years students observed 4500 people in 65 
bars along with drinking rates they noted arrivals departures 
prices and decor 
the results people slowed their drinking when the tempo reached 
85 beats per minute when it dipped below 60 they sped up 
the moral mamas dont let your babies grow up to be cowboys 
at the least make sure they have a safe ride home after those long 
beery nights with the mechanical bulls 
for their next study schaefer and sykes will zero in on people 
guzzling in groups schaefer also hopes to check out the connection 
between drinking and gambling and between drinking and games such 
as billiards or darts

hes taken to carrying light meters in and out of twin cities 
taverns and his curiosity about ladies night is growing hes 
also busy refining his theories on twang the nature of 
countryandwestern lyrics is important schaefer thinks but so 
too is the tone of the tune 
ive begun measuring individual songs coding them in terms of 
nasality he says societies with a high degree of nasality 
tend to have lots of tension and stress in our society nasality 
is pretty much out except for countryandwestern music this 
could be significant 
call it coming of age in missoula 
but if the setting seems frivolous the research is not 
identifying risks can lead to more effective campaigns against 
alcohol abuse and drunk driving schaefer says it also can help 
owners run their bars more responsibly 
alcohol abuse cost the country 117 billion last year 
threequarters of it due to lost productivity schaefer says 
were all at risk from cirrhosis hypertension heart disease 
cancer fetal alcohol syndrome 
we need to talk about how to drink smart we need to learn 
that its ok not to drink and its ok to put down intoxication 
tough talk from a guy who once spent his weekends drinking jim 
beam out of a toilet plunger 
schaefer grew up in schenectady ny the son of parents who 
didnt drink he made up for that at the university of montana 
where he enrolled as a forestry major at 18 the legal drinking age 
was 21 but that didnt stop him from checking out every watering 
hole in missoula 
on autumn saturdays he attended university of montana football 
games with other members of the kams and dregs a school spirit 
group in more ways than one 
they didnt allow booze in the stadium so wed go there the 
night before and bury bottles of jim beam wed start drinking at 5 
am the day of the game we drank out of plungers and wed lead 
cheers dirty cheers mostly 
rather than let school interfere with his social life schaefer 
settled for cs then forest economics left him stymied and the 
dean suggested he pick up a couple of social service courses to 
boost his average 
schaefer chose anthropology in no time he was hooked he 
changed his major and earned an undergraduate degree then a 
masters then he decided to go all the way 
it got to be time for my dissertation and i thought of two or 
three scholarly ideas but when i met with my professor to discuss 
them he asked me a question that stopped me in my tracks what do 
you know a lot about 
schaefer thought long and hard then it hit him drinking 
he said i know a lot about drinking 
his dissertation examined the relationship between drinking and 
family structure political ideology values and religious beliefs 
in 57 societies it earned him a phd and a teaching job clearly 
jim schaefer was on to something 
twenty years later schaefer limits himself to one or two 
drinks he still enjoys the bar scene but that isnt to say its 
been one endless happy hour 
to keep from blowing his cover hes dressed up like a cowboy 
and learned how to twostep hes smuggled gallons of booze out of 
bars by the strawful to compare freepoured with automatically 
dispensed hes eaten chicken wings by the flock and crudites by 
the crate while listening to such nasal classics as she got the 
gold mine i got the shaft 
dedicated scientist that he is hes even been known to drink 
the occasional beer 
now really all things considered dont it make your brown eyes

editors note he called himself the unicorn back when he was 
at center stage in the activism of the 60s and 70s ten years ago 
ira einhorn skipped bail while awaiting trial for the murder of his 
girlfriend and has been at large ever since but amid recent 
reports that the elusive unicorn has been sighted in sweden plus 
the publication of new revelations about the case investigators 
have not given up the chase 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
police removed a steamer trunk from the 
apartment of philadelphias star flower child 10 years ago and the 
world created by the unicorn began to wither 
the trunk contained the remains of helen maddux a blonde former 
cheerleader known as holly ira einhorns lover 
she had been missing for 18 months by the time private 
investigators hired by her family in tyler texas pieced together 
enough information to point an accusing finger at einhorn until 
then a living symbol of nonviolence with incredible personal charm 
and a nimble intelligence 
today the unicorn is a fugitive from justice and faces a murder 
trial if he ever gets caught 
einhorn was a 60s hippie guru of drugs and free love who rode 
the tide of peace and unity to acceptance as a corporate 
guruconsultant in the 70s people looked to einhorn for guidance 
as the new age dawned he became a harvard fellow and an 
environmental leader as he and the times matured though he still 
dressed as a campus radical did right down to the ponytail 
he was a very engaging person recalls thacher longstreth 
former president of the philadelphia chamber of commerce and now a 
city councilman i have nothing but respect for what he was or 
seemed to be 
an investigative journalist who chronicled einhorns case in a 
recent book said the unicorn was both product and property of 
philadelphia the city nurtured him and worshiped him the city of 
brotherly love was also his stage and einhorn was the ringmaster 
wrote new york citys steven levy 
einhorn was a founder of the free university at the university 
of pennsylvania in 1964 organizer of the citys first bein in 
1967 first smokein in 1969 earth day in 1970 and sun day in 
1978 he was an expert in the paranormal and spoke at conclaves 
around the world 
but the battered and partially mummified body in the steamer 
trunk along with some new and startling revelations by levy led 
investigators and finally even his close supporters to conclude 
that there was a very dark side to the unicorn 
its a shame longstreth says because here was a man who 
held in his power the magic of the mythical creature whose name he 
used as his own the unicorn focused the attention of the nation on 
himself on the environment and on philadelphia when he organized 
the citys earth day observance 
it was truly wonderful longstreth says recalling the day 
thousands gathered to honor the sanctity of earth and mankind in 
philadelphia and in other cities but the premiere event was in 
philadelphia on independence mall near the liberty bell the 
unicorn presided as the television cameras zoomed in to show him 
kissing sen edmund muskie full on the mouth 
levy said the unicorn was more than just a nickname it was an 
ideal for einhorn 
since someone had pointed out how his name einhorn one 
horn relates to the mythical horselike creature with a single 
horn between the eyes ira had fancied himself as kin to that 
mythical creature representing purity uniqueness gentleness and 
sexual power levy wrote 
the philadelphia district attorneys office and police think 
hes still got some of the magic because hes still running free 
somehow hes still able to get the confidence of some people 
especially women it seems says terry williamson a spokesman 
for the district attorneys office but hes a brutal killer as 
far as were concerned 
einhorn was arrested on march 28 1979 and charged with the 
murder of miss maddux the arrest shared the headlines of another 
big event that day the worst nuclear accident ever at three mile 
island power plant in middletown pa 
he claimed innocence and said it was a ciakgb frame he was 
able to get the services of a top attorney of the time arlen 
specter now a us senator 
but evidence of a frame didnt surface and in january of 1981 
while free on bail the unicorn skipped his trial was to begin in 
february or march 
einhorn grew up in philadelphias jewish neighborhoods attended 
the university of pennsylvania and was among the many caught up in 
the activism of the vietnam era levy grew up within a mile of 
einhorn attended the same high school where einhorn studied and 
played football there was a chance facetoface meeting while levy 
was working on the underground newspaper known as the drummer 
those memories prompted his decision to research and write the 
unicorns secret which was published in october

i remembered well that ira was the big presence in 
philadelphia levy says he stood for nonviolence and it 
seemed unreal for him to be charged with murder 
i didnt set out to prove guilt or innocence i just wanted to 
find out what the real story was 
there was the story everyone knew 
here was a man fluent in science literature and hippiedom who 
had built a worldwide network of intellectuals from all walks he 
was the prophet of new concepts he found in books articles and his 
own brain that flowed around the world to those in his network 
bell telephone of pennsylvania even paid the postage and listed him 
as a company consultant 
im a communicator he told the philadelphia daily news in 
1975 i dig up facts and data and convey them 
longstreth says einhorn had only two faults 
one was body odor another was simply his own motion 
he was erratic longstreth says he pushed his bad ideas 
as hard as he pushed his good ones 
levys digging uncovered another einhorn who could hide things 
from nearly anyone even his network of intellects and supporters 
nearly to the end of his reign 
his network was still somewhat intact when he fled first to 
ireland because there was no extradition treaty with the united 
states according to law enforcement agencies 
at some point he assumed the name ben moore 
one of those who helped finance his exile was barbara bronfman 
exwife of an heir to the seagrams fortune swedish authorities 
told the philadelphia inquirer 
ms bronfman read levys book and decided to cooperate with the 
philadelphia district attorney 
williamson said he could not disclose how much cooperation there 
might have been or the true extent of the investigation over the 
years 
i can say that hes definitely always been a high profile 
fugitive for us williamson says 
interpol in december conveyed a tip to swedish authorities that 
einhorn was in stockholm but ms bronfmans boyfriend tipped off 
einhorn and authorities found only empty rooms the inquirer said 
the book definitely turned the heat on and a few people have 
also contacted us levy says 
the unicorns secret is about how the unicorn met the former 
cheerleader from texas in 1972 by then a graduate of bryn mawr 
and how such a man could wind up as her murderer while fooling 
those around him 
levy discovered a stormy relationship during which miss maddux 
tried repeatedly to shed einhorns overpowering influence her own 
insecurities kept pushing her back 
then in september 1978 she dropped out of sight einhorn 
claimed he knew nothing other than she had left the apartment to do 
some shopping and never came back 
at first that seemed plausible and police considered miss 
maddux a missing person who wanted to be missing but fred and 
elizabeth maddux had not liked their daughters companion and hired 
a retired fbi agent to find out what happened the retired agent 
turned to other retired agents for help 
levys book followed the case being built against einhorn by the 
private investigators including reports by dwellers of the 
apartment who told of a terrible smell one man even remembered a 
scream 
levy found that einhorn had asked two women for help in 
disposing of the trunk he had told them it was full of russian 
papers he had to get rid of he wanted to dump it in the 
schuylkill river the trunk wouldnt fit in their car levy said 
he also found two women who had been attached to einhorn in the 
past one relationship ended when einhorn strangled the woman 
nearly killing her the other ended when einhorn smashed a bottle 
over her head 
according to levy only one question remained 
how could a smart guy like him deny that trunk in his 
apartment 
levy concluded it was a drug ketamine which wouldnt cause 
brutal behavior but would allow einhorn to disassociate himself 
from it 
williamson said the effort to find einhorn continues today 
heightened by the book and the december incident in stockholm 
the problem right now he said is what einhorn looks like 
swedish authorities said he cut his nowgraying hair and changed 
his dress they provided sketches from those who knew him the 
trouble williamson says is that the unicorn has once again 
managed to work his magic 
the sketches were all different

editors note as america prepares to honor its war dead on 
this memorial day many veterans of the vietnam war are on 
humanitarian missions to help their former enemies they are 
finding that time can heal wounds both physical and mental

fourteen years after the end of the 
vietnam war former foes came face to face for the first time at a 
government workshop in hanoi where crippled vietnamese veterans try 
to eke out a living 
nguyen dinh vinh who still feels the pain of an american bullet 
that ripped off the left side of his forehead told a group of 
american visitors how he spent a year in an underground field 
hospital codenamed k23 the hospital in what was then south 
vietnam withstood american b52 bomber strikes and searches by the 
us infantry 
im glad we didnt find it said kevin bowen of boston who 
had fought on that same battlefield but was now on a humanitarian 
mission to aid his former enemies 
as america prepares to honor its nearly 60000 men and women who 
died in vietnam as well as the fallen of other wars many veterans 
such as bowen no longer hold hatred toward the vietnamese and are 
actively working to help people such as vinh 
at age 38 vinhs future is bleak he still suffers bouts of 
dizziness and headaches he and his wife make only 6 a month 
between them at the an duong veterans workshop in hanoi barely 
enough to support themselves and their two children 5 and 10 
but he too is no longer bitter toward the americans 
during the war we both suffered vinh says through the 
news media im aware there is frustration and suffering among 
american veterans i can relate to that for the vietnamese we had 
to defend the country and we had to fight neither one won the war 
its something neither one of us wanted 
vinh is among vietnams disabled veterans who strain an already 
bankrupt economy whose unemployment rate is as high as 25 percent 
in a country so poor it cant even afford wheelchairs for its war 
victims or equipment as simple as sewing machines to keep them 
working 
nguyen dinh lieu head of the governments invalid veterans 
section says the country is struggling to care for 25 million 
vietnamese war victims including 1 million disabled veterans and 
15 million paramilitary and civilians 
an october 1987 report by a us technical team that visited 
hanoi estimated that vietnam was able to fit only 9000 of an 
estimated 60000 amputees who needed artificial limbs and 
rehabilitation the report estimated the country needed 30000 
wheelchairs 
estimates put communist vietnams military losses at 600000 in 
the war with the americans vietnam also has 300000 soldiers 
missing in action according to nguyen can acting director of the 
vietnam office for mias although some american veterans who have 
visited the country doubt the number of mias is that high 
many veterans with slight or moderate disabilities are sent back 
to the countryside to their villages to work the farmlands from 
whence they came some are sent to workshops set up by the 
government like an duong which produces nails inner tubes and 
sports clothes 
others go with their wives and children to live in disabled 
veterans homes like those in tay ninh province 50 miles west of ho 
chi minh city in the southern part of the country 
in one 7acre compound 300 former viet cong guerrillas and 
their families are living in homes set aside by the government for 
disabled veterans legless paraplegic blind or scarred by napalm 
men and women alike recently made their way to a meeting room to 
greet visiting american veterans

there representing the joiner foundation were bowen codirector 
of the william joiner center for the study of war and social 
consequences at the university of massachusetts in boston and 
ralph timperi assistant commissioner of public health for the 
state of massachusetts 
the foundation provides humanitarian aid to disabled vietnamese 
veterans and hospitals the veterans in tay ninh have been trying 
to open a small woodworking shop and timperi and bowen are trying 
to get tools for them 
i was here 20 years ago bowen told the veterans we share 
many things in common our center was founded in 1982 to help 
american veterans who suffered physical injuries as well as 
injuries in their minds and hearts 
thats why we return today although there are few of us here 
i think we represent many more back home tay ninh was known as 
tough country i know because i lost my best friend here we can 
learn to know each other better to trust and respect each other 
we all wish we could change the past but we cannot timperi 
said but what we can do is work together as friends and 
brothers 
a vietnamese veteran who lost an arm in the war replied that as 
a soldier he had killed americans im very sad about that he 
said but im glad we will be friends 
like tay ninh the an duong veterans workshop in hanoi in the 
north is filled with men and women veterans who have lost arms and 
legs but is virtually empty of equipment and medicine its 
buildings and equipment are old diminishing its production 
capacities as well as the earnings of its more than 100 veterans 
who average about 2 a month not enough to survive on 
the government has to provide extra support in order to 
guarantee a minimum level of subsistence says do van nghe 
director of an duong in this area and in the capital itself 
there are many many more veterans who are without any kind of job 
either their families or the government has to provide for their 
support 
by law the us government cannot provide material assistance 
to vietnam because the countries have no diplomatic relations but 
it has pledged to help nongovernment charitable organizations and 
individuals in getting humanitarian aid to the country in return 
vietnam is cooperating more fully with the united states in its 
efforts to find and return the remains of americans missing in 
action 
much of the humanitarian aid is coming from american veterans 
we have a tremendous bonding with these veterans timperi 
says theres a very strong sense of common experience its very 
sad to see the injuries that theyve suffered and the difficult 
life they have now the economy of this country is decimated 
theres a lack of every kind of imaginable supply and resource and 
equipment 
just as they had in tay ninh timperi and bowen brought badly 
needed medicine to an duong to help control the headaches of the 
veterans like vinh with head injuries they also plan to ship new 
sewing machines to the workshop 
we receive very little support from the government an duong 
director nghe told the americans without support from groups 
such as yours our capabilities to generate jobs and products would 
be very much limited 
its important we know each other better so that other people 
will know who it is that we came to work with bowen replied 
the hands are extended on both sides 
as these former warriors who had bloodied each other embraced 
and shook hands timperi pointed to his hip and told the wounded 
vinh i was also shot

editors note when officials wanted to know what kind of 
weather to expect during the cleanup of the alaskan oil spill they 
turned to a weather archive in the mountains of north carolina the 
national climatic data center handles tens of thousands such 
queries each year from farmers lawyers sailors filmmakers and 
others

perhaps its fitting that the worlds 
largest repository of weather records is housed in a 1920svintage 
indoor shopping mall that leaks during downpours 
accurate weather records dating back to 1890 some even to the 
time of the pilgrims at plymouth rock are available at the 
national climatic data center which has dozens of cubbyhole 
offices in the the historic building guarded by two terracotta 
griffins 
every time it rains hard the roof leaks and we have to break 
out the buckets says steve doty the centers project director 
despite the accomodations the center with a staff of 300 
turns out an impressive amount of weather information answering 
85000 queries last year alone 
we cant give you the weather forecast for next week but we 
can give you a look back 100 years doty says our role is to 
supply the historical perspective 
the centers long view at the worlds climate can be vital when 
it comes to such things as fighting world hunger sending 
astronauts into space or winning court cases 
for example when an exxon tanker spilled 10 million barrels of 
oil in march into prince william sound in alaska industry and 
government experts called the center to learn what kind of weather 
conditions could be expected during the cleanup 
by coincidence the center had just published a climatic atlas 
of the area which provided detailed information on temperatures 
wind speed and ocean currents 
bill brower who helped prepare the atlas said the data showed 
the 70mph winds that hit the valdez area at the time of the 
accident were unusual for that time of year the information was 
beneficial as cleanup efforts were coordinated 
what we offer is a lot of good hard science doty says we 
can tell you normals and extremes so you know what to expect 
while keeping weather records may seem like dull work some of 
the greatest minds in us history have shown an interest in it 
ben franklin thomas jefferson and george washington carver all 
were amateur weather observers copies of their records can be 
found at the center which is part of the us commerce 
departments national oceanic and atmospheric administration 
the tons of records stored in the centers basement are 
testimony to generations of lessfamous volunteer weather trackers 
weve even got a copy of a diary with weather records from 
plymouth rock doty says 
most of the bound records stored in what once was the malls 
underground parking deck come from places like vicksburg miss 
st joseph mo or bear mountain ny since 1890 
so if youve just got to know how many times it snowed in 
chicago on april 30 for the past 99 years the folks at the ncdc 
can help 
the raw data comes from the military the national weather 
service the federal aviation administration and 8000 volunteer 
weather observers hourly weather observations pour in from around 
the globe much of them from 10000 ships stationed in various 
positions and from weather satellites orbiting earth 
current records are stored on computer but because of budget 
constraints the center has been able to save on microfiche only a 
fourth of the 200 million paper records 
in 1951 the center was moved from new orleans to asheville in 
the mountains of western north carolina the city had a pool of 
workers skilled in keypunch machines so the government bought the 
arcade building and set up shop 
at one time the sprawling building that takes up an entire city 
block was bulging at the seams with keypunch cards now its rooms 
are stuffed with computers and microfiche readers 
the center prints about 5000 different publications on such 
topics as hourly precipitation data by state national storm data 
and global climatic data the publications go out to more than 
50000 individuals and businesses 
seven staff meteorologists answer thousands of telephone and 
mail queries each month over the years they have been asked some 
peculiar questions including 
a freelance writer wanted to know what the weather was like 
during the oct 30 1938 radio broadcast of the the war of the 
worlds 
actress carol burnett called to find out whether thunderstorms 
and hail hit the san antonio area on april 26 1933 the day she 
was born 
a company planning to shoot a television commercial wanted to 
know where in the united states they were likely to find snow on 
the ground in november they were instructed to shoot on location 
in stampede pass wash which averages 64 inches of snow each 
november 
a texas law firm requested wind speed and direction records for 
a client who was planning to build a chicken coop the lawyers 
wanted to show that the odors from the coop would not be blown to 
surrounding homes 
a chocolate candy company planning a summer publicity campaign 
requested nighttime temperatures in several midwestern towns to 
help them pinpoint the best time to leave samples on doorsteps 
one out of three requests come from attorneys trying to 
reconstruct weather conditions in accident or criminal cases says 
sam mccown the centers supervisory meteorologist 
the minimum charge for information was increased recently to 
12 while the average cost is about 40 some complicated requests 
can cost several thousand dollars 
last summer the center set up a special office to handle 
requests for droughtrelated information calls came in from all 
over the country 
richard heim who was in charge of the drought office said 
records on file from the 1930s and the 1950s put last years dry 
weather into perspective 
at the peak of the 1988 drought about 26 percent of the country 
was classified as experiencing extreme drought on his computer 
heim called up a map from 1934 which showed 45 percent of the 
country was suffering from extreme drought 
the weather records also help scientists explore such things as 
the greenhouse effect a warming of earths temperatures that 
has been attributed to industrial growth 
there are some scientists who believe the 1988 drought was 
caused by the greenhouse effect heim says weve had worse 
droughts if this one was caused by that what caused the droughts 
of the 1930s and 1950s

jesus christ superstar and starred as danny zuko in 
grease on broadway and in chicago 
my two dads has been onagain offagain for the past two 
seasons it made its debut in september 1987 and ran for the whole

they wouldnt guarantee i could write it

each day willy russell would drive past the 
everyman theater in liverpool england and see a huge banner 
proclaiming march 19 willy russells new play opens 
out of such positive statements and rapidly approaching 
deadlines new plays are born 
id wake up in the middle of the night and think about having 
to give back the money to the poor people who already had purchased 
tickets the playwright recalls now it was then that this 
woman shirley valentine sort of came onto the page 
since then she has become something of a cultural phenomenon 
the onewoman play was a success more than two years ago in 
liverpool the battered british port city made famous by the 
beatles it was an even bigger hit in londons west end where it 
won the prestigious laurence olivier award as best comedy of the 
year 
since then shirley valentine has played places like west 
germany australia israel scandinavia and now is thriving in new 
york where it was nominated for a tony award as best play of 
broadways 198889 season 
in new york as in london the play stars pauline collins as a 
bored lonely middleaged english housewife who leaves her husband 
and grown children for an amorous adventure in greece 
at first russell was skeptical about writing a monologue 
i probably have the same prejudice against the idea of 
spending two hours with the same character as anybody else he 
says i knew i couldnt write just a onewoman show but rather a 
play that happens to have only one character present on stage but 
you cant convince an audience of that in advance theyll know 
that when they come out 
in productions around the world the audience response has 
followed the same pattern at first skepticism and no great 
advance sale then terrific wordofmouth from audiences and 
boxoffice success 
shirley valentine is the 42yearold russells first 
broadway play american audiences know an earlier work educating 
rita more from its film version which starred julie walters and 
michael caine than from its various regional theater and 
offbroadway productions 
russell followed a roundabout path to writing plays born in a 
suburb of liverpool to workingclass parents he dropped out of 
school at 15 and seemed destined for factory work his father 
wanted him to become a printer but russell wanted to write 
songs poetry even a novel 
my family was intensely theatrical i now realize he says 
they told stories they sang they lived their lives through a 
sort of oral theatricality i think thats why i now write for the 
stage and not the page 
his mother suggested he become a ladies hairdresser and he did 
for six years he set hair during the day and at night hung 
around beat clubs like the cavern and played the guitar 
i was a terrible hairdresser but i couldnt do anything about 
it he says 
russell had his music which by then was folk and his 
performing 
you could write a song and sing it in a club that night he 
says you could get a reaction to it i learned the dynamic of 
performance itself thats why i have a great deal of sympathy for 
actors because i performed and because of that experience i 
finally got out of hairdressing 
russell realized that if he became a teacher he could have time 
off in the summer to write in 1971 he went back to school and 
when a drama department production of peer gynt fell through 
he offered to write a play 
the second i began writing this play for the stage i knew 
that all the years of trying to write poetry trying to write the 
novel i was struggling toward this particular moment he says 
since those days russell has made a name for himself not only 
as the author of educating rita about a young female 
hairdresser who wants more out of life but as the author of two 
successful british musicals john paul george ringoand 
bert and blood brothers 
shirley valentine originally was called shirley smith 
such a poor name muttered russells wife the playwright 
finally settled on shirley valentine the name of a girl he 
went to secondary school with and not anything like russells title 
character his character is not modeled on anyone he knows russell 
says 
miss collins best known in the united states as sarah the 
saucy maid in upstairs downstairs wasnt russells first 
choice for the role he always had associated the actress with 
light middleclass parts it wasnt until he heard her being 
interviewed on the radio that he heard vowel sounds that suggested 
that her origins were not middle class she was from the 
merseyside the liverpool area 
shirley valentine transferred triumphantly from england to 
the united states with very little changed for american audiences 
its very difficult especially looking at broadway from an 
english point of view because of the mythology of it it seems 
that its the only sort of theatrical area in the world where the 
audience is monumentally overprotected russell says i wanted 
to get through that without the play being americanized if we 
presented the inds samples of vidalia onions and 
then conducts chemical tests that may someday enable consumers to 
identify the strength of an onion 
the gourmet onions have a reputation of being the sweetest 
mildest in the world but when there are 50 to 60 vidalias to slice 
in a day her lab fills with eyeburning fumes and a pungent odor 
i have to wear a mask and goggles mrs hayes said 
otherwise my eyes burn and my sinuses throb 
she and horticulturist doyle smittle are collecting information 
on sugar and pungency levels in vidalias 
were trying to develop a rapid objective method of measuring 
quality in onions said smittle wed like to have a technique 
simple enough that a grower or group of growers could measure 
the quality in at least every field of onions they have 
this summer food scientist robert shewfelt will convene a taste 
panel at the experiment station in griffin to sample some of the 
same onions that have been tested 
smittle who has been studying the compounds in onions since the 
mid1970s hopes to establish a relationship between the chemical 
composition of vidalias and the onions preferred by the taste panel 
onions have virtually no odor until their tissue is damaged by 
slicing at that point an enzyme triggers a chemical reaction that 
produces ammonia and other substances that cause tears 
chemical tests give a good indication of an onions pungency 
but theyre too complicated and costly for routine use by growers 
said smittle 
taste buds arent as reliable as laboratory tests because humans 
tend to forget how bad or good a sample was he said members of 
the taste panel will sample six onions a day then theyll come 
back a week or two later and evaluate the same onions 
the horticulturist foresees use of an infrared device that would 
scan onions in the packing sheds and determine their mildness 
since sugars absorb infrared light there may be a correlation 
between taste and the amount of light that passes through onions 
he said 
smittle believes growers eventually will be able to place 
stickers on each onion with a picture of a thermometer showing the 
degree of mildness his tests have shown that onion mildness varies 
from field to field and season to season 
with a pungency rating consumers could use the hotter onions in 
dishes that require more flavor the rating also would help 
consumers adjust the thickness of slices to specific needs 
georgias 260 registered growers and packers have turned the 
vidalia onion into a 30millionayear crop protected by state 
law onions bearing the vidalia label have to be a yellow granex 
hybrid the growing region encompasses 13 counties in southeastern 
georgia and parts of six other 
growers claim vidalias are sweetest because of the variety and 
the lowsulfur soil around vidalia a town of 10000 residents 
about 80 miles west of savannah

i will use my name his grace 
said i will use it ruthlessly 
his name is gerald cavendish grosvenor the sixth duke of 
westminster and reputedly britains richest man and he said hell 
lend it to a good cause 
the 37yearold aristocrat was standing on what he considered to 
be a good cause the site of an industrial estate hes doing his 
bit to help the local development corporation attract american 
investors 
if you are given a lot i think you should give a lot back 
said the duke who spends about onethird of his time supporting 
150 charities 
he says it springs from a sense of duty we still have a lot 
to do with those who have been left behind in the march toward 
prosperity 
its also a sort of insurance against those british radicals who 
would regard the duke as a child of archaic privilege in these 
egalitarian times its important for aristocrats from royalty 
downward to be seen working for the common good 
but he is no apologist for the aristocracy 
there is a class system wherever you go in the world we just 
have handles on our names to identify our pecking order better 
in the pecking order he is also the marquess of westminster 
earl grosvenor viscount belgrave baron grosvenor and 15th baronet 
of eaton 
the boyish energetic duke is tall mediumbuilt and for his 
outing to warrington he wore a conservative suit and the british 
aristocracys obligatory gold pinky ring his bassethound eyes are 
very blue his eyebrows meet at the bridge of his nose 
laughing in frequent short bursts he is casual and friendly 
obviously wellpracticed at putting the overawed at ease with 
oneliners 
he speaks with an updated version of the upperclass british 
accent laced with occasional americanisms like you guys 
the grosvenor family fortune is estimated by londons sunday 
times to be worth 5 billion surpassed only by queen elizabeth 
iis 87 billion 
it owns 300 acres of londons elegant mayfair and belgravia 
districts including the plot on which the us embassy stands 
back in 1677 it was all cabbage patch and swamp the dowry of 
mary davies the 12yearold bride of sir thomas grosvenor 
the estate also owns pieces of scotland vancouver in british 
columbia and hawaii a sheep station near wagga wagga australia 
and extensive property outside chester in northwest england where 
stands the family home eaton hall 
its not something i wake up every morning with and say how 
wonderful to have all this money the duke said i am not 
sitting there on hard cash and its not going into cars and boats 
as i see fit 
does he ever feel guilty about being born so rich 
no never have done and never will do he said 
i am a curator of what my family does now and of what my 
family have done in the past and i am a planner of what my family 
will do in the future 
i use my wealth in order to create my wealth is a business 
and it is a very substantial employer of people 
a major drawback he said is having too little time to see 
ones family i clearly resent that but he added it comes 
with the territory 
born in 1951 he was the second of three children the other two 
were girls 
he was reared in northern ireland where his father was a member 
of parliament and ran a silversmiths business he has described 
his childhood as idyllic isolated and free 
a series of accidents of birth and death brought the title to 
his father in 1967 and at 16 young grosvenor was suddenly heir to 
one of the worlds biggest fortunes 
at exclusive harrow school he was an undistinguished student 
and instead of college he roughed it as a cowboy on a british 
columbia ranch learned farm management in new zealand and worked 
for a real estate agent and a nature conservancy agency in britain 
when he was 21 his father became ill and grosvenor began to 
learn the complexities of the family business 
in 1978 he married 19yearold natalia phillips or tally 
whose greatgrandfather was grand duke michael of russia 
fittingly they met at a ball 
at 27 on his fathers death grosvenor succeeded to the title 
he has two daughters and no son so the heir to the estate is his 
cousin the earl of wilton 
clearly my regret is that my father went when i was very 
young he says i had to cocoon myself at a very early age 
he had dreamed of an army career and found it hard to adjust to 
his responsibilities 
he reached a compromise during the week he is the businessman 
commuting to london by helicopter on weekends he dons camouflage 
and joins maneuvers as a major in britains territorial army or 
volunteer reserve force 
the duke has tried to modernize restructure and expand the 
estate which builds and manages shopping centers industrial sites 
and office buildings it has extensive property interests in the 
united states 
my goodness we werent quite on the quill pens when i took 
over but we werent far from it he said 
the duke says he has another ambition not to be the grosvenor 
who loses the family fortune he says hes happy to pay income tax 
but his accountants spend a lot of time figuring out how to avoid 
inheritance taxes 
some of his tenants complain that his rents are exorbitant and 
he has been tagged lord greedy guts he is unapologetic 
i operate on the simple principle of supply and demand i am 
not running a charity for some of the richest people in the 
world he said someone can go and live somewhere else if they 
want to i have a waiting list from here to washington 
the duke describes himself as a liberal whig and his aides 
advise the uninitiated to address him as your grace 
the first duke was hugh lupus a master of the horse who was 
awarded the title in 1874 for philanthropic works the first 
recorded hugh lupus was william the conquerors huntsman whose 
contribution at the battle of hastings won him chester as a gift 
the dukes treasurefilled family home is a 12bedroom modern 
glass and white tile structure his father built in 1973 to replace 
a victorian palace that was demolished 
in his spare time grosvenor enjoys hunting deer and grouse he 
likes scuba diving too its rather peaceful at the bottom of 
the sea 
its less peaceful on the warrington site news cameras click 
questions are asked then the duke shakes a few hands hops behind 
the wheel of his dark blue jaguar and sweeps off 
with two honks and a wave

miss piggy glamorously attired in swimwear 
and a broadbrimmed hat is lounging around the hotel pool soaking 
up the sun and the attention 
the sun high in the cloudless sky is hot and miss piggy 
retreats to a cabana the hotel like a pink fantasy surrounded by 
palm trees is reflected in the sparkling blue pool 
behind her the crew rigs up a sun screen for her scenes by the 
pool her makeup woman and wardrobe mistress await her summons 
she pulls down her sunglasses peers over them at a reporter and 
says breathlessly please no interviews 
jim henson however is willing to talk after all the nbc 
series miss piggy is working on is called the jim henson hour 
more than 30 years ago henson created the muppets which 
has grown to include miss piggy hensons green alter ego kermit 
the frog big bird and cookie monster on sesame street and a 
wide assortment of mostly lovable but sometimes gruesome creatures 
the jim henson hour is a magazinestyle show that mixes 
halfhour the storyteller dramatic pieces miss piggys 
hollywood and muppet creatures in various pieces some of which 
are enhanced by computer graphics 
we had been doing the storyteller and were working on a 
hightech version of a variety show and some specials when the idea 
struck us of putting it all together said henson we presented 
it to nbc and they said ok what it is is two halfhour shows back 
to back but about every fourth episode well do an hour show 
one piece called the song of the cloud forest is about an 
endangered species of tree toad the design is in the style of 
south american primitive art with bright intense colors the 
muppet creatures are filmed against a blue ultimatte screen and the 
animationlike background is generated electronically by a system 
called paintbox 
basically everything we do involves creatures of some kind 
said henson one show is called living with dinosaurs which 
was written by anthony minghella who writes the storyteller 
its a contemporary story about a boy with a toy dinosaur that 
comes to life its live action but the dinosaur is a muppet my 
son brian manipulates the dinosaur he also does the dog in the 
storyteller 
we produce all of the shows i have a whole separate unit in 
england they do the storyteller and theyre doing two of the 
hour shows they also made the creatures for lighthouse island a 
halfhour liveaction show about an island with some very strange 
people 
henson said he wanted to do things that have never been done on 
television before i think weve always pushed puppetry to the 
limits and now were pushing new technologies to the limit he 
said were using the most sophisticated stateoftheart 
technology available its very exciting to mix puppets and 
technology 
the muppets made their first network appearance on the jimmy 
dean show in the early 1960s rowlf the talking dog carried on 
frequent conversations with dean the first wide exposure of 
various muppet characters came on sesame street whose 20th 
anniversary was celebrated on the jim henson hour in early may 
the muppet show from 1976 to 81 ran in more than 100 
countries and was seen by more than 235 million people kermit 
miss piggy fozzie bear animal and all the other creatures became 
as famous as real celebrities the show won three emmys a peabody 
and numerous other awards and honors the muppet babies is an 
animated saturday morning series on cbs that has won four emmys in 
a row as best childrens program and is also seen in 50 countries 
hensons creations inspired a series of movies beginning with 
the muppet movie in 1979 the witches based on a raold 
dahl childrens story about a little boy whos turned into a mouse 
is due out later this year his creature shop in london made the 
characters for dream child and teenage mutant ninja 
turtles 
his production of fraggle rock which ran for five years on 
home box office will begin running in the soviet union in october 
puppetry is very advanced and very popular in russia henson 
said soviet television has a puppet pig called krushe on every 
afternoon 
another series jim hensons the ghost of faffner hall will 
make its debut on hbo in the fall it will feature a new set of 
muppets including fughetta faffner a ghost with a love of music 
who haunts the gothic mansion she built in the last century

the accused paramount home video vhs priced for rental 
beta 2995 rated r 
 
rape is a difficult and sensitive subject to present for mass 
consumption on film such movies as sophia lorens two women 
and farrah fawcetts extremities managed to evoke the violence 
and rage of rape in a realistic and adult way 
the accused does the same and more 
inspired by the gang rape on a pool table in a new bedford 
mass bar the accused begins with a screaming halfnaked 
bruised young woman running from a tavern while a college student 
calls the police to report that a woman is in trouble 
the woman is sarah tobias a foultalking slutty waitress jodie 
foster won the academy award for her performance and well deserved 
it was she is riveting and pure force her rage her frustration 
and her pain cut through the screen like a laser 
as the assistant district attorney who accepts a plea bargain 
for the rapists but later goes after the onlookers after locating a 
seldom used law kelly mcgillis is stunning 
jonathan kaplans direction is tight and absorbing he builds 
suspense from start to finish and doesnt show the rape until the 
very end the scene is bound to make viewers uncomfortable and 
many will be angry at the howling idiots who encourage the attack 
but all will be riveted to the home screen

heart of midnight should carry a warning do not watch this

while there is little nudity or actual sex enough is shown or 
implied to make the story not one for the squeamish

closed nightclub from her doting uncle only to find out that the 
establishment had been a sex club and uncle was a sadist the 
place is haunted by bumps in the night and something that lives in 
the walls carrying out mayhem 
some of the scenes are strong on sadism and there is a rather 
long rape scene there is also a tasteless exploitation of aids 
used as the cause of uncles death

itll be apocalypse now and not sweet 
sisterhood from the walkueres when the berlin opera brings wagners 
four ring operas to the kennedy center in june 
for 100 years nobody really knew how terrible the job is 
these girls do says gotz friedrich who staged the ring for the 
company he has headed since 1981 its a mixture of war and love 
and necrophilia its a terrible situation this is terrible 
music 
the 58yearold friedrich says it took a modern movie to show 
opera the real warlike content of the ride of the walkueres 
the first time this music was really in the ring context was 
in apocalypse now when the helicopters fly to drop attack troops 
in vietnam the director francis ford coppola understood what 
this music means he said 
when i put the girls in black leather i did it to show in 
which kind of association we have to understand them today they 
are not lovely daughters of a god they are wonderful terrible 
awful girls the killer army 
the black leather bodices friedrich says can be left 
revealingly open or laced to conceal depending on the inclination 
of each walkuere singer 
friedrich first staged a ring at covent garden in 197476 he 
started a ring in hamburg in 1979 but because of other 
circumstances it wasnt done 
i was really happy when i could do it in berlin in 198486 
since you can not make too many different rings in your life he 
said in a recent interview 
the berlin operas performances of its ring in japan in 1987 
were the first ever there itll perform the cycle twice in 
washington at the john f kennedy center for the performing arts 
between june 2 and 18 
the stage designed by peter sykora features a big tunnel one 
end facing the audience friedrich calls it a time tunnel 
the most important part of his berlin conception friedrich 
says is the tunnel the tunnel means for me the specific space 
where time is suspended what was old can be young what is in the 
future can be the past 
when they come to the end of the ring they are on the 
beginning again when we start the ring we know we start from the 
end this is the philosophical idea behind all this 
a postcard was the germ of the tunnel idea friedrich said a 
friend sent me one from the new subway station in washington dc 
now it comes back to washington 
the ring he said is about power money and love its 
characters and its viewers are trying to find solutions and a 
better way for the next generation but they do the same errors 
again 
in the opera we show what you could learn personally i have 
my doubts maybe every third generation has to repeat all the old 
mistakes in different situations the question wagner puts is if 
love can save the world what kind of love how to save which 
world none of the questions is really answered but in 100 years 
the ring stays very actual 
opera staging is important friedrich believes if the music 
carried everything composers wouldnt have been so intent on 
staging we know the stage is changed in 200 years therefore it 
is the duty and challenge for the stage to find a new dialogue with 
the music because the composer wanted dialogue betweeen music and 
stage 
when the ring was first completed and performed in bayreuth in 
1876 wagner said in the next year he would change everything he 
saw as soon as he saw it on stage that what he wrote in his score 
about the scenes was bad but in his lifetime it never came to a 
new production the tradition carried almost 80 years 
wagner is like a recreated genius now said friedrich i 
think we are only on our way to discovering him i think its very 
good that we have as many different ring interpretations as 
possible 
friedrich sometimes thinks listeners shouldnt understand every 
word keeping their minds and fantasies open for the big picture 
the kennedy center production will use english surtitles 
friedrich went straight from college to his first opera post at 
east berlins komische opera and he proudly notes that hes one of 
the last opera directors who actually started with opera and didnt 
begin with theater 
he saw his first ring at the age of 13 in weimar i was 
terribly bored i hated this music i didnt want to meet wagners 
music until i was asked to make tannhauser in bayreuth in 1972 
after 1972 i did every year another wagner im happy that i came 
late to wagner so i knew better what is his great difference to 
other opera composers he said 
wagner started to make opera a new kind of scenic novel on 
stage with music he anticipated the movie this is absolutely 
new also absolutely new from him is every character is torn split 
in two parts they are brought together by music full of desire 
we go to washington not in arrogance to show america how the 
ring is to be interpreted no no no no he said we say only 
our ring is one from many others we hope its one of the best 
ones we are thankful and proud to be invited to kennedy center on 
the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the federal republic of 
germany

they are young and talented and plan to retire 
by age 25 
levert the rhythm and blues pop trio of marc gordon and 
brothers gerald and sean levert has just released its third album 
just coolin a balanced collection of funk and melodic ballads 
with snippets of dialogue interspersed throughout 
we recorded those dialogue pieces spur of the moment no 
script we were just acting silly and having fun said gerald 
levert a 22yearold keyboardist and vocalist 
but he takes a slightly different attitude towards most of the 
music he has created i get tired of hearing every album because 
i wish i could do it differently he said you keep seeing how 
you can do it better i still have a lot to prove to the 
industry 
his perfectionism coupled with 24yearold marcs technical 
expertise has led to the development of their writing and 
production team just coolin showcases leverts complete 
production responsibilities 
its not that i want to give up music by the time im 25 its 
just that id like complete control gerald levert said the 
hardest thing about the business is trusting people and thats why 
its good to establish yourself as more than just an entertainer 
gerald levert and gordon have many projects under way including 
collaborations with james ingram and stephanie mills and managing 
a new group the rude boys 
the two also contributed to miki howards duet with gerald 
levert thats what love is a top 5 rampb hit they also helped 
make troops mamacita a success the record was coproduced by 
gerald and seans father eddie levert lead singer of the ojays 
gerald levert and gordon recently produced the latest ojays 
record serious which they said was their biggest challenge to 
date 
ever since summers of being on the road with the ojays gerald 
levert has thrived on the energy generated between the band and the 
audience he started writing songs with gordon who also plays 
piano when they met as teenagers growing up in ohio 
my father would listen to the songs and would always say 
somethings missing gerald levert recalled then we finally 
started writing some good songs 
we put out an album i get hot on an independent label 
which sold 1000 copies if that much but we had a pretty big 
record off that called im still we did some shows and from 
there we got the record deal from atlantic 
in 1986 they released bloodline the first two singles from 
this collection rocketed to the top 10 with pop pop pop pop 
goes my mind making it to no 1 on the charts in 1987 levert 
came out with its second lp the big throwdown which yielded 
three top 10 singles including the no 1 casonova which 
played on the soundtrack to the movies fatal beauty and the 
pickup artist 
the group had its third no 1 hit last year with addicted to 
you which was featured in the movie coming to america 
i think our romantic music is very sensuous and our uptempo 
stuff is something everyone can relate to its funky gerald 
levert said 
i write songs thinking if we do this live will it make them 
groove or the girls scream but first i write for me im very 
critical i dont think id write terrible slop songs 
the title song on the new lp was originally written by gerald 
levert for the rapper heavy d to perform 
he took one look at what i wrote and did not like it he wrote 
another one in 10 minutes and thats the rap on the record 
gerald levert said 
if my father doesnt like a song ive written id think 
twice if i like it enough though its going to happen if i work 
with it its only one persons opinion 
leverts energetic performances display the groups enthusiasm 
for wanting to make the audience happy 
thats the whole key if you can laugh and have fun doing your 
work people see that and they feed off that gerald levert said 
i love people singing along live and with the record its a 
great high the lyrics harmonies and melodies are very important 
for me and its important for people to be able to hum and whistle 
your music 
usually i first come up with a concept title or groove i get 
my ideas from tv things i read when im on the airplane from 
anything then i give the idea to marc and he does the music 
gerald levert doesnt think levert will be changing its musical 
formula but hes toying with the idea of doing a solo album 
i would want to do some social commentary talk about 
different things like family the record industry deceitful 
women he said with a big laugh 
as far as the harmonious closeknit group is concerned gerald 
levert feels levert shows more signs of longevity than other groups 
in the business 
we have more finesse more polish he said were 
vocalists we dont need extra props if we got a mike and a lamp 
we are going to be able to do what we do

in the 1950s when bobbie ann mason was growing 
up in mayfield ky women had limited choices when they graduated 
from high school they were expected to marry raise children and 
remain in their hometown 
mason decided otherwise 
i wanted to go off to college and amount to something said 
the author of the bestselling novel in country and the 
recently released love life harper amp row 1795 a collection 
of short stories 
it was hard for me at the time to see the positive values of 
having a family in the traditional way if anybody stops to think 
about it its a burden that prevents you from doing anything else 
that kind of thing stuck in my mind 
instead of settling down mason attended journalism classes at 
the university of kentucky where she developed a lasting interest 
in literature the softspoken author realized that writing was a 
perfect way to express herself 
i always say im a writer because id rather write than 
talk she said its hard to think of things on the spot but in 
writing you can work it out a writer has the luxury of time when 
you write you take the time to observe she has focused her 
attention on the people from the western part of kentucky 
specifically the town of paducah her characters face the problems 
and opportunities of a changing world should they settle down or 
further their education should they have children should they 
move to another part of the country 
people didnt have that many choices but i think my 
characters are discovering a lot more choices she said times 
have changed joe can move to south carolina beverly and jolene 
can hop down to memphis for a fun weekend they can do these 
things and in a way its bewildering thinking about what it 
means 
masons characters are people who are ready to make decisions 
in one short story marita the title character is a college 
student who becomes pregnant by one of two interchangeable 
guys someone whose name she can not recall marita decides not 
to keep the baby and happily resumes her education 
i think my characters are very hopeful that theyre going to 
get somewhere and find true love mason said theyre going to 
find some kind of satisfaction in their home life 
its like the bruce springsteen song everybodys got a 
hungry heart everybody tries to fill that hunger in various ways 
the wife and kid in baltimore are not enough 
mason writes sparely some have called her style minimalist she 
weaves complex ideas around simple story lines she cited vladimir 
nabokov as one of her biggest influences expressing admiration for 
how he used surface images to show lifes infinite reflections and 
possibilities 
she concluded the short story coyotes with one of his 
favorite metaphors light shining through trees onto leaves 
he nabokov talks about dappled light mason explained 
you think inside this dappled light again and again and again 
and each time see things in a different way its an infinite 
complexity of the way light and dark play together and create 
shadows there are just infinite ways of seeing things 
superficially masons characters are similar they come from 
the same part of the country speak with the same accent and spend 
their time watching television and shopping at the local mall but 
mason is determined to give them dignity and individuality in 
piano fingers she writes of snowflakes falling no two alike 
theres individuality in the tiniest things nothing is really 
like anything else i want to communicate that everybody is a 
person with a valid life even if theyre not famous there are 
plenty of things people do that are absolutely heroic but theyre 
very quiet 
like the author masons characters are uncomfortable with 
expressing themselves in words in state champions she writes 
of a teenagers inability to describe how she feels about the 
death of a fellow students younger sister 
we werent raised to say things that were heartfelt and 
gracious country kids didnt learn manners manners were too 
embarrassing learning not to run in the house was about the extent 
of what we know about how to act 
at cuba school there was one teacher who for punishment 
made her students write i love you five hundred times on the 
blackboard love was a dirty word 
mason contrasted this with her characters dislike of pretense 
and artifice 
in most other things country speech which is really the 
source of my style of writing is very blunt and straightforward 
and matteroffact and practical the author said but when it 
comes to saying something direct about your inner feelings it 
seems embarrassing 
love life collects stories written from 1982 to 1988 the 
author does not see any single concept linking her work but wanted 
to give the sense that her characters have grown through the years 
i think that im trying to find out what happens next and get 
the characters a little further along i see that most of them are 
growing towards an enlarged sense of possibility i did think about 
arranging the order of the stories the stories towards the end are 
about going beyond

grand ole opry star jimmy c newman 
figures hell be part of the record books this summer when he and 
four other performers make the first cajun music tour 
newman eddy raven doug kershaw rockin sidney and queen ida 
will make a 20city concert tour that will last until early fall 
we will be making history said the 61yearold newman who 
has been playing cajun music on the opry since 1956 this is the 
first tour of its kind 
i think well be opening doors in different parts of the 
united states and probably in other countries before this is all 
over well be exciting people more and educating them more about 
what cajun music is 
authentic cajun food prepared by randols restaurant and cajun 
dance hall of lafayette la also will be available at each 
concert a live album may be done during the tour and a tv special 
about it is in the works 
this definitely will mean a lot for our cajun culture and 
there definitely will be a good positive effect for each and every 
act on the show newman said 
cajun music often features an accordian and fiddle and takes 
folk tunes from the bayou country and gives them a bouncy 
danceable beat many cajun songs are sung in french because cajuns 
are descended from acadian french immigrants 
probably the best known cajun song is jambalaya which 
starts out goodbye joe we gotta go it has been made famous 
by brenda lee hank williams and others 
its a fun song that makes a fantastic finale said newman 
a native of big mamou la everybody knows it and can sing along 
and clap their hands and have a good time its such an exciting 
song and very well written its a happy song 
the tour shapes up as one of the highlights of newmans career 
which already spans almost 40 years 
his 33 years on the opry rank him as one of the veterans on the 
live country music radiotv show thats never missed a broadcast 
since 1925 hes sung his cajun songs such as diggy diggy lo 
for millions becoming the first cajun performer to experience 
mainstream success in nashville 
the opry is home he said in an interview whenever any 
artist has been in the business for a long time hes liable to be 
lonely on the weekends without a home when personal appearances 
dont come in its nice to be on the opry have a home and get the 
exposure it offers and i have a lot of close friends there 
since 1980 he has toured europe every year with his fivepiece 
band cajun country he has written and arranged cajun music and 
has extensively studied cajun culture his wife of 41 years is 
writing a cajun cookbook 
we have cajun food nearly every day newman said 
he had his own successful recording career in the 1950s with hit 
records such as a fallen star 
during his years in nashville hes helped several aspiring 
performers including a young singer named dolly parton who has 
said newman helped her get a cherished spot on the grand ole opry 
some 25 years ago 
newmans recollection of the incident is foggy but he 
apparently gave up some of his time on the show in order to let her

let this relaxation sink inward let it 
sink inward let it flow into your brain intones the soothing 
mellifluous voice as a lowfrequency tone resonates in the 
background 
feel it sinking inward easily and calmly until your entire 
brain feels more and more relxed more and more relaxed 
robert a monroe founder and executive director of the monroe 
institute is guiding his listener on a 30minute journey to 
dreamland via an audiocassette tape called the catnapper 
the tape one of a series of monroes hemisync recordings 
recharges and aids recovery from lost sleep or jet lag relieves 
anxiety before exams meetings and speaking according to a 
brochure 
the institute tucked away in the ragged mountains between 
charlottesville and lynchburg also sells tapes it says can improve 
concentration and memory reduce stress help break the smoking 
habit improve ones tennis or golf game or aid in recovery from 
major illness or surgery 
there are a number of companies that market audioguidance 
systems said leslie j france director of the institutes 
professional division but those dont use the specific 
carefully modulated frequences that we do 
behind monroes voice each tape has a different audio tone the 
institute says manipulates brain waves to produce a desired 
behavior the tapes create an auditory environment in which 
people can relax very profoundly and have extremely focused 
attention said ms france 
professionals ranging from a bestselling mystery writer to an 
orthopedic surgeon swear by the tapes but a leading biofeedback 
and brainwave authority says a person can achieve the same results 
without using hemisync 
the danger is that it shortchanges people said dr elmer e 
green of the menninger foundation in topeka kan i have been 
telling everybody to burn the tapes and start depending on 
yourselves 
the menninger foundation a psychiatric center that studies 
human behavior trains people to help themselves instead of 
programming them green said we want people to know power is 
centered in themselves not in a procedure 
monroe 73 said his interest in using sound to influence 
behavior evolved from a long broadcasting career that included a 
top post at mutual broadcasting system and ownership of radio 
stations and a cable tv operation 
monroe found that certain audio patterns can lead the brain into 
various states he got a patent on the discovery in 1975 that 
finding led to a system of binaural beats in which separate 
signals are fed into each ear through stereo earphones to produce a 
synchronization of the left and right hemispheres of the brain a 
focused and coherent state that monroe called hemisync 
brain synchronization happens naturally but only for random 
brief periods monroe said 
rhythmic tones similar to what he has on the tapes have been 
shown to produce a synchronizing effect on brain waves said dr 
lester fehmi head of a behavioral clinic in princeton nj you 
can produce a specific effect 
still a hemisync user has to be receptive to get the maximum 
benefit said f holmes atwater director of the institutes 
brainmapping project a monroe tape will not work unless you 
want to cooperate with it theres a lot of psychology involved 
but also physiological changes 
bestselling mystery novelist phyllis a whitney uses the 
concentration tape to jumpstart her imagination when i have a 
question that stumps me i sit in a chair and turn on the tape in 
a startlingly few seconds the scene comes i use it again and 
again it works i get better ideas more quickly 
dr james m thomas jr a clinical psychologist in ponca city 
okla has used hemisync tapes for two years as part of his work 
with delinquent adolescents it has reduced violent behavior by 
onehalf 
i was very skeptical about this entire thing said thomas 
i have found it to be a very helpful clinical tool i am 
convinced there is really something to it and not just a placebo 
effect 
its real its not mystical but i sure dont know whats 
happening 
dr robert roalfe an anesthesiologist at merritt hospital in 
oakland calif has been using monroes emergency series tapes 
for three years to help reduce preoperative anxiety and 
postoperative pain 
i have seen a number of cases where patients are extremely 
anxious before surgery and within five minutes they are asleep or 
resting very comfortably it probably reduces the amount of 
anesthesia and definitely reduces the amount of postoperative 
medication required said roalfe who emphasized that he does not 
use the tapes in lieu of anesthesia 
i think were on the verge of seeing a tremendous number of 
cases in medicine where techniques that at the moment seem 
borderline in acceptability will become very acceptable he said 
dr peter w kozicky an orthopedic surgeon at st lukes 
hospital in bethlehem pa uses the emergency series tapes in the 
operating room during surgery and in the recovery room afterward 
the patients wear the earphones in surgery to permit positive 
suggestions throughout surgery because kozicky believes patients 
are aware of whats going on under anesthesia 
through electroencephalograms and brainmapping kozicky said he 
has drawn a clinical correlation to what hemisync claims are it 
relaxes people 
dr michael m dullnig a sacramento calif psychiatrist uses 
the tapes as part of a program of holistic therapy to fight 
depression among men infected with the aids virus and has found 
they felt better could sleep better 
the advantage of hemisync is there is no side effect to it 
medications very often have side effects that can be 
lifethreatening dullnig said 
green believes hemisync reflects a society in which 
selfreliance and selfdiscipline are obsolete the trouble is if 
people develop confidence in a procedure and not in themselves 
later on they will have to go to another procedure to correct 
another problem he said 
he also wants to know if the tapes effectiveness derives from 
the tones or from monroes suggestions im saying ok the tapes 
work but why

the proud parents admire their newborn 
child smiling a gentle breeze puffs the curtains and clowns smile 
from the walls it is a picture usually found in magazines and 
conjured up by expectant parents 
reality usually hits in the middle of the night 
parents pace the room to quiet a crying child the darkness 
reflects their mood and the clowns on the wall now smirk this is 
the time parents realize how little they know about taking care of 
their bundle of joy 
chances are the couple took classes on delivering the baby when 
those ended it was a case of learning by mistake 
parents whose first children are born at william beaumont 
hospital in this detroit suburb have an option beaumont helps 
firsttime parents adjust to the experience with a program 
involving mothers who volunteer as trainers 
weve had very positive feedback usually because of the 
family setup nowadays said beth frydlewicz one of two 
coordinators it used to be that the mother aunt or someone 
else from the family would come over and help out the new mom 
but that is rarer these days she said 
volunteers for the 9yearold parenting program that began as a 
michigan state university research project go through intensive 
training in eight threehour classes the volunteers learn about 
listening to the new parents feeding sleeping and crying habits 
of newborns and how to comfort them 
the program is available to firsttime parents only who either 
deliver at beaumont or whose pediatrician works out of the 
hospital neither the michigan nor american hospital associations 
were aware of a similar program elsewhere 
when a volunteer contacted nelle bird 26 of st clair shores 
my husband and i decided we could use all the help we could get 
for susan larinto 41 volunteer ann scheel was like my friend 
and mother it was like having june cleaver helping me through 
the baby was colicky so i called and asked to join the 
program ann came and looked at the baby and calmed me down they 
even sent a massage therapist to help the baby 
not all moms need the same help said scheel 57 some moms 
had very little skill and common sense others could have done 
without the program and some moms are relieved to find someone 
interested in them not just the baby 
volunteer carol eugenio 34 a mother of three knows how 
difficult it is the first second and third time she also knows 
the relationship is good for not only the new mother but the 
volunteer as well we let the moms know they are doing a good 
job we get thanks from the moms she said its an ego boost 
its nice to know youre helping someone else

takeover bid for the rival poultry processor holly farms spurned 
the offer and reached a merger agreement with conagra in november 
in an effort to keep tyson at bay 
the battle has since moved to the delaware courts where tyson 
is contesting an agreement between conagra and holly farms giving 
the omaha company the right to buy some of holly farms more 
valuable assets if the merger was not consummated all three 
poultry companies are incorporated in delaware

new york hotel owner leona helmsley failed 
today in a supreme court attempt to win a special pretrial hearing 
in her prosecution on charges of federal income tax evasion 
the justices without comment let stand a ruling that mrs 
helmsley cannot now appeal the trial judges denial of such a 
hearing 
mrs helmsley and her husband harry were indicted with two 
hotel executives a year ago on charges they evaded some 12 
million in federal taxes over a threeyear period 
the helmsleys on april 3 lost a supreme court appeal aimed at 
quashing the 47count indictment against them 
that appeal raised the same issue decided by the high court in 
another case march 28 
in that ruling the justices said federal criminal defendants 
who fail to persuade a judge to throw out their indictment because 
of alleged misconduct by prosecutors cannot appeal before they are 
tried and convicted 
the helmselys appeal rejected by the court in april raised the 
issue of preindictment publicity generated by federal prosecutors 
the appeal acted on today raised a separate issue mrs 
helmsleys asserted right to a pretrial hearing on her claim that 
the prosecution against her was based on immunized testimony 
justice department lawyers told the court that the march 28 
decision also makes mrs helmsleys appeal premature 
the case is helmsley vs us 881348

teachers in the nations secondlargest 
school district went on strike today for the first time in 19 
years threatening to create chaos for nearly 600000 students in 
the final weeks of school 
the education process will come to a complete halt warned 
don schrack spokesman for the teachers union united teacherslos 
angeles 
early indications were that schrack was right students drifted 
away from schools or prepared to sit out the day under the watch of 
hastily hired substitutes 
were going to be stuck in a gym all were gonna do is sit 
and vegetate complained 15yearold hamilton high school 
freshman maureen lim as teachers marched in front of the building 
in west los angeles 
united teacherslos angeles representing 22000 teachers is 
demanding a 21 percent pay hike over two years and more control 
over classrooms although district administrators said schools 
would remain open with substitute teachers union president wayne 
johnson called that a joke at best 
johnson who joined picketing teachers at hamilton high said 
informal talks would be held again today with the district but no 
formal negotiations had been set 
im hopeful that it wont go more than two or three days he 
said of the strike theres still a possibility that might 
happen but that depends on the board 
signs carried by picketing teachers read we deserve better 
and we need equal say and fair pay 
attendance figures for the districts more than 600 schools 
schools were still being taken early today so the effect on 
districtwide attendance could not immediately be determined 
the first picket lines formed at about 2 am when about 30 
teachers marched in front of district warehouses in an attempt to 
block teamsters union drivers from delivering food later this 
morning 
for too long teachers and students have been at the end of the 
pecking line instead of at the front where they should be said 
one of the pickets leo hildebrand a fifth grade teacher at 
garvanza elementary school 
by 6 am picket lines were forming in front of schools 
enough is enough said teacher carole rosenkaplan one of 
about 30 pickets at the birmingham high school in van nuys a 
section of the suburban san fernando valley weve taken all the 
insults were going to take 
board of education president roberta weintraub speaking for the 
majority on a deeply divided school board said the district would 
not budge from what she termed one of the best contract offers for 
teachers in the nation 
the lines on this issue have been clearly drawn and the ball 
is in the unions court she said 
the strike deadline was pushed up two weeks from may 30 to may 
15 when superintendent leonard britton refused to authorize pay 
for teachers who failed to turn in final grades 
about 500 hastily hired substitutes and another 500 credentialed 
administrators lined up to teach the districts 594000 students 
johnson ridiculed the plans saying the district cant 
provide enough substitutes on a normal day 
with five weeks remaining before summer vacation the strike 
threatened to create havoc at the schools with high absenteeism 
large and unruly classrooms and students final grades determined 
by substitutes 
the school year ends june 23 for students and june 26 for 
teachers 
we are really hoping we can keep our schools open as safely as 
possible and to that end of course the district will be working 
night and day weintraub said 
teachers stood by their demands for higher pay and more say in 
how schools are run 
united teacherslos angeles which represents 22000 of the 
32000 teachers nurses and counselors has been locked in a 
contract battle with the district for more than a year 
the union has been adamant in its demand for a 21 percent pay 
increase over two years and the elimination of unpaid nonteaching 
duties such as school yard supervision and afterschool meetings 
it also seeks to give teachers more influence in how their 
classrooms are run 
the district has offered teachers a 215 percent pay raise over 
three years with the possibility of more money if an anticipated 
increase in state revenue materializes 
the sprawling los angeles unified school district with a 
student body that speaks 85 languages is second in size to new 
york city and hasnt been struck by teachers since a 23day walkout 
in 1970 
los angeles teachers salaries start at 23440 and can go as 
high as 43319 administrators salaries range from 37000 to 
95600 
the average us teacher salary is 29567 according to the 
national education association average salaries range from 20480

a bankruptcy judge postponed a hearing today on 
the sale of eastern airlines prized northeast shuttle to property 
billionaire donald trump after the strikecrippled carrier 
requested a 24hour delay to consider a rival bid from america west 
airlines 
federal bankruptcy judge burton lifland set a new hearing date 
for 11 am edt tuesday after eastern attorney deryck palmer told 
him the airline needs more time to consider the america west offer 
trump an atlantic city casino developer and manhattan real 
estate mogul has agreed to pay 365 million for the washingtonnew 
yorkboston service one of the most heavily traveled air routes in 
the country 
trumps agreement with frank lorenzo the chairman of easterns 
parent texas air corp expires on may 27 under their contract 
the developer would receive 8 million from eastern if the deal 
collapses 
phoenixbased america west announced last wednesday it was 
offering to pay 415 million for the shuttle and 336 million for 
10 boeing 757s in a total package worth 751 million 
trump said afterward he found it hard to believe that any bank 
or responsible financial institution would loan america west the 
money to purchase the very troubled shuttle operation of eastern 
for such an inflated price 
easterns shuttle was its most profitable operation before the 
airline was struck on march 4 since then it has been running near 
full schedule but with sharply reduced loads as many passengers 
have defected to pan am corps rival service 
miamibased eastern has been under chapter 11 protection from 
creditors since march 9 five days after the start of a machinists 
union strike supported by pilots and flight attendants that 
virtually grounded the airline 
the bankruptcy court must approve any sale of eastern or any of 
its assets including the shuttle service 
on saturday a group headed by chicago commodities trader joseph 
ritchie formally submitted a proposal to buy the entire airline 
eastern spokesman robin matell said saturday 
lifland had given the ritchie group an extension to 11 am edt 
saturday of a wednesday bidding deadline to allow it time to study 
confidential financial data on eastern 
the ritchie groups offer was the second formal bid received by 
the bankruptcy court according to sources close to the situation 
on wednesday an investor group led by william howard the former 
chairman of piedmont airlines submitted its bid before the 5 pm 
deadline set by lifland the sources said 
the investment firm prudentialbache securities inc is a 
participant in the howard group 
billionaire hotelier jay pritzker already has proposed buying 
all of eastern for around 500 million although it is unclear 
whether he has submitted a formal offer 
the proposal made by the ritchie group would temporarily put 
former defense secretary frank carlucci in charge of eastern 
ritchie said in an interview with the new york times he did not 
disclose details of the bid 
carlucci had been tapped by the unions earlier in the eastern 
bankruptcy as a possible temporary trustee who would take over 
control of the airline from lorenzo 
the trustee issue was at the heart of the midapril collapse of 
former baseball commissioner peter v ueberroths 464 million deal 
to buy eastern the unions wanted an outsider to run the airline 
but lorenzo rejected that

the supreme court ruled today that disputes 
between investors who allege fraud and their brokers must be 
resolved by arbitration not in court suits 
by a 54 vote the justices overturned a 1953 high court 
decision that permitted lawsuits under an antifraud provision of 
the securities act of 1933 
in its history the high court has reversed itself fewer than 
200 times 
justice anthony m kennedy writing for the court said the 1953 
decision has fallen far out of step with our current strong 
endorsement of federal laws that favor arbitration 
our conclusion is reinforced by our assessment that resort to 
the arbitration process does not inherently undermine any of the 
substantive rights afforded investors under the securities act 
he said 
justice john paul stevens in a dissenting opinion accused the 
court of unwarranted judicial activism that ignores the will of 
congress 
judges who have confidence in their own ability to fashion 
public policy are less hesitant to change the law than those of use 
who are inclined to give wide latitutde to the views of the voters 
representatives on nonconstitutional matters he said 
joining kennedy were chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices byron r white sandra day oconnor and antonin scalia 
dissenting with stevens were justices william j brennan thurgood 
marshall and harry a blackmun 
the case stems from a challenge by 17 firsttime investors to 
standard brokerage contracts that order arbitration to settle all 
disputes 
todays ruling affirms a decision by the 5th us circuit court 
of appeals which reversed a ruling by a lower federal court in 
bronwsville texas 
the investors some of whom could not understand english 
included minors widows and people dying of cancer 
they opened securities accounts in 1982 and 1983 with the 
shearson lehman hutton office in brownsville doing business with 
account manager jon grady deaton 
the investors claimed deaton mismanaged separate accounts 
totaling some 190000 and conducted unauthorized transactions to 
generate commissions and profits 
shearson which is now shearsonamerican express went to 
federal court to enforce the arbitration agreements in the 
contracts but the lower court cited the supreme courts 1953 
decision against arbitration that permitted a court suit 
the company then appealed citing a 1987 high court ruling that 
said claims against brokers made under the federal securities 
exchange act of 1934 should be arbitrated 
kennedy said today the 1933 and 1934 laws should be in harmony 
to discourage investors from manipulating complaints allowing 
them to go to court if they invoked the earlier law 
the case is quijas vs shearsonamerican express 88385

a computer monitor that emits no radiation to 
the user was unveiled monday by a small massachusetts company that 
said it would be good for pregnant women and others possibly at 
risk from vdt emissions 
there are no surveys conclusively showing any danger from the 
radiation given off by video display terminals vdts emit electric 
radiation and magnetic radiation which are different from the 
ionizing radiation of xrays 
safe computing co of needham mass said its safe monitors 
sell for 995 three or four times as much as conventional 
onecolor computer monitors 
women who hear about this want it said george s lechter 
the companys president and owner 
he said the screens could be moved from one terminal to another 
instead of a televisionlike tube the monitor uses a 
lowradiation japanesemade liquid crystal display like the ones 
used in laptop computers radiation is further reduced with four 
shields two strong lights in back compensate for the dimming 
caused by the shields 
safe computing cited a study by kaiser permanente medical care 
group inc in oakland calif which said that certain women who 
used vdts more than 20 hours a week in their first three months of 
pregnancy were almost twice as likely to have a miscarriage as 
nonvdt users 
however that study team said the findings didnt necessarily 
mean vdts themselves were the sole cause of the reproductive 
problem since the study didnt measure other potentially relevant 
factors such as stress felt by heavy vdt users as well as eye 
strain uncomfortable seating and restricted movement 
also the higher miscarriage rate showed up in only one of the 
groups of women studied administrative and clerical workers

shareholders praised nwa inc for what 
they called its graceful handling of an unwelcome takeover battle 
that the parent of northwest airlines has been mired in for the 
past 45 days 
i would say theyve done a good job of keeping it orderly 
said paul carroll a shareholder from st paul 
shareholders at the meeting overwhelmingly elected the companys 
11 nominees for oneyear terms on the board of directors they also 
sided with management by rejecting a proposal that would have 
required the board of directors to give northwest employees an 
opportunity to match any offer from a third party to buy the 
company the proposal was drafted prior to the takeover activity 
even william mahlum the attorney who helped draft the failed 
proposal commended nwa management for its measured response to a 
takeover battle that erupted march 30 when oil billionaire marvin 
davis submitted an unsolicited bid of 27 billion or 90 a share 
to buy the nations fourthlargest airline 
to this point they have handled it responsibly mahlum said 
it will probably go to the highest bidder thats good for the 
shareholders but not necessarily good for employees theres no way 
to preserve the rights of the employees when the sharks swim in 
these rich waters 
the three unions representing northwests 35000 employees fear 
that a possible debtfinanced takeover of the airline would burden 
the carrier with excessive debt and result in wage concessions job 
reductions or the sale of strategic assets about a dozen of the 
companys 5000 pilots picketed the meeting to demonstrate their 
concerns 
airline for sale one of the picket signs said cash only 
no credit 
among the groups interested in buying northwest are davis pan 
am corp the takeover firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp co the 
airlines machinists union and a friendly partnership led by los 
angeles investor al checchi pan am on sunday said its financial 
backers would put up at least 400 million in equity if pan am 
makes an offer 
shareholders interviewed at the meeting were pleased that nwa 
rejected davis offer and announced that it would consider other 
proposals the stock has been trading for more than 100 a share in 
anticipation davis bid will be topped 
davis threatened a proxy fight to unseat nwas board of 
directors at the annual meeting but he chose to drop his plan to 
participate in the bidding process under ground rules set by 
northwest in a may 2 agreement 
i think the board is most interested in the process being 
properly handled said frank fox a shareholder from florida i 
cant fault them 
another shareholder asked during the meeting what shareholders 
could do to keep the company independent chairman steven rothmeier 
declined to comment joking that he could go to jail for spilling 
insider information 
i like pin stripes and not threeinch blackandwhite 
stripes rothmeier said in one of the few spontaneous moments at 
the meeting 
the chairman said nothing new about the takeover battle which 
heated up sunday with pan ams announcement davis is the only 
other suitor to dislose a financial details and his bid is said to 
include about 300 million in equity 
alan muncaster a northwest spokesman said the company would 
not comment on the announcement by pan am the nations 
eighthlargest airline 
pan am has nearly 1 billion in debts and is about half the size 
of northwest but has the financial backing of a group that includes 
sid and lee bass of texas billionaire bass family and the 
equitable life insurance co 
jim halvorson a spokesman for the air line pilots association 
at northwest said a 400 million equity stake would be 
insufficient for a new owner the pilots have been warning suitors 
that they are a force to be reckoned with because they have yet to 
agree on a new contract 
back pay alone could cost the airline 300 million and a strike 
could be even more costly halvorson said 
rothmeier in his prepared remarks at the meeting said an 
agreement with the pilots is one of three major goals for 1989 he 
also said northwest will unveil what he called a new corporate 
image may 23 muncaster said the revamped image will include a 
revised color scheme that will be evolutionary not 
revolutionary

consumers have nothing to fear from 
apples even those that have been treated with the chemical alar 
according to the president of the american farm bureau federation 
dean kleckner joined an apple grower and two scientists monday 
on a telephone news conference to complain that a televised report 
about alar on 60 minutes had caused unnecessary fear 
food quality in this country is the safest in the world 
said kleckner the facts remain the same the fda us food and 
drug administration and the surgeon general say consumers can eat 
apples without any qualms 
alar is a chemical used to regulate growth and extend the shelf 
life of apples among other purposes 
but it has been linked to cancer in laboratory animals 
that does not translate into an impending disease in 
individuals from whatever apples are left in the pipeline 
said dr sorell schwartz a professor of pharmacology at georgetown 
university 
the apple industry says sales have been reduced dramatically by 
consumer reaction to news reports focusing on assertions that alar 
poses a serious cancer risk especially to children 
kleckner said apple growers had lost 150 million before 
sundays 60 minutes report on alar 
burt chestnut a wenatchee wash apple grower participating in 
the conference call said he stopped using alar two years ago on 
his 50acre orchard 
we are good farmers and we can grow apples without alar 
said chestnut who explained that the chemical helped make the 
apples firmer and kept them on the trees longer well do without 
it 
but the alar scare has made it difficult to sell any apples 
said chestnut who estimated he has lost 30000 so far 
were working for nothing this year said chestnut 
meanwhile consumer advocate ralph nader told a us senate 
panel monday that alar should be banned immediately 
he told the subcommittee on toxic substances that there is now 
a convergence of interest between consumers who dont want alar 
on apples and growers who are hurt by the bad publicity and poor 
sales 
the us environmental protection agency announced over the 
weekend that it has started a procedure that could lead to an alar 
ban in about 18 months 
sen john warner rva whose state is a major producer of 
apples said congress could act much more quickly than the epa 
we could simply pass a law tomorrow unilaterally banning alar 
and put that behind us said warner i think we need some 
swift decisive action to restore confidence in the marketplace 
schwartz said during the telephone news conference that alar 
is doomed though he stressed there was no reason to fear any 
apples or apple products currently on the market 
kleckner said this may be the first shot in a new war on the 
chemicals farmers use to produce food efficiently he said 
consumers are confused by emotional attacks on chemicals that 
are not supported by the facts 
pulling apples off the shelf without any proof of danger is 
real he said its frightening that a whole industry can be 
brought to its knees overnight

k mart corp the nations secondlargest 
retailer monday reported a 22 percent decline in quarterly 
earnings caused mainly by lowerthananticipated sales increased 
costs and higher advertising expenses 
the sluggish sales at k mart stores partially reflected consumer 
interest in a heavily advertised new lowprice policy at rival 
retailer sears roebuck and co an analyst said 
k mart reported it earned 941 million or 47 cents a share 
for the quarter ended april 26 down from 1208 or 60 cents a 
share during the same period a year ago 
sales for the first quarter of its fiscal year were 607 
billion up 39 percent from 584 billion in sales during the same 
time last year 
the company said higherthananticipated costs including some 
advertising expenses affected the earnings 
retail analyst steve dimaggio of william c roney amp co in 
detroit said the introduction of an everyday low price strategy at 
sears in late february contributed to the drop in k marts 
earnings at that time sears the largest us retailer closed 
its doors to mark down the prices of nearly all of its merchandise 
sears hurt them a little bit he said i think we might 
see some of this loss come back there always is a onetime 
curiosity of where consumers will go when price reductions are 
announced 
the deterioration in k marts profit didnt come as a surprise 
the company previously said its sales had suffered for a variety of 
reasons particularly because of unusually cold weather in early 
spring 
a couple of weeks back they kind of warmed up the market that 
their first quarter was going to be below expectations dimaggio 
said so that helped them soften the blow 
the company said it paid more for advertising and to open new 
stores while also having higher outlays for employee pensions 
k mart chairman joseph antonini called the results 
disappointing he said coolerthannormal weather during march and 
the first two weeks of april adversely affected sales of outdoor 
patio goods and plants 
we are encouraged by the marked improvement in sales in the 
last two weeks of april and early may antonini said 
k mart reported 278 billion in sales last year the 
corporation operates 4106 stores nationwide including 2269 k 
mart discount stores 1230 waldenbooks 137 builders square and 
271 pay less drug stores

in an important victory for the securities 
industry the supreme court ruled monday that disputes between 
investors and brokers must be resolved by arbitration not in court 
suits 
by a 54 vote the justices overturned a 1953 high court 
decision that permitted lawsuits under an antifraud provision of 
the securities act of 1933 the reversal was one of under 200 in 
the courts history 
the case stemmed from a challenge by 17 firsttime investors to 
standard brokerage contracts that order arbitration to settle all 
disputes the ruling affirmed a decision by the 5th us circuit 
court of appeals which reversed a ruling by a lower federal court 
in bronwsville texas 
the investors some of whom could not understand english 
included minors widows and people dying of cancer 
the case was widely watched by the securities industry which 
historically has supported arbitration in clientbroker disputes 
arguing that this process saves brokerage firms enormous legal 
costs 
william fitzpatrick general counsel for the sia we are very 
pleased with the ruling said william fitzpatrick general counsel 
for the securities industry association an organization of 
brokerages this should go a long way toward avoiding confusion 
by making all arbitration contracts enforcable as written and it 
should reduce a tremendous amount of expensive unnecessary and 
timeconsuming litigation 
justice anthony m kennedy writing for the court said the 1953 
supreme court decision has fallen far out of step with our 
current strong endorsement of federal laws that favor arbitration 
our conclusion is reinforced by our assessment that resort to 
the arbitration process does not inherently undermine any of the 
substantive rights afforded investors under the securities act 
he said 
justice john paul stevens in a dissenting opinion accused the 
court of unwarranted judicial activism that ignores the will of 
congress 
judges who have confidence in their own ability to fashion 
public policy are less hesitant to change the law than those of use 
who are inclined to give wide latitutde to the views of the voters 
representatives on nonconstitutional matters he said 
joining kennedy were chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices byron r white sandra day oconnor and antonin scalia 
dissenting with stevens were justices william j brennan thurgood 
marshall and harry a blackmun 
the investors opened securities accounts in 1982 and 1983 with 
the predecessor of shearson lehman hutton inc in brownsville 
doing business with account manager jon grady deaton 
the investors claimed deaton mismanaged separate accounts 
totaling some 190000 and conducted unauthorized transactions to 
generate commissions and profits 
shearson now owned by american express went to federal court 
to enforce the arbitration agreements in the contracts but the 
lower court cited the supreme courts 1953 decision against 
arbitration that permitted a court suit 
the company then appealed citing a 1987 high court ruling that 
said claims against brokers made under the federal securities 
exchange act of 1934 should be arbitrated 
in other businessrelated action the court monday 
ruled that civil fines on top of criminal penalties may be a 
form of unconstitutional double jeopardy the ruling came in the 
case of a new york city medical laboratory manager hit with 
131170 in civil fines for defrauding the federal government of 
585 on medicare bills 
agreed to resolve a dispute stemming from the federal 
governments efforts to protect american workers from hazardous 
chemicals the court said it will hear the bush administrations 
argument that a federal appeals court wrongly required that 
additional information be supplied to employees 
rejected a bush administration appeal aimed at giving the 
government more power to control rents for federally subsidized 
housing without comment the court refused to review a decision 
favoring landlords in washington state 
let stand a ruling that new york hotel owner leona helmsley 
cannot appeal a trial judges denial of a special hearing in her 
prosecution on charges of federal income tax evasion

nbc sold all of the available advertising time 
in its madefortv movie about the case that legalized abortion but 
had to sell some of the time at a discount and will lose money on 
the show a network executive said monday 
the movie roe vs wade scheduled for broadcast monday 
night had drawn criticism from a righttolife group and a major 
religious organization that said the movie took a proabortion 
stance and urged advertisers to refuse to buy time on the program 
but nbc president robert wright told the 100 biggest national 
advertisers in a letter earlier this month that the movie presented 
a balanced view of the abortion issue and that he intended to air 
it even if there were no paying advertisers on the program the 
movie cost nbc about 4 million to produce 
nbc spokesman curt block said monday afternoon that all 14 
minutes of available commercial time on the twohour movie had been 
sold although he conceded that the network cut its normal rate in 
the past four or five days to find paid sponsors for some of the 
time 
he declined to say how much of the commercial time was sold at a 
discount nor would he say how deep the discounts were 
he said the movie will probably lose money but was unable to 
confirm a published report that placed the anticipated loss at 
about 1 million 
industry sources say that the going rate for a 30second 
commercial in that time period is about 180000 block declined 
comment on that figure 
networks rarely have to discount prices for commercials in prime 
time if a network fails to find paying sponsors it will often 
fill the time with public service announcements run for free 
in addition to the commercial sales block said that only one of 
nbcs 208 affiliate stations had notified the network that they 
intended to preempt the movie the lone exception was the 
affiliate in kansas city which was committed to running a baseball 
telecast nbc found another station in the market to run the movie 
he said 
the uproar over roe vs wade is the latest in a series of 
television programs triggering protests over the past several 
months from individuals or groups or individuals who have found the 
shows morally objectionable and have called on advertisers to 
refrain from buying time 
among them have been nbcs saturday night live comedy show 
and fox televisions situation comedy married with 
children 
abc recently pulled a show crimes of passion ii because it 
couldnt sell any of the shows advertising time the program 
recreated brutal crimes 
roe vs wade stars holly hunter as a character based on 
norma mccorvey the thenanonymous jane roe plaintiff who sued 
the dallas district attorney henry wade in an abortion case that 
went to the supreme court 
the movie is about the prochoice advocates who prevailed in the 
1973 supreme court decision but it also portrays sympathetically 
the prosecutors who argued the other side 
in its effort to gain advertising support for the movie nbc 
took the unusual step of allowing advertisers to screen the movie 
before deciding whether to sponsor it 
block said some advertisers who had made seasonlong commitments 
to sponsoring monday night movies withdrew but other advertisers 
emerged he declined to identify them 
it may be the advertising bargain of the year for some 
advertisers he said

the chairman of the securities and exchange 
commission on monday endorsed a privatesector plan to strengthen 
the critical backoffice operations of the worlds securities 
markets 
david s ruder said the international group of thirty an adhoc 
group of financialindustry leaders was on the right track in its 
plan to speed up and standardize the way markets arrange for trades 
to be settled and paid for 
the sec is entitled to impose its own rules to reform the 
backoffice operations but ruders speech showed he is willing to 
let banks and securities firms take the lead 
if it turns out the private companies cannot do the job on their 
own the sec federal reserve and treasury department could still 
step in said lewis w bernard a managing director at morgan 
stanley amp co 
i view it as a carrot and stick said bernard a member of 
the group of thirty steering committee they can lose patience 
with us and preempt the whole process 
although backoffice work is littleunderstood by most 
investors it is critical to the health of the financial markets 
an inefficient system raises the risk that a sharp decline in the 
market could cause a devastating ripple of defaults something 
experts say almost happened in the october 1987 crash 
we all know what the consequences are and theyre extremely 
unpleasant financial gridlock bernard said 
bernard spoke at a news conference following a closed session at 
which ruder and other officials spoke to roughly 50 top officials 
of the major exchanges and brokerage houses about the group of 
thirty report 
the text of ruders speech was released to reporters 
in march the privatesector group of thirty made nine major 
recommendations for changes that it said should be carried out 
around the world by 1992 
the most important proposal is to shorten the lag between the 
time a trade is made and the time the buyer receives the securities 
and the seller is paid long delays increase the vulnerability of 
the financial system 
us financial markets currently settle or complete trades 
five business days after they are executed the united states and 
other nations are supposed to reduce that lag to three business 
days by 1992 
that speedup will be the most difficult step for the united 
states to carry out according to david kelly a member of the us 
working committee of the group of thirty 
the proposed changes will require banks and securities firms to 
stay open longer hours eventually around the clock to form 
tighter communications links with each other and to install more 
computer equipment to automate their paperwork 
the three biggest securities markets the united states japan 
and the united kingdom are leading the efforts to improve the 
international system 
others participating in the reform efforts include canada 
switzerland west germany france italy spain and hong kong

eli lilly and co is seeking permission from 
the food and drug administration to market its drug prozac for the 
treatment of obesity and bulimia the company said monday 
lilly gain approval in 1987 to market the drug known 
generically as fluoxetine hydrochloride as a treatment for 
depression but investment analysts have long speculated prozacs 
largest profit potential lies in treating weight disorders 
mel perelman president of lilly research laboratories made the 
disclosure that the company would seek approval for the new 
applications during a presentation monday to the new york society 
of investment analysts 
weve conducted clinical studies evaluating the use of 
fluoxetine as a therapy for people who are obese or bulimic and we 
have submitted new drug application supplements fo the food and 
drug administration for both indications perelman said 
lilly also is studying fluoxetine as a possible treatment for 
patients suffering from obsessivecompulsive disorder or who want 
to stop smoking perelman said 
some analysts have suggested prozac could have worldwide sales 
of 1 billion if it is used to treat obesity as well as depression 
prozac works by preventing nerve endings from reabsorbing a 
chemical called serotonin which has been linked to depression 
after it has been initially secreted by nerve endings

the news that sent the stock price of dun amp 
bradstreet corp higher monday was that there was no news at all 
abcs 2020 news program broadcast a story friday detailing 
fraud allegations against the financial information services 
company but analysts said the show contained no new substantive 
information and they recommended buying the stock 
that sent dun amp bradstreet rising 237 to 5350 in active new 
york stock exchange trading volume was 845400 for a stock that 
normally trades about 383900 shares daily 
rumors spread on wall street last week that an unidentified 
network news show was preparing a story on 148yearold dun amp 
bradstreet which has been accused in a series of lawsuits of 
duping clients into buying more credit rating information than they 
needed 
by the weeks end analysts who follow the company confirmed 
that 2020 the primetime show hosted by hugh downs and 
barbara walters was running the piece the stock fell despite a 
fairly strong market rally 
then the show came it went and at least in wall streets eyes 
it flubbed 
to those who were watching closely there was nothing 
incremental in the story said eric philo a goldman sachs amp co 
analyst who reissued a buy recommendation monday it was 
basically a rehash of what was known 
asked if the 2020 program and rumors leading up to it moved 
the stock price last week and monday philo said absolutely 
zero question about it 
the 2020 episode included interviews with two former dun amp 
bradstreet salesmen who were fired from the company they said they 
had tried to expose improprieties at the stately and wellrespected 
corporation founded in 1841 
it was certainly negative but it was nothing new j 
kendrick noble who follows the company for painewebber inc said 
of the show 
former dun amp bradstreet employees accused the company of 
misleading clients about how much credit rating service they 
needed lying about how much of the service clients needed and 
used and billing clients for service that was never delivered 
the procedures are misrepresenting the facts to the customer 
regarding the level of service they buy versus the amount of 
service they use said gary mertz a national account 
representative still with the company 
many dun amp bradstreet customers and former employees have made 
accusations against the company clients and shareholders in at 
least five states have filed suits seeking class action status 
against the company in ohio the us postal inspection service is 
conducting a criminal fraud investigation 
last week five new jersey companies in separate suits accused 
dun amp bradstreet credit services of fraud in misleading them to buy 
more credit information than they needed 
the claims were first reported in march in the wall street 
journal analysts said the stock has been stable despite the 
allegations trading at between 47 and 57 a share in the last 
year 
dun amp bradstreet spokesman william f doescher declined to 
comment on either the 2020 show or earlier charges the firm 
has denied all charges 
dun amp bradstreets credit reports provide information on a 
companys credit history including details on how fast bills are 
paid the reports are widely used by clients to make a variety of 
business decisions 
despite the fraud charges analysts are bullish on dun amp 
bradstreet because of its overall performance the company reported 
firstquarter profits of 143 million or 77 cents a share on 
revenue of 106 billion both increases over the same 1988 period 
dun amp bradstreet also owns the donnelly yellow pages operations 
the nielsen television audience ratings and moodys investors 
service debt ratings its business services are marketed under the 
names mccormack amp dodge dataquest and petroleum information among 
others 
i think the company is a real growth machine and not because 
of anything fraudulent but because of its dominance in a variety of 
areas in sophisticated information noble said

takeover target holly farms corp on 
monday sought to bar rival chicken producer tyson foods inc from 
entering into an agreement with conagra inc that would restrain 
the bidding for holly 
holly farms which has agreed to merge with conagra sought a 
temporary restraining order against tyson in delaware chancery 
court 
also monday tyson extended its 6350ashare offer for holly 
farms until friday the move followed a failed weekend effort to 
settle the fight between tyson of springdale ark and conagra of 
omaha neb for holly farms 
tyson launched its bid for holly farms in october the memphis 
company rejected the offer and instead reached its merger agreement 
with conagra the following month 
all three poultry companies are incorporated in delaware and the 
battle has since moved to that states courts tyson is contesting 
an agreement that gives conagra the right to buy some of holly 
farms more valuable assets if their merger is not consummated 
holly farms said monday it was concerned that its shareholders 
would not be represented if tyson and conagra reach an agreement to 
settle the asset option issue 
rl taylor ii president and chief executive officer of holly 
farms asked the other two companies to not discuss the matter 
without the consent of holly farms board 
mr taylor said that neither tyson nor conagra had responded 
to the companys request in view of this and indications that 
such discussions might occur the company felt compelled to seek 
relief from the court a statement from holly farms said monday 
the concern is that if they get together and settle this 
between themselves without anybody representing the holly 
shareholders tyson might pay conagra something with the agreement 
they would no longer bid on the company said rob bowers a 
spokesman for holly farms 
tyson said that as of the close of business friday about 103 
million shares of holly farms outstanding 184 million common 
shares had been tendered

three years ago their states were economic powerhouses and 
govs michael dukakis mario cuomo thomas kean and william oneill 
seemed politically charmed 
now massachusetts new york new jersey and connecticut are 
among nine states struggling to cope with budget deficits totaling 
56 billion and their governors can be excused if they sometimes 
feel hexed 
while some fiscally conservative states in the rust and farm 
belts have piled up big surpluses these four prosperous 
northeastern states have emptied their pockets so have rhode 
island west virginia louisiana missouri and arizona 
the reasons vary but all boil down to the same thing the 
states counted on billions of dollars of income that wasnt there 
and in some cases they were victims of their own prosperity 
when you get in those flush times and the revenue is flowing 
in theres a tendency for governors and legislators and regular 
citizens to assume this will last forever said jim verdier who 
lectures on state budget policy at harvard universitys kennedy 
school of government 
it didnt last in louisiana where the oil boom went bust or in 
new york where the stock market crashed or in massachusetts 
where the massachusetts miracle turned into a mirage 
in west virginia bad times in the coalfields got worse and the 
state treasurer was impeached for losing 279 million in bad 
investments 
in the northeast especially the seeds of the fiscal crisis were 
planted in the federal tax reform act of 1986 
among many other things that act raised the tax on capital 
gains profits earned from stock real estate or other property 
in most states budget officials correctly assumed that many 
people would immediately sell off assets that were subject to the 
capital gains tax tax revenues would jump but they would drop the 
next year when fewer people declared capital gains 
other states guessed that there would be a much more gradual 
selloff when tax revenues suddenly climbed in 1987 those states 
didnt see the canyon that loomed ahead sure enough revenues 
plummeted the next year 
it was like getting an extra paycheck one week and then not 
getting one the next week said dall forsythe new york states 
budget director 
the tax change particularly hurt wealthy northeast states 
which with their many rich investors depend more heavily than 
other states on the capital gains tax 
new york new jersey and connecticut home to a lopsided share 
of fortune 500 companies and financial services workers also were 
especially hurt by the 1987 stock market crash 
when planning began for fiscal 198990 governors and 
legislators faced deficits of 26 billion in new york 700 
million in connecticut and 500 million in new jersey 
massachusetts was about 250 million short rhode island a modest 
5 million 
louisiana determined not to raise taxes faced a 700 
millionplus deficit west virginia one of the nations poorest 
states was looking at a shortfall of about 400 million 
a us supreme court ruling in march left missouri with a sudden 
192 million deficit the ruling said that states cannot tax 
federal retirees while exempting state pensioners 
arizona whose tax base leans heavily on sales taxes was hurt 
by a nationwide slump in sales tax revenues giving it a 250 
million shortfall some blame the slump on a fear of recession that 
prompted people to save more and spend less 
unlike the federal government state governments generally 
prohibit deficit spending so the shortfalls must be covered 
either with more taxes or service cuts 
new york adopted a program of cuts and increased taxes but 
cuomo still estimates that the budget will fall 500 million short 
by years end in new jersey kean ordered a hiring freeze and 
legislators are looking for programs to cut 
dukakis his popularity in a nosedive is still negotiating a 
program of cuts and fee hikes in massachusetts 
gov edward diprete bit into supposedly untouchable education 
funds to help seal rhode islands fiscal gap 
connecticut which has no personal income tax and the highest 
percapita income in the united states is struggling to find a way 
to close its gap oneill whose popularity also has sunk has 
proposed 737 million in new taxes but the legislature has been 
unable to decide which taxes to raise 
west virginia gov gaston caperton persuaded a special session 
of the legislature to raise taxes by 392 million but legislators 
decided they still need 15 million to 20 million 
arizona and missouri legislators are still wrestling with their 
budgets 
louisiana has perhaps the most intractable problems voters 
rejected a referendum last month that would have raised personal 
income taxes and the legislature is forbidden by law from raising 
taxes in any regular session in an oddnumbered year 
the people of louisiana seem completely unwilling to enact any 
kind of tax increase said marcia howard the denverbased 
research director for the national association of state budget 
officers its mindboggling in a sense the state is really in 
bad shape i dont know what theyre thinking 
on the other end of the spectrum are states such as michigan 
which pulled through bad times in the late 1970s and early 80s and 
now expects a 235 million budget surplus its simple presciption 
tax increases and budget cuts followed by conservative growth in 
spending 
weve learned that lesson for sure said budget director 
shelby solomon its very difficult to get the budget back into 
balance once you lose control 
the congress is a case in point 
everything they try to do is tainted or affected by that huge 
deficit solomon said until you really have your financial 
house in order its difficult to take a lot of positive action to 
improve things and have government play a helpful role

canada will inspect fuel imported by ships and 
trains as well as by tanker trucks in its effort to stop 
shipments of contaminated supplies environment minister lucien 
bouchard said monday 
last week he announced the program for the inspection of tanker 
trucks and limited the number of canadausborder crossings open 
to those trucks to 31 
the government acted following published reports that new york 
and canadian suppliers conspired to mix toxic wastes with fuel sold 
in ontario and quebec 
bouchard said he has received the results of 91 laboratory tests 
of fuel samples from tanker trucks and none showed evidence of 
contamination 
a senior environment department official said the tests 
conducted so far were directed at detecting pcbs and not other 
toxic chemicals such as solvents also mentioned in the allegations 
he said samples from all inspections are being stored and they 
will be further analysed as the inspection program is refined 
pcbs or polychlorinated biphenyls have been used in various 
industrial processes and discharged as waste they have been linked 
to cancer and skin rashes 
jim conrad executive vice president of the independent 
petroleum marketers association of canada has said the 
governments inspection program would be more fair if it were 
expanded to include tanker ships and trains 
bouchard said government employees have been told the cabinet 
must be kept better informed about allegations of potential 
environmental hazards 
we dont want to receive news like this from the deep bowels 
of a department he said we want the information on our desk 
now immediately 
bouchard and other cabinet ministers have said that newspaper 
reports last week provided the first word they received of the 
possibility that contaminated fuel was being sold in canada 
later there were allegations that government authorities were 
warned about the fuel scheme months and even years ago but failed 
to take action 
according to the allegations toxic chemicals were mixed with 
gasoline and diesel and heating fuel and sold to unsuspecting 
customers
