about 2000 people were urged to leave their 
homes monday after authorities found a liquid they thought was 
nitroglycerin in a house where officers earlier responded to a 
domestic dispute 
authorities also evacuated residents along a threemile route 
where a truck would carry the material out of this western ohio 
city of 20000 people 
michael hemm public information officer for the city said fbi 
tests indicated that the substance in the two 16ounce softdrink 
bottles could be nitroglycerin 
the slightest friction such as the removal of a cap can 
detonate it hemm said 
police arrested an occupant of the home dana taylor 25 and 
charged him with possession of a dangerous ordnance hemm said 
taylor whom police said had experimented with explosives before 
was held monday in the miami county jail 
about 2000 residents in 500 homes were urged to leave the area 
said police chief donald white officials werent able to say how 
many actually left but the evacuation area appeared empty 
about 100 people in this town 30 miles north of dayton ended up 
at an evacuation center at an elementary school said lucy fess 
executive director of the miami valley chapter of the american red 
cross 
hemm said fbi agents tested a syringe and shot glass containing 
sawdust in the basement both tested positive for nitroglycerin he 
said however the tests are not foolproof 
he said some flammable materials were removed from the house in 
the afternoon but the substance suspected of being nitroglycerin 
remained 
safety officials planned to use a dump truck filled with sand to 
take the chemical to a gravel pit outside of the city 
brad leffel 32 a neighbor said police arrived at taylors 
house shortly after midnight talked with him and entered the house 
after he left 
about seven hours later leffel said police came to his door and 
told him the neighborhood was being evacuated because of some 
explosive chemicals nearby 
i had no idea it was next door leffel said i took my 
time its got me thinking

the flap over an adamandevestyle motel 
mural has ended with the artist painting a branch over a pair of 
naked backsides that offended the citys mayor 
but artist steve kroeger had the last laugh sunday as he touched 
up the mural at the sunray lodge motel 
since city officials had also asked for children to be added in 
keeping with hollywoods family image kroeger obliged by painting 
one in the coppertone girl bare derriere and all 
the controversy began thursday when mayor sal oliveri asked that 
the bare bottoms of the adults be covered because it was offensive 
the 8foottall by 24footlong mural showed a rear view of a 
couple seated on a deserted beach and gazing into each others eyes 
oliveri said later he found nothing offensive about the bare 
bottom of the coppertone girl which is displayed on a billboard 
eight blocks away 
kroeger 34 originally refused to change the mural 
would they have put bathing suits on a rubens he asked last 
week 
but the artist said he added the branches and little girl to 
address the citys concerns and to avoid trouble for motel owner 
doris ouellet 
i am just complying with city officials he said they 
requested a child and a dog and thats what they got 
ms ouellet the owner of the motel laughed when she saw little 
miss coppertone 
i like it she said i didnt know he was going to put 
that in the picture i dont think its offensive 
ms ouellet said she had received about 50 calls in favor of the 
original mural with only two residents agreeing with the mayor 
that it should be toned down 
oliveri said sunday he was pleased that kroeger had cooperated 
this is very interesting he took a nude mural and put a 
child in it it changes the flavor in it a bit it seems he is 
cooperating what can i say

a woman was carried monday from the site 
of the motel where martin luther king jr was killed but she moved 
her twoyear protest against construction at the motel all of 50 
feet 
two femal sheriffs deputies enforcing a court order lifted 
jacqueline smith from a lawn chair and hauled her unresisting 
across the street 
she had refused to leave her makeshift camp in front a 
construction site at the lorraine motel which was shut down in 
january 1988 to make way for a museum called the national civil 
rights center she has camped in front of the lorraine since 
deputies evicted her from the motel itself on march 2 1988 
ms smith 39 contends the lorraine should be used as housing 
for the homeless as a medical clinic or for some other such 
purpose 
this protest must continue she said after pitching her tent 
anew on a sidewalk across the street from the construction site 
a halfdozen sheriffs deputies waded through about 50 gawkers 
news reporters and supporters of ms smith to pluck her from her 
camp she didnt resist 
tom marshall a deputy chief with the shelby county sheriffs 
department said the court order required only that she leave the 
construction site 
construction workers moved her tent and other belongings into 
the street and closed in a chainlink fence behind her 
shortly after the eviction ms smith restablished her camp but 
on the opposite side of the small side street 
theyve torn it up look at it she said of the motel it 
wont be the lorraine motel again 
museum developers say the wing of the motel where king was shot 
will be restored to the way it looked when he was assassinated 
april 4 1968 the museum will center on that wing much of the 
lorraine has been demolished 
the court order to move ms smith was issued friday after the 
construction manager for the museum said she was in the way 
until then museum developers had pretty much ignored her city 
police have made no attempt to move her 
police spokesman john bennett said that has been considered the 
states responsibility since the museum project is under state 
supervision 
state officials bumped the responsibility for moving ms smith 
to the construction company 
the lorraine was crumbling in disrepair in 1982 when a group of 
concerned citizens raised 140000 to buy it at a foreclosure 
auction 
the group called the lorraine civil rights museum foundation 
spent the next several years persuading the state county and city 
governments to build the museum

allaying polish concerns about german 
unification is the main goal of sevennation talks involving 
secretary of state james a baker iii in paris on tuesday 
the longscheduled event also gives baker a chance hear from 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze on the communist 
party shakeup in moscow 
baker flying to paris today will swap information with 
shevardnadze on the backtoback nato and economic summits held by 
western allies in london and houston 
the talks in paris were set up to give polish foreign minister 
krysztof skubiszeski a chance to pitch directly for territorial 
guarantees when the two germanies are unified 
he will take the seventh seat at the table with baker 
shevardnadze and the foreign ministers of britain france west 
germany and east germany 
bakers top aides do not expect any major breakthroughs during 
his 41hour stay in the french capital 
the soviet leadership is still settling down from a busy party 
congress that kept president mikhail s gorbachev from spending a 
lot of time reflecting on global issues 
i dont expect a large degree of movement in any area a 
senior us official said friday my sense is that the soviets 
will not be difficult on germany but that the talks will not reveal 
any major moves on their part 
the official who insisted on anonymity described the kremlin 
as totally preoccupied by the party congress 
at two earlier rounds on germany in bonn and berlin the soviets 
tried at first to slow down unification and then to put limits on 
the merged germanys military might 
the united states britain france and west germany resisted 
but the nato summit meeting two weeks ago in london gave moscow 
a partial victory eastwest talks on german forces are to begin 
immediately after nato and the warsaw pact complete a treaty to 
reduce us and soviet troops in europe 
invaded and nearly extinguished by germany in world war ii 
poland wound up after the allies victory with some german lands to 
compensate for territory seized by the soviet union their other 
historic adversary 
now poles wants to be sure the merger of east and west germany 
will not inspire the germans to try to spread into their country 
again 
leaders of the two germanys have promised poland a border treaty 
after unification but the poles are reluctant to see the four 
allies the united states britain france and the soviet union 
withdraw from control of berlin until the treaty is concluded 
markus meckel the east german foreign minister saw baker 
friday at the state department he told reporters afterward that 
the future germany will have good relations with countries in the 
east 
moreover meckel said german unification and a border treaty 
with poland should be finished at about the same time in january 
the nato summit did a lot more to ease eastwest tensions than 
just set up negotiations on german forces 
a quarter century of military doctrine was revised to make the 
use of nuclear weapons against the soviets a highly unlikely last 
resort 
and gorbachev was invited to attend the north atlantic council 
meeting in brussels in december 
my impression is that shevardnadze will be very pleased coming 
into this meeting with baker because of the nato summit the 
senior official told the associated press he will demonstrate 
good will and appreciation

a scientists prediction that a quake might strike missouri and 
neighboring states dec 2 appears to have shaken loose the seismic 
fears of people in the nations heartland 
the prediction by climatologist iben browning who claims to 
have forecast the oct 17 bay area quake but whose theories are 
disputed by most seismologists has not created a panic 
but along the new madrid fault the example of the northern 
california quake coupled with brownings forecast has raised 
awareness of earthquakes and earthquake safety 
insurance sales are up a school district has tentatively 
canceled classes and two states national guards have scheduled 
drills that week 
the fault which roughly follows the mississippi river from 
mississippi to illinois may not be as well known as the san 
andreas fault in california but it commands respect among 
earthquake experts 
the last sizable quake on the fault was in 1895 but thats not 
the one people talk about the big one actually the big three or 
four occurred in 1811 and 1812 when a series of quakes centered 
in new madrid mo rocked much of the eastern half of the nation 
the quakes rang church bells in washington dc and are said 
to have made the mississippi river run backard they have been 
estimated at around 8 on the richter scale 
the quakes have become part of the folklore of the region 
its our fault a tshirt proclaims but until recently that 
was about as far as it went 
we talked about it for years said sheriff jake rone of new 
madrid county but we never really got serious about it until 
this thing happened 
the thing that has people talking up and down the new madrid 
fault is a projection by browning a scientist from tijeras nm 
that there could be a major quake in the region dec 2 or 3 
browning 72 an inventor and climate consultant bases his 
projection on a convergence of tidal forces which he believes can 
put stress on earthquake faults but he stresses its a 
possibility not a certainty that such a quake will happen 
still he claims to have predicted last octobers california 
quake using the same method he says he warned a group of 
executives in san francisco seven days before the quake 
despite the disdain of seismologists a school district in 
mississippi county ark has tentatively canceled classes dec 34 
insurance agents in arkansas say their business in quake 
insurance policies picked up noticeably after the california 
temblor and dramatically after word of brownings projection became 
public in march 
the director of indianas emergency management agency doesnt 
necessarily believe the forecast but he doesnt disbelieve it 
either 
i basically have taken the position we are not going to ignore 
this prediction jerry hauer said 
hauer also is chairman of the central united states earthquake 
consortium which includes emergency management directors from the 
states that would be hardest hit by a new madrid quake arkansas 
illinois indiana kentucky mississippi missouri and tennessee 
the consortium has taken no action to prepare for a december 
quake and hauer said browning probably will be proved wrong 
but just in case he isnt hauer said if we have to schedule 
national guard drills during the month of december why not 
schedule them that week 
officials in missouri and arkansas have already done just that 
both planning earthquake drills for guardsmen in the first few days 
of december 
if something does happen well be there said arkansas 
guard spokeswoman maj cissy lashbrook if nothing happens 
people will see were prepared for this type of emergency 
seismologists have mixed feelings about brownings forecast 
its not that they dont believe there will be a quake they just 
dont believe it can be forecast as specifically as browning 
suggests 
as close as seismologists can pinpoint it theres a 40 percent 
to 63 percent chance of a severe quake one that is magnitude 6 on 
the richter scale on the new madrid fault in the next 15 years 
yes people ought to be prepared said klaus jacob a senior 
research scientist at columbia universitys lamontdoherty 
geological observatory in palisades ny they should be prepared 
on dec 3 and 4 but they should also be prepared today and 
tomorrow and dec 1 and next year 
earthquakes dont care about predictions he said and 
people shouldnt worry about predictions they should worry about 
earthquakes

a drive to change the way americans elect 
their presidents is being pushed by a group that acknowledges 
democrats stand to gain the most at least at first from 
tinkering with the electoral college 
the yearold electoral fairness project led by a democrat is 
trying to persuade states to abandon the winnertakeall method of 
doling out electoral college votes to presidential candidates 
the system has been nearly universal since 1836 but critics say 
it does not accurately reflect the popular vote and prompts 
candidates to avoid entire states they feel they cant win 
lately the system has favored republicans 
in state after state the voters are essentially written off 
by the numbers people dont see the candidates dont get a sense 
of whats going on said linda tarrwhelan a board member of the 
electoral fairness project 
she said the changes advocated by the group would get people 
much more involved and would require candidates to look at 
virtually all the states and congressional districts at one time or 
another as they plan out their strategy 
the constitution determines how many electoral votes each state 
gets one for each of its two senators and for each of its us 
house members how states divide up those votes is not dictated by 
the constitution but virtually all states award all their 
electoral votes to the candidate who wins the statewide popular 
vote 
the fairness project wants other states to do what maine did in 
1969 give presidential candidates one electoral vote for each 
house district in which they win the popular vote with the other 
two votes going to the winner of the statewide popular vote 
the fairness project run by democrat skip roberts admits its 
primary objective is to break the gop lock on electoral votes in 
the south and parts of the midwest 
some republicans proposed the same changes 30 years ago when the 
gop would have reaped the most benefit but this year state and 
national republican leaders are heaping scorn on the tactic 
the democrats are resorting to gimmicks because they cant win 
on the strength of their ideas said ben ginsberg chief counsel 
to the republican national committee 
roberts denies he is promoting a gimmick this is not a trick 
you still need a nominee and a coherent campaign he said 
the connecticut house adopted the fairness projects proposal 
this session but it died in the state senate in north carolina 
where the republican governor has no veto the house has passed the 
plan and the democraticcontrolled senate was scheduled to vote 
today 
roberts still hopes that legislatures in connecticut new 
jersey louisiana arkansas georgia and indiana will revise their 
electoral systems before 1992 when the impact of the changes can 
be tested 
curtis gans director of the nonpartisan committee for the 
study of the american electorate contends the changes would 
generate major improvements affecting both parties 
gans said the revised electoral system would stimulate more 
grassroots campaigning and less reliance on demagogic media 
appeals and unaccountable political consultants it also 
would produce an electoral college vote that more closely reflects 
the popular vote he said 
few political scientists are as enthusiastic nor do they see it 
being embraced in many states many say its virtues are subtle at 
best it is slightly more democratic and might put a few more 
states on the presidential campaign trail 
larry sabato an analyst at the university of virginia said the 
districtbydistrict allocation of electoral votes might even 
discourage candidates from visiting certain states 
contenders often write off states whose electoral vote total is 
insignificant sabato said parceling out those votes by 
congressional district would give even less of an incentive to 
come he said 
nevertheless sabato said he supports the change because it 
would lessen the likelihood of an electoral college victory by a 
candidate who had received a minority of the popular vote that 
almost happened in 1976 when jimmy carter defeated gerald ford 
and did happen three times between 1824 and 1888 he said 
it would be a disaster today i think people would take to the 
streets sabato said 
that kind of emotion does not characterize the current debate 
people just regard this as a woodwork issue said bruce 
buchanan a government professor at the university of texas its 
way off the center of the plate

the justice department has no information that 
neil bush broke any criminal law as a director of a failed savings 
and loan but it would pursue the case if such an allegation were 
made the attorney general says 
attorney general dick thornburgh spoke sunday as rep patricia 
schroeder dcolo vowed to continue seeking an independent 
counsel to investigate the denverbased silverado banking savings 
and loan association 
neil bush one of president bushs four sons was a director of 
the institution which failed at a loss of 1 billion 
thornburgh disagreed with mrs schroeder on the need for an 
independent counsel 
i dont think it would be fair to anyone any citizen of the 
united states to appoint an independent counsel or special 
prosecutor where there are no allegations of criminal misconduct 
he said on abcs this week with david brinkley 
meanwhile fdic chairman william seidman said the insurance fund 
for deposits in banks and savings and loans is under considerable 
stress but its unlikely it will collapse the way the savings 
and loan system did 
the banks will not be like the sampls seidman said on cbss 
face the nation but he said i think we have to be very 
careful the way we handle deposit insurance and we have to be very 
careful that we maintain the stability of the system 
also the office of thrift supervision is planning to change the 
way it releases financial data to the public and some analysts 
accuse the agency of using spin control to cut down on the bad 
news 
the agency plans to report only on solvent privately owned 
savings institutions information on failed but stilloperating 
thrifts controlled by the government will be reported later by a 
separate agency the resolution trust corp 
the sampl fiasco has spawned bitter partisan wrangling over who 
caused the crisis and how it is going to be fixed republicans 
charge democrats in congress led the legislative efforts that 
resulted in abuses democrats say the republican administrations 
failed to supervise the system 
neil bush has become a symbol in the burgeoning crisis expected 
to cost taxpayers 500 billion or 2500 per person 
thornburgh said information turned up in other investigations of 
neil bushs role as a director of silverado might be turned over to 
the justice department 
so far nothing has been brought to our attention that 
indicates criminal activity he said let me assure you 
however that in this case as in any other that if there are 
credible allegations of criminal wrongdoing we will pursue them 
to make a request for an independent counsel schroeder must 
obtain signatures from 12 democrats on the house judiciary 
committee she was one signature short on friday but she said on 
cbs she still believes an independent counsel is warranted 
neil bush has been charged by thrift regulators with violating 
conflictofinterest rules for in one case accepting a loan from 
a businessmen who later received a 900000 line of credit from 
silverado bush has denied doing anything wrong and will appear at 
an administrative hearing in september to defend himself 
the federal deposit insurance corp also is investigating the 
failure of silverado to determine whether neil bush and other 
directors acted properly charges could be filed against bush if 
the fdic determines there was negligence 
the ots plan to change the way it reports data on sampls is 
drawing criticism from some analysts 
by just reporting data on the healthy part of the industry 
regulators can report a number that says the thrift industry is 
earning money when it isnt its spin control said robert 
litan of the brookings institution a washingtonbased think tank 
also statistics on deposits and withdrawals at thrift 
institutions previously released monthly will be put out 
quarterly 
i think its terrible said bert ely a financial 
institutions analyst in alexandria va here we have an industry 
turning into one of the worst financial disasters ever and a 
key agency says its going to make it harder to figure out whats 
going on 
the thrift office will relay financial information on the failed 
thrifts to the rtc which manages those institutions until they can 
be sold or closed 
its more appropriate for the rtc to put out information on 
conservatorship institutions because they are the conservator 
said thrift office director timothy ryan

two of the nations largest farm lobbying 
groups are giving widely divergent pictures of american farming if 
president bush prevails in his quest to eliminate all 
tradedistorting crop subsidies 
for the national farmers union an end to subsidies would turn 
back the clock to the depression where farmers were whipsawed by 
boombust cycles of overproduction and shortages 
but the american farm bureau federation has a less apocalyptic 
view believing us farmers will be able to adapt to a 
subsidyfree global market 
last weeks economic summit in houston produced an agreement of 
sorts that white house officials hope will breathe new life into 
the ongoing uruguay round trade talks in geneva 
the united states wants the 97member general agreement on 
tariffs and trade to eliminate export subsidies on agricultural 
products and to start winding down internal farm subsidies on food 
production 
but us officials insist there will be no unilateral scuttling 
of farm programs and bush made it clear that he will not ask 
congress to dismantle us farm subsidies unless other countries do 
likewise 
spending for commodity programs under the 1985 farm law which 
expires this year is estimated at 794 billion over five years 
the cost of the 1990 farm bill is projected at about 55 billion 
the national farmers union supports the us proposal for 
eliminating export subsidies spokesman bob denman said export 
subsidies are paid so that one countrys commodities can have a 
price edge on those of another 
the 12nation european community is a major user of export 
subsidies for agricultural products and the united states in 
recent years has retaliated with subsidies of its own called the 
export enhancement program 
aside from that the nfu is wary about trading away the 
traditional us price supports for wheat corn cotton rice milk 
and other products 
without domestic farm programs the programs the president 
wants ended i predict a return to depressionera supply and price 
cycles massive overproduction and waste of foodstuffs says nfu 
president leland swenson 
don lipton a spokesman for the american farm bureau federation 
has a milder view 
we think we will continue to have a safety net of price 
supports lipton said but pressed to comment on the possibility of 
all being phased out he said american farmers are competitive 
enough to survive and do well 
they will flourish in competing for new markets lipton 
said in a few areas we might have some problems but therell 
be enough time to make adjustments to become competitive 
most american farmers he said realize that they should be 
assuming more of the risks of production and not rely so much on 
the government 
yet in the 1990 farm bill its clear that theres not going 
to be any great shift in that direction in the near term lipton 
said 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said the houston agreement 
reaffirmed a goal of longterm agricultural policy reform and 
emphasized the uruguay round as a step in that direction 
there was an intent expressed in houston to reduce each 
countrys farm supports which have a tendency to stimulate 
excess production he said 
yeutter said another objective is to have specific 
negotiations on reducing and hopefully phasing out export 
subsidies throughout the world 
a third objective is to open trade doors the houston agreement 
yeutter said contained considerable language that tells the 
world the uruguay round of trade talks is important and that time 
is running out 
but phasing out domestic price supports even if the other gatt 
countries agree to do the same 
rep dan glickman dkan chairman of the house agriculture 
subcommittee on wheat soybeans and feed grains thinks its a pipe 
dream 
we may be in an era of somewhat reduced international export 
subsidies glickman said but its pie in the sky to say were 
going to eliminate domestic subsidies i just dont think thats 
going to happen the cycle of history is kind of immutable 
rep dante fascell dfla chairman of the house foreign 
affairs committee said after listening to bush last week that it 
would be hard to sell the idea on capitol hill 
if you follow the history of farm price supports in this 
country its been very difficult to conclude anything except that 
farm subsidies will live forever fascell said 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash a former agriculture 
committee chairman said the europeans have great reluctance to 
dismantle farm subsidies and those he said go far beyond the 
us programs 
one of the us criticisms of the european agricultural 
structure is that there are far too many small mom and pop farms 
and subsidies have been designed to preserve them 
in the united states farm programs have been keyed to 
production since their roots were set in the early 1930s 
as a result the larger a farm is the more it produces the 
larger the subsidies in 1988 for example about 633000 farms 
received federal subsidy payments averaging 14257 each according 
to the general accounting office the investigative arm of congress 
more than 70 percent of the total payments in 1988 went to farms 
that grossed more than 100000 a year that included 136 percent 
of the total to 21701 farmers whose annual sales were 500000 or 
more an average of 56571 each 
by comparison 159691 farms averaged 10917 each making up 
less than 20 percent of the years subsidy payments 
advocates of targeting payments to smaller farmers are aiming at 
further action when 1990 farm legislation comes up for floor debate 
in the house the week of july 23 
the charge is led by reps richard armey rtexas and charles 
schumer dny who want to eliminate subsidies to any producer 
with income over 100000 a year or with gross sales of more than 
500000

bereft of its empire and wrestling with the 
prospect of a reunited germany dominating europe britain has once 
again become embroiled in a dispute over its commitment to european 
political and economic union 
its an issue that has caused four cabinet ministers to leave 
prime minister margaret thatchers government in four years and 
is expected to dominate british politics through the 1990s 
prime minister margaret thatchers opposition to european 
political and economic union is wellknown especially now that 
germany is uniting 
thus when nicholas ridley her ideological soulmate and closest 
cabinet colleague launched a diatribe against the germans and the 
european community bureaucracy it provoked new questions about 
mrs thatchers true feelings 
in an interview in last weeks spectator magazine ridley 
accused germany of seeking to dominate a federal europe called 
france a poodle of west germany and said that surrendering 
british sovereignty to unelected european community politicians was 
tantamount to giving it to hitler 
facing a chorus of disapproval from the opposition as well as 
his own conservative party ridley resigned as trade secretary on 
saturday 
on sunday it emerged that mrs thatcher called a meeting of 
leading academics in march to discuss germany the talk touched 
among other things on german stereotypes like bullying egotism 
and sentimentality 
it was a further embarrassment to a government already on the 
defensive over ridleys remarks 
polls in several sunday papers found about half of all britons 
disagreeing with ridley 53 percent in the sunday telegraph poll 
52 percent in the sunday correspondent and 48 percent in the sunday 
times 
the independent on sunday published the leaked text of a summary 
of the academics meeting written by charles powell mrs 
thatchers private secretary this guaranteed that the issue of 
europe would remain on top of the national agenda 
the summary of the march 24 meeting at mrs thatchers country 
home said even the optimists had some unease not for the present 
and the immediate future but for what might lie further down the 
road than we can yet see 
mrs thatchers think tank concluded that while the germans have 
changed the future was uncertain meanwhile they decided we 
should be nice to the germans 
but the summary said the way germans threw their weight about 
in the european community suggested that a lot had still not 
changed german behavior in the ec we pay so we must have our 
way was seen by some as a harbinger of germanys economic 
dominance over western europe 
the report of the brainstorming session drew swift criticism 
from opposition politicians 
gerald kaufman of the opposition labor party attacked the 
uncouthness and insensitivity of senior government members 
sitting around pulling the germans to pieces 
paddy ashdown leader of the centrist liberal democrats said 
mrs thatcher is now irreparably damaged in her ability to 
represent britain in europe and to play a full and constructive 
part in the creation of a new europe 
foreign secretary douglas hurd who confirmed the accuracy of 
the summary defended the meeting in a bbctv interview as a 
natural response to the questions posed by the upheaval in eastern 
europe 
arguments about britains commitment to the european community 
have bedeviled mrs thatchers cabinet in recent years 
michael heseltine quit as defense secretary in 1986 after losing 
a battle over the sale of an ailing british helicopter 
manufacturer heseltine favored selling it to a european 
consortium mrs thatcher preferred an american buyer 
heseltines resignation forced home secretary leon brittan to 
quit 
the longrunning argument about britains entry into the 
arrangement that acts to stabilize european community currencies 
the exchange rate mechanism was in the background of another 
upheaval last year 
geoffrey howe then foreign secretary and a supporter of the 
mechanism was demoted months later nigel lawson resigned as 
treasury chief in a dispute linked to it 
britains entry into the currency arrangement now looks 
inevitable but a whole new issue has loomed the uniting of the 
12 european community nations under a single currency and central 
bank 
economic union combined with a lifting of border controls and 
tariffs is planned for jan 1 1993 and mrs thatcher loathes the 
idea seeing it as the end of britains sovereignty over its 
economic affairs 
these are complex financial affairs above the heads of many 
britons but ridleys blunt remarks in the spectator interview 
about monetary union being all a german racket designed to take 
over the whole of europe were much more readily understandable 
they ensure that europe as a british political issue will run 
and run

didnt want him to speak at her high school graduation and neither 
did some of her classmates 
i wanted to keep him for myself as my grandfather not as 
the president she recalled saturday at a oneday conference 
bringing together some of the descendants of former presidents the 
event in the town where eisenhower grew up was part of a 
celebration of the centennial of his birthday 
ms eisenhower said some classmates were upset about the 
presidents visit because they thought the attention would go to 
him and not to them on their graduation 
but eisenhower was a hit with the crowd when he said ankles 
are neat but knees will always be knobby his granddaughter 
recalled 
that was in 1967 when the miniskirt was in style she said 
he received thunderous applause some of those clapping the 
hardest were girls who had earlier criticized him

the district of columbia spent almost four 
times the national average on criminal and civil justice in 1988 
the year it became the nations murder capital according to a 
justice department report 
the city spent about 859 per resident that year for justice 
systems including police protection the courts and correctional 
facilities the national average per capita spending on justice 
activities by state and local governments that year was 218 the 
state that spent the least per capita was west virginia which 
spent only about 90 per person 
sue lindgren the statistician who prepared the report released 
sunday by the bureau of justice statistics speculated that the 
nations capital topped the per capita spending on justice because 
the entire district is an urban center 
we know theres more crime in high population density areas 
than in rural areas she said 
washington dc became the nations murder capital in 1988 an 
unwanted unofficial title it maintained last year as well 
the second highest per capita spending by state and local 
governments on justice activities in 1988 was in alaska 541 
followed by new york 399 california 316 and nevada 315 
rounding out the top 10 were arizona 276 new jersey 274 
hawaii 249 massachusetts 246 and delaware 240 
those states spending the least after west virginia were 
arkansas 97 mississippi 100 north dakota 106 south dakota 
116 indiana 124 iowa 125 montana 130 idaho 132 and 
kentucky 133 
federal state and local governments spent a total of 61 
billion two years ago for civil and criminal justice 
of that total almost 46 percent or about 28 billion was 
spent on police protection another 31 percent was spent on 
corrections and about 22 percent was spent on courts prosecution 
and legal services and public defenders 
local governments contributed 335 billion or 55 percent of 
the money spent on justice systems state governments spent 221 
billion or 33 percent and the federal government spent 78 
billion or 12 percent 
in the decade from 1979 through 1988 total spending on justice 
systems increased by 1343 percent 
however the real increase for the decade was 214 percent when 
the dollars are adjusted for inflation the report said 
the constant dollar spending amounted to a 65 percent increase 
during the decade in corrections spending 34 percent increases in 
prosecution legal services and public defense a 17 percent hike 
in courts and a 3 percent increase in police protection 
justice systems received 32 percent of all government spending 
two years ago the federal government devoted the smallest portion 
of its expenditures for justice 07 percent states spent 61 
percent of their money for such activities and cities allocated 68 
percent of their funds for justice the report said

the savings and loan scandal is dominating 
congress agenda raising the question of whether the lawmakers 
top priority is fixing the mess or saving their own hides 
certainly the most spectacular work falls in the latter category 
the senate last week approved one of its biannual anticrime 
bills with a whole new category of crime sampl kingpin these 
conspiratorial characters would get a minimum of 10 years and up to 
life in prison if they derive more than 5 million over two years 
from their crimes 
the bill also would extend federal racketeering laws to bank 
fraud cases even though those cases may not involve organized 
crime as was the purpose of the racketeering statute private 
citizens could even earn bounties for becoming informants 
the house meantime voted as part of a spending bill to put the 
secret service on the sampl case 
the senate sampl provisions passed 991 with only sen bill 
armstrong rcolo voting against it they are reactionary akin 
to an impromptu public hanging he said 
armstrong who is retiring at years end contends the intent 
of the senate bill was to provide a smoke screen to shift the 
culpability for the sampl mess from the congress and onto a few 
unscrupulous businessmen 
sen don nickles rokla chairman of the senate republicans 
campaign committee told reporters he had doubts about the senate 
measure but voted for it anyway 
he said he cant prove it but he senses a throw the rascals 
out sentiment growing among the voters 
a public hanging is exactly where congress wants to get the 
voters looking elsewhere of course republicans and democrats 
differ on the victim 
democrats are salivating over the involvement of presidential 
son neil bush in the 1 billion failure of a denver thrift 
republicans are searching for an equally satisfying target and 
in the meantime are resurrecting the political corpses of democrats 
like former speaker jim wright who quit the house after charges of 
unethical financial dealings 
the ante could rise in terms of penalties for those convicted 
of samplrelated offenses if congress record on drug laws is any 
example sampl crooks would do well to turn themselves in now 
as the nations scourge of illegal drugs continued to worsen 
through the 1980s congress responded before each election with 
more laws and harsher penalties 
of course there are some important differences between the two 
cases 
few members of congress are ever accused of dealing drugs many 
however have received campaign contributions from the sampl industry 
and some have even served on the boards of thrifts 
and as the political barbs fly tempers are starting to flare 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash with his mr clean 
reputation angrily denounced house republican campaign chief ed 
rollins for complaining that foley accepted campaign money from 
thrifts over the years 
another difference between drugs and the sampl scandal is the fact 
that most of the disaster has already happened tens of billions of 
dollars are gone and congress and the white house seem to be 
closing the barn door a little late 
but that wont keep congress from slamming that door hard to 
make the maximum amount of noise 
asked about it last week senate majority leader george mitchell 
responded philosophically obviously it is a recurring fact of 
human life that we learn from our mistakes he said

from colorful charlatans proficient in 
the use of amputation saws to dentists with blunt instruments who 
took just one approach in or out medical practices of the late 
18th century were not for the timid 
that much quickly becomes clear when members of the dublin 
seminar for new england folklife get together to talk about the 
gory delights of pre1850s medicine 
its absolutely gruesome said peter benes spokesman for 
the folk history group 
we tend to think quite romantically about the 18th and early 
19th centuries until you run square across advertisements of new 
york dentists he said in a telephone interview from his home in 
concord 
their latest conference held over the weekend covered such 
topics as spruce beer and cod liver oil in popular and 
professional medicine and the democratic medicine of dr elias 
smith 
benes has researched a paper on itinerant physicians and 
surgeondentists from 1760 to 1830 including the history of one 
anthony yeldall who traveled through maryland new jersey 
connecticut and massachusetts and once set up shop on the westfield 
town common attracting business with a highwire act and jugglers 
the side shows were common among the traveling doctors benes 
said 
you hear a noise in the town common shouting screaming 
applause a drum beating you walk over there to find out whats 
going on youre part of a crowd with say 150 people watching two 
trapeze artists or a clown while hes still got those 150 
people around him yeldall gets up and starts haranguing the 
audience thats the whole mountebank concept he said 
in fact yeldall must have had some skills because he lectured 
knowledgeably on the eyes and was able to remove cataracts 
probably with a knife or razor benes said 
the swiftmoving healer was despised by mainstream physicians 
partly because of his success and partly because he would be a 
step ahead of his failures while the established physicians lived 
with theirs benes said 
the questionable element persisted until disciplined medical 
societies were founded in the second and third decades of the 
1800s he said 
the conference in deerfield was offered in conjunction with 
boston universitys program in american and new england studies 
dr j worth estes a bu professor of pharmacology showed off 
his special collection of lethallooking medical tools including 
amputation saws 
one of the things ill be talking about is the reliance on 
drugs that made people throw up that was standard procedure he 
said 
estes who is also a medical historian presented a paper titled 
samuel thomson rewrites hippocrates 
thomson was a new hampshire itinerant healer who developed a 
theory that all disease was caused by cold and therefore could be 
treated by application of heat 
for general good health thomson liberally prescribed a potent 
emetic he was tried for murder after a patient took a little too 
much of the drug but the jury acquitted him after only five 
minutes deliberation 
like thomsons jurors patients of the era were longsuffering 
when it came to medicine estes said 
they didnt go to the great lengths to prevent death they 
didnt bewail death as much as we do he said 
life expectancy was only about 35 years most people didnt live 
long enough to contract ailments such as cancer and heart disease 
and of those who did get sick most got better regardless of a 
doctors efforts estes said

heartattack patients who are advised to 
quit smoking on leaving the hospital appear to have better success 
when they get periodic telephone calls of encouragement from 
nurses researchers say 
of the 72 heartattack patients who completed a nursemanaged 
intervention program by stanford university 51 of them or 71 
percent successfully quit smoking for one year stanford 
researchers reported in sundays annals of internal medicine 
of the 58 patients who did not get calls only 26 of them or 45 
percent had cut out tobacco the study found 
many quitsmoking programs attack both the psychological and the 
biological addiction to nicotine but some smokers benefit from 
additional outside help the researchers said 
nurses represent the largest cadre of health care 
professionals available to assist physicians with interventions for 
smoking cessation wrote the researchers led by dr c barr 
taylor 
dr steven cummings of the university of california at san 
francisco who studies physicians attitudes and training on 
smoking cessation programs said the stanford study demonstrates 
that phone calls are an effective way of providing support to 
smokers trying to quit 
the nursemanaged program usually began one day after patients 
left the hospitals coronary care unit smokers were given manuals 
and audio tapes on cessation techniques and counseling while 
hospitalized nurses then followed up on the care by calling 
patients weekly for one month and then monthly for the next four 
months 
patients who found it more difficult to quit met with nurses in 
an outpatient clinic and some received prescriptions for nicotine 
gum the nurses intervention ended after six months 
the researchers verified the volunteers smoking status through 
biochemical tests or through family members and friends 
the researchers attributed the success of the intervention 
program to the early start while patients were hospitalized and the 
frequent and convenient contact between patients and nurses 
smoking is blamed for the deaths of 390000 americans each year 
according to federal statistics about 13 million smokers quit 
every year but about 1 million start smoking

mohawk indians locked in a land dispute with 
authorities have reversed themselves and kept up their blockade of 
a bridge into montreal 
the mohawks said they decided not to lift the blockade of 
vehicles as promised because authorities had reneged on a promise 
to reduce the number of provincial police in oka about 20 miles to 
the southwest 
the town was the scene of a shootout wednesday between 
authorities and mohawk warriors manning barricades to block the 
expansion of a golf course onto land they claim is theirs 
one police officer 31yearold marcel lemay was killed in the 
confrontation but it is not clear if he was shot by mohawks or 
fellow officers lemay was to be buried today 
talks aimed at ending the oka standoff between armed mohawks and 
police broke off sunday night quebec province was represented by 
native affairs minister john ciaccia who said the negotiations 
would resume today 
he said sunday that he believed that the two sides were close to 
patching up their agreement of the night before 
we have obtained the cooperation of quebec police said 
ciaccia 
they have reduced the number of personnel however not in 
such a way as to affect our own security he said he refused to 
say how many of the estimated 1000 police officers at oka had 
pulled out 
the mohawks of the kahnawake reserve blocked the mercier bridge 
on wednesday in sympathy with the oka indians the bridge blockade 
enraged some residents who faced massive traffic jams trying to 
get into montreal from the south shore of the st lawrence river by 
alternate routes 
on saturday evening a mob of about 2000 residents gathered at 
the boundary of the kahnawake reserve and shouted racist slurs at 
the natives who did not appear to be armed 
at one point they burned a dummy bearing the words non aux 
warriors or no to the warriors they also chanted war 
whoops danced and waved quebec flags 
the crowd dispersed only after ciaccia emerged from six hours of 
talks with indian negotiators in oka and promised the bridge 
blockage would be lifted in return for a significant reduction 
in the police presence in oka 
but in a statement released sunday the mohawk council of 
kahnawake said the deal was off because police forces had been 
boosted both at oka and near the mercier bridge 
on sunday a crowd of about 500 people gathered again at the 
bridge the afternoon started quietly as people carrying binoculars 
and potato chips installed their folding lawn chairs near police 
barricades to watch developments 
later the crowd became restive and cheered as an effigy of a 
mohawk carrying a bow and arrow was hung from a lamppost 
in oka a town of 3000 police and the indians from the 
reservation there stared at each other across their own sets of 
barricades on sunday 
about 1000 police officers blocked access to the town police 
also prevented anyone from taking food into the mohawkoccupied 
area

an american identified as the buyer 
in a drug deal in which a colonel and two other alleged dealers 
were slain was actually a us drug agent working with police a 
us official said today 
on tuesday police and national bureau of investigation agents 
shot and killed col rolando de guzman deputy chief of the 
militarys northern luzon command his intelligence chief maj 
franco calanog and a military informant 
the bureaus director alfredo lim said the three were trying 
to sell 10 million in heroin to an american phil needham who 
escaped after shooting broke out 
us embassy spokesman stanley schrager said today that needham 
was actually a drug enforcement administration agent on temporary 
assignment from his post in bangkok thailand 
schrager said said needham was working on a case with the 
national bureau of investigation but refused to elaborate the 
associated press telephoned the dea office in bangkok and asked to 
speak to needham but was told he had just stepped out 
the shooting has produced a major national scandal de guzmans 
colleagues in the military branded the killings coldblooded 
murder and said their investigation showed the three were shot at 
close range 
that raised doubts about the report of a shootout 
last week military chief of staff gen renato de villa ordered 
the arrest of all police and nbi agents involved in the operation 
pending completion of an investigation 
brig gen gumercindo yap chief of the northern luzon command 
said he was having trouble controlling his troops because of their 
anger over the colonels slaying 
also today the philippine daily inquirer quoted unnamed 
military sources as saying needham enticed de guzman into making 
the sale by telling him proceeds would finance a future coup 
attempt against president corazon aquino 
the nationally circulated newspaper quoted the source as saying 
de guzmans enemies wanted him eliminated because he had helped put 
down some of the six coup attempts against mrs aquino 
regardless of whether the allegation is true the fact that an 
american was involved is likely to increase speculation that the 
shooting was part of a conspiracy beyond simply arresting drug 
dealers 
de guzman and calanog were buried sunday with full military 
honors and speakers praised them as heroes in the 21year war 
against communist rebels 
pallbearers at de guzmans funeral included maj gen cesar 
nazareno the victims classmate at the philippine military academy 
and current chief of the national police 
last week mrs aquino appointed a commission to investigate the 
shooting in an apparent bid to prevent the incident from leading a 
virtual war between the military and the police 
on saturday justice secretary franklin drilon said lim and de 
villa had agreed to refrain from further public comment until the 
investigation was finished

a snag that kept a daredevil from 
plunging over niagra falls in a barrel probably saved his life 
said the man who promised to try again after he pays the fine for 
the failed illegal stunt 
dave munday who survived going over the falls in a barrel in 
1985 was trying to become the first person to live through a 
second descent sunday when his foampadded barrel got caught on a 
rocky shelf about a foot from the edge 
mundays 650pound barrel was left partially hanging over the 
brink of the 176foot horseshoe falls on the canadian side of the 
niagara river 
the area directly below the spot where the current took the 
barrel is very rocky the stuntman said 
ive never been a religious man but something stopped it 
he said a lot of the guys said it was fate that stopped it 
probably i would have been dead if it went over 
munday 53 of caistor center ontario was charged with 
violating laws that prohibit river stunts he faces a possible 
8500 fine police confiscated mundays 4footby7foot barrel 
after it was pulled out of the rapids with a crane 
munday said he will make another attempt to go over the falls as 
soon as he pays the fine he said he probably wont try the stunt 
again this year 
niagara parks police who patrol the canadian side of the twin 
waterfalls said mundays barrel was dropped into the river about 
660 feet above the brink of the horseshoe falls about shortly 
before 5 am sunday 
police spokesman george bailey said ontario hydro had been 
diverting half the rivers flow overnight to power its 
hydroelectric plant that kept the river level low helping snag 
mundays barrel on the rocky ledge he said 
munday said he wanted to be nearer the center of the river 
where the volume of water is greater and provides a better cushion 
against the rocks at the bottom 
on oct 5 1985 munday became the seventh daredevil to 
successfully go over the falls in a vessel three others who tried 
before him died 
last month a man who went over the falls in a kayak apparently 
died the battered kayak belonging to jessie sharp of ocoee 
tenn was found below the falls but his body has not been 
recovered 
after his 1985 plunge munday told reporters anyone who would 
go over the falls twice would have to be crazy

president mikhail s gorbachev has moved to end 
the communist partys longtime control of the airwaves decreeing 
that the state broadcasting monopoly must provide access to 
competing voices 
his decree on democratization of television and radio was 
read on the main evening news program vremya sunday just hours 
after tens of thousands of people braved a driving rain to gather 
at the kremlin gates in the capitals first mass demonstration 
against the communist party 
although the decree did not appear a direct response to the 
demonstration gorbachevs decision to open the airwaves to groups 
other than the communist party and government comes amid growing 
criticism of central authorities 
the communists fortunes are in decline as forces of democracy 
gain strength and demand that the party blamed for plunging the 
country into economic crisis be stripped of all its political 
monopolies 
the decree on broadcasting was issued a month after the supreme 
soviet legislature passed the nations first law guaranteeing 
freedom of the press and creating broad rights for journalists and 
publishers 
the press law gave nongovernment and nonparty groups the right 
to own and operate newspapers and magazines ending what 
effectively had been a decadesold monopoly held by communist 
authorities 
rather than appeasing popular opinion however greater media 
openness has helped fuel public anger toward central authorities 
as demonstrated in the march on the kremlin 
communist worms this corpse wont feed you anymore read a 
poster carried by a demonstrator on sunday one woman hoisted a 
pair of shoes worn into tatters and labeled slave of the party 
police used trucks and barricades to block the entrance to red 
square and the marchers instead gathered around a sound truck in 
the adjacent manezh square just under the red brick walls and 
towers of the kremlin 
the demonstrators cheered when a speaker called out the names of 
three leading reformers who last week announced they were quitting 
the communist party russian republic president boris n yelstin 
moscow mayor gavriil popov and leningrad mayor anatoly sobchak 
the protesters estimated by a police officer and local 
television to number 50000 shouted down with the criminal 
communist party as they huddled under a sea of umbrellas 
every communist to his own mausoleum read another poster 
alluding to the mausoleum of soviet founder vladimir lenin a few 
hundred yards away many soviets regard lenin as a deity and 
thousands file through his crypt daily to see his mummified body 
soviet reforms have been transferring power from the party that 
lenin founded to elected legislatures throughout the country and 
to the newly strengthened presidency held by gorbachev 
last week the 28th congress of the soviet communist party 
reelected gorbachev as general secretary and adopted his proposal 
to restructure and expand the partys leading body the politburo 
henceforth the politburo which once ran the nation will concern 
itself largely to party affairs 
the decree on broadcasting which was also carried by the 
official tass news agency states that growing democracy in the 
country requires a cardinal change in the nature of the countrys 
television and radio broadcasting 
the guidelines for radio and television are currently set by a 
state committee 
the decree recognizes the need to determine a legal basis for 
the activities of television and radio broadcasting under new 
conditions and recommendsd that parliament adopt appropriate 
laws those laws apparently would correspond to the press law 
passed june 12 
until now only groups approved by the state committee had 
access to soviet television and as a result the communist party 
received large segments of time on the airwaves 
the decree emphasized the inadmissibility of monopolizing air 
time by this or that party political current or group tass 
reported 
hundreds of new groups have sprung up throughout the country in 
the last several years 
in the baltic states and other republics at odds with moscow 
over their status within the soviet union elected governments have 
declared that local radio and television stations belong to them 
however the decree stresses control by the soviet government 
over the legal status of radio and television stations in the 
republics 
any acts taken by republican territorial and regional bodies 
without coordination with the ussr council of ministers and 
aimed at changing legal or property status will be considered 
invalid tass reported 
the decree came during a time of change within the television 
industry the government newspaper izvestia reported friday that 67 
new television studios were to be built in the next 10 years 
mostly in the nonrussian fringes of the soviet union 
izvestia quoted henrykas juskiavicius deputy director of the 
state television and radio committee as saying that his 
organization broadcasts tv programs in 48 languages and radio 
programs in 72 languages spoken by different ethnic groups in the 
soviet union

the price was right so thousands took a free 
weekend ride on the new southern california lightrail trolley line 
that transportation officials hope will make commuters forsake 
their smogspewing cars 
riders of the blue line which links downtown with long beach 
can ride free until the end of july when a 110 oneway fare 
takes effect 
the 877 million rail lines inaugural weekend featured live 
bands along the 22mile route that drew combined crowds nearing 
100000 authorities said sheriffs deputies counted more than 
43000 blue line riders sunday 
everything has gone off really smoothly so far said deputy 
rafael estrada 
no violence was reported and deputies made just one arrest of a 
man who allegedly cut a hole through a 6foot fence along the rail 
line because he wanted to pass through 
area residents have complained the blue line fences have divided 
neighborhoods and separated merchants from their customers other 
critics say commuters will shun the blue line because it passes 
through some of the most gangplagued communities in the county 
the overheadpowered rail is the first part of a 10 billion 
150mile rail grid planned into the next century for los angeles 
where freeways get so jammed that relatively short commutes can 
take an hour or more 
a projected 5000 to 7000 riders a day are expected to board 
the coaches that travel at speeds reaching 55 mph 
included in that system is the 13 billion metro rail subway 
which suffered a setback friday when fire ravaged a maintenance 
tunnel under construction the first 4mile segment was scheduled 
to open in 1993

former philippines first lady imelda marcos 
acquitted of fraud two weeks ago by a federal jury here faces new 
questioning by a grand jury in pittsburgh 
mrs marcos said two federal agents on friday served her with a 
subpoena to appear in pittsburgh on sept 25 the case involves a 
neverused nuclear power plant westinghouse electric corp built in 
the philippines in the early 1980s when her late husband ferdinand 
marcos was president 
they said they want me to come and bring all my documents i 
dont really know what this is all about mrs marcos said 
saturday during a party thrown to thank jurors from her new york 
trial 
a source close to mrs marcos who asked not to be identified 
said she will appear as ordered unless the government advises her 
that she is a target of the inquiry in which case she would refuse 
the subpoena was issued on behalf of the justice departments 
fraud section in washington it does not indicate whether mrs 
marcos is a target of the investigation 
us attorney thomas w corbett jr of pittsburgh declined to 
comment citing the secrecy of grand jury proceedings 
the subpoena dated july 11 instructed mrs marcos to bring all 
documents in your possession or under your control relating 
directly or indirectly to the payment of commissions or anything of 
value by westinghouse or burns amp roe inc to the marcoses or 
their agents since jan 1 1973 
burns amp roe an engineering firm was a subcontractor on the 
philippines project 
mrs marcos 61 and saudi arabian financier adnan khashoggi 
55 were acquitted july 2 after a 10week federal trial 
prosecutors alleged that she helped her husband loot the 
philippines treasury of more than 220 million using the money to 
buy four new york buildings artworks and jewelry 
khashoggi was accused of falsifying documents to show that he 
not the marcoses owned the new york properties and some paintings 
prosecutors said that was done to circumvent a march 1986 court 
order that froze the marcoses assets following their ouster from 
power 
marcos illegally skimmed millions from the philippine treasury 
by demanding kickbacks from companies and banks doing business with 
his government prosecutors said westinghouse was not mentioned in 
the case 
in pittsburgh westinghouse spokesman paul b jones said the 
subpoena may stem from a lawsuit filed against the company by the 
government of philippines president corazon aquino which is still 
seeking to recover the money allegedly stolen by the marcoses 
jones said safety concerns delayed the nuclear plants opening 
and after marcos was deposed and aquino took office the plant 
became a political issue 
the philippine government sued westinghouse because the plant 
was sitting there they chose not to operate it jones said 
he said the suit alleges westinghouse built a plant that could 
not be operated but declined to comment further 
despite the subpoena mrs marcos was jovial at the party 
saturday in the penthouse of her posh manhattan apartment complex 
among 100 guests were 10 of the 12 jurors who acquitted mrs marcos 
and khashoggi 
its just a gathering of friends said exjuror luellen 
white a subway worker who left carrying a decorated cake 
others departed with bouquets of flowers 
i invited the jurors to thank them and because i thought they 
should see some of the good things about the philippines said 
mrs marcos who entertained her guests by singing god bless 
america and philippine songs

gorbachevs communist party deputy and he was elected easily

britains largest jewelry retailer today said it 
would stop selling jewelry made with south african gold the 
decision followed pickets of its stores by antiapartheid groups 
a spokesman for the company ratners plc said the move was part 
of a continuing switch to north american gold supplies 
one antiapartheid group end loans to south africa said it has 
suspended its action against ratners and is asking other groups to 
do the same pending a meeting with ratners officials 
ratners said south african gold is found in 2 percent to 3 
percent of its gold jewelry it had total sales of 16 billion in 
its fiscal year ended feb 3 
its a fairly simple process for us to remove the final few 
percentage points said a ratners spokesman who spoke on 
condition of anonymity the process should be completed in the next 
year or two he said 
the spokesman denied the move was in reponse to antiapartheid 
pressure he said he believed only three of its more than 1000 
british stores were picketed 
were a commercial organization not a political 
organization he said 
end loans to south africa said it and other groups had applied 
pressure on ratners in response to african national congress leader 
nelson mandelas call to intensify sanctions and boycott south 
african goods to end apartheid 
the anc is south africas leading black opposition movement it 
is seeking to end white minority rule of south africas black 
majority 
ratners has purchased much of its gold jewelry supplies from 
italy which according to a us general accounting office report 
gets 91 percent of its gold from south africa the group said 
south africa produces onethird of the worlds gold the group 
said south african supplies dominate the european gold market and 
almost all gold jewelry sold in britain is made with south african 
gold the group said 
nonsouth african supplies of gold are plentiful it said 
this historic victory will send clear signals to south africa 
and will hasten an early end to apartheid said cosmas desmond 
head of end loans to south africa it shows that british business 
can no longer avoid the moral implications of collaborating with 
apartheid

from albania to the southern italian port of brindisi 
italian and egyptian officials reported today that no new 
albanians had sought asylum in their embassies in tirana the 
albanian capital the czechoslovak embassy and the hungarian 
mission were reported empty of refugees 
the red cross conducted preliminary health checks on the latest 
arrivals on the train and at reims the refugees were then broken 
up into three groups and bused to creil emance and mourmelon in 
the paris region 
the health of most of the refugees is good said a red cross 
spokesmen in reims but they all need rest 
carrying little luggage and dressed for the most part in 
tshirts simple trousers sandals or clothing donated by the crew 
of the ferry orient star the tired refugees settled into their 
temporary quarters in reims for a long sleep soldiers had 
stockpiled 160 gallons of beverages and 660 pounds of fruit for 
their arrival

perigueux southwestern france extremely tired they turned down a 
prepared meal and simply asked for drinks and cigarettes 
several wept as they got off the bus most said all they wanted 
was sleep they were later driven to two separate camps 
they were jubilant on their arrival in marseille crying long 
live france in albanian and long live the albanian people as

my country the 25yearold said i know it wont be easy for 
me in france but i hope to succeed i wont go back to albania 
until the communists are gone

hezbollah fighters attacked a major 
stronghold of the rival shiite moslem amal militia in south lebanon 
today touching off a fierce battle police said at least 12 people 
were killed and 50 wounded 
the flareup coincided with a new effort by an arab league envoy 
to persuade christian and moslem leaders to agree to a settlement 
of the 15yearold civil war 
a police spokesman said militiamen of the proiranian hezbollah 
or party of god mounted a threepronged attack at 6 am behind a 
massive artillery barrage the target was jarjou village 
the syrianbacked amal and hezbollah or party of god have been 
fighting each other intermittently for three years seeking control 
of lebanons 12 million shiites the countrys largest sect 
todays casualties raised the overall toll to 1061 people 
killed and 3201 wounded 
the police spokesman who could not be identified said the 
identity of those killed was not known but he said the wounded 
included 22 combatants and six civilians 
amals leadership confirmed the attack in a statement but said 
only 20 amal militiamen were wounded 
hezbollah accused amal earlier of shelling its positions in 
jabal safi mlita and luweizeh with artillery and rockets 
ambulances raced in and out of the combat zone ferrying victims 
to hospitals in sidon the mountainous region overlooks sidon 
provincial capital of south lebanon from the southeast sidon is 
25 miles south of beirut 
also in south lebanon militiamen of sunni moslem nasserite 
organization clashed with the israelibacked south lebanon army in 
kfar falous to the east of sidon 
there were no immediate casualty reports but the thud of 
exploding rockets and artillery shells shook the region 
the arab league envoy lakhdar ibrahimi met for 90 minutes late 
sunday with rebel gen michel aoun over a peace plan endorsed last 
october by lebanese legislators in a special meeting in the saudi 
arabian town of taif 
the conservative newspaper alanwar which is close to aoun 
said the discussion was rough ibrahimi refused to disclose 
details of the talks at the shellwrecked presidential palace in 
baabda east of beirut 
aoun the alanwar said stressed the need for a 
reconsideration of the peace plan 
the independent newspapr annahar said the mere fact that 
ibrahimi met aoun was a positive development ibrahimi has made 
several trips to lebanon since october but met only once with 
aoun when he officially conveyed to him the agreement immediately 
after the taif meeting 
aoun has rejected the accord ostensibly because it did not 
include a fixed timetable for the withdrawal of syrias 40000 
troops from lebanon the syrian forces control 70 percent of 
lebanese territory under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the 
22nation arab league 
the taif plan would redistribute power equally between moslems 
and christians who have dominated the government parliament 
judiciary and army since independence from france in 1943 
it was welcomed by moslems and most christian leaders including 
warlord samir geagea geagea is aouns main rival in the christian 
camp 
differences among christians over the taif peace accord have 
sparked a bloody conflict between aouns troops and geageas 
lebanese forces militia 
the inconclusive power struggle that erupted jan 30 so far has 
killed 1044 people and wounded 2793 by police count

onto a more even keel foreign office minister william waldegrave 
said in an interview on bbc television 
mrs parish 53 was sentenced to 15 years in prison for 
allegedly assisting farhad bazoft who was hanged march 15 in 
baghdad 
bazoft had been in iraq working for the observer a sunday 
newspaper published in london 
bazoft an iranian native who traveled on british documents was 
arrested in september trying to check out reports of an explosion 
at a military installation colleagues insisted he was not a spy 
just an enthusiastic reporter going after a scoop 
mrs parish was accused of driving bazoft to the aliskandaria 
military complex 
following bazofts execution britain recalled its ambassador 
from iraq and expelled six iraqi military trainees in protest 
foreign secretary douglas hurd also announced a freeze on visits 
by government ministers to iraq and canceled a trade mission 
however hurd rejected trade sanctions against iraq 
relations between the two countries were further strained in 
late march when british customs officers seized 40 components for 
nuclear bomb triggers at heathrow airport before they could be put 
aboard an iraqi airways flight to baghdad 
in april customs officers seized massive steel tubing that had 
been ordered by iraq british authorities said the tubing appeared 
to be designed for a massive artillery gun 
through the the recent difficulties with iraq our desire has 
been open and honest dialogue the foreign office said 
the release is a constructive signal that they share our 
desire we hope that mrs parishs freedom is the latest step 
toward a new and more fruitful relationship with iraq 
waldegrave said mrs parish appeared to be in good health the 
foreign office said it was up to her how long she would remain in 
lusaka 
the foreign office said it had approached a number of states to 
seek mrs parishs release and had not worked solely through 
kaunda 
bazoft was one of several journalists who had accepted 
invitations to cover elections in kurdistan in september 
just before he was hanged bazoft gave british consulgeneral 
robin kealy a note of apology to mrs parish whom he had 
befriended on an earlier visit 
mrs parish was held at abu ghraid prison the foreign office 
said 
adrian hamilton deputy editor of the observer said the release 
came as a surprise 
of course they can never clear the decks when an innocent man 
has been hanged but we are still delighted by mrs parishs 
release hamilton said 
she has been the most stalwart and formidable of women and has 
refused to give in to any kind of pressure to make a false 
statement

sheriffs deputies picked up a protester 
and carried her away today from the construction site of a museum 
at the small motel where martin luther king jr was murdered 
jacqueline smith has camped in front of the lorraine motel for 
two years to protest the construction project and had defied a 
judges order to move 
two deputies picked her up from a lawn chair this morning and 
moved her bodily from her campsite to a sidewalk across the street 
she offered no resistance and did not appear to say anything as she 
was being moved 
then workmen from the construction project began moving her 
belongings into the street 
ms smith 39 a former worker and resident of the motel is 
protesting the decision to remodel it into a museum in honor of 
king who was assassinated in 1968 she wants it to be used to 
serve the poor instead saying kings memory and this sacred 
ground is being exploited 
she also complains that the museum is part of an overall 
movement to upgrade housing and raise rents in the generally 
lowincome neighborhood 
it is my right and any other poor persons right to remain in 
this area she said today 
when the motel was closed two years ago deputies had to evict 
her then too 
tom marshall a deputy chief with the shelby county sheriffs 
department said his officers did not arrest ms smith this morning 
were enforcing a court order marshall said he said it 
would be up to the city to deal with her tent and other belongings 
left in the small side street in front of the motel 
ms smith said she did not know if she would continue her 
protest from the location across the street 
i just dont know she said its been a shock 
on friday a judge had set a deadline of saturday for ms smith 
to move saying she was trespassing on a construction site but 
authorities decided to take no action over the weekend 
the lorraine was shut by the state in january 1988 to make way 
for the museum project sheriffs deputies evicted ms smith two 
months later the deputies deposited her on a sidewalk outside the 
motel where she set up a tent and remained 
work on the museum site got under way last year but authorities 
generally ignored ms smith until now anthony vaccaro project 
manager for jamesonvaccaro construction co said she was camped 
on a spot that must be torn up for utility lines and the company 
petitioned the court to have her moved 
this morning ms smith was surrounded by about a dozen 
supporters when sheriffs deputies arrived none was arrested and 
there were no confrontations 
there were about 50 onlookers 
the lorraine was a popular stopping place for blacks when 
memphis hotels were segregated but it was falling apart in 1982 
when a group of citizens bought it at foreclosure auction 
the group formed the lorraine civil rights museum foundation and 
spent the next several years persuading the state county and city 
governments to build the 9 million museum title to the property 
was turned over to the state 
the museum to be called the national civil rights center is 
scheduled to open july 4 1991

the crews of the soviet and american spacecraft 
that linked in orbit 15 years ago say that only now are they 
beginning to see the cooperation on research they expected after 
their historic mission 
i would have hoped wed see some changes happening sooner than 
this but its very positive now said donald deke slayton 
pilot of the docking module that linked the apollo and soyuz ships 
on july 15 1975 
slayton and others who served on the 1975 mission predicted 
sunday that warming ussoviet relations will help the two 
countries work together to put man on mars within 20 years 
the two most notable times in relations between these two 
countries were world war ii and the apollosoyuz mission said 
retired air force lt gen thomas stafford 59 
thomas and slayton were on hand at a seattle air show to 
commemorate the mission anniversary along with soyuz commander 
alexei leonov and soviet crew member valeriy kubasov the four are 
currently touring the united states 
leonov said he was disappointed by what happened after the 
mission 
we finished our joint program perfectly and mr president 
ford said we are ready to have our cooperation he said i 
dont know why but president carter broke our programs it was 
very bad for relations between our country and america 
thomas pointed out that the freeze in joint programs occurred 
after the soviet invasion of afghanistan 
leonov said he has high hopes for a joint mars program and said 
a joint program may be the only way to reach the planet 
if america will do mars alone it will be very expensive if 
the soviet union will do it alone also we are going to work 
together because the soviet union and america have very good 
results he said 
slayton said a ussoviet mars mission is inevitable its 
just a matter of when were probably 15 or 20 years away from that 
because of resources but it will be a major international 
venture 
slayton said the soviet and american crew members have met many 
times since their 1975 orbital flight 
the third apollo mission member commandmodule pilot vance 
brand 59 was unable to attend sundays meeting he is preparing 
to command the space shuttle columbias next mission

japan which has moved from the secondlargest 
world bank loan debtor to the worlds largest creditor nation 
repaid its last world bank loan today 
the last 7 million installment on a 25year 75 million loan 
to the japan highway public corp was paid said world bank 
spokeswoman keiko sato 
between 1953 and 1966 japan borrowed 8629 million from the 
world bank to finance 31 projects only india borrowed more money 
from the world bank at that time 
the loans financed the construction of power plants steel mills 
and other development projects 
the world bank provided money during japans roughest times 
said seiichiro yonekura professor of business history at 
hitotsubashi university 
without its help japans postwar recovery would have been 
inconceivable the banks strict scrutiny over borrowers also 
forced japanese companies to improve their management and 
accounting practices yonekura said 
in a statement released by the world bank j burke knapp 
chairman of the banks loan committee during the 1950s and 1960s 
said there was considerable skepticism in the bank regarding 
japans economic viability and creditworthiness 
when the bank awarded its first loans to japan the economy was 
in an almost primitive condition barely recovered from the 
ravages of war and struggling with seemingly intractable 
balanceofpayments problems he said 
but burke knapp added that when japan stopped borrowing from the 
world bank in 1966 the world bank too had cause to regret the 
termination since for many years we had been saying that every 
loan we made to japan improved the quality of our general 
portfolio 
japan is now the second largest contributor after the united 
states to the international loan institution bearing 669 percent 
of its total shares the bank also borrows up to onethird of its 
finances from the tokyo money market 
the united states lost its position as worlds largest creditor 
nation to japan in the early 1980s by 1985 the united states was 
a net debtor for the first time in 71 years 
in 1989 the united states tightened its grip on the title of 
worlds largest debtor by ending the year with a net debt of 6637 
billion up 25 percent from the previous year

protesters eager to shut down the top dog 
world championship prairie dog shoot instead helped make it a 
booming business success and all the hubbub may have made the 
curious critters easier to kill 
locals thanked animal rights protesters for publicizing the 
event that kept cash registers ringing as more than 100 shooters 
about five dozen reporters and hundreds of partying visitors 
descended on this rural ranching area 
they didnt mean to do it but they did us more good than 
anything thats been done around here in years said beulah 
colcord owner of the yellow rock cafe the areas social center in 
nearby naturita 
an animal advocate appalled at the killing of prairie dogs for 
sport and 7000 in prizes said prior to the shoot that 5000 
protesters would disrupt the weekend event but no more than two 
dozen showed up 
the twoday prairie dog death toll was 2956 with local rancher 
earl reams and partner rusty calhoun claiming top dog honors with 
112 kills between them 
reams said new york can have broadway he prefers more rustic 
diversions some places have theaters we have turkey shoots 
he said this is good for the town and now were on the map 
protesters hooting and blowing whistles in hopes of keeping the 
targeted rodents inside their burrows during the shooting actually 
hurt the curious animals chances of surviving participants said 
all their noise does is bring the prairie dogs out of their 
holes to see whats doing on said terrye logan 32 of clyde 
texas one of three women competing in the event my brothers 
yesterday ended up laughing so hard they had to put their guns 
down 
a 25man special sheriffs force was on patrol there were a 
number of verbal confrontations but no fistfights two protesters 
were cited for trespassing 
nucla mayor john vanderpool who wore a flak jacket all weekend 
after receiving death threats said local merchants reported 
everything has at least tripled because of the prairie dog 
shoot 
organizer mike mehew said hed be writing thankyou notes today 
to robin duxbury of the rocky mountain humane society gov roy 
romer and us rep ben nighthorse campbell because they really 
made this what it turned out to be 
duxbury had promised to deliver 5000 protesters to the event 
but was not even among the small number that showed up 
romer and campbell said they understood that ranchers need to 
control prairie dogs to protect livestock and prevent soil erosion 
but criticized the shoot that turned rodent control into a 
spectacle 
the moose lodge in nucla headquarters of the hunt reported 
skyrocketing revenue bar receipts for the week hit 22000 
compared with 800 normally tallied each week lodge administrator 
leo laremore said 
the yellow rock cafe did even better colcord said 
we did enough in four days to double what we do in an entire 
big game hunting season she said and we couldnt be happier 
with the protesters they made the publicity that brought all these 
people in here 
reams and calhoun won two topofthe line kimber rifles after 
the event that awarded more points for longdistance kills and 
deducted points for missed shortrange shots 
the shooters pace was deliberate and careful with a shot 
coming about once every five minutes when a prairie dog poked his 
head into the air four hunters were stationed at each ranch and 
each was allowed 50 shots a day 
only four local shooters were entered in the 106shooter field 
which drew hunters from california to north carolina 
three young protesters were all that remained sunday of the 
larger band of demonstrators operating the day before 
if nothing else were bothering the mighty hunters said 
jon ellenbogen 24 who moved from detroit to durango three months 
ago i dont take their arguments about damage from prairie dogs 
if the prairie dogs are ruining it for the cows dont raise cows 
shooting them is not much of a philosophy

wanted by the czech ministry of 
justice vaclav havel 
for at least one bureaucrat within the ministry havel remains 
the shady enemy of the state and former convict instead of 
czechoslovak president 
the daily mlada fronta on monday carried the facsimile of a 
request from the ministry of justice to the criminal department of 
prague police on the whereabouts of a vaclav havel born oct 5 
1936 
the suspect moved without notifying the authorities the 
daily quoted the request dated may 2 as saying 
havel was jailed for 4 years by communists during the 20 years 
he acted as a human rights activist and dissident under 
czechoslovakias harsh communist regime 
he was under permanent watch of the secret police until last 
years democratic changes resulted in his election as president 
the ministry inquiry appeared not only out of date but based on 
inaccurate information as well 
unlike his predecessors havel who starts serving his second 
term as president on july 5 still formally lives in his private 
apartment in downtown prague although he spends much of his time 
at the presidential residence in lany near prague and his country 
house at hradecek in northern bohemia

when a lightning bolt 
sent flames crackling from a cottonwood tree in yellowstone 
national park half a dozen firefighters responded within minutes 
they were too late the fire had been reduced to embers by heavy 
rain from the storm that got it going but ever since blazes 
blackened nearly half of yellowstones 22 million acres during the 
dry hot summer of 1988 even a single burning tree quickly draws 
firefighters attention 
the heavily criticized let it burn plan under which fires 
caused by nature were left untouched unless they endangered people 
or structures has been suspended and is under review 
this year firefighters have fought about a dozen fires most of 
which were a quarteracre or smaller and several of which involved 
just one tree 
the parks 13th lightning fire which had blackened 15 acres 
north of yellowstone lake was 95 percent contained by fire lines 
today and 13 firefighters were at work down from a peak of 82 
said park spokeswoman marsha karle 
the costs are high the summers biggest fire spotted july 5 
near yellowstone river was contained at 220 acres by 315 
firefighters and the bill is expected to be around 750000 said 
park spokesman marsha karle 
when we have a big one where we bring in overhead and we bring 
in outside crews thats where it adds up real quick she said 
any time you call in outside resources retardant drops 
smokejumpers helicopters crews it adds to the cost 
firefighting is an expensive business 
at the height of the 1988 blazes public and political outrage 
prompted the interior department to go back to its pre1972 policy 
of fighting all fires 
the agency also mobilized a us forest servicenational park 
service team to analyze the let it burn policy the team found 
the policy to be basically sound but asked for some refinements 
steve frye a park ranger said the proposed revisions if 
adopted will leave little room for guesswork when rangers decide 
which backcountry fires to fight 
rangers would have to take into account recent rainfall 
humidity fuel moisture wind speed fuel types and the slope of 
the forest floor when deciding whether to fight fires frye said 
these factors have been considered in the past but there were 
no predetermined limits that they had to fall within he said 
it wasnt always so complicated 
during the parks first 100 years rangers battled every fire 
they could reach 
then in 1972 the national park service agreed to manage natural 
areas of yellowstone as vignettes of primitive america and 
adopted the let it burn policy 
from 1972 to 1987 the policy guided action over 235 fires that 
burned roughly 34000 acres according to park records 
how soon the parks firefighters will be given leeway in 
deciding which fires to fight and which to leave alone is 
difficult to gauge frye said 
our fire management plan is in the regional foresters office 
for review at this point he said 
if an environmental assessment of the revisions is required the 
plan may not take effect until next summer frye said an 
environmental impact statement would require even more study he 
said

education reform efforts that have swept the 
country during the last 10 years may be leaving hispanics behind 
the head of a civil rights group said today 
raul yzaguirre director of the national council of la raza 
said hispanics remain the most undereducated segment of the us 
population despite being the fastest growing 
the problem is getting worse rather than better yzaguirre 
told a news conference at the start of nclrs threeday national 
conference more than 4000 hispanic leaders from all over the 
country are attending 
nclrs statistical portrait of hispanic education found in some 
cases the gap between hispanics and nonhispanics in test 
achievement scores was growing 
yzaguirre said the group is worried that education reform 
efforts are helping whites but hurting minorities 
he compared some education reforms to a track coach who raises 
the bar on the high jump and does nothing to train his athletes to 
leap higher 
what that means is those who have had the training the 
preparation the nutrition will jump higher than those who have 
not he said 
thats exactly what we fear will happen to the hispanic 
community 
president bush and secretary of education lauro cavazos are 
scheduled to address the meeting later this week 
yzaguirre said the group does not expect bush to announce any 
new policy initiative to cope with the problem 
hispanics compared with blacks and whites enter school later 
and leave it earlier they are also less likely to complete high 
school enter or complete college the nclr report said 
hispanics have more problems in school and have lower 
expectations sometimes because teachers expect less from them 
yzaguirre said 
we have to understand this problem as the systems failure 
not a failure of children yzaguirre said 
nclr is a washingtonbased nonprofit advocacy group for the 
nations 20 million hispanic citizens it has a field office in 
mcallen texas

the change from communism to democracy 
has made sex a growth industry in hungary red lights now glitter 
where red stars once shone brightly 
budapest kiosks feature at least a dozen sex magazines a 
pornography shop joint venture with austria opened downtown six 
months ago in june the city got its first peep show a cab 
company ferries passengers exclusively to its massage salon 
the explosion in hungarys sex industry began after censorship 
laws were repealed last year as the nation moved from communist 
rule to democracy this paved the way for hardcore pornography 
which remains unrestricted in the absence of any new press law 
king of budapests new trade in bodily pleasures is antal laszlo 
voeroes a 37yearold travel journalist turned nude photographer 
and now sex and porn entrepreneur 
sitting in a swing chair in his garden barking explicit 
instructions to a photographer over a cordless phone voeroes 
explained how he struck it rich 
last summer voeroes launched sexy lady a 24page 
explicitly pornographic magazine selling for 90 cents an issue the 
initial print run of 60000 has soared to 1 million copies a month 
a followup sexy man was a flop but two new publications 
with lewd english and german language titles designed to boost 
foreign sales and give the allure of the west to hungarians are 
doing well voeroes said 
he hopes to break into the new yugoslav and romanian markets 
this summer 
voeroes starting capital of 16700 came from profits on girlie 
calendars and what he calls a photo model school where he says had 
trained some 1400 girls by 1988 
taking that capital and 585000 raised from nonbanking sources 
he refuses to reveal voeroes established his present company 
intermozaik in may 1989 
besides the lucrative magazines the company also makes 
pornographic videos that are also sold in austria and poland and 
is an agent for girls to italian and west german movie makers 
voeroes said 
not everyone is happy with voeroes newfound freedom 
antiporn campaigners have complained that hungary is fast 
becoming the thailand of central europe 
roman catholic church leaders who are campaigning to get 
religion back into schools and restrict abortion are pressing for 
restrictions on the growing sex industry 
but after 45 years of censorhip under communist rule not even 
leading antipornography campaigner pal becker head of the 
catholic youth movement wants pornography banned 
he has however argued that it should be restricted to the 
narrowest circles well outside the center of budapest 
like a good capitalist voeroes is constantly reinvesting and 
expanding his sex empire 
on june 15 his nudist cruise boat took its maiden voyage on 
lake balaton daytime trips strictly for sunbathing cost 8 and 
550 for children 
evening sex cruises advertised as live show sex games video 
and nudist disco cost 50 or 108 with a sex massage thrown in 
business is so brisk that voeroes plans to have a second boat 
cruising the lake hungarys most popular foreign tourist spot 
in a country where the average wage is 135 a month voeroes 
doesnt seem to have difficulty finding masseuses who earn 25 a 
client or a couple to perform live sex for double that amount 
parliament which was democratically elected earlier this year 
has not legalized prostitution stalling voeroes plans for two 
brothels 50 cabs driven by girls available for more than a ride 
and buses cruising round lake balaton with five girls aboard 
at intermozaik headquarters not everybody is as explicit as the 
magazines calendars and posters surrounding them 
both secretaries answering phones that constantly ring with 
demands for pornography declined to give their names and said 
their families dont know where they work 
we take home a lot more than at our previous jobs one said 
defensively after all filling out invoices for sexy lady is 
no different than filling out invoices for anything else

prime minister vp singh won a power 
struggle with his deputy monday ending a crisis which had 
paralyzed his minority government for three days 
singhs victory came with the resignation of deputy prime 
minister devi lals son om prakash chautala as head of the 
government of haryana state five days after he was reinstalled by 
his father 
chautala was forced to quit the post in may after 12 people died 
in repeated election violence in his constituency chautalas 
supporters were accused of inciting the troubles but a promised 
inquiry into his role never began 
chautalas reappointment thursday which prompted 13 ministers 
to resign in singhs 38member cabinet was seen as an effort by 
devi lal to promote his sons political career 
the crisis has blown over somappa rayappa bommai president 
of the janata dal party announced at a news conference late monday 
chautala resigned at my request to improve the image of the 
government and the party i congratulate him he has risen to the 
occasion bommai said 
the crisis began friday when three cabinet ministers resigned 
ten more ministers resigned after that and on saturday singh also 
offered to quit the national front rejected the offer 
top leaders of the alliance rallied behind singh forcing him to 
retract his resignation letter some commentators suggested the 
maneuver was meant to garner support in his fight with devi lal 
the 75yearold political patriarch of haryana state 
several major newspapers had been demanding chautalas ouster as 
a solution to the crisis if you bow to mr devi lal today you 
will have to crawl tomorrow wrote the conservative hindustan 
times in an editorial 
singh led the front in ousting rajiv gandhis congress party in 
novembers national elections campaigning on a platform of a clean 
government 
neither party got a majority of the seats in parliament but the 
national front formed the government on the strength of outside 
support by a rightwing hindu fundamentalist party and leftwing 
parties

president mikhail s gorbachev today removed his 
objection to a united germany belonging to nato saying germany was 
free to choose its allies the soviet objection had been a major 
obstacle to full german unification 
gorbachev spoke at a joint news conference with west german 
chancellor helmut kohl in southern russia that was broadcast live 
on soviet and west german television 
kohl said west germany wants to new unified state to be a 
member of nato he said he was sure the government of east 
germany concurred 
gorbachev said that the fourpower agreement of the victorious 
world war ii allies that has governed germany since the end of the 
war will cease when germany is unified 
unified germany receives complete sovereignty gorbachev told 
the news conference 
it has the right to use this sovereignty to make its choice 
that is its internal choice meaning its variant of social 
development and meaning what it would like to be a part of what 
blocs to support he said 
the two leaders spoke following a twoday vsiit by kohl aimed at 
removing soviet concerns over german unification the news 
conference was held in zhelosnovodsk in southern russia 
gorbachev said that no nato forces must be stationed on the 
territory of what is now east germany during a period of three to 
four years when soviet troops will be withdrawing 
he said the soviet union hopes that after that period no nato 
forces or nuclear weapons would be stationed there 
previously the soviets had insisted on a neutral germany and 
recently had suggested a form of associate membership in the north 
atlantic treaty organization after an unspecified transition period 
west germany and its nato allies had insisted that a united 
germany be a part of the western alliance 
in washington the state department said gorbachevs comments 
were most interesting and welcome but it withheld further 
comment pending study of gorbachevs remarks 
nato in a statement from brussels also praised gorbachevs 
acceptance of a unified germany as member of the western alliance 
it said such membership will increase stability for all 
including the soviet union 
kohl and gorbachev also announced agreement on several other 
issues including the size of the future army of a united germany 
and a timetable for the withdrawal of soviet soldiers from east 
germany 
gorbachev said the two sides in talks that started sunday in 
moscow and continued in gorbachevs native stavropol region had 
managed to ease each others concerns about the future of soviet 
troops on the territory of what is now east germany 
kohl said soviet troops should be withdrawn from east german 
territory three to four years after germany is united the soviets 
now have about 380000 troops in east germany 
during the same period the armed forces of a united germany 
will be reduced to 370000 men kohl said the combined strength of 
the east and west german armed forces is now about 600000 with 
west germany providing 480000 men 
kohl said the rights of the four world war ii victorious powers 
will cease immediately after unification but that their troops 
could stay in berlin as long as the soviet troops are in east 
germany 
he said a united germany and the soviet union will sign a 
comprehensive treaty that will govern all aspects of their 
bilateral relations 
the two leaders were in southern russia after a visit sunday to 
gorbachevs home region stavropol 
the soviet leader said he thought the fresh air of the 
northern caucasus mountains would help both leaders formulate their 
thoughts clearly the tass news agency reported 
it was kohls second visit to the soviet union since february 
and gorbachevs hospitality indicated the soviets seek close ties 
with the economically powerful germans 
tass said parallel talks were held sunday between foreign 
ministers eduard shevardnadze and hans dietrich genscher as well as 
finance ministers valentin pavlov and theo waigel 
during kohls visit the two leaders discussed how west german 
economic aid can help gorbachev restructure and revive the 
ailing soviet economy 
the west german government has backed a 31 billion loan to 
support gorbachevs efforts so far ineffectual to transform the 
soviet unions centralized economy to a marketoriented system 
at last weeks houston summit of leading industrial democracies 
western leaders rejected a proposal strongly supported by west 
germany and france for a 15 billion aid plan to shore up the 
soviet economy and demonstrate western support for gorbachev

aircraft maker mcdonnell douglas corp will cut 
11 percent of its work force or up to 17000 jobs by years end 
under a plan to reduce costs by more than 700 million the company 
said today 
we tried to do everything else john f mcdonnell chairman 
and chief executive officer told a news conference but in the 
final analysis we had to come to this 
the company the nations biggest defense contractor has been 
struggling financially because of cutbacks in the defense industry 
and costly development problems in both military and commercial 
aircraft projects 
the costcutting plan also includes reduced capital budgets 
significant cuts in budgets for travel consultants and advertising 
and restrictions on overtime 
in a statement mcdonnell told employees he deeply regretted 
the pain and hardship these cuts will cause to thousands of people 
who have valued and dedicated employees 
job fairs resume services and counseling would be offered to 
help laidoff workers find new jobs mcdonnell saidj 
the cuts had been expected for several weeks since the company 
announced plans for significant layoffs in an effort to cut 
expenses and bolster its sagging financial performance 
the companys stock was down 150 a share at 4337 in midday 
trading on the new york stock exchange 
mcdonnell douglas earned 2 million during its first quarter 
down 98 percent from a year earlier the drop stemmed mainly from 
huge losses at douglas aircraft which primarily builds commercial 
jets 
the layoffs will affect salaried and hourly jobs at all of 
mcdonnell douglas companies and facilities 
the news release said 4500 jobs in st louis would be lost 
about 9000 jobs will be lost including about 8000 at the douglas 
aircraft co commercial airplane facility in long beach calif an 
additional 1000 jobs are being eliminated in 25 other states where 
the company has offices and manufacturing operations 
mcdonnell said he believed the company can make the cuts so 
that they will not jeopardize our technological capability or 
undermine our ability to deliver quality products on time

a rebound in business sales in may helped keep 
inventories growing at a moderate rate the government said monday 
in a report that analysts say signals continued economic expansion 
the commerce department said inventories held on shelves and 
backlots totaled a seasonally adjusted 7994 billion up 04 
percent after aprils 03 percent gain 
business sales shot up a seasonally adjusted 09 percent in may 
nearly recovering from a 1 percent drop a month earlier it was the 
strongest increase since february when sales rose 14 percent 
the report which was in line with economists expectations 
provided fresh evidence that the economy was not in danger of 
toppling immediately into a recession 
theres no excessive inventory building so economic growth 
can continue just fine said economist john silvia of kemper 
financial services in chicago 
the combination of strong sales and a moderate increase in 
inventories produced a 148 ratio of inventories to sales down 
slightly from 149 in april the ratio means that it would take 
148 months to exhaust the backlog of goods at the may sales pace 
usually when the inventorytosales ratio gets high 
businesses cut down on production and that tends to generate a 
recession silvia said 
the ratio hit a peak of 17 in october 1982 during the last 
recession 
although inventories appear wellcontrolled overall some 
analysts are worried that inventories rose more strongly on the 
retail and wholesale levels 
the increase in inventories was greatest at wholesale 
establishments up 12 percent retail backlogs rose 04 percent 
while inventories at factories were unchanged 
retail and wholesale are where a cycle of rising 
inventories would start and eventually work back to manufacturing 
it seems to suggest the economy still has problems said 
economist robert brusca of nikko securities co international 
manufacturers showed the biggest sales gain in may 2 percent 
while sales fell 06 percent at retail stores wholesalers reported 
a 06 percent increase 
in an advance estimate the commerce department said last week 
that retail sales rose 05 percent in june the first increase in 
five months

new members of the world bear eaters 
association may feel like growling after getting their first taste 
of the dark greasy meat 
but i tell them not to worry said the rev joseph gluck 
pastor emeritus and historian of the forksofcheat baptist church 
after that passes theyll feel stronger more powerful with a 
new zest for life 
the church founded in the mountain wilderness 215 years ago 
marked its anniversary sunday with a bear feast to honor the 
animal that helped keep early members alive 
it wasnt easy for the settlers to bring cows sheep and other 
domestic animals across the allegheny mountains said gluck 
thats why the black bear became one of the great sources of meat 
for the people who founded our church 
for the past 30 years bear meat has been served as a sort of 
memorial at the picnics marking the anniversary of the churchs 
founding on nov 5 1775 gluck said the picnic is held in july to 
take advantage of summer weather 
the hilltop church which overlooks the cheat and monongahela 
rivers near the pennsylvania line depends on hunters to supply the 
meat 
gluck 75 is also bear master at the church and initiates 
new members into the beareating club 
i say some magic special indian words tap them on the head 
three times with the magic tooth taken from a west virginia black 
bear and give them a certificate so they can prove to people 
theyve actually eaten bear gluck said mostly they just grin 
and eat it 
about 1500 people from two dozen states and several other 
countries are members said gluck 
lena nicholson 90 who has helped prepare the feast for 
decades said cooking the hind quarters takes all day 
the meat is divided into roasts and boiled in water three times 
before being covered with onion apple and celery and roasted in 
the oven for several hours she said 
that bear meat is awful strong and greasy said nicholson 
i have to open all the windows and the door the smell gets 
pretty strong 
when its done the meat tastes like a cross between beef and 
pork she said 
people seem to like it real well said nicholson theres 
never any left and ive never had anyone complain yet

two young men who shot themselves in 1985 were 
influenced by subliminal messages in a rock n roll album produced 
in the interest of greed an attorney charged today as a trial got 
under way 
what this case is is about making money vivian lynch said 
in her opening statement in the case against the band judas priest 
and cbs records 
excitement is what the defendants were selling she said 
excitement is what the consumers were buying 
the lawsuit seeks unspecified damages relatives of the victims 
claim hidden messages in the album stained class spurred the 
two men to form a suicide pact 
the band members strongly deny any such messages exist 
on the afternoon of dec 23 1985 raymond belknap 18 held a 
sawedoff shotgun to his chin and died instantly from a single 
blast james vance 20 managed only to blow away the lower portion 
of his face the two had been listening to the album repeatedly 
while drinking and smoking marijuana their relatives said 
though he survived the shootings vance underwent repeated 
operations and eventually died three years later of complications 
from his injuries and a reaction to medication 
ms lynch who represents vances family told the court the 
audience targeted by the band was a stained class in itself 
that craved excitement and touted satanism sexual aggression 
violence suicide and death 
this case is about mind control in this case what pushed the 
boys over the edge into eternity was the subliminal push 
lawyers for judas priest and cbs records will argue it was the 
young mens troubled lives including a history of drug and alcohol 
abuse psychiatric disorders and physical abuse that pushed them 
over the edge they deny that the band promotes suicide or satanism 
washoe district judge jerry carr whitehead is presiding over the 
nonjury trial he already has denied a defense motion to dismiss 
the case on grounds the record was protected by the first amendment 
whitehead said freedom of speech protections would not apply to 
subliminal messages he said he was not convinced the hidden 
messages actually existed on the album but left the argument to 
attorneys 
the lawsuit is proceeding as a products liability case with the 
band and record company accused of negligence and intentional and 
reckless misconduct 
in one of the albums songs beyond the realms of death the 
band sings yeah i have left the world behind i am safe now in 
my mind im free to speak with my own mind this is my life this 
is my life and ill decide not you 
but the trial will focus not on what the lyrics may have 
suggested but whether there was a second allbutinaudible set of 
lyrics in the background 
i dont believe that wed have had the support and following 
that weve had for the past 17 years had we deliberately attempted 
to contrive to create songs where people did harm to themselves 
lead singer robert halford said in a 1988 deposition 
attorneys for the families said the young mens troubled lives 
made them susceptible influenced and vulnerable to the ideas 
suggestions and emotions allegedly hidden in the music 
more than 100 witnesses are expected to testify during the trial 
likely to last four weeks

the navy says collegebound young people will 
benefit from a new twoyear enlistment program designed to fill 
some of the services toughest jobs 
about 600 men and women have signed on for the program which 
began last month 
it is geared toward attracting the collegebound kid 
interested in earning benefits for higher education and seeing the 
world before starting school vice adm jeremy boorda the chief of 
naval personnel said in a recent interview 
the lure is the montgomery gi bill under which participants can 
receive a 250 monthly stipend over three years of college 
while sailors can leave the service after two years of active 
duty under the program they must stay serve an additional six 
years with the nondrilling naval reserve 
the program was created in response to congressional calls for 
military spending cuts and leaner armed forces 
were looking for high school graduates boorda said 
were looking for quality people but also people who may not 
want to make the navy a career 
instead of attracting young men and women for a normal four or 
sixyear enlistment with the promise of hightech training the new 
program enlists sailors for general detail the deck and 
engineering assignments that are often dirty laborintensive and 
hard to fill 
these are tough jobs boorda said 
he envisions bringing 2000 such sailors into the service this 
year 14000 over the next year now 580000 men and women serve 
in the navy 
the program should help the service in coming years when 
pentagon spending is expected to decline and the militarys 
activeduty roster of 21 million is expected to shrink 
i have to figure a way to bring the navy down in size without 
hurting readiness or hurting those people who want to stay 
boorda said we know we are going to get smaller 
boorda said the move is only part of a bigger reduction 
strategy that means the navy will have to look at cutting 
enlistments enforcing retirements and as a last resort 
involuntary separations 
the twoyear recruits will be finishing their duty exactly 
when we need to get smaller boorda said im not looking for 
large numbers to stay 
the program also helps boost the numbers of trained sailors in 
the reserves a force that will need to grow in light of the 
changes in the world environment and the lessened soviet threat 
defense experts on capitol hill such as senate armed services 
committee chairman sam nunn dga have called for cutting active 
duty personnel back by 100000 in the next fiscal year 
nunn also has backed proposals to put more emphasis on reserve 
and national guard forces which can be called up if national 
security is threatened thats a much cheaper option than paying 
for large numbers of activeduty personnel 
the twoyear enlistment program comes at the right time 
according to sen john mccain rariz a specialist on military 
personnel issues 
its a good approach when you need to fine tune the nations 
forces said mccain the ranking republican on the senate 
committees manpower subcommittee

vice president dan quayle chairman of the 
national space council asked nasa today to establish an outside 
task force to consider the longterm direction of americas space 
program 
quayle discussed the request in an hourlong meeting with nasa 
administrator richard h truly 
reports circulated over the weekend that the white house was 
considering restructuring the agency in the wake of its recent 
setbacks the grounding of the space shuttle fleet and a flaw in 
the 15 billion hubble space telescope that prevents it from being 
focused perfectly 
the vice president said in a threeparagraph statement that 
contrary to some published reports there is no white house 
investigation of nasa 
the statement said quayle had asked truly to put together an 
outside task force that will consider the future longterm 
direction of the space program it said the nasa chief and the 
task force will report to the vice president 
there was nothing in the statement about shaking up the agency 
nasa sources said quayle privately had expressed confidence in 
trulys leadership 
space continues to be a top priority for this 
administration the quayle statement said we all want the best 
ideas on how we can move into the next century maintaining our 
leadership in space 
quayle truly and white house chief of staff john sununu talked 
with several nasa critics in a meeting aboard air force two on the 
flight home wednesday from the economic summit in houston 
participants included former astronaut eugene cernan former 
nasa administrator thomas paine cal tech scientist bruce murray 
and hans mark chancellor of the university of texas system 
the white house may enlist a team of space experts from outside 
government to aid in reviewing nasa said the official who spoke 
sunday on condition of anonymity 
the administration source said quayle and truly are leading the 
internal effort to find ways to get the space program back on track 
space news a weekly industry newspaper said in todays edition 
that the restructuring stems from concern that a lack of public 
support for space and federal budget pressures make it difficult 
for nasa to carry out its missions and that the white house is 
concerned the problems are institutional rather than technical 
the decision has not yet been made to convene a blueribbon 
panel of experts the source said but if something is done it 
will be done with a combination of outside and inside advice 
cbs news reported saturday that the administration likely will 
name a panel of outside experts this week 
until its recent problems the national aeronautics and space 
administration seemed to be recovering from criticisms following 
the 1986 challenger explosion that killed seven astronauts 
the shuttle fleet was grounded after hydrogen leaks were 
discovered on space shuttles columbia and atlantis but engineers 
have located the leaks and officials say they are easy to fix 
also nasa revealed that the 15 billion hubble launched 
april 25 has a focusing flaw that has sharply reduced its 
usefulness the agency blamed the problem on a defect in one of the 
telescopes two mirrors 
in addition to quayle and truly the national space council 
includes sununu budget director richard darman commerce secretary 
robert mosbacher and other officials

president bush today welcomed soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachevs willingness to accept a united germany as a 
member of nato 
this comment demonstrates statesmanship and strengthens 
efforts to build enduring relationships based on cooperation 
bush said in a written statement 
bush added we think this solution is in the best interests of 
all the countries of europe including the soviet union 
the presidents statement was issued after gorbachev said that 
germany was free to choose its own allies 
unified germany receives complete sovereignty gorbachev 
said standing alongside west german chancellor helmut kohl at a 
news conference in southern russia 
it has the right to use this sovereignty to make its choice 
that is its internal choice meaning its variant of social 
development and meaning what it would like to be a part of what 
blocs to support gorbachev said 
kohl said west germany wants a new unified state to be a 
member of nato he said he was sure the government of east 
germany concurred 
in his statement bush said that gorbachevs position can be 
seen as a response perhaps in part to the outcome of the nato 
summit in london where the alliance displayed its readiness to 
adapt to the new realities in europe and reach out to former 
adversaries in the east 
nato agreed to reduce nuclear and conventional weapons and 
proposed a nonaggression declaration between the alliance and the 
states of the warsaw pact it also declared that nuclear arms would 
be used only as a last resort 
west germany and its nato allies have steadfastly insisted that 
a united germany be a part of the western alliance 
in washington the state department said gorbachevs comments 
were most interesting and welcome but it withheld further 
comment pending study of gorbachevs remarks 
nato in a statement from brussels also praised gorbachevs 
acceptance of a unified germany as member of the western alliance 
it said such membership will increase stability for all 
including the soviet union

an east german church is getting help 
from west germany to retrieve art treasures believed pilfered by an 
american soldier at the close of world war ii a west german 
official said monday 
east and west germany also agreed to build an information 
database aimed at the return of other art works that vanished when 
the third reich fell 
litigation to retrieve the socalled quedlinburg treasures from 
bank vaults in texas is already under way the foreign ministry 
said monday that west germany would pay the legal costs 
bonns help in meeting the expense will be a major boost for the 
lutheran church of quedlinburg which claims its treasures were 
stolen at the end of world war ii said klaus maurice director of 
the west german cultural foundation of the states 
nobody knew until now who had to pay but they will pay and 
this is marvelous maurice said 
the quedlinburg treasures include two rare medieval manuscripts 
a jeweled ivorycarved container for relics and several 
rockcrystal and ivory objects they were allegedly removed from a 
mine shaft where they had been hidden in the final days of the war 
maurice said there was no doubt the art works in question were 
authentic 
the quedlinburg treasures among germanys most famous art 
works were allegedly taken by a us army officer stationed in 
quedlinburg now east germany in 1945 and brought to his hometown 
of whitewright texas 
the church is suing the sister and brother of the officer the 
late joe t meador to recover the treasures 
maurice said officials have no clear idea of how many other 
works were allegedly looted from germanys artitistic heritage in 
the final months of the war 
the problem up to now is that we had two states and it wasnt 
easy to speak with east germany maurice said now this is 
easier 
maurice spoke after attending a twohour meeting to dicuss 
coordinated approaches toward retrieving lost german art also 
attending the meeting was a ministry of culture representative from 
east germany which is expected to formally unite with its western 
neighbor in december 
the new database is to be established in berlin and collect 
information from museums churches and other institutions 
throughout the two germanys maurice said the database will 
compare preworld war ii inventories with current records in an 
attempt to get a complete picture of what is missing he said

a radical iranian newspaper monday said 
many western reporters sent to cover events in iran were spies and 
warned the government to beware 
the persianlanguage jomhuri islami which reflects the views of 
government hardliners said many western journalists visited iran 
to fulfill their missions assigned by the zionists and western 
spying agencies 
the article which was obtained by the associated press in 
cyprus blamed officials of the ministry of islamic guidance which 
is in charge of regulating the activities of foreign reporters for 
giving reporters too much freedom on their trips to iran 
journalists who visit iran are assigned agents from the ministry 
who accompany them on all trips outside their hotels reporters are 
also required to submit their film and tapes to ministry officials 
for approval 
it is simplicity if we think that the cia the israeli 
mossad and other intelligence services simply use one device to 
obtain information from iran 
in addition to their set formula they send reporters 
photographers and and cameramen as a coverup the newspaper 
alleged 
the iranian government allows few western news organizations to 
base representatives in iran and reporters are only to visit the 
country only on special occassions recently reporters were 
allowed in to cover the first anniversary of the death of irans 
spiritual leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini and the june 
earthquake that left about 40000 dead 
on such visits the paper alleged many reporters take full 
advantage to carry out their mission and take interesting gifts to 
their masters and receive handsome rewards 
to support its claim the newspaper said an american television 
crew that visited iran in june to cover the anniversary of 
khomeinis death had four members none of whom had majored in 
journalism 
when the united states has tens of colleges and schools for 
the training of mass media men they dont need other people to be 
used in the media field the article said 
in a section of the article subtitled sample of mischiefs 
the paper said the american crew took a picture of an unfinished 
building which was the subject of a dispute between the united 
states and iran at the international court in the hague 
the article said the television team had full knowledge about 
the geographical situation of tehran and its streets and that it 
attempted to visit a public park and the main shopping center in 
central tehran 
the paper took umbrage at an alleged remark by the american 
reporter claiming that the shopping district was full of michael 
jackson fans and that he intended to interview them 
the article accused a reporter from another major american 
television network of compiling a full list of leaders of 
fundamentalist moslem proiranian lebanese and palestinian groups 
invited to tehran to participate in the first anniversary 
ceremonies 
the full list of the guests was however also reported by the 
staterun radio and television and all major newspapers 
the paper gave the following as other examples of 
nonjournalistic activities 
a reporter from a major british televsion network tried to take 
an unauthorized photograph of a refinery 
another british radio journalist visited downtown tehran and 
tried to compile a report of illegal black market sales of hard 
currency 
a danish reporter tried to compile a negative report of the 
economy and accused him of attempting to photograph a woman at 
the weekly friday prayers dressed in western clothes 
the newspaper also accused western reporters of mischiefs in 
reporting on the quake which killed some 40000 
it said they used their visits to collect information on the 
condition of women the economy politics and the military the 
newspaper also accused reporters of counting the number of iranian 
helicopters involved in relief operations 
jomhuri islami said the guidance ministry should offer 
facilities only to genuine journalists and not spies

us presidents have for four decades relied 
on cia assessments of the soviet economy that vastly overstate the 
economic strength of americas chief rival witnesses told a senate 
committee monday 
sen daniel patrick moynihan dny said the faulty numbers 
could well have created an unjustified level of concern about 
soviet strength that in turn led the united states to overspend on 
defense 
the cia has come to be relied upon as the principal western 
source of information about the soviet economy including its 
overall gross national product and the proportion of the gnp 
devoted to military might 
the spy agency has rated soviet economic growth as higher than 
that of the united states for most of the period since it began its 
assessments in the early 1950s last year the cia put the soviet 
gnp at 51 percent of the us gnp of 523 trillion 
that figure puts the cia near the top of a range of estimates 
which go as low as 14 percent and moynihan said a more realistic 
number would be around 33 percent if we had kept with that 
onethird number we would have behaved differently moynihan 
said 
michael boskin chairman of the presidents council of economic 
advisers said the onethird figure is probably a good estimate 
the spy agencys chief analyst of the soviet union george kolt 
conceded the agencys number is probably too high but maintained 
we have done a good job on a very complex issue 
kolt said the cia would adjust its figures downward perhaps 
nearer to an economic growth of 35 percent if it can get better 
information on the quality of soviet goods and can improve its own 
analytical methods 
but he said the agencys estimates have been accurate when it 
comes to soviet defense spending 
boskin pointed out that any estimates of the soviet economy are 
made difficult because of problems in getting accurate data about 
production and consumption the inability to compare currencies and 
the fundamental problem of assigning value to items in a system 
without market pricing 
the process is fraught with distortions such as the soviet 
plant that produces an excess of easytomake ball bearings then 
ships them to a steel mill where they are melted down and sent back 
to make more bearings boskin said 
moynihan pointed out that it is difficult as well for 
americans to conceive of a system where fully onehalf of 
agricultural production can be lost to spoilage because of a 
defective distribution system 
those difficulties will confront the international monetary fund 
when it seeks to carry out a study of the soviet economy mandated 
last week by the worlds seven most developed nations the imf 
study is to be the basis for any future aid to the soviet union 
congress ran into its own problems in trying to assess the cias 
performance a witness from the general accounting office allan 
mendelowitz said he had been stymied by the agency in seeking 
information for a congressionally mandated study of cia methodology 
this is discouraging moynihan said promising to take the 
matter up with cia director william webster didnt i read 
somewhere that the cold war is over

it took a lot to rile residents of this 
farming community best known as the birthplace of thomas e dewey 
until firefighters were barred from sitting in front of their 
firehouse 
about 250 people have signed a petition to protest the order by 
the fire chief and city manager and more 50 people turned out for 
a city council meeting july 9 to press for the ban to be dropped 
i figure theyve done it for years why not keep doing it 
said don hornus a regular patron at the roundtable restaurant i 
dont know why theyre making such a big deal over it we dont get 
that much controversy over things that matter 
the motto of this treelined city about 100 miles northwest of 
detroit proclaims that its a shade better than other 
communities the city of 16455 is the birthplace of dewey the 
republican presidential candidate in 1944 and 1948 and was a 
leading manufacturer of caskets in the 1920s 
city policy permitted the 18 firefighters who work 24hour 
shifts to sit in front of the station after 5 pm but two months 
ago chief john kenney banned it around the clock after seeing some 
firefighters in front of the station at midday he said it looked 
unprofessional 
firefighters can still sit outside on the other sides of the 
onestory fire station or in its airconditioned lounge when 
theyre waiting for emergency calls 
chamber of commerce executive director mike mccloskey said 
opinion is virtually unanimous that the city went too far with the 
ban i think its probably a way of life for firemen to sit in 
front of the fire station he said 
heat from the public prompted city council last week to order 
city manager gregg guetschow to solve the dispute guetschow said 
the firefighters union has asked for a meeting to discuss the 
sitting situation 
union president james treadway did not return a message left on 
his answering machine monday in a letter to the arguspress 
newspaper he wrote sitting in front of the fire station in the 
evening is a tradition that predates all of the current 
firefighters 
in a letter published monday dick marr 24year firefighter 
wrote 
if you wonder just what the firemen get out of sitting in 
front of the station it is just watching the people go by tooting 
their horns waving and watching the smiles on the kids and their 
parents when we wave back its the thankyous from the people who 
stop by 
the city manager or fire chief would neither discuss the ban nor 
allow onduty firefighters to be interviewed 
this really in the whole scheme of things is a very very 
minor issue that should have been dealt with under the contract and 
will be dealt with under the contract just like every other 
grievance we get is guetschow said 
he said the city is being unfairly ridiculed because it let a 
small matter get out of hand but the arguspress said city council 
deserved the criticism 
there are few jobs that require their workers to go to work 
every day knowing it could be their last an editorial said 
we dont care what they talk about to whom they talk or if 
they want to play a few hands of gin rummy or snooze or eat or 
turn cartwheels or floss their teeth or just sit

the woman known as the central park jogger 
climbed unsteadily onto the witness stand monday and described the 
lasting effects of a beating she barely survived and does not 
remember 
speaking in a firm voice the woman testified she has trouble 
walking and seeing cannot smell and cannot remember why 
she said she remembers breaking a dinner date with a friend on 
april 19 1989 because of work but does not remember entering the 
park to run around 930 pm when she was gangraped and viciously 
beaten by marauding youths who left her naked and near death in a 
puddle of mud and blood 
what was your very next memory asked assistant district 
attorney elizabeth lederer 
i remember waking up in the hospital on a friday evening late 
in may she said a very good friend of mine was in the room 
and so was a nurse it was the memorial day weekend 
she said she was in the hospital about six weeks before being 
transferred to a rehabilitation center 
before her testimony tension filled the courtroom during the 2 
minutes from when she was called until she took the stand it was 
not clear what took so long but finally she walked shakily into 
the room taking short steps as a court officer held her elbow and 
helped her climb the witness stand 
during her 10 minutes on the stand the woman did not appear to 
look at the three youths charged with maiming her the three looked 
at their hands fiddled with pens or stared into space 
there were no obvious reactions by the jurors 
defense attorneys asked the witness no questions 
do you suffer any lasting injuries as a result of what 
happened to you on april 19 1989 asked lederer 
i have problems with balance when im walking and 
coordination at times ill veer off to the right or the left 
she said i have trouble walking down steps i also lost my sense 
of smell completely that has not come back 
i have double vision when im reading i hold papers over to 
the left to compensate it takes a fair amount of concentration to 
make the image one 
its worse when my eyes are tired and worsens still if 
shes in a dark room she said 
in an attempt to blunt assertions by defense attorneys that a 
rape may not have occurred the jogger was questioned about her 
sexual activity and use of a diaphragm for birth control 
the woman who was attacked on a wednesday testified that she 
had last had sex the previous sunday with her boyfriend 
afterward she went running with her boyfriend and with a diaphragm 
still inserted 
a dna expert dwight adams who works for the fbi testified 
earlier that semen that matched her boyfriends dna profile was 
found on the joggers black running tights 
the prosecution apparently was trying to show the semen was 
deposited there on sunday and that she wore the same pants on 
wednesday 
adams also said none of the other semen samples matched the 
defendants or the boyfriends 
the victim the prosecutions 34th witness was called as the 
trial entered its fourth week 
antron mccray and raymond santana and yusef salaam all 16 are 
charged with attempted murder rape sexual abuse assault robbery 
and riot in the attack on the woman and two male joggers 
they are being tried in an adult court but if convicted they 
will be sentenced as juvenile offenders to up to 10 years in prison 
three other youths face trial later this year 
the woman a 30yearold investment banker has recovered enough 
to return to work at salomon brothers inc where she is a vice 
president in corporate finance 
the witness was dressed in a purple doublebreasted business 
suit her blond hair was cut short and away from her face 
permitting a view of the jagged scar which runs from above her left 
eyebrow down across her cheek 
justice thomas b galligan told the courtroom artists not to 
draw the woman because she had expressed anxiety about having her 
likeness shown and was entitled because of the nature of the 
crime to make that request her name has been withheld by news 
organizations 
the woman was asked to identify the clothing she was wearing the 
night of the attack lederer showed her a tshirt now almost 
completely brown with dried blood 
do you recognize this lederer asked 
thats the shirt that i used to wear she replied 
prior to april 19 1989 what color was it lederer asked 
it was white she answered 
the prosecution said the woman was attacked as she jogged after 
work the tshirt twirled tightly to form a kind of rope was used 
to bind her hand to her neck and gag her while she was raped and 
bludgeoned detectives have testified 
robert burns salaams lawyer said outside the courtroom he did 
not crossexamine the witness because she came here as a 
helpless victim she served no evidentiary purpose 
santanas lawyer peter rivera said in the long run i think 
her testimony helps us the fact that she came in and couldnt 
identify any of the defendants and could not even remember going 
to the park 
as rivera spoke supporters of the defendants shouted 
sellout sellout whore you representing the boys or the 
victim

two prominent solidarity activists who 
oppose chairman lech walesa formed a new political movement monday 
that sympathizes with the government and advocates a popular vote 
for president 
the movement called democratic action said it would try to 
present a strong alternative to the 2monthold center 
alliance which backs solidarity leader walesa and wants him named 
president by parliament this year 
the political movements formation comes a few days after prime 
minister tadeusz mazowiecki and walesa declared a political truce 
in their fued over the pace of political and economic changes 
more than 90 people attended the founding meeting held at 
parliament those attending include many of the 63 senior advisers 
and longtime solidarity activists who broke ranks with walesa at a 
stormy june 24 meeting of the national citizens committee which 
walesa controls 
the groups leaders include zbigniew bujak former warsaw 
regional leader of solidarity and the head of the solidarity 
underground during the martiallaw period and wladyslaw frasyniuk 
the longtime leader of solidarity in lower silesia 
the new movement scheduled a founding congress for july 28 and 
representatives said they intended to meet with solidarity members 
of both houses of parliament this friday to invite them to join the 
movement 
bujak and fransyniuk were once regarded as walesas potential 
heirs within solidarity but in recent months they have distanced 
themselves from him complaining about his autocratic style 
bujak said the movement has its own proposals concerning the 
system of the state and style of politics 
the groups first demand is for popular presidential elections 
this year 
both center alliance and democratic action presume president 
wojciech jaruzelski the former communist party leader will be 
persuaded to resign well ahead of his scheduled 1995 departure 
a fast presidential election will thus contribute to improving 
the political situation allowing the sejm parliament to 
complete its work 
he said his party also sees it as essential that the next 
president is elected by the people and not by parliament 
walesas opponents have said polls indicate he may have a 
difficult time winning a popular vote for president walesas 
supporters want parliament to appoint a president they say popular 
presidential elections should be held after a new constitution is 
written 
bujak and frasyniuk said some members of the solidarityled 
government support their movement but they did not know if 
mazowiecki would join

the white house in its annual reality check 
has confessed the governments deficit problem is far worse than it 
admitted last january 
now instead of being the pollyanna of budget forecasters the 
administration sounds more like chicken little shouting the sky 
is falling 
in submitting his proposed budget to congress six months ago 
president bush foresaw a budget deficit absent changes in law of 
1005 billion for the fiscal year that begins oct 1 
bush said that figure which was 365 billion above the 
required deficit limit for 1991 could be handled with a collection 
of spending cuts and a hodgepodge of small tax hikes that would 
meet the grammrudman deficit target of 64 billion for 1991 
now comes the administrations midsession review of the 
budget and the president sees a much more formidable challenge 
instead of a 100 billion deficit the deficit has ballooned to 
1688 billion 2314 billion if the savings and loan bailout is 
taken into account 
what happened 
in the real world not a whole lot 
the economy that was chugging along at a subpar growth rate in 
january has changed little in the intervening months interest 
rates have been stuck at their december levels for most of the 
year the cost of the savings and loan bailout has been what most 
people feared horrendous 
the congressional budget office and many private forecasters all 
had budget estimates in january that were far higher than the 
administrations 
however since the president is required in his january budget 
to meet the grammrudman deficit targets only on paper not in 
reality the administration forecast a far different world six 
months ago 
it saw economic growth rebounding smartly thus bringing in more 
tax revenue normally interest rates rise along with economic 
growth but in the administrations world interest rates would 
drop sharply as growth rebounded this helps the bottom line as 
well because it reduces the governments borrowing costs on the 3 
trillion national debt 
and as for the sampls the administration despite widespread 
warnings to the contrary lowballed the estimate of how much the 
government would need to clean up the mess 
while the whole process may not win a truthinbudgeting 
award it did allow the president to submit a 1991 budget that 
honored his readmylips pledge against tax increases 
but with the new budget year set to start oct 1 the 
administration by law must take another look at the economic and 
budget landscape based on actual performance over the last six 
months 
bushs new budget estimates had to take into account the reality 
that economic growth has not picked up that interest rates have 
not fallen and that spending on the sampl problem has been horrendous 
it may well have been the fastapproaching deadline for the new 
budget estimate that forced the presidents hand last month and 
caused his reversal on the tax question 
treasury secretary nicholas brady budget director richard 
darman and michael boskin chairman of the presidents council of 
economic advisers all dodged the question monday of just how much 
in new taxes the administration would be willing to accept to close 
the yawning budget gap saying that issue would have to be 
addressed as part of the budget negotiations with congress 
but in addition to offering the stark numbers the 
administration seemed to be proposing the outline of a possible 
agreement monday 
the budget document estimated the deficit both with sampl spending 
counted against grammrudman target and not counted while darman 
insisted that the administration was not taking a stand on this 
issue the administration seemed to be signalling a willingness to 
support an accounting change that will not count sampl spending 
against the grammrudman targets 
that would still leave 100 billion in deficit reductions needed 
to meet the 1991 grammrudman limit of 64 billion 
boskin said a deficit fix of that magnitude could well tip the 
country into a recession but the administration also warned that 
anything less than 50 billion to 55 billion in deficit cuts would 
not be viewed as a credible attack on the budget problem 
thus the administration appeared to signal a willingness to 
accept a spending and tax package totalling 50 billion to 55 
billion while removing sampl costs from the grammrudman accounting 
and raising the grammrudman target for 1991 and following years 
that law whose targets were stretched out once before in 1987 now 
calls for a balanced budget by 1993 
despite the fact that the budget negotiations have been going 
nowhere for weeks darman expressed hope monday that a deal could 
be reached before congress leaves for its august recess 
he said the negotiators had come perhaps 60 percent to 70 
percent of the way toward striking a deal 
the unfortunate thing is that the last 30 or 40 percent of the 
way is all of the hard stuff thats where the really tough choices 
have to be made darman said

the head of soviet television and radio said 
monday he fears an orgy of democracy now that mikhail s 
gorbachev has acted to loosen controls on the state broadcasting 
monopoly 
mikhail f nenashev the chief of gostelradio and a communist 
party traditionalist said in an interview broadcast on soviet tv 
that the decree issued by gorbachev sunday will make managing 
television much more complex than in the past 
gorbachevs presidential decree on democratization of 
television and radio is designed to cut back on the communist 
partys monopoly on the airwaves 
the decree recognizes the need to determine a legal basis for 
the activities of television and radio broadcasting under new 
conditions and recommended that parliament adopt appropriate 
laws apparently corresponding to the press law passed june 12 
that law gave nongovernment and nonparty groups the right to 
own and operate newspapers and magazines ending what effectively 
had been a decadesold monopoly held by communist authorities 
growing democracy within the country requires a cardinal 
change in the nature of the countrys television and radio 
broadcasting said the decree which also was carried by the 
state news agency tass 
the guidelines for radio and television currently are set by a 
state committee 
until now only groups approved by the committee had access to 
soviet television as a result the communist party received large 
segments of time on the airwaves 
the decree emphasized the inadmissibility of monopolizing air 
time by this or that party political current or group tass 
reported 
for a lasting time the television was under the party 
influence what we used to call and still call the party 
monopoly said nenashev who formerly held the post of head of 
the state publishing committee 
now i am more afraid of an orgy of democracy rather than the 
party monopoly when the monopoly is replaced by numerous demands 
put forth by various groups parties various councils various 
organs he said 
hundreds of new groups have sprung up throughout the country in 
the last several years 
a spokesman for democratic platform a group of radical 
reformers in the communist party who have announced that they are 
leaving the party praised the decree 
as a whole we regard this as a very positive and radical 
decree said vladimir filin he said democratic platform would 
work to gain access to new channels but said the group did not 
have the financial or technical means to start its own 
im afraid its going to be tough to get quick access to 
television on the strength of the decree said vladimir 
zhirinovsky chairman of the liberal democratic party which he 
claims has 12000 members registered across the country 
zhirinovsky said since the press law was passed in june putting 
out his newspaper has become much easier in general because he 
has the right to publish it as a person rather than a party 
as to the presidential decree on broadcasting i see it as a 
very good thing though i am afraid that lowlevel holdover 
apparatchiks in the moscow city council will definitely try to 
delay the process should my party apply for tv coverage 
zhirinovsky said 
lets see how this decree will be realized he added 
in addition to stubborn bureaucrats the many new parties also 
lack the money to buy time on soviet central television let alone 
set up their own tv or radio station 
in the baltic states and other republics at odds with moscow 
over their status within the soviet union elected governments have 
declared that local radio and television stations belong to them 
however the decree emphasizes control by the soviet government 
over the legal status of radio and television stations in the 
republics

the parliament of the ukraine the soviet unions 
second most populous republic followed sovereignty decrees by 
other republics and overwhelmingly declared monday that its laws 
take precedence over national law 
the proindependence political movement rukh said the 
sovereignty declaration was far more radical than one adopted in 
the russian republic stating the ukraine has the right to set up 
its own armed forces currency citizenship and banking system in 
the republic of 50 million residents 
the supreme soviet parliament meeting in the capital of kiev 
declared the supremacy independence absolute authority and 
indivisibility of ukrainan authority on the republics territory 
the tass news agency said 
it also called for the ukraines independence and equal rights 
in external relations 
its youth cannot perform military service outside the republic 
without parliaments permission the declaration said it sets a 
goal of establishing a constantly neutral government which does 
not take part in military blocs and opposes the production 
proliferation and use of nuclear weapons according to tass 
the interfax news service said the vote was 3554 in favor of 
the sovereignty declaration with one abstention 
anatoly shibiko a senior official of rukh said he was 
surprised the communist faction in the parliament supported the 
declaration 
we expected them to kill it today after returning from the 
congress in moscow shibiko said referring to the 28th communist 
party congress but now i see that communists want independence 
too wishing to keep their power 
the parliament set july 16 as a public holiday in the ukraine 
in its declaration the ukraine followed other republics such as 
russia the baltic states of lithuania estonia and latvia 
uzbekistan and moldavia that passed decrees seeking more 
independence from central authority lithuania began the 
independence movement with its march 11 declaration 
soviet georgia also favors sovereignty and last month 
established a commission to work toward independence 
some ukrainian nationalists support total independence for their 
republic a key industrial and farming region but the movement is 
not as far advanced as it is in other soviet republics such as the 
baltics 
the debate over sovereignty in the supreme soviet of the ukraine 
had caused sharp disagreements and last week led indirectly to the 
resignation of the republics president vladimir ivashko who then 
was chosen the deputy head of the soviet communist party 
ivashko and other deputies to the ukrainian supreme soviet were 
called back last week from the party congress for the debate on 
sovereignty 
ivashko refused to go however and turned in his resignation 
he said he interpreted his dispute with the parliament over the 
issue as indicating that he did not have enough authority to govern 
the republic 
the same day he was nominated to be soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachevs communist party deputy and he was elected easily

an israeli human rights group accused soldiers 
of an itchy trigger finger in dealing with the palestinian 
uprising and said monday that unclear firing orders resulted in 
hundreds of unnecessary deaths 
the army spokesmans office criticized the 60page report by 
betselem saying it contains many inconsistencies and was 
haughty incriminating and onesided 
the office refused to discuss specific charges saying it could 
not comment until the supreme court rules on a suit filed this year 
challenging the armys orders in the occupied territories 
according to figures compiled by the associated press israeli 
soldiers or civilians have killed 723 palestinians during the 
31monthold rebellion against israeli occupation of the west bank 
and gaza strip 
an additional 236 palestinians were killed by fellow arabs most 
on suspicion of collaboration with israeli authorities fortyfive 
israelis have died in the violence 
the betselem report said shootings by soldiers accounted for 
the overwhelming majority of fatalities and that there were 
hundreds of cases in which death could have been averted 
it blamed unclear firing regulations saying they led to a 
tangle of interpretations on when and how weapons can be used 
betselem also known as the israeli information center for human 
rights in the occupied territories was founded by liberal israeli 
legislators academics and lawyers to investigate human rights 
problems in the occupied lands amnesty international is among the 
international groups which have cited its findings 
the facts evoke an image of an itchy trigger finger a lax 
observance of regulations the absence of exhaustive investigations 
and a failure to mete out deterring and educational punishment 
betselem reported 
it said these suggest legitimacy is conferred on unjustified 
firing and violation of the law 
the report was especially critical of army handling of 
palestinian demonstrations in which most deaths have occurred 
army orders require soldiers to fire at a demonstrators legs 
and to shoot to kill only if the soldiers life is threatened 
the report said just one of the nine soldiers killed during the 
uprising died during a riot 
these figures show that no direct correlation exists between 
the intensity of the danger to life and the circumstances in which 
soldiers may open fire it said 
it also criticized army use of plastic bullets for punishment 
and deterrence calling this an extremely grave and wholly 
improper usage 
the army introduced plastic bullets in july 1988 trying to 
reduce fatalities it says the bullets are not lethal when fired 
from at least 230 feet 
betselem said at least 128 palestinians have been killed with 
plastic ammunition 
brig gen amnon strasnov the armys chief legal officer told 
israel radio the army takes every step to decrease the number of 
deaths and injuries and said plastic bullets resulted in a 
significant decrease in deaths 
he noted that 122 soldiers have faced courtsmartial proceedings 
during the uprising 41 for illegal killing causing death or 
illegal use of firearms most were found guilty he said 
but betselem said only two soldiers have been tried for 
manslaughter during the uprising 
dedi zucker a founder of betselem and a parliament member from 
the leftwing citizens rights movement told a news conference in 
tel aviv on sunday the findings suggest the army should adopt 
regulations closer to those used by police 
police must exhaust nonlethal riot controls measures such as 
tear gas and rubber bullets and face lifethreatening situations 
before they can get commanders permission to fire lethal weapons 
zucker observed that jerusalem is under police jurisdiction he 
noted it has seen considerably less violence and fewer people 
killed than towns in the west bank and gaza where the army 
functions 
he said the police have adopted totally different criteria 
and with much more success the army should adopt the police 
criteria

here is the statement by west 
german chancellor helmut kohl during a live news conference monday 
from the soviet union on the results of his talks with soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev 
mr president ladies and gentlemen this press conference 
concludes a twoday encounter between president gorbachev and 
myself an encounter that i think in the history of 
germansoviet relations produced a new high point that covers the 
depth and the intensity of our talks in moscow in the airplane and 
here in the homeland of president gorbachev i understand this 
invitation in his homeland as a very special gesture our talks 
were marked by the greatest openness and mutual understanding and 
personal sympathy 
but what was special in the significance of this encounter lies 
in the results 
we are in agreement that in central issues broadranging 
progress could be reached 
this breakthrough was possible because both sides are aware that 
in germany and in europe and in the soviet union historical 
transformations are taking place that also places special 
responsibility on us 
as for the results of the talks i can note 
president gorbachev and i are clear that the germansoviet 
relationship is of central importance for the future of our peoples 
and for the fate of europe we agreed to conclude immediately 
after the unification of germany a comprehensive and fundamental 
bilateral treaty that regulates our relationship on a longterm and 
goodneighborly basis such a treaty should include all areas 
political relationships as well as the security of both sides 
economy culture science and technology visitor exchanges as well 
as many other things the goal of this is to bring our relationship 
on the basis of stability verifiability trust for the future 
our talks served to clarify basic questions that are being 
negotiated in the framework of the twoplusfour talks we have 
stressed the agreement that was reached at the meeting of the six 
foreign ministers at the twoplusfour talks in june in berlin 
namely that the twoplusfour talks should be concluded in a time 
frame so that the results can be presented to the csce summit in 
november in paris i can today with satisfaction and agreement with 
president gorbachev state 
1 the unification of germany comprises the federal republic of 
germany the german democratic republic and berlin 
2 when unification is accomplished the rights of the four 
powers and responsibilities will be completely removed so that a 
unified germany at the time of its unification receives its full 
and unrestricted sovereignty 
thirdly a unified germany in exercising its unrestricted 
sovereignty freely and by itself decide if and which alliances it 
wants to belong to that conforms with the csce final act i have 
explained the view of the government of the federal republic of 
germany that the unified germany would like to be a member of the 
nato alliance and i am sure that this is in accordance with the 
view of the german democratic republic 
4 the unified germany concludes with the soviet union a 
bilateral treaty to carry out the withdrawal of soviet troops from 
the german democratic republic that should be concluded within 
three to four years at the same time we should conclude a 
transitional treaty with the soviet union that would cover the 
consequences of the introduction of the deutsche mark in the german 
democratic republic within this time period from three to four 
years 
5 as long as the soviet troops remain stationed on the former 
territory the german democratic republic the nato structures will 
not be extended to this part of germany the immediate application 
of article 5 and 6 of the nato treaty remains from the beginning 
undisturbed unintegrated units of the bundeswehr the west german 
army that means units of the territorial defense can be 
stationed immediately after unification on the territory of the 
german democratic republic and berlin for the period of the 
presence of soviet troops on the former territory of the german 
democratic republic troops from the three western powers should 
stay in berlin after unity according to our concept the federal 
west german government will ask the three western powers about 
this and will seek to conclude agreements with respective 
governments to regulate the stationing of the troops in berlin 
7 the federal republic of germany declares itself ready during 
the period of the vienna negotiations to give a declaration of its 
commitment to reduce the level of the armed forces of a unified 
germany from a period of three to four years to 370000 men the 
reduction should come into force the day the first vienna agreement 
takes effect 
8 a unified germany will renounce the production storage and 
use of abc chemical weapons and remain member of the nuclear 
nonproliferation treaty 
ladies and gentlemen this joint agreement is a very good 
starting point now to be able to conclude successfully and in time 
the external aspects of german unity within the framework of the 
twoplusfour talks

a whale that got tangled in a 
fishing net was freed monday by scientists who rushed to its aid 
aboard a flotilla of research boats and private craft 
its swimming free into the sunset said tom hill captain 
of the yankee captains out of gloucester as the 25ton mammal 
spouted and splashed out into the open sea 
the fiveyearold 40footlong humpback had been tangled for 
most of the day in a fishing net 
the humpback nicknamed mallard by whale watchers was 
discovered thrashing in the water 17 miles off massachusetts 
rescuers could clearly hear trumpeting through the breathing 
hole atop its head as it fought the net and rope running through 
its mouth and around its body 
its a sign of antagonism or anxiety scientist steven 
frohock said of the sound as he waited with others for the whale to 
tire so it could be approached 
rescue workers attached buoys to the trailing ends of the net 
wrapped around mallard hoping the additional drag would tire the 
whale forcing it to rest on the surface 
thirty to 40 other whales humpbacks and finbacks circled and 
fed in the area keeping a safe distance from the boats but one 
whale apparently hearing mallards cries came up along side the 
entangled mammal and rubbed its head 
leading a crew of four rescuers late in the afternoon charles 
stormy mayo head of the center for coastal studies in 
provincetown mass approached the whales in two inflatable 
motorboats a few minutes before 5 pm after more than an hour of 
effort they managed to free mallard from the plastic net at one 
point mayos boat nearly overturned when mallard reared its head 
mayo clad in a wetsuit got into the water at one point a risky 
move 
hill a 10year veteran of whalewatching trips said the 
rescuers would only in the most extreme circumstances get into the 
water to help the whale 
one swoop of a flipper and they could be dead he said 
the whale was caught in a gill net set along the seafloor on the 
stellwagen bank to catch tuna and other fish 
the area is frequented by whalewatching boats of by 
massachusetts companies that earn their keep by taking humans to 
watch their animal cousins feed and frolic rather than harpooning 
them as in the old days 
the mission set off monday from gloucester and across cape cod 
bay from provincetown mass after a fisherman radioed that he was 
awakened in the morning by a whale thrashing next to his boat the 
whale first recorded by whale watchers in 1986 was identified by 
scars and coloring on its tail and flukes or flippers 
mallard was the second tangled whale sighted in a week last 
week a whale known as quixote was spotted trailing net which the 
whales hit when diving to the bottom in search of the same fish the 
nets are designed to ensnare quixote hadnt been seen since 
thursday 
its a very precarious situation these whales arent very 
happy to have a boat on top of them said frohock chief 
scientist of yankee fleet one of the whalewatching companies 
when they start thrashing around it can be a lifeanddeath 
situation not only for the whale but also for the people trying 
to save him 
the whale sex unknown was tangled in one of the 
quartermilelong gill nets set on the stellwagen bank which is 
about 17 miles off gloucester and 25 miles from provincetown the 
bank is 25 miles long five miles wide has an average depth of 84 
feet 
the area is a prime fishing ground this time of year for tuna 
but it is also where fishermen catch haddock pollock codfish and 
some of the smaller species of whiting and red fish whales too 
come there for about half the year to feed 
lt glenn miller the us coast guards fisheries coordination 
officer in boston described gill nets as similar to freestanding 
chainlink fence about eight feet height and sitting on the ocean 
floor the bottom edge is weighted with lead and the upper edge has 
plastic floats to keep the net upright

barbara bush choked back tears monday as she 
told a group of foster grandparents that more volunteers are needed 
because so many babies are born with aids or addicted to drugs 
were running out of you mrs bush told the 26 volunteers 
who came to washington on an expensepaid trip to mark the 25th 
anniversary of actions foster grandparent program 
weve got to get more help because unfortunately the boarder 
babies and the babies that need you are multiplying the first 
lady said sounding a somber note during the otherwise festive 
ceremony 
so weve got to work on both ends weve got to stop them from 
being abandoned and born with aids and cokerelated problems she 
said her voice faltering 
she caught herself and added i see here im supposed to end 
with a very high happy note so having told you that get out and 
recruit some more and meanwhile happy anniversary and god bless 
you all 
the foster grandparent program matches lowincome men and women 
age 60 or older with mentally or physically handicapped children 
youths in juvenile detention facilities abandoned babies and 
others with special needs 
the 26 volunteers the oldest 93 years old represented the 
current 27000 foster grandparents and the more than 400000 who 
shared themselves with our children over the past 25 years as 
mrs bush put it 
the program assigns foster grandparents to children on a 
onetoone basis after 40 hours of preservice training action 
says the typical volunteer devotes two hours daily to each of two 
children 
mrs bush has visited hospitals and other facilities caring for 
infants with aids and boarder babies abandoned by 
crackaddicted mothers 
she received a peach smock from a san antonio foster 
grandparent as well as one for her husband 
on a lighter note she said we bushes love being 
grandparents weve been through it 12 times so far and its gotten 
to be a wonderful habit 
mrs bush recalled how much her children enjoyed spending time 
with the presidents mother dorothy walker bush now 89 
theyre really better people because they had the pleasure of 
her company she said all people need that special 
relationship 
im sure you have that same wonderful effect that georges 
mother had on the children whose lives you touch said mrs bush 
who was joined at the ceremony by william bennett the drug policy 
coordinator 
it was bennett who told mrs bush of the growing need for foster 
grandparents 
were going to need more foster parents and grandparents 
before the drug wars are over he told reporters and when the 
drug wars over were still going to need them because the babies 
will still be the casualties

the justice department will pay 25000 to a 
former official cleared of espionage allegations to head off a 
lawsuit over an erroneous report about the inquiry a lawyer said 
monday 
matthew l myers who represents former justice department 
official roger pilon said the government issued a private letter 
of apology last week and agreed to pay 25000 to settle the 
dispute 
pilon former director of the justice departments asylum policy 
and review unit was placed on administrative leave in 1988 when he 
and his wife juliana were investigated to determine whether they 
had passed a classified document to south african diplomats 
the investigation did not result in criminal charges and pilon 
was reinstated in his job and his topsecret security clearance was 
restored 
but the 1988 annual report of the departments internal watchdog 
unit described a different outcome when it was issued last fall 
the report by the office of professional responsibility which 
did not identify pilon by name said that the investigation found 
sufficient cause to terminate the officialss appointment 
the employee resigned prior to the initiation of removal 
proceedings said the report 
pilon acknowledged to reporters who had learned his name that he 
was the person referred to in the report but denied any wrongdoing 
he demanded an apology from the justice department which conducted 
a further inquiry into the matter 
in its july 12 letter the justice department acknowledged that 
there was confusion created by the publication of the opr 
report last fall 
assistant attorney general stuart m gerson said in the letter 
that the pilons were entitled to an apology because the 1988 
investigation of mr pilon did not produce any evidence sufficient 
to warrant his dismissal from the department 
gerson noted that pilon was restored unconditionally to his 
agency position and his subsequent resignation was selfinitiated 
and was not made in the face of removal proceedings which in fact 
never had been contemplated or ordered 
as part of the settlement gersons letter will be placed in 
justice department files along with those at the state department 
the fbi and the national security agency 
pilon said he suspects that the investigation may have begun 
after the nsa intercepted a conversation between his wife and a 
south african diplomat in new york 
at the time mrs pilon was analyzing un policies for the 
heritage foundation 
pilon says he suspects his wifes conversation with the diplomat 
was misinterpreted by eavesdroppers 
according to a chronology of the case released by pilons 
lawyer the couple were interrogated separately but simultaneously 
on jan 6 1988 by the fbi 
the pilons have maintained that the probe cost mrs pilon a 
presidential nomination to be an assistant secretary of interior 
the pilons have denied that they gave a classified state 
department report on the influence of communism in south africa to 
a south african diplomat in new york 
the fbi told the pilons they had both showed problems when 
they took polygraph tests according to the chronology but the 
couple both passed polygraph tests administered by private 
investigators 
during the investigation the chronology said the fbi agents 
told the pilons they had a high degree of confidence that the 
pilons transmitted the document and that they had other 
evidence 
but on sept 9 1988 associate deputy attorney general dee v 
benson reinstated pilon and said in a letter that no implication 
adverse to you should be taken from the investigations 
myers said the pilons had threatened to file suit unless the 
department acted decisively to correct the record and to compensate 
the pilons 
in many respects the admission of error is too little too 
late there is no reason this should have taken eight months to 
resolve when the facts are as clear as they are myers said

east germanys deposed communist leadership 
sheltered palestinian terrorists including the man believed 
responsible for killing 11 israeli athletes at the 1972 olympic 
games the interior ministry confirmed monday 
wolfgang elstner the ministrys director of police said 
factions of the palestine liberation organization teamed up with 
other terrorist groups during the late 1970s and sought to set up 
a logistical base in east germany 
he said records of the former secret police force known as the 
stasi showed a man known as abu daoud gained entry to east 
germany in 1978 and traveled to the country several times since 
then 
elstner said abu daoud tried to establish contact in east 
germany with the venezuelan terrorist known as carlos the jackal 
abu daoud is believed to be the plo terrorist who planned the 
attack on the olympic village in munich which led to deaths of 11 
israeli athletes during a terrorist shootout with police at munich 
airport 
the berliner morgenpost newspaper in west berlin reported over 
the weekend that abu daoud was sighted several times at the palast 
hotel in east berlin and was still believed to be living in east 
germany now 
on monday east germanys adn news agency published an interview 
with the hotels protocol manager reinhard hellmann who confirmed 
that abu daoud was a regular guest there daoud used the name tarek 
we had known this mr tarek for years but no one knew who 
this modest and utterly polite guest was hellmann was quoted as 
saying 
according to adn hellmann said abu daoud made a very 
cultivated impression and often discussed mideast problems with 
hotel staff he said he was very unhappy about the discord within 
the plo 
although plo chief yasser arafat also stayed at the palast 
during official visits to east berlin he and abu daoud never were 
guests at the same time hellmann was quoted as saying 
abu daoud or mahmoud daoud is a senior officer of the plo 
branch fatah many fatah people were believed to have had a hand in 
the black september terrorist group that carried out some of the 
most notorious attacks of the 1970s including the one at the 
munich olympics 
terrorist carlos whose real name is illich ramirezsanchez is 
thought responsible for the deaths of two french secret agents and 
for the dec 21 1975 attack on arab oil ministers in vienna that 
killed three of the officials 
abu daoud also sought to get in touch with anarchoterrorist 
groups from western nations said elstner who gave no specifics 
elstner said east german ports and airports were on the lookout 
for abu daoud but no arrest warrant was issued 
east germans communist rulers ousted last fall have also been 
accused of hiding red army faction terrorists from west germany 
west german news media claimed the rulers had ties with libyan 
basque and irish terrorists as well

the drug epidemic in part forced the district 
of columbia to spend more on police jails and courts than any 
state but so did footing the bill for programs states usually pay 
for city officials said monday 
a justice department report issued sunday showed the district 
had spent almost four times the national average on criminal and 
civil justice in 1988 the year a crack cocaine epidemic hit the 
city 
certainly if you are comparing the states you have to 
compare apples with apples said robert pohlman the citys 
deputy mayor for finance if you are comparing the cost of our 
local police force with a state police force youre comparing 
apples with oranges 
the study revealed the nations capital which functions as a 
local and a state government spent about 859 per resident in 1988 
for police protection courts and correctional facilities the 
national per capita average spending on justice activities by state 
and local governments that year was 218 
that figure is so high because we have to pay for the city 
jail plus the equivalent of a state correctional institution and 
halfway houses said corrections department spokeswoman pat 
wheeler no state has to pay for all of that 
wheeler said the explosion of drug use has helped drive up the 
cost of corrections in washington but mandatory sentencing laws 
have added to the price tag 
we have a high incarceration rate both because the police are 
doing a good job arresting drug dealers and because we are seeing 
an increase in the number of drug offenses that require the person 
serve time wheeler said we didnt ask for all these people 
we just lock them up 
but there is little question the citys budget reflects an 
increasing concern about stopping crime 
in fiscal 1980 the district spent 566 million to house the 
4707 inmates that spent time behind bars in the fiscal year that 
ends sept 30 the city is budgeting 237 million to house 
prisoners on monday 11487 people were behind bars 
indeed to avoid exceeding courtordered population limits at 
the citys prisons inmates now are serving sentences in state and 
federal penitentiaries as far away as washington state

president bush on monday praised soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev as a statesman for withdrawing 
objections to a united germanys membership in nato 
bush said gorbachevs action strengthens efforts to build 
enduring relationships based on cooperation 
a senior white house official called gorbachevs statement a 
big step it seems quite significant that they have said for the 
first time that they are willing to see germany unified in nato 
another administration official said gorbachevs successes at 
the recent soviet communist party congress where he strengthened 
himself politically had put him in a stronger position to allow 
full german membership in nato 
it looks like hes coming around the official said both 
officials insisting on anonymity noted there still are other 
problems facing german unity 
gorbachev announced his position in a joint statement with 
visiting west german chancellor helmut kohl 
moscows opposition to a united germany in nato had posed one of 
the biggest obstacles to german unification gorbachev had insisted 
that a unified germany be neutral or a member of both the western 
nato alliance and the sovietled warsaw pact 
however the joint statement read by kohl said a unified 
germany in exercising its unrestricted sovereignty freely and by 
itself decides if and which alliances to which it wants to 
belong 
kohl said he had told gorbachev that a united germany wants to 
be part of nato and that he was sure east germany agreed 
unified germany receives complete sovereignty gorbachev 
said 
bush in his statement said he welcomed gorbachevs remarks 
this comment demonstrates statesmanship and strengthens 
efforts to build enduring relationships based on cooperation 
bush said 
the president said gorbachevs action can be seen as a 
response perhaps in part to the outcome of the nato summit in 
london where the alliance displayed its readiness to adapt to the 
new realities in europe and reach out to former adversaries in the 
east 
secretary of state james a baker iii in paris for talks on 
germany said we have to make sure that we see exactly what was 
agreed to 
otherwise baker was extremely enthusiastic this is the right 
development for all of europe he said 
in recognition of reduced eastwest tensions nato agreed to 
tailor its nuclear and conventional forces to the rapidly shrinking 
military threat from moscow 
nato also proposed a nonaggression declaration with members of 
the warsaw pact and declared that nuclear weapons would be used 
only as a last resort 
bush said the helsinki final act which ratified the postwar 
boundaries of europe guaranteed germanys right to choose 
membership in the western alliance 
we think this solution is in the best interests of all the 
countries of europe including the soviet union bush said 
at their summit last month gorbachev had told bush that he was 
opposed to a united germany belonging to the western alliance 
however gorbachev did not challenge bush when the president said 
we are in full agreement that the matter of alliance membership 
is in accordance with the helsinki final act a matter for the 
germans to decide 
based on that administration officials began saying that 
gorbachev was leaning toward acceptance of a united germany in nato 
baker said gorbachevs move had been anticipated but not until 
later in the summer i think we should be optimistic that it 
would give significant impetus to the overall process of german 
unification he said 
baker and soviet foreign minster eduard shevardnadze will meet 
tuesday in the third in a series of talks on german unification 
the session will focus on germanys border with poland amid polish 
concerns that a reunified germany might try to recover territory it 
lost at the end of world war ii 
prior to that he will meet tuesday with west german foreign 
minister hansdietrich genscher

after a spate of recent nasa embarrassments 
the bush administration monday ordered a review by outside experts 
of the nations longterm space goals 
space continues to be a top priority for the administration 
said a statement released by the office of vice president dan 
quayle who heads the national space council we all want the 
best ideas on how we can move into the next century maintaining our 
leadership in space 
the review by an outside task force was not as drastic a measure 
as the complete restructuring of the space agency which had been 
forecast by some news media over the weekend 
contrary to some published reports there is no white house 
investigation of nasa the statement said 
quayle met for an hour monday with nasa administrator richard h 
truly their third meeting in a week 
adm truly and the task force will report their 
recommendations to the vice president the statement said but it 
was not clear whether truly would head the panel or merely appoint 
it 
truly said in a statment that he was pleased that quayle has 
expressed his confidence in nasa 
the space agencys most recent embarrassments the myopic 
hubble space telescope and a grounded space shuttle fleet have 
focused both public and congressional attention on nasa 
not since the challenger accident of 1986 which claimed the 
lives of seven crew members has the space agency been so under 
siege investigations so far have shown that the mistake in 
grinding the lenses of the 15 billion telescope would have been 
caught with proper testing 
after challenger nasa appointed an internal investigating 
board but president reagan also appointed a 13member commission 
of experts headed by former secretary of state william p rogers 
which held hearings and published its voluminous findings 
the commission called the challenger explosion an accident 
rooted in history and was highly critical of nasa for lax 
oversight poor internal communications and pressures to launch 
nearly all the officials who ran nasa at the time of challenger 
are gone from the agency 
there were a number of outside investigations by congress and by 
a panel of the national research council which also oversaw the 
redesign of the shuttles faulty booster rockets 
congress has been upset by the hubble fiasco and by the 
concurrent hydrogen leaks that caused nasa to halt all shuttle 
flights 
sen barbara mikulski dmd chairwoman of the senate 
appropriations subcommittee that has oversight responsibility for 
nasa summoned truly and former administrator james beggs to a 
hearing wednesday 
beggs had charge of the space agency a decade ago when the 
telescope was built 
the problems come at a particularly bad time for nasa which has 
had 10 successful shuttle missions since the challenger explosion 
and a spate of spectacular successes with probes to the planets 
their plate is quite full and its a very stressful time for 
nasa said rep bob traxler dmich chairman of the house 
subcommittee that oversees the space and science budget 
nasa needs congressional support to continue the 32 billion 
space station scheduled for a critical design review this year a 
planned earth study called mission to planet earth and the 
presidents announced goal of a permanent manned base on the moon 
and an expedition to mars 
rep michael andrews dtexas was critical of the decision to 
name a blueribbon panel 
what is needed is a definition of where we are going in 
space said andrews whose district includes the johnson space 
center we dont need another commission to start defining those 
goals once again 
quayle discussed the problems with truly twice last week once 
aboard air force two as he returned from the economic summit in 
houston white house chief of staff john sununu took part in the 
airborne talks 
space news a weekly industry newspaper forecast in mondays 
edition that a restructuring of nasa was in the works because of 
concern that a lack of public support for space and federal 
budget pressures make it difficult for nasa to carry out its 
missions and that the white house was concerned the problems are 
institutional rather than technical

of working to steer city contracts to his company and to the 
businesses of friends and then skimming money off the top

officials to broker contract awards and influence jobs in the 
citys human services department which rivers headed and other 
city agencies 
barry who is on trial for drug and perjury charges expressed 
delight at the verdict in clyburns case 
the us attorneys office has waged a long and underhanded 
campaign to discredit the minority business community in 
washington barry said in a statement they have failed 
if he had been convicted of all the charges against him clyburn 
would have faced a maximum penalty of 50 years in prison

andrew young predicted monday he will pick 
up the endorsement of one of his chief white rivals if tuesdays 
democratic gubernatorial primary leaves him in a runoff with lt 
gov zell miller 
young a former atlanta mayor united nations ambassador and 
congressman who is bidding to become georgias first black 
governor barnstormed the state monday as did miller and state 
sen roy barnes 
barnes campaign manager bobby kahn called youngs comment 
the height of arrogance 
the candidates were wrapping up a gentlemanly campaign free of 
negative advertising and racial appeals even former gov lester 
maddox a longtime segregationist running a longshot campaign 
deemphasized race as an issue 
young insisted he doesnt put much trust in polls which have 
shown miller and young in a close race well ahead of barnes 
but when asked who barnes might support in a runoff he was 
willing to answer 
i think hell endorse me young said 
barnes who portrays miller and young as too liberal for 
georgia stoked endorsement speculation when he bumped into young 
at a black church sunday i like andy young barnes told the 
congregation im glad to be here with him today im not too hot 
on zell miller 
but barnes said monday he had not decided to endorse anyone and 
was not conceding defeat 
andy and i have deep philosophical differences he said he 
joked im glad andys endorsing me 
in a speech at augusta miller raised the endorsement issue 
already youve got candidates wanting to make deals like its 
already over with he said well its not already over with 
the people have not spoken 
georgia law provides for the top two finishers to meet in an 
aug 7 runoff unless someone wins a majority of tuesdays votes 
some black leaders acting without youngs support have filed a 
lawsuit arguing the runoff system is unfair to blacks who make up 
about 22 percent of the states registered voters they asked us 
district judge richard freeman to declare tuesdays leader the 
democratic nominee freemans staff said he wouldnt issue a 
decision until tuesday at the earliest 
in speeches to supporters in macon and columbus young portrayed 
himself as the candidate who can pull georgians together and miller 
as a combative politician who doesnt get along with anybody 
i dont get along with people miller replied later on 
may 8 in rome georgia andy young said that if he were not running 
he would be for me for governor 
miller apparently was referring to a may 17 appearance by young 
in rome the rome newstribune reported at the time that young said 
hed vote for miller if he wasnt running himself and added i 
would say that id make a better governor but hes a great guy 
miller meanwhile reminded voters that he was the first major 
politician to endorse a state lottery and that he engineered a 
sales tax exemption for some groceries he repeated his promises to 
lift the sales tax from all groceries to open more boot camps for 
firsttime drug offenders and to cut auto insurance rates 10 
percent 
ive talked about things the people of georgia can identify 
with he told supporters in albany 
barnes continued to portray himself as the conservative 
alternative to taxandspend liberals barnes who has promised 
a tax cut also is the only major candidate who supports new 
restrictions on abortion 
as l douglas wilder did in virginia last year when he became 
the nations first elected black governor young championed 
abortion rights 
the most recent poll released last week by the atlanta 
journalconstitution found 36 percent of likely democratic voters 
favoring miller 30 percent for young and 16 percent for barnes 
state rep lauren bubba mcdonald and maddox trailed badly in 
the poll which had a margin of error of 3 points 
in tuesdays republican primary polls have shown state rep 
johnny isakson with a commanding lead 
the current governor democrat joe frank harris is completing 
his second term and cannot seek reelection 
three seats in the us house also are being contested but only 
one incumbent rep doug barnard has opposition in the primary 
barnard a democrat from augusta is a member of the house banking 
committee and has been accused by opponents of being too cozy with 
savings and loan officials he faces journalism student scott a 
starling of athens 
jb stoner a white supremacist who served time for the bombing 
of a black church in alabama is running for lieutenant governor 
but is considered the longest shot of nine candidates in the 
democratic primary

western nations on monday praised president 
mikhail s gorbachevs agreement to a united germany belonging to 
nato as being a turning point in european history and as helping 
stabilize the continent 
in britain the foreign office said the decision was an 
extremely positive development in soviet thinking 
we have throughout argued that a united germany in nato would 
be in the best interests of all those concerned the foreign 
office said in a statement 
it added that gorbachev was evidently swayed by a nato summit 
meeting in london july 56 at which the 16 leaders of western 
alliance committed themselves to limiting the size of the german 
army a prime soviet concern 
the north atlantic treaty organization leaders also offered a 
nonaggression pact to the soviet union and other east european 
countries and relegated nuclear arms to weapons of last resort 
france a major west european power that belongs to nato but 
keeps its military forces outside the nato command made no 
immediate comment foreign minister roland dumas said he was 
waiting to hear the news personally from west german foreign 
minister hansdietrich genscher 
in rome an italian foreign ministry spokesman praised 
gorbachevs position 
at first glance we look on it with extreme favor said the 
spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity 
portugals defense minister fernando nogueira said portugal 
as a founder member of nato is very happy with the announcement 
austria which is not a member of nato said the agreement 
announced during a visit by west german chancellor helmut kohl to 
moscow was a historic hour for europe and for the world 
the long journey of european history in this century has 
reached a very positive station said austrian chancellor franz 
vranitzky it is the foundation for building a peaceful 
europe 
sweden another nonnato member said the agreement should also 
calm soviet fears about german military might 
the soviet union endured the heaviest casualties of any nation 
in world war ii about 20 million people killed 
we should not forget that for gorbachev it means security that 
germany is in nato swedish prime minister ingvar carlsson told 
the swedish news agency tt 
the soviet union paid a high price in the struggle against 
nazi germany and it has probably been regarded positive that 
germany is with nato with the wider responsibility which the 
united states and other nato countries have 
nato in a statement from its brussels headquarters said 
gorbachevs acceptance of a unified germany in the western alliance

imelda marcos facing a welter of legal problems 
despite her acquittal on federal fraud charges hired her former 
codefendants attorney monday to represent her in future court 
proceedings 
james p linn who successfully defended saudi arabian financier 
adnan khashoggi in the case that ended july 2 said he agreed to 
take over all legal affairs of the former philippine first lady 
in a telephone interview mrs marcos said she was urged to hire 
linn by gerry spence the wyoming attorney who represented her in 
the fraud trial earning a 5 million fee 
the justice department has ordered mrs marcos to testify sept 
25 before a federal grand jury in pittsburgh investigating a 
nuclear power plant built in the philippines by the westinghouse 
electric co 
the plant was built in the early 1980s when mrs marcos late 
husband ferdinand marcos was president but was never operated 
because of alleged safety concerns 
it is also the subject of a civil suit against westinghouse by 
the present philippine government which claims the marcoses 
accepted kickbacks in exchange for allowing construction of the 
plant 
mrs marcos said over the weekend that she had no knowledge of 
the case and no papers concerning the plant linn said mrs marcos 
would testify unless the government advised her that she is a 
target of the criminal investigation 
mrs marcos also is involved in a number of civil cases in which 
the government of president corazon aquino seeks to recover 
millions of dollars allegedly stolen by marcos during his 20 years 
in power 
in the fraud case the federal court jury rejected the 
prosecutions claim that mrs marcos participated in her husbands 
financial dealings or that khashoggi had falsified documents to 
help the marcoses conceal their holdings in new york real estate 
and artworks 
linn a former west texas prosecutor who now lives in oklahoma 
city led khashoggis defense team and will command a 
multimilliondollar fee for representing mrs marcos 
like spences fee the costs will be paid by tobacco heiress 
doris duke a friend of mrs marcos linn said neither linn nor 
mrs marcos would divulge the amount 
she said the change in lawyers had nothing to do with the 
controversy that swirled around spence who triggered numerous 
rebukes from us district judge john f keenan during the trial 
mr spence had to go back to wyoming where he has three 
criminal cases and he suggested mr linn to take over all our 
cases mrs marcos said mr spence was a good lawyer and it 
takes a lawyer to know another good one 
in another development the aquino goverment which has barred 
mrs marcos return apparently wants to keep her halfsister a 
roman catholic nun out of the country as well 
in a cable filed july 11 the philippine foreign ministry asked 
the philippine mission to the united nations to add dulce 
romualdez known in her religious order as sister bellarmine to a 
holdorder list 
if carried out the instruction would mean that sister 
bellarmine could not obtain a visa to return to the philippines 
spokesmen for the philippine consulate here said they hadnt 
seen the order 
sister bellarmine was among the coterie of 50 or so marcos 
supporters who attended the 10week trial she has lived with mrs 
marcos since shortly before ferdinand marcos died last september

iraq freed british nurse daphne parish from a 
baghdad prison in a surprise move monday after she served four 
months of a 15year sentence for helping a journalist who was 
hanged as a spy 
britain hailed the release and said it hoped this was a turning 
point in the two countries checkered relations 
mrs parish 53 freed after pleas from president kenneth kaunda 
of zambia flew in a private jet to lusaka capital of that 
southern african nation zambian officials and iraqi diplomats 
presented the smiling nurse with a bouquet of red and yellow roses 
she was driven from the airport in a luxury car to spend the night 
at kaundas official residence

saddam hussein decided to release mrs parish in response to an 
overture from president kaunda and for purely humanitarian 
reasons 
prime minister margaret thatcher expressed delight at mondays 
development and was grateful to presidents saddam and kaunda a 
thatcher spokesman said 
mrs parish was arrested in september after driving farzad 
bazoft an iranianborn reporter for the london newspaper the 
observer to the aliskandaria military installation outside baghdad

before leaving iraq saying her treatment in prison was good and 
she was grateful to saddam and kaunda

bumpy with iraq for historical reasons are aimed in the right 
direction again he said

bound for baghdad officials said the parts ordered from british 
companies could be used to make a super gun capable of hurling 
shells as far as israel

follow up mrs parishs release by freeing british businessman ian 
richter who is serving a life sentence in iraq after being 
convicted of bribery three years ago

incredible said her daughter michelle de vries 22 who

a partnership made a formal bid monday on a 5 
billion highspeed train system that would whisk riders from 
southern california to the casinos of the strip in little more than 
an hour 
the partnership headed by bechtel international inc of san 
francisco proposed the first commercial use of magnetically 
levitated trains that would run up to 300 mph on an about 270mile 
line between las vegas and anaheim 
the bid for exclusive franchise rights was hailed as a milestone 
for the project which was first proposed in 1979 
we feel we are about to revolutionize ground transportation in 
the united states said arnie adamsen chairman of the 
californianevada super speed train commission we believe we 
have overcome the last true hurdle in bringing this system into 
being 
bechtel officials gave the commission a 500000 deposit along 
with a threeinchthick proposal that calls for a twoway train 
that would glide atop an elevated guideway running alongside 
existing highways between the two metropolitan areas 
the train could have commuter stops in southern california and 
bechtel proposed possible spurs that could also eventually link the 
system to palmdale palm springs riverside and santa ana 
if bechtel gets financing and overcomes other obstacles 
construction would begin in 1993 with the system up and running 
four years later 
we see this as a pilot system that will be the first part of a 
network that will eventually encompass the southwest and the 
nation said erv koenig a bechtel vice president 
the train would follow interstate 15 from las vegas to southern 
california where it would run alongside the santa ana river 
channel into a final destination at anaheim stadium south of los 
angeles 
but the project faces enormous hurdles including its huge price 
tag and uncertainty over whether it would attract enough riders to 
be profitable since the mid1980s the estimated cost of the 
project has risen from 25 billion to 51 billion 
bechtel is gambling not only that it can raise the huge amount 
of money needed to privately finance the system but also on the 
use of maglev technology 
the maglev system which uses a magnetic field to propel the 
train and to elevate it one to four inches above the guideway is 
being tested in west germany but has not entered commercial use 
before deciding whether to actually build the train bechtel 
plans to spend about 16 months on ridership studies 
a ridership survey done for the commission said an anaheim to 
las vegas run would get a 65 million round trip passengers a year 
paying 110 a ticket 
the idea of a speedy train linking las vegas with the southern 
california market that provides most of it 18 million tourists each 
year was first raised in 1979 by thenmayor bill briare 
the train commission was established in 1988 after a study 
showed the project was feasible

the soviet union on monday dropped its objection 
to a united germanys membership in nato clearing one of the most 
difficult remaining hurdles to german unification 
president mikhail s gorbachev and west german chancellor helmut 
kohl announced the agreement in a televised news conference from 
gorbachevs home region stavropol in southern russia the area was 
one of the deepest points of german penetration during world war ii 
the announcement capped several months of intense diplomatic 
maneuvering during which germany backed a 3 billion bank loan to 
moscow and pushed its allies for a comprehensive plan to bail out 
the crumbling soviet economy 
the agreement reached in just two days of talks in moscow and 
at a country home in arkhyz in the caucasus mountains made it 
likely the two german states could complete unification by december 
a unified germany in exercising its unrestricted sovereignty 
freely and by itself decides if and which alliances to which it 
wants to belong kohl said reading a joint statement 
he said he had told gorbachev a united germany wants to be part 
of nato and that he was sure east germany agreed 
unified germany receives complete sovereignty gorbachev 
told the news conference it has the right to use this 
sovereignty to make its choice meaning its variant of social 
development and meaning what it would like to be a part of what 
blocs to support 
in washington president bush praised gorbachevs remarks 
this comment demonstrates statesmanship and strengthens 
efforts to build enduring relationships based on cooperation 
bush said in a written statement 
the british foreign office called the soviet change an 
extremely positive development in soviet thinking 
kohl and gorbachev also reached agreement on other contentious 
issues 
they agreed to begin negotiations on the complete withdrawal of 
soviet soldiers from what is now east german territory the 
approximately 380000 soldiers should be withdrawn in three to four 
years they said 
the army of a united germany during the same period will be 
reduced to 370000 soldiers currently the two germanys have about 
600000 men under arms 480000 in the west 
no nato forces will be stationed on the territory of what is 
now east germany while soviet forces still are there but german 
soldiers not integrated into the nato command may be stationed 
there as soon as unification is completed 
the rights of the four victorious world war ii powers france 
the united states britain and the soviet union will cease 
immediately upon unification such rights include military patrols 
and control of air traffic in berlin but western forces may remain 
in berlin as long as soviet soldiers stay in any part of the 
country 
kohl had been expected to make some progress on the nato issue 
in his talks with gorbachev but had not been expected to be able 
to wrap up the entire agreement during this visit the second to 
moscow since february 
although there are no such guarantees in the agreement 
gorbachev said the soviet union hopes that after it withdraws from 
east german territory nuclear weapons will not appear foreign 
soldiers will not appear so that the budding trust the 
responsibility we have toward each other and toward europeans can 
be preserved 
the soviet union says that more than 20 million of its citizens 
died as a result of the german invasion in world war ii and for 
years afterwards worries about a new german threat were cultivated 
in the soviet media 
as the two german states raced toward reunification after the 
collapse last fall of the hardline east german government led by 
erich honnecker soviet objections to nato membership had remained 
one of the main obstacles 
east germany had been one of the linchpins of the sovietled 
warsaw pact and one of moscows main trading partners 
the soviet union first demanded that a unified germany be 
neutral then recently approved the idea of an unspecified 
associate membership in the north atlantic treaty organization 
that position was rejected by west germany and its allies they 
had insisted that germany be a full nato member 
the united states argued that a united germany would present 
less of a threat to the soviet union if it was anchored in the 
western alliance 
recently the warsaw pact has announced its intention to 
transform itself from a military to a political organization nato 
responded at its london summit by reducing its reliance on nuclear 
weapons reviewing the size of its forces and its military strategy 
kohl said the two governments would work out an agreement on the 
details of the withdrawal of soviet soldiers from east germany and 
on the introduction of the west german mark into what is now east 
germany during the withdrawal 
the soviet union is concerned about the financial status of its 
army on german soil it has had agreements with east german 
concerning the convertibility of its currency but has none with 
west germany 
east germany began using the west german mark earlier this 
month and theoretically this could leave soviet soldiers in east 
germany without money

radical palestinian leader abul abbas has 
torpedoed a plo plan aimed at reviving its dialogue with 
washington suspended last month after an attack on israel by his 
guerrillas senior plo sources said monday 
the officials speaking by telephone from tunis on condition of 
anonymity said that under a compromise proposed by egyptian 
foreign minister esmat abdelmeguid abbas whose real name is 
mohammed abbas would resign from the palestine liberation 
organizations ruling executive committee 
washington would then resume the dialogue with the plo through 
ambassador robert pelletreau jr in tunis and within a few weeks 
elevate the level of contacts the sources said 
but abbas leader of the palestine liberation front one of nine 
guerrilla factions in the plo under chairman yasser arafat 
rejected the proposal the sources said 
arafats in a corner a senior plo official said by 
telephone if he acts against abul abbas hell appear to be 
bowing to america and incense the radicals in the movement even 
further if he doesnt the dialogue will remain severed 
in washington state department spokesman richard boucher said 
we have stated very clearly what we think has to happen before we 
can resume the dialogue those things have not changed 
president bush suspended the 18monthold dialogue june 20 after 
arafat made no apparent move to punish abbas as washington demanded 
egyptian president hosni mubarak said june 28 that his 
government was trying to mediate a resumption of the dialogue 
egyptian foreign ministry sources confirmed that the effort is 
still under way 
the united states agreed to talk to the plo after arafat 
publicly renounced terrorism and recognized israel in december 
1988 the americans had refused any contacts with the plo until 
arafat met those conditions 
the dialogue was at the time seen as a major breakthrough in the 
tortuous middle east peace process but israel opposed it as did 
many palestinian radicals inside and outside the plo 
in the may 30 attack libyanbased plf guerrillas in rubber 
boats tried to land at a beach near tel aviv israeli forces 
intercepted them killing four guerrillas and capturing 12 there 
were no israeli casualties 
arafats renunciation of terrorism involved halting attacks on 
civilians but not necessarily on military targets 
abbas said the guerrillas were aiming for a military target in 
israel even though they landed on a civilian beach 
the sources said abbas was to have submitted his resignation at 
a meeting of the plos central council scheduled for july 18 in 
baghdad capital of iraq when he refused to do so during the 
weekend the plo postponed the meeting 
the plfs chief spokesman in baghdad where abbas has his main 
offices said when asked if his leader planned to resign this is 
a baseless report 
its a fabricated story by the united states and its 
cronies hussein elabid said 
the central council is an 80seat minilegislature its members 
are drawn from the 450seat palestine national council the plos 
parliamentinexile 
the central council oversees implementation of resolutions 
passed by the pnc which usually meets once a year to map out plo 
strategy and elect the executive committee 
the central council has no power to dismiss any of the 15 
members of the executive committee members if one tenders his 
resignation the council can accept it but cannot appoint a 
replacement

year with 2 million people medellin is colombias secondlargest 
city after the capital of bogota and is home to the medellin drug 
cartel

bombings and assassinations

sicarios but also all the young people who form part of the 
subculture of violence gaviria said

was a longterm problem requiring international cooperation to 
reduce drug consumption and help cocaineproducing countries find

for the first time in nearly three decades 
los angeles area residents monday rode a commuter train to their 
downtown offices 
on the systems first business day the long beachtolos 
angeles trains carried at least 10000 riders who used tickets 
given away free the 22mile system started saturday with a gala 
attracting thousands 
they had their little briefcases and were reading their papers 
on the way in said sheriffs lt jim holts with transit 
security it is an unusual sight in los angeles 
among the commuters was ken mattfeld of long beach who normally 
takes the bus to work 
the train is a lot more civilized than the bus said 
mattfeld i think ill stick with this 
throughout the day there were no mechanical problems and only 
one security problem an apparently drunken man who couldnt figure 
out how to get off the tracks said holts 
the 877 million blue line marks the first stage of a 150mile 
rail system planned over the next century in los angeles an 
ambitious effort to pry southern californians from their beloved 
exhaustbelching cars 
the 10 billion system includes the 13 billion metro rail 
subway where a fire erupted friday in a maintenance tunnel under 
construction and closed part of the busy hollywood freeway overhead 
only two lanes were open on the artery through the citys heart 
but traffic was light throughout the morning rush hour said margie 
tiritilli a spokeswoman for the state transportation department 
the blue line is the first lightrail service from long beach to 
los angeles since the pacific electric red cars stopped operating 
in 1961 but the technologically advanced blue line bears little 
resemblance to its noisy ancestor 
the blue lines sleek japanesebuilt overheadpowered cars move 
quietly each 87footlong airconditioned car can hold 230 people 
the large percentage of blue line commuters monday pleased 
officials with the los angeles county transportation commission 
which built the line 
but officials noted the true test comes aug 1 when tickets go 
on sale for 110 and in the next six months to a year when the 
systems novelty wears off 
its going to be a very long slow process to convince the los 
angeles motorist to give up his automobile and gridlocked freeways 
and give these trains a chance said transportation commission 
spokeswoman stephanie brady

the justice department said monday a florida 
savings and loan association had agreed to pay more than 18 
million to settle charges that it falsely billed the department of 
education for student loans 
the settlement calls for florida federal savings bank of st 
petersburg to pay 1789 million in restitution in addition the 
thrift must pay 150000 to release most bank officers and 
employees from liability the justice department said 
florida federal and one of its former officers were convicted 
may 2 of 43 counts of mail fraud conspiracy and filing false 
claims the thrift was fined 215 million which is separate from 
the sum agreed to in mondays civil settlement 
the department said in a statement that florida federal had 
falsely claimed it had attempted to collect delinquent student 
loans 
because florida federal made little or no attempt to collect 
the loans it issued thousands of students were unfairly tagged as 
delinquent borrowers part of this settlement insures that they 
will be vindicated said stuart m gerson assistant attorney 
general in charge of the departments civil division said in a 
statement 
as part of the settlement florida federal agreed to correct the 
credit records of students against whom it had reported adverse 
information in addition to sending letters to credit bureaus the 
institution must advertise in local newspapers its willingness to 
correct credit ratings the agency said 
the department said the areas covered by the newspaper 
advertising will be st petersburg tampa orlando tallahassee 
gainesville and pensacola 
florida federal will pay a majority of the 1789 million by 
agreeing not to accept legitimate reimbursements from the education 
department that process which began several months ago is nearly 
complete the agency said 
in the may criminal case robert harmas former vice president 
of the institutions student loan division received a twoyear 
prison sentence 
another florida federal official james lamantia was convicted 
on 30 counts of fraud and sentenced to three years probation a 
third former official jeffrey flatten has been indicted on 25 
counts and is awaiting trial 
florida federal has been under the supervision of the office of 
thrift supervision for the last several months although federal 
regulators have not formally assumed control

the bush administration is prepared to 
open a dialogue with soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs 
sharpest critics if they form a legitimate noncommunist 
opposition secretary of state james a baker iii said monday 
boris n yeltsin president of the russian federated republic 
led the gorbachev foes who quit the communist party during the 28th 
party congress in moscow last week and began forming a national 
opposition coalition 
baker said it wasnt clear whether yeltsin and the others who 
quit the party are going to develop any kind of multiparty 
democracy 
we dont know yet if that is going to happen baker said 
if it does happen we ought to approach it as we have in other 
countries 
baker expects to get a report on the congress during a meeting 
wednesday in paris with soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze 
on tuesday baker and shevardnadze will participate in the third 
in a series of talks on german unification the session will focus 
on germanys border with poland amid polish concerns that a 
reunified germany might try to recover territory it lost at the end 
of world war ii 
polish foreign minister krystof skubiszewski said in paris on 
monday that his government agrees that german unification must 
precede a treaty dealing with the germanpolish border 
skubiszewski said poland would not insist that such a treaty be 
in place before the four world war ii victors the united states 
great britain france and the soviet union relinquish control 
over germany 
earlier poland had demanded the four occupying powers retain 
their rights over germany until the treaty is completed 
baker said the bush administration would like to see german 
unification move quickly but that the united states has floated 
the idea of not giving up control of the border until germany 
concludes a treaty with poland 
given european history i think it is understandable that 
there is a lot of attention focused on this issue baker said 
before a refueling stop here en route to paris 
control over berlin and the polish border are the main powers 
the four world war ii allies have retained from the 1945 victory 
agreement 
leaders of west and east germany have assured poland the border 
would be guaranteed in a treaty after unification 
bakers offer to open a dialogue with the soviet radical 
reformers who quit the communist party could enhance their stance 
the radicals who include gavril k popov head of the moscow 
government and anatoly a sobchak the leningrad city council 
leader challenged gorbachev to move faster on freemarket reforms 
they say they doubt the party is able to lead the country to 
democracy and prosperity 
baker said the good news for gorbachev at the party congress 
was that he strengthened himself politically by fending off 
conservatives who tried to slow down his liberalization programs 
the bad news for gorbachev is that the party split which 
tells the soviet people that the party has failed baker said 
as central and east european states have broken away from 
moscow baker said the bush administration has established a 
dialogue with opposition groups that showed democratic traits 
citing bulgaria as an example he said 
we have taken care to touch base with the opposition to make 
sure that we understand where the opposition is coming from that 
they understand where we are coming from and i dont think thats 
inappropriate just because its the soviet union

grass fire in northern californias rural santa clara county that 
jumped fire lines and doubled in size to more than 2000 acres by

and washington but none posed immediate threats to life or 
property 
california fire officials said they expected to have full 
containment of the blaze northeast of mount hamilton by late 
tuesday the mountain is 15 miles southeast of san jose 
right now weve got a lowpressure system causing erratic 
winds and fire behavior on all areas of the fire line so thats 
going to be another problem for us said state forestry spokesman 
chris morgan 
temperatures were in the mid90s with 1012 mph winds and 
efforts to contain the blaze were further hampered by rugged 
terrain and dry brush he said 
the blaze was 65 percent contained on monday but morgan said 
gusty winds pushed the flames over the fire line 
it doubled fairly quickly he said 
the cause of the fire which began shortly after 5 pm 
saturday still was under investigation 
only one building an uninhabited log cabin was burned 
although there are ranches in the area no homes were in danger 
outbuildings were threatened if the blaze continued to spread 
morgan said 
firefighters also controlled a 650acre brush fire near santa 
clarita in northern los angeles county monday no one was seriously 
injured and no structures were burned by the blaze that erupted 
saturday afternoon at a campground said us forest service 
spokesman robert brady 
firefighters in yellowstone national park hoped to contain one 
lightningcaused fire monday as officials watched for new fires 
park spokeswoman marsha karle said 13 firefighters remained at 
the scene of the 15acre fire monday to finish a containment line 
around the blaze the fire was 95 percent contained karle said 
firefighters had hoped to fully contain the fire sunday but 
several flareups within the containment line delayed work karle 
said 
in idaho fire bosses called in more reinforcements monday in 
their battle against a wildfire racing out of control across 120 
acres east of cascade in the boise national forest cascade is 
about 80 miles north of boise 
its expanding quite rapidly fanned by hot temperatures and 
gusting winds spokeswoman ann finkelstein said 
more than 100 firefighters were digging a line in the area about 
17 miles east of cascade and another 200 men were being moved in 
to bolster the attack 
the fire erupted sunday evening from smoldering embers left from 
a lightning strike during a storm that passed through the area last 
week 
fires triggered by lightning last week had consumed more than 
4000 acres of forests in central and eastern oregon by monday 
authorities said 
one fire grew to 935 acres monday while smoldering brush on the 
warm springs indian reservation reignited and consumed 146 acres 
a blaze near john day had destroyed 880 acres according to state 
and federal fire managers 
as many as 500 fires were started by lightning strikes wednesday 
night and about 75 fires most of them small are burning in 
oregon and washington said ralph satterberg spokesman at the 
northwest interagency coordination center in portland

republic tried to shed their hardline image monday merging with a 
sister group and renaming themselves the socialist party 
serbia largest of the six yugoslav republics had moved more 
slowly than the others toward democratic reform 
the new partys platform includes commitments to a market 
economy and multiparty democracy however it retains 
communiststyle calls for broad state ownership of businesses and 
makes no provision for freedom of the press 
the socialists also kept the communist red star as official 
party symbol 
the new union with the socialist alliance a communistrun mass 
movement originally designed to give noncommunists a forum was 
proclaimed monday at a hastily convened joint session of delegates 
from both groups 
the fusing of the two movements was first announced last month 
by serbias communist president slobodan milosevic an official 
statement then said the merger was motivated by a desire to unite 
all leftleaning forces in serbia in the face of an onslaught of 
extreme rightist anticommunist forces 
we will not be afraid of anticommunism we will fight it 
bogdan trifunovic former chief of the disbanded serbian communist 
party told the partys final congress monday the congress was 
held just before the new organization was formed with milosevic

this year held the first free elections here for local parliaments 
in 45 years centerright parties won both elections 
the states of bosnia montenegro and macedonia are due to hold 
multiparty elections this fall 
milosevic has gained great popularity in serbia for tightening 
control over the republics province of kosovo where majority 
ethnic albanians have resisted his efforts kosovo has been shaken 
by unrest for months 
leaders of serbias illegal opposition parties have denounced 
the merger as a sham intended to give communists control over the 
assets of the sister group 
serbias leadership has said it will adopt a new constitution 
before allowing the legalization of dozens of new independent 
parties and holding free elections 
also on monday a leading ethnic albanian dissident in kosovo 
said the region is seeking the status of a full yugoslav republic 
we are demanding independence within yugoslavia ibrahim 
rugova chief of the democratic union told journalists in 
pristina the provinces capital 
his group claims more than 500000 ethnic albanian members 
serbia all but abolished the autonomy of the province this 
month it considers kosovo as ancient serbian territory 
ethnic albanians make up 90 percent of the population in the 
province which borders albania

an animalrights activist was sentenced 
monday to 32 months in prison for trying to blow up an executive of 
a company that uses live dogs to demostrate surgical equipment 
fran trutt 35 pleaded no contest in april to charges of 
attempted murder possession of explosives and bomb manufacturing 
trutt of the new york city bureau of queens was accused of 
planting a sophisticated pipe bomb near the parking space of leon 
c hirsch chairman and chief executive of norwalkbased us 
surgical corp in november 1988 the bomb didnt explode 
the company uses anesthetized live dogs to show surgeons how to 
use its surgical staplers instruments which some doctors use 
instead of sutures 
superior court judge joette katz sentenced her to 10 years in 
prison for each charge the judge suspended all but 32 months of 
the sentence and trutt is due to be released march 31 because she 
has already served time while awaiting the conclusion of court 
proceedings 
katz said she felt there was no question that trutt had some 
sort of evil in her mind but said trutts intentions as well as 
accusations that the company set her up to hurt the animal rights 
movement will never be known in light of the plea 
trutt had said in interviews that she wanted to scare hirsch 
rather than kill him 
animal protection groups at first disavowed any connection to 
trutt saying they deplored violence 
but activists who have long disliked us surgical rallied 
after hearing allegations that the company had set up trutt by 
taping conversations she had with mary lou sapone 
according to trutts attorney john r williams sapone was 
hired by us surgical to befriend trutt and spy on her then later 
encouraged her to proceed with the bombing despite trutts 
reservations 
us surgical acknowledged hiring sapone of ridgefield to spy 
on trutt after hearing of her plans against hirsch 
prosecutor bruce hudock said during the sentencing that he had 
no doubt trutt wanted to kill hirsch 
this is punishment for someone who places human life below 
that of animals and the law simply does not allow that hudock 
said 
trutttold katz that she feels she is a scapegoat 
here i am taking the brunt for it this is unbelievable 
trutt said in a loud angry voice 
in a telephone interview after the sentencing hirsch called 
trutt a very disturbed woman and defended his companys use of 
animals to develop medical tools 
i think all of america has to wake up to the threat of animal 
rights activists he said if theyre successful you can 
forget about improvements in medicine or any cure for alzheimers 
or cancer or any other disease thats still with us 
trutt was also sentenced jan 8 in federal court in new york for 
possession of two bombs found in her apartment she received time 
served and three years probation 
the sentence in the stamford case includes three years 
probation following her release from the niantic prison for women 
the judge said that during probation trutt must undergo 
psychotherapy and must refrain from contacting hirsch or any 
employee of us surgical

panamanian officials said monday they 
will file a lawsuit in a us court seeking 5 billion in damages 
from former dictator manuel antonio noriega 
attorney general rogelio cruz told reporters he would travel to 
washington next week to file the suit assisted by the us law 
firm of williams and connolly cruz said the country seeks to 
recover damages caused by noriega during his six years as head of 
the armed forces 
the panamanian authorities would be absolutely irresponsible 
if they did not try to recover for panama the funds which were 
obtained illegally by noriega he said 
us officials took noriega to florida to face trial on drug 
trafficking charges after he was overthrown by a us invasion last 
december 
cruz said noriega is the main theme of his scheduled meeting 
with us attorneys everything turns around noriega he said 
cruz said the meeting with us attorneys would be aimed at 
permitting both american and panamanian justice systems to work 
more effectively in the noreiga case 
panama does not expect to recover the full amount said 
panamanian ambassador to the united states eduardo vallarino 
what is being said is not that panama hopes to be able to 
collect this money he said simply what is being said to the 
united states court is that this is the damage that noriega has 
caused to the panamanian economy and to the country in general

the bleak condition of hispanic education 
threatens the emerging power of the minority group expected to be 
the nations largest in 10 years leaders of a hispanic rights 
organization said monday 
a study by the national council of la raza says hispanics are 
the most undereducated segment of the us population 
they continue to drop out of the nations schools at a faster 
rate than other students and those who do stay in school have a 
harder time than nonhispanics they achieve lower scores on 
standardized tests and get less financial aid from private schools 
and colleges 
worse some officials say is the councils finding that 
education reforms designed to help poorly performing hispanics have 
hurt them instead 
the problem is getting worse rather than better said raul 
yzaguirre director of the council 
he and others warned 4000 hispanic leaders attending the 
councils annual conference that poor education could wipe out 
gains hispanics have made in business and government 
its painful to know that with all the potentials and all the 
dreams all of it will be undercut if we cannot deal with the 
question of education for our people said henry cisneros former 
mayor of san antonio 
hispanics compared with blacks and nonhispanic whites enter 
school later and leave it earlier they are also less likely to 
complete high school enter or complete college the report said 
in 1988 the dropout rate for hispanics at age 19 was about 31 
percent compared with 18 percent for blacks and 14 percent for 
nonhispanic whites 
yzaguirre said the council is worried that education reform 
efforts that have swept parts of the country have forgotten 
hispanics failing them behind just as a track coach would fail his 
team if he raised the bar of the high jump and failed to train the 
athletes to jump higher 
those who have had the training the preparation the 
nutrition will jump higher than those who have not yzaguirre 
said thats exactly what we fear will happen to the hispanic 
community

the federal aviation administration informed 
airlines of a threat against pan am in europe but did not consider 
the threat credible an faa spokesman said monday 
the faa routinely issues information to us carriers to put 
into perspective rumors news reports and other information that 
may be based on erroneous information or speculation said 
spokesman fred farrar 
such a circular was issued july 12 he said without describing 
its contents 
a london newspaper the sunday correspondent reported sunday 
that us authorities had warned airlines of a threat to blow up a 
pan am jet on a flight from west germany in the next 10 days 
the supposed threat involved a female student with a canadian 
passport who was to be duped into carrying a suitcase containing a 
bomb on a pan am flight from either frankfurt or berlin 
farrar said information about the threat had been circulating 
for several months among news organizations in europe 
the faa cautioned that doubts existed about the information and 
advised airlines that the agency did not consider it a credible 
threat he said 
a pan am plane was blown up by a bomb in december 1988 over 
lockerbie scotland with the loss of 20 lives many authorities 
believe the bombing was carried out by a terrorist group working on 
behalf of iran in retaliation for the accidental shooting down of 
an iranian airliner over the persian gulf by a us warship

a school monday i cant go through this alone my friends are

she was among hundreds of students and teachers inside the 
christian college of the philippines when an earthquake struck at 
about 430 pm on monday toppling the sixstory building in this 
city of 80000 residents the school included first grade through 
the senior year of college 
the quake measured 77 on the richter scale and was centered 
near cabanatuan city 60 miles north of manila it was the 
strongest earthquake to hit the philippines in 14 years and 
seismological officials said cabanatuan had not had a major quake 
since 1645 
early tuesday hospitals said 35 people had been killed in the 
cabanatuan area and 154 injured most casualties were from the 
school but officials had no accurate breakdown 
officials admitted they had no idea how many were in the 
building when it collapsed mayor honorato perez said tuesday about 
50 people remained buried in the rubble but fewer than half were 
believed still alive 
rescue efforts were undertaken largely by townspeople who 
flocked to the site and volunteered their services there was 
little sign of experienced supervision 
president corazon aquino flew to cabanatuan from manila early 
tuesday to console families and visit survivors gov bren guiao of 
pampanga province said mrs aquino gave the families money and told 
them its already happened leave it to god 
as she met a rescuer crawled from the rubble and told reporters 
he found four boys all alive but he said one was pinned under the 
ruins in such pain he amputated his own leg with a jagged piece of 
concrete 
poorly equipped local hospitals overflowed with victims 
patients were placed on cots in yards in front of clinics 
lt benbol moralde part of an army contingent sent from nearby 
fort magsaysay said he believed few remained alive beneath the 
debris 
moralde said victims cries grew fainter and fainter and that he 
could see bodies and parts of bodies when he surveyed the 
destruction 
hours after the temblor hundreds of family members and friends 
watched and prayed as rescuers dug through the school rubble 
each time someone was brought out alive relatives crowded 
around the survivor begging for news of those still missing 
they told me shes still alive said rosa de los reyes who 
was waiting word of her daughter maria lisa 14 im very happy 
but if it turns out she has died i think im going to die too 
throughout the night boys as young as seven scrambled between 
slabs of concrete carrying water to victims still trapped 
sixteenyearold florencio alano crawled through the wreckage 
looking for his 13yearold brother cesario only to find out he 
was dead 
florencio who eventually led three survivors to safety said 
at first i couldnt believe that he was already dead so i 
crawled through the passageway i saw his face and felt him what 
else can one feel but just accept it 
rescuers could hear the anguished screams during the night of 
those buried under tons of debris most begged for water one girl 
shrieked for rescuers to cut off my legs to free her 
miss gabwat a high school sophomore said her class had just 
finished a math examination when the quake struck 
we were kidding each other we were saying the test was so 
easy miss gabwat said as she rode in an ambulance to the 
provincial hospital then suddenly the walls trembled the 
ceiling collapsed and there was total darkness we embraced each 
other we were very scared 
she said survivors groped for one another in the darkened rubble 
and prayed aloud 
we were calling out our classmates names but they did not 
respond any more she said then we groped for their hands but 
felt that they were cold each time we wept 
we were scared and some were screaming but then later on 
they said they wanted to sleep already and rest then there was 
silence 
cenando memping whose 14th birthday was on monday said he had 
just invited his three best friends to join him after class at a 
restaurant when the quake hit 
cenando and his friends were trapped beneath tons of rubble he 
said there were 54 students in his class more than 10 hours after 
the quake he was the only one of them who had been rescued 
i prayed to god that if i survive ill hear mass every day 
he said from his hospital bed he said his friend michael nuevo 
joked that he would never go to a high school again 
moments later michael died cenando said 
we were kidding each other comforting each other cenando 
said softly then suddenly he stopped breathing he said 
praise the lord our father our father our father then he was

a fire halfway up the empire state building on 
monday evening sent flames billowing from shattered windows and 
chased tourists from the observation deck and workers from 
throughout the building at least 38 people were injured most from 
inhaling smoke 
about 150 firefighters battled the blaze which was largely 
confined to four unoccupied offices on the 51st floor said don 
malva a fire department spokesman heavy smoke poured through the 
middle floors of the 102story building and the entire tower was 
cleared of tourists and latelingering office workers 
josephine danielson of new york who was visiting the 
observation deck with five friends from spain said they clambered 
down stairways to the 70th floor then took an elevator to ground 
level 
we started smelling smoke and we saw on the east side of the 
building dense black smoke coming from below the tower said ms 
danielson an airline flight attendant whoever runs the 
observation deck is tremendously unorganized you would think they 
would have had some kind of recorded announcement 
the fire was reported at 630 pm and by 845 pm the blaze 
was out and the danger passed malva said 
the fire did heavy fire damage on the 51st floor with water 
damage on lower floors and smoke damage above said john mulligan 
another department spokesman the cause of the blaze wasnt 
immediately known he said 
thirtyone firefighters and seven civilians were injured said 
mulligan twelve of the firefighters were immediately hospitalized 
the mot seriously hurt suffering from first and seconddegree burns 
three nonfirefighters were treated at the scene by paramedics 
and four were hospitalized with smoke inhalation and heat 
exhaustion 
some people said they heard the alarms others said they 
didnt mulligan said but we get that in every fire theres a 
speaker system and we are investigating to see how well it worked 
fire capt charles kasper said the building underwent a brick 
oven effect heating up quickly some windows broke from the 
heat and wind surging through fanned the flames he said 
it had to be close to a thousand degrees on the fire floor 
said kasper the nozzleman i was next to was getting burned he 
was screaming in pain but he did not let go of his hose 
kasper said the empire state building is an incredibly 
wellmade building if this happened in a modern highrise 
building we would have far more problems 
building employees brought people down from the deck 15 at a 
time finally clearing the building by 1020 pm 
nabila al riyami a tourist from oman on the arabian sea was 
helped out along with her husband and five children 
some people were crying and were having nervous trembling 
fits she said her husband said added we were praying to 
god that he would help us we are safe and we thank the fire 
department of the municipality 
fire commissioner carlos rivera said flames had billowed out the 
windows when the fire first broke out but a short time later only 
heavy smoke kept pouring out from some of the floors 
the empire state building was the worlds tallest tower until 
1973 when the world trade center was built in manhattan the sears 
tower in chicago is now the tallest building 
mulligan said he believed the last blaze at the empire state 
building was in 1988

the california supreme court rejected legal 
moves by minority stockholder harry hoiles that might have led to 
the breakup of the freedom newspapers group 
in a unanimous decision july 11 the justices denied a hearing 
on an appeal by hoiles from a lowercourt ruling that upheld 
actions by relatives who hold controlling shares in the 
familyowned company based in orange county 
the dispute dates to 1981 after the death of clarence hoiles 
harrys older brother and head of the 29newspaper company 
harry hoiles claimed his sister mary jane hoiles hardie had 
promised to back him as clarences successor when she refused 
harry talked to possible buyers for his onethird share including 
timesmirror corp 
the hardies and the family of clarence hoiles who each also 
control about onethird of the company offered to buy out harry 
hoiles shares at a discount harry said the 74 million offer was 
375 percent of the shares market value in 1981 
the majority also adopted a stock restriction to give family 
members the first chance to buy majority shares harry hoiles was 
not reelected to a threemember executive committee 
his suit claimed his relatives actions took unfair advantage of 
their majority status and denied him fair value for his stock he 
sought a court order liquidating the company or requiring the 
majority to buy his stock at market value 
orange county superior court judge leonard goldstein ruled in 
favor of the majority stockholders and was upheld april 27 by the 
4th district court of appeal 
equity does not require the majority to submit to corporate 
blackmail at the whim of a minority any more than it will permit a 
majority to take unfair advantage of a minority justice thomas 
crosby wrote for the supreme court

state rep david duke helped kill 
legislation that might have financially harmed a smalltown 
newspaper that has refused to run his political ads 
duke who frequently criticizes the media for mentioning his 
past neonazi ties and ku klux klan leadership declared his 
devotion to safeguarding press freedom july 9 as he moved to kill a 
bill aimed at the st helena echo 
the legislation would have allowed local governments in st 
helena parish to pick a newspaper from outside the parish as the 
parishs official journal the publication that prints for a fee 
government notices minutes of public meetings and other government 
information 
this is a danger to freedom of the press said duke i 
suggest the danger of this amendment and this bill is to prevent 
people from publishing its become political 
he then moved that the house put off consideration of the bill 
a motion that carried 5036 the 1990 session adjourned a few hours 
later without the bill coming up again 
told of dukes action echo publisher harrell griffin said he 
was amazed i dont know what to think about that he said 
im flabbergasted 
griffin and duke have been at odds for months ever since 
griffin refused to run ads for dukes us senate campaign 
he accused duke of trying unsuccessfully to organize an economic 
boycott of the echo duke said he never tried to organize a boycott 
but did advise his supporters of the echos refusal to run his ads 
griffin said he wouldnt question dukes motives but added he 
didnt believe duke had given up racist philosophies 
asked if he would change his mind about running dukes ads 
griffin said id have to think long and hard on that it makes 
me think better of him for having done this 
griffin said the legislation could have put the echo one of six 
small papers he publishes out of business if it resulted in his 
losing the 17000 worth of government business it gets each year 
he blamed the mostly white st helena power structure for 
persuading rep buster guzzardo and sen bb sixty rayburn to 
sponsor the legislation he said the leadership doesnt like his 
support of black residents causes in the parish where almost half 
the registered voters are black 
guzzardo said the bill wasnt intended to put the echo out of 
business but was aimed at making griffin bid competitively with 
other papers for government business

ted vagelos figured the proper way to 
pop the question to an editors daughter was in print 
so he took out a quarterpage ad in the knoxville newssentinel 
on july 15 
dear tina will you marry me love ted the 1274 ad asked 
in big bold letters 
the proposal surprised both tina moskos and her father 
newssentinel editor harry moskos but vagelos timing was apt 
since tinas parents celebrated their 28th wedding anniversary the 
same day 
ms moskos accepted the wedding will be early next year

while the worlds spotlight remained trained on 
the deliberations of seven western leaders the city of houston 
plied the news media for its share of attention 
about 4000 reporters came for the economic summit july 911 
and civic leaders spared no effort to put them in a good mood about 
the city 
we specifically asked for the opportunity to host the economic 
summit because we wanted the chance to focus the worldwide 
attention on what is happening here in houston mayor kathy 
whitmire said 
we felt that there ought to be some way that we can take 
advantage of your presence here she said 
boosters invested hundreds of thousands of dollars to present 
reporters with free food alcohol tshirts tote bags and even 
toothpaste thats become the standard formula for any city playing 
host to preeminent news events like summits political conventions 
or sports extravaganzas 
houstonians made no secret of their motives 
frankly the people from washington told us early on that the 
media attitude at previous summits was affected by the preparation 
and presentation of the food said ben love a retired bank 
chairman who helped organize the media center 
but houston was miffed when the three television networks turned 
a cold shoulder to hot houston and chose not to broadcast their 
news shows from the summit a snub that was frontpage news locally 
and when whitmire and some pillars of the community staged a 9 
am summit news conference july 10 in an auditorium that can hold 
more than 1000 people 50 civic boosters outnumbered the handful 
of reporters 
ive heard you reporters stay up pretty late at night 
and maybe dont get up so early in the morning love said this 
may be some confirmation of that 
no matter the tiny turnout wasnt cause for concern 
when i see 10 or 11 television cameras across the back of the 
room im very much aware of the potential they have for reaching 
very large numbers of people whitmire said you dont have to 
have large numbers to impress me

publishing in the late 1950s 
ingersoll announced a transatlantic swap with investment 
partner em warburg pincus amp co he gave up all his american 
newspapers and became sole owner of his european newspaper group 
ingersoll had controlled 10 american dailies and dozens of weeklies 
the swap left ingersoll with a much smaller lessindebted 
business that includes morning afternoon and sunday newspapers in 
dublin and three dailies and 39 weeklies in england 
ingersoll said hes happy with the deal 
i think it was natural and basically inevitable he said in 
a telephone interview we had a philosophical difference i saw 
great opportunity in europe they werent really interested 
he said the key to the deal for him is that hes severing his 
ties with warburg pincus his investment partner since 1983 
under his original agreement with that firm ingersoll was 
obligated to share 50 percent of the profits of any acquisition or 
deal he made 
now im free to negotiate with individual investor groups for 
each individual deal thats the way my father and i did it for 25 
years and thats the way im going to do it now he said 
nonetheless a basic question lingers how much choice did 
ingersoll have 
whats happening i think was basically forced upon him 
said john morton a media industry analyst for lynch jones amp ryan 
but i guess with his affinity for europe it might make it easier 
to swallow 
others say ingersoll welcomes the chance to escape the recession 
that has hit american newspapers ingersoll said he talked with his 
partners about the transatlantic swap last year and had been 
watching the european market for eight years 
ralph always said there were greater opportunities in europe 
he always expressed a strong interest over there i think this move 
is consistent with his thinking said tom tallarico expublisher 
of the shortlived st louis sun 
the sun was supposed to be a revolutionary tabloid designed to 
show growth was possible in a stagnant industry after seven 
months it folded with a loss of at least 25 million 
ingersoll who used some of his own money to start the paper 
said he stopped publishing because of inadequate street sales 
analysts said he was forced to pull the plug because of his 
weighty obligations in junk bonds by some reckonings ingersolls 
us newspaper network amassed debts exceeding 700 million 
a month before the suns demise ingersoll offered to repurchase 
240 million worth of junk bonds at deep discounts to avoid 
defaulting on upcoming interest payments he got a poor response 
everyone in the industry said the st louis sun was illfated 
from the start said kenneth berents an analyst with alex brown 
amp co in baltimore and its interesting that had he not gone out 
on a limb for the sun he might not be having the problems hes 
having today the sun may have cost him his whole empire 
ingersoll said the junk bond troubles had nothing to do with his 
decision to give up the us holdings and hes not sure where the 
sun fits into the picture 
it didnt figure in it directly but i suppose it may have had 
some type of metaphysical impact on what warburg pincus was 
thinking but its hard to say he said 
its difficult to say much about the internal finances of 
ingersolls companies because they are privately owned but its 
clear things havent been easy since the sun stopped publishing 
april 25 
i think the failure of the sun affected him more than anyone 
thought it disenchanted him with american newspapers said kevin 
horrigan the suns lead columnist who was lured away from the st 
louis postdispatch ralph felt he had something to contribute 
and was basically told no thanks

the wausau daily herald is publishing free 
detailed obituaries again after 2 years of charging for them 
the policy cost the paper too many advertisers and subscribers 
publisher fritz jacobi said july 11 
if a business decision is so unpopular that emotions are so 
strong more than two years after its implementation then i think 
its time to review that policy he said 
leroy yorgason executive director of the wisconsin newspaper 
association in madison said fewer than a dozen of the 37 daily and 
218 weekly newspapers in wisconsin charge for obituaries 
in december 1987 the herald began charging families for 
obituaries that included the deceaseds job survivors 
contributions to the community and other pertinent information the 
publisher at the time said the change would generate income and 
follow a practice at other newspapers of publishing for free only a 
death notice with information about the funeral 
readers 55 letters to the editor in less than six weeks 
complained that free obituaries with some life history had been a 
tradition at the paper which gannett co inc bought in 1980

a state appeals court ruled july 10 that a 
newspaper can refuse an advertisement for gay and lesbian services 
and is not subject to a law regulating public access to businesses 
the 3rd district court of appeals ruled the green bay 
pressgazette could not be forced under the public accommodations 
law to accept classified ads without discretion 
that law makes it illegal to deny full and equal enjoyment of 
any public place of accommodation or amusement because of sex 
race color creed physical condition developmental disability 
sexual orientation national origin or ancestry 
we conclude that to be a place of public accommodation under 
the public accommodation act the business must be comparable to or 
consistent with the business enumerated in the statute itself 
the appeals court said 
newspapers do not offer the public accommodations in the 
sense that this term is normally understood it added 
the decision affirmed a summary judgment by a trial court in 
favor of gannett co inc owner of the pressgazette 
the case stemmed from a lawsuit filed by jay hatheway doing 
business as among friends and peggy and tracey vandeveer 
according to court records one proposed ad by hatheway read in 
part gaylesbian resources referrals networks for rural 
wisconsin the vandeveers attempted to place a classified ad that 
offered unique handpainted sweatshirts for lesbians 
the newspaper said it rejected the ads because the ads contained 
the words lesbian and gay 
in its decision the appeals court said it was not examining the 
constitutional implications that a contrary decision would have 
involved if the newspaper were forced to accept the ads

the state supreme court denied a new york 
newspaper access to a full transcript of the child sex abuse trial 
of a former day care teacher 
the court in a 52 decision july 9 agreed with a trial courts 
ruling that the village voice was entitled only to a version of the 
transcript with the names and identifying characteristics of the 
children and their families deleted 
laura handman an attorney for the voice said the newspaper had 
not decided whether to appeal to the us supreme court 
we believe that a redacted transcript would be very difficult 
to understand because of all the deletions given the numerous 
children ms handman said of the transcript which exceeds 
30000 pages 
it would be very hard to follow which child we are talking 
about she said 
the teacher was convicted in 1988 of 115 counts of sexually 
abusing 19 children aged 3 to 5 
the supreme courts ruling addressed the issue of whether the 
voice was entitled to receive edited or unedited transcripts of the 
10month trial which generated extensive news coverage 
to accommodate first amendment rights while protecting the 
privacy of the young victims and their parents the trial court 
allowed the media full access to the trial but prohibited 
publication of the names addresses or other identifying 
characteristics of the children and their families the trial court 
also ordered that all transcripts be sealed 
no representative of the voice attended the trial but two 
months after the trial ended the newspaper sought to obtain an 
unedited version

newspapers have no right to a list of 
state employees with details of their work history the state 
supreme court ruled 
the providence journalbulletin had asked the state department 
of administration for information on employees affiliated with the 
rhode island federation of teachers and the national education 
association of rhode island 
john j kane director of the agency refused to turn over the 
information saying it was too personal 
the journalbulletin and bruce landis a staff writer wanted 
information that will uniquely identify state employees by name 
address and employee number as well as employment history 
qualifications job classification relationship to the civil 
service system minority and other special status position by 
agency and by other identifiers work schedule the components of 
their pay their pay and overtime history vacation and sick leave 
status 
the newspaper also asked for data on the employees history of 
personal actions beginning with fiscal 198586 including both 
present and former state employees recounting their comings and 
goings and how their status changed inbetween 
the journalbulletin maintained it was entitled to the 
information under the states access to public records act 
kane offered only to produce information available to the 
general public including an employees name position agency 
assignment salary and date of employment 
the newspaper sued kane in superior court in march 1989 the 
judge there ruled the records were personnel records relating to 
identifiable individuals that are exempt from the public records 
law 
the supreme court upheld the lower courts ruling citing its 
previous ruling involving the pawtucket teachers alliance 
in the pawtucket case a teachers union sought records of the 
pawtucket school department to investigate a school principals 
performance 
in that case the supreme court ruled the legislature did not 
intend for the act to allow the public carte blanche to rummage 
through all publicly held documents

a newspapers distribution of lyrics 
from a 2 live crew album that a lee county judge declared obscene

police said 
in a frontpage editorial last month everett landers executive 
editor of the newspress offered free copies of the lyrics to 
anyone over 18 who stopped by the newspapers office and requested 
them 
a feb 8 ruling by judge isaac anderson made it a misdemeanor 
offense to sell the miamibased groups recording as nasty as 
they wanna be to adults and a felony to sell it to minors 
a federal judge in fort lauderdale later ruled the recording 
obscene and members of the rap group have been arrested on 
obscenity charges 
a spokeswoman for the state attorneys office said prosecutors 
would investigate to see whether state law had been violated by the 
newspress 
landers referred all questions to his lawyer steve carta who 
was unavailable for comment a newspress receptionist said the 
company had run out of copies of the lyrics and didnt plan to 
print more 
in his editorial landers said that unbending advocates of 
free speech often find themselves having to defend things they find 
offensive he said people not the news media should make a 
decision on what is obscene 
we bow to that logic in this case not low enough to print 
the lyrics on our pages but to a middle ground of distributing

men refused to quit 
the agency which serves 38 weeklies of the 149 millionmember 
denomination and also about 400 other news outlets has been

declaring the step adversely affects the credibility of 
religious journalism in north america donald f hetzler

what makes this situation especially regrettable is that 
southern baptist press has earned a high degree of credibility and 
trust among secular press agencies for its open balanced reporting 
of controversial matters 
chapman has declined comment on actions against the news agency 
editors but said the feeling has surfaced that there seemed

one sunday 20 years ago former beatle paul 
mccartney and his wife linda looked out their kitchen window as 
they ate lunch and saw their sheep in the field it was the last 
time they ate meat 
if animals could speak i think theyd tell us not to eat 
meat linda mccartney said we are such a pompous race of 
humans were so destructive so sad people dream of heaven and 
you know were living in heaven but we make it hell 
her familys change in diet was influenced more by animal rights 
than by health but whatever the motivation mccartney preaches 
vegetarianism to that end she has written linda mccartneys 
home cooking already published in england and to be issued oct 
31 in this country by arcade publishing 2495 
i did the cookbook for one reason i love animals and to pass 
on the recipes to my kids and friends mccartney said from new 
jersey where she was with her husbands band at a stop on a world 
tour 
even on the road which is where the mccartneys have been for a 
year no meat or fish is served to the 180 people on the touring 
staff 
this whole tour is vegetarian and those who at first were 
skeptical have been converted she said 
people think of vegetarians as cranks they eat radishes and 
lettuce said mccartney who calls herself an instinctive peasant 
cook they dont realize you eat better as a vegetarian nothing 
suffers and you eat better you only cut out decaying flesh 
many of her friends had doubts but she and her family are 
healthy and friends who give up meat soon say they feel better 
she said 
but its not an easy change 
at first mccartney said she ate lots of quiches and macaroni 
and cheese at restaurants the choices were ratatouille or 
omelets then she began cooking with soybean imitation meats 
called texture vegetable protein now she uses much less of that 
and relies more on produce legumes and dairy products 
tvp sold in health food stores and some supermarkets is shaped 
like various meat products bacon burgers sausage and tastes 
exactly like meat said mccartney who added she has fooled many 
guests with it 
she suggests tvp is a good way to help convert a family to 
vegetarianism 
everybody bases their meal around a chop or a leg or a 
thigh and with tvp no one will think somethings missing she 
said 
in her book mccartney adapts vegetarianism to a decidedly 
british eating style with a proper english breakfast of vegetable 
sausages alongside fried eggs a festive sunday roast made from 
vegetable burgers and sausages with stuffing a suetfree christmas 
pudding and even a shepherds pie without beef 
i havent written this book in order to be acclaimed as a 
great cook like everyone ive had my share of disasters in the 
kitchen im simply doing it for the animals she wrote in her 
introduction 
most of the more than 200 recipes in the book are geared toward 
beginners they appear simple to prepare and were chosen from 
mccartneys years as a home cook yes although she surely can 
afford to stay out of the kitchen mccartney said she and her 
family paul plus four children have always spent a lot of time 
there 
mccartney even discusses ways to involve reluctant husbands and 
children in food preparation paul bakes bread 
ive never had a cook ive never had a nanny either i love 
my kids im sort of very womanly that way said mccartney who 
also is a photographer and plays keyboards with her husbands band 
vegetarianism takes a sense of awareness she said mccartney 
grew up a real meat eater never connecting the horses she 
loved with the horsemeat that was fed to her dogs 
i think were going through a food revolution and people will 
realize that meat is disgusting or i should say flesh is 
disgusting we cover everything up we call pig a ham 
humans should take their cue from animals such as gorillas or 
elephants she said strong animals dont eat meat i think we 
have a whole false thing about meat

one of these weekends there may be a 
political collision at a small town dump a good place to find 
voters on a summer saturday 
sen gordon j humphrey says hell be working the dump circuit 
as he campaigns to swap his seat in the us senate for one in the 
new hampshire legislature 
so will john l sherburne seeking to move from the new 
hampshire house to the state senate seat humphrey wants 
in the era of campaign consultants television commercials and 
image makers the contest for the republican nomination in new 
hampshires 17th senate district is a clash of cultures as well as 
candidates 
while sherburne tries to broaden his constituency humphrey has 
to narrow his focus to line up primary election support in the 14 
towns that make up the largely rural district where most voters 
know him from afar 
in the republican primary two years ago 4444 voters turned 
out therell probably be more this time perhaps as many as 6000 
humphreys campaign mission is easier because people know his 
name he says he is campaigning intensively for the 100ayear 
seat in the legislature at concord knowing that nothing would 
alienate voters faster than for him to act as though he thinks the 
job is automatically his 
whatever the outcome nobody will say that humphrey didnt 
work his butt off the senator said 
besides the outcome is no sure bet despite humphreys 
advantages 
weve been going allout for a long time sherburne said one 
evening last week talking politics across the kitchen table at his 
deerfield farmhouse his home for 20 years after a career in the 
air force we obviously have a name recognition problem 
hes working on it with a network of volunteers trying to make 
his name and face known by word of mouth and campaign tshirt 
while he visits general stores volunteer fire stations wherever 
there might be a voter or two 
youve got to go out and root them out meet them find them 
at the dump sherburne said its real basic actually 
i dont think either one of us is going to see very big 
crowds said humphrey contrasting his campaign past with his 
current objective but he said the only fundamental difference 
between running for the us senate and campaigning for the state 
senate is that some of the issues are different 
some are not notably taxes and abortion topics on which 
humphrey and sherburne differ sharply humphrey one of the most 
conservative of senate republicans is a leading abortion foe 
sherburne favors abortion rights and says the issue doesnt belong 
in the realm of politics 
new hampshire has no general income or sales tax sherburne 
favors a statewide referendum on taxes humphrey insists the 
legislature should hold firm against a sales or income tax 
its a good fight and i want to go back and fight it 
humphrey said in an interview in his us capitol office a 
hideaway where he works at two computer terminals new hampshires 
24 senators share office space and staff help 
ill miss all these goodies humphrey said surveying the 
windowless office he calls his cockpit two blocks from his senate 
office building suite im building my own little cockpit in my 
barn back home his home is in chichester 
humphrey 49 was a pilot on a commuter airline before his upset 
senate election in 1978 he was reelected comfortably in 1984 he 
had said from the start that he would serve only two terms 
preaching what he practices he is pushing a proposed 
constitutional amendment to limit congressional service to 12 
consecutive years humphrey said he will keep up that campaign from 
new hampshire 
he has some other campaigns in mind too he says he will try to 
help other conservatives get elected to the legislature humphrey 
would like to run for president of the state senate next year 
im certainly interested he said 
beyond that he said im interested in running for governor 
id like to offer myself as a candidate some time 
says sherburne 
hes trying to use this for higher office a lot of people 
tell me they resent that he expects to walk right into office 
and some people dont take kindly to it hes a little gruff and 
demanding 
sherburne 66 was a combat pilot in two wars later an aide at 
the pentagon hes served eight years in the state house 12 as a 
selectman in deerfield 
humphrey began his campaign with a letter to district 
republicans saying he needed notarized signatures from 500 of them 
by midjune in order to qualify for the ballot thats not 
quite so he needed the signatures because he did not accept the 
states optional campaign spending limit 15000 for the senate 
contest 
the senator said 1100 people signed his petitions voters who 
presumably will be back to support him in the primary humphrey 
said he doesnt expect to spend more than the limit but wants the 
flexibility to do so if abortion rights organizations go after him 
sherburne agreed to the limit and said his campaign probably 
wont spend that much 
dont see its necessary actually he said

adjusting the spray upward also gets rid of insects bugs are 
smart they lay their eggs on the underside of the leaf out of the 
rain so we got smarter and spray from the bottom washing off the 
eggs this reduces use of pesticide to a sixteenth of what the bag 
label recommends 
another sermon in robbinss ministry is lowtillage farming 
lisa low input sustainable agriculture leaving corn stubble in 
the field retains snow melt impedes rain runoff cuts herbicide 
use by twothirds means only five tractor trips across a field a 
year instead of eight or 10 and saves water 
bruce unruh farms 2000 acres of wheat corn and sunflowers and 
is a prize pupil of robbins i used to pump 90 to 120 days a 
season last year i ran the pivot 39 days he uses gypsum blocks 
only 2 percent of ogallala farmers do which measure soil 
moisture like a fuel gauge and tell me when to irrigate 
lepa and lisa farming are more management intensive but 
instead of five operations with the tractor before planting at 10 
acres an hour now i have one 
another of robbinss proteges is growing corn over in nebraska 
on 6 to 8 inches of irrigation instead of 2 feet you got guys 
running pumps all summer thats what everybody told them to do 
much of the hope for the future of the aquifer in robbins 
view lies in a change of farmer mentalilty farmers think in 
terms of yield not profit the whole purpose of farming is to make 
enough to support your family if you can reduce the cost you do 
it better 
in the coffee shop farmers are always talking about how many 
bushels they got per acre unruh says but its how much money 
you net that makes you sucessful or not 
farmers have a tilling addiction robbins says they get 
the shakes if the tractor isnt running suns up you gotta be 
driving suns down go to bed its a problem to program older 
farmers they think its a sin to sit down but we know how to farm 
with less manpower less water and more profit 
weve been mining the aquifer using it up marketing water 
through a crop says lyle we got 172 bushels of corn on our 
fields with 55 inches of irrigation vs 24 bushels dry farming 
for an additional 12 inches of water we added 14 bushels so in 
effect we gave away the 12 inches 
but the most persuasive missionary for sensible water use is a 
farmer looking over his fence at a more prosperous neighbor 
we had 16 lepas in this county last year robbins reports 
by the end of this year therell be 100 it costs up to 9000 
to convert a 50000 pivot to lepa it is an investment in the 
future 
if there were no pioneers in this country wed still all be 
sitting on plymouth rock says wes robbins visionary we 
havent begun to scratch the future out here 
i seriously think we have the technology right here today to 
cut the amount of water were using by half in texas and parts of 
nebraska says lyle i believe the ogallala could be 
selfsustaining if we cut back on water and concentrate on 
profitability instead of yield 
he mentions technology 
a new cotton plant that uses 20 percent less water 
an improved pivot whose segments move uniformly in tandem 
spreading water and chemicals more efficiently 
improved management by irrigating in alternate furrows with 
diking to retain water 
an improved nozzle that sprays in a sheet instead of more 
erosive droplets 
in imperial neb district water manager ron milner foresees 
irrigation technology that will reduce water on crops by twothirds 
but in greeley county in western kansas the horse has already 
left the barn says keith lebbin water manager in scott city 
a new proposal would limit 12section areas to 641 acre feet of 
water but permits are already in existence for 8191 acre feet 
what do you do sue everyone to take away their property rights 
whats the cost of that 
the us geological survey had predicted the water table in the 
corn and cow belt of the upper republican river in nebraska would 
drop 90 feet by 2000 the actual decline has been only 15 feet 
annually a projected 15 feet by centurys end with irrigating 8 
to 10 inches a year the ogallala here could be selfsustaining 
with recharge from rain and surface water milner predicts 
a 1982 study for the us department of commerce forecast a 25 
percent fall in water levels in the ogallala by 2020 if no 
conservation steps were taken irrigated farming would decline 
sharply from kansas to new mexico and increase greatly in 
nebraska a more regulated use of the aquifer would reduce 
predicted declines by 5 percent to 25 percent depending on the 
area 
but the report concluded actions by individual states would 
have little effect on regional consequences that crystal ball 
has proved to be cloudy with new technology better management 
regulated pumping and normal rainfall declines have been 
considerably below generalized predictions 
suppose they werent it should be remembered that the original 
sodbusters of the high plains got by on dryland farming about 
threequarters of the farmers in northwestern kansas do not 
irrigate about half of the acreage of the texas panhandle and 
south is dry farmed for years farmers have grown summer fallow 
wheat planting fields in alternate years 
eventually well have a mix of dryland and irrigated 
farming says former nebraska state hydrologist vince dreeszen 
this will keep the ogallala around absolutely 
even assuming a worst scenario any changes in population and 
agriculture are going to take place over time says michael 
jess nebraska director of water resources this is evident across 
the high plains where abandoned swaybacked weedcovered 
farmsteads of those who didnt make it gaze windowless over 
stillgreen fields of neighbors who did 
the 1982 study the most thorough the ogallala has had did not 
write the aquifers epitaph in the dust it will last well into 
the next century the report said nebraskans talk about a 
400year supply for them 
seen through the eyes of a wes robbins or a wayne wyatt or a 
bill lyle the ogallala has been comprehended in time to save it 
should this be so and the drinking spree of the ancient aquifer 
has taken the pledge it would signal a commendable triumph of good 
sense over greed 
at a water conference in lincoln not long ago david sands of 
the nebraska audubon society delivered a better epitaph for the 
ogallala

home on the range the skies are not 
cloudy all day thats the problem 
rain falls and rivers flow far more kindly elsewhere than in the 
high plains 
but this semiarid swath from south dakota to new mexico has 
been an irrigated breadbasket producing some 25 percent of the 
nations food and fiber since its huge underground sea the 
ogallala aquifer began being pumped in earnest 70 years ago 
but what if the well should eventually run dry 
there have been some earthshaking proposals that challenge 
genesis itself such as pouring canadas huge northern rivers south 
of the border meanwhile rainmaking once the province of tomtoms 
and flimflam artists has actually been working 
ten years ago in texas where wells have dewatered as 
hydrologists delicately put it they were talking about importing 
water from nebraskas mother lode of twothirds of the aquifers 
great lakessize supply 
the cost and realities of interstate politics have stilled such 
musings 
in the 1960s texas was seriously considering capturing the 
mississippi river below new orleans and siphoning and pumping it 
800 miles to the panhandle to irrigate its huge cotton fields 
power to do it would have come from six or so new nuclear 
generating plants the prohibitive price kept ol man river where 
it was 
in 1982 the sixstate high plains aquifer regional resources 
study for the us department of commerce went into megariver 
transfers in some detail as outlined by the army corps of 
engineers various alternatives would divert water from the 
missouri river turn rivers backward put reservoirs and pumping 
stations all over the map and cost anywhere from 13 billion to 
226 billion in 1982 dollars 
stating it nicely the corps reported none their emphasis 
of that water has been identified as surplus to the needs of the 
basin of origin michael jess nebraskas director of water 
resources puts it more bluntly we wouldnt stand for it 
canada has expressed similar reluctance about a proposal by an 
american engineering firm in california to redirect the yukon 
susitana and tanana rivers from the northwest territories down to 
the states the flow would be 125 percent that of the mississippi 
at st louis cost 200 billion in 1977 money 
another plan would cost 40 billion to tap the mackenzie river 
which pours 325 million acre feet largely unused into the arctic 
ocean every year for 40 million acre feet delivered to the united 
states by way of the rockies 
the corps estimates its plans would cost the farmer 226 to 434 
an acre foot which would bankrupt most of them overnight 
maybe some day if we have starving multitudes and people are 
willing to work for a hell of a lot less than the minimum wage 
well have transfers says wes robbins a us water expert in 
burlington colo 
on a more realistic level is the 1982 decision by the us 
supreme court that ground water is a commodity of interstate 
commerce and its export cannot be embargoed by the state where it 
is found the cast involved a colorado farmer joy sporhase who 
owned land in nebraska and was pumping its well water onto his 
adjacent farm in colorado nebraska tried to invoke its regulatory 
powers against sporhase but the court said it couldnt 
this caused nebraska state sen loran schmit to suggest that 
nebraska begin selling its water out of state since under sporhase 
there wasnt anything stopping the city of denver say from buying 
up nebraska land and pumping its water back to the mile high city 
schmit was damn near lynched says jess we might as well 
get something for our water while we have it 
several small towns in kansas and colorado have dipped straws 
into nebraska for domestic water and dewatered texans and 
jayhawkers have been buying farms in liquid cornhusker land but 
the implications of sporhase remain so far only a cloud on the 
horizon 
in kansas water district no 1 scientists have been 
experimenting with cloud seeding to produce rain since 1975 
people thought it was hocuspocus but if it could take some 
of the stress off our aquifer we thought it might be worth 
trying says district manager keith lebbin 
the results have been evaluated independently in 1978 81 and 
88 all confirmed a 9 percent increase over normal rainfall and 
more importantly a 35 percent reduction in hail the rainfall is 
equivalent to an inch or inch and a half of precipitation hail 
insurance rates have dropped 11 percent a saving of 75 million 
hail the size of grapefruit can ruin a crop in minutes it 
caused ed gutentag a federal geologist to reroof his house four 
times in the 15 years he lived in the area 
some people think its the lords work and we shouldnt 
interfere says lebbin who has four cloudseeding planes on 
ready alert during growing season but were not pretending to 
make rain were just trying to maximize what the cloud is doing 
north dakota has had even better luck ray pat jones 
meteorologist for the upper colorado river municipal water district 
in texas says seeding has increased rainfall there 20 percent the 
lubbock texas water district is going to give it a try in three 
to five years 
it takes people that long to get comfortable with it says 
water manager wayne wyatt

when the rev martin luther king jr mounted the cathedrals 
canterbury pulpit on palm sunday 1968 just three days before his 
death the central tower was complete but the twin towers on the 
west portal had not yet begun to rise 
when mourners were summoned for a memorial service for 
assassinated egyptian president anwar sadat in 1981 the protestant 
episcopal cathedral foundation had fallen 107 million in debt and 
work at the cathedral was at a standstill 
only the most optimistic person would have bet on washington 
cathedral ever being finished said canon richard t feller 
clerk of the works since 1953 a review of the hard facts gave it 
almost zero chance 
and yet at noon on sept 29 a gleaming blue crane will lift a 
1008pound chunk of indiana limestone carved in the shape of a 
folded leaf onto the south towers southwestern pinnacle and one 
of the worlds last great gothic cathedrals will be completed 
president bush is expected to be on hand just as president 
theodore roosevelt was there for the foundation stone ceremony on 
the same date in 1907 godspeed in the work begun this noon 
roosevelt told a crowd estimated at 10000 as a stone quarried in 
bethlehem was sunk in the rocky soil of washingtons mount st 
alban 
a national worshiping place was first conceived by pierre 
lenfant the parisianborn american architect commissioned by 
george washington to plan the national capital his blueprints for 
the city included a church intended for national purposes such 
as public prayer thanksgiving funeral orations etc and 
assigned to the special use of no particular sect or denomination 
but equally open to all 
partly because of concern over the constitutional separation of 
church and state it was not until dec 9 1891 that the first 
meeting to plan the cathedral was held at the home of banker 
charles c glover 
construction would not begin until 16 years later 
building the cathedral has cost 65 million to date not taking 
inflation into account the figure includes more than 200 
stainedglass windows and a wealth of statuary mosaics and other 
art works 
according to the federal highway administration it can cost up 
to 63 million in 1990 money to build a onemile stretch of urban 
interstate highway the cost of a b2 stealth bomber has been set 
at from 530 million to 815 million depending on how many are 
purchased 
even in todays dollars the cost of the cathedral is small 
compared to such sums 
yet some have questioned whether the foundation which operates 
the cathedral under a charter granted by congress in 1893 should 
have pumped money into such a project in a capital facing mounting 
homelessness and poverty 
the provost of the cathedral the very rev howard a perry 
says the decision in 1983 to finish the building on a payasyougo 
basis while retiring its debt was coupled with a commitment to 
expand outreach to the city 
at the time 20 percent of the cathedrals budget went into 
worship and outreach it is now 40 percent 
we dont see ourselves being so caught up in this building and 
all its glory that we dont also have a very strong involvement in 
the metropolitan area says the rev kwasi thornell who came 
from a mission church in a poor st louis neighborhood to be canon 
missioner of the cathedral 
the cathedral does not double as a parish church as do most 
episcopal cathedrals in the united states so there is no builtin 
congregation yet several services are held every day there are 
usually five services on sunday 
perry says only about 15 percent to 20 percent of the people 
attending the services come to the cathedral regularly 
one of the regulars is ruth goodchild daughter of an episcopal 
clergyman and wife of a retired foreign service officer she and 
her husband come in every sunday from suburban mclean va but her 
involvement with the cathedral doesnt end there 
on monday afternoons from 1230 to 3 mrs goodchild a former 
schoolteacher goes to a school in a povertystricken area of 
washington and tutors two hispanic fifthgraders

as chairman of the cathedrals literacy program mrs goodchild 
also arranges and attends threehour training sessions for 
volunteers the first saturday of each month 
there are more than 90 volunteers in the program some visiting 
schools once or twice a week and some working in the evening with 
adults at a former public school now run by the city government as 
a tutoring center 
the cathedral is built in the style of the english cathedrals of 
the 14th century with some variations including mostly 
frenchstyle windows it is put together in the same stoneonstone 
method used by medieval masons 
although there are steel reinforcing rods in the concrete floors 
and in the cores of the pillars there is no structural steel in 
the bearing walls flying buttresses countering the outward thrust 
of the gothic arches hold them up 
this thing is built to stay here a couple of thousand years 
says joseph alonso the mason foreman 
at 83012 square feet the washington cathedral is the sixth 
largest in the world exceeded by st peters in rome at 227069 
seville at 128570 the unfinished cathedral of st john the divine 
in new york at 121000 liverpool at 101000 and milan at 92600 
the building is 518 feet long its central tower rises 301 feet and 
the west tower reaches 234 feet 
the work proceeded from east to west starting in 1907 with the 
bethlehem chapel where wilson was laid to rest then continuing to 
the chapel of st joseph of arimathea with a mural of christs 
entombment and the resurrection chapel with the cathedrals only 
mosaics a visitors center and museum shop complete the crypt or 
lower level 
the main altar directly above bethlehem chapel was built next 
then came the choir with its richly carved wood and the south and 
north transepts which intersect the nave at right angles to form 
the shape of a cross 
construction stopped in 1977 due to the shortage of money work 
resumed in 1980 after a new bishop and dean the right rev john 
thomas walker started a fundraising drive and ordered stringent 
economies cutting back on heat reducing staff and turning the 
lights off except during services the final phase of construction 
began on april 5 1983 with the setting of the first stone for the 
west towers 
walker died after heart surgery on sept 30 1989 the day that 
a ceremony was held marking the beginning of the final year of 
construction like five other bishops who served as the building 
rose he is interred in the cathedral his successor the right 
rev ronald h haines will be installed a few weeks after the 
cathedrals ceremonious completion 
a few months before his death walker challenged the cathedral 
to become a servant church 
the alternative is to become an anachronism a museum piece a 
stop on a tour of the capital city he wrote i dont believe 
that we will be reduced to be a museum piece 
the building will need more work even after the final stone is 
set 
weve got a 70yearold building at one end and a brandnew 
building at the other end and the 70yearold portion of the 
building and the intermediate areas have got to have some 
preservation feller says 
one problem is that during the stopandstart construction the 
building was often protected only by temporary roofs 
walking a visitor through the nave alonso said you notice 
these black stains here thats from water infiltrating it seeps 
into the limestone and then darkens 
a building like this is always moving expanding settling 
he added 
unlike new yorks st john the divine which is on the edge of 
harlem the washington cathedral is on a leafy hilltop in a 
fashionable residential area far from the troubled inner city 
from the south tower you can see across the potomac river to 
the pentagon off into maryland to the mormon temple and beyond to 
sugar loaf mountain up pennsylvania avenue to the capitol and the 
library of congress the white house four miles away is hidden 
behind trees 
you can be any place in that building and you can find 
delight says james p cramer executive vice president of the 
american institute of architects

from coventry to philadelphia from the edge 
of harlem to the golden gate cathedral building in the 20th 
century has often been accompanied by controversy 
a cathedral serves as the official seat or chair of the bishop 
of a diocese in churches that are governed by bishops such as the 
roman catholic eastern orthodox anglican or episcopal and in 
sweden the lutheran denominations 
the question of whether and how to build cathedrals has been 
revived with the scheduled completion in september of the 
gothicstyle washington national cathedral begun in 1907 the 
question is not a new one 
when the 14th century st michaels cathedral in coventry 
england was gutted by german bombing during world war ii the 
cathedral chapter decided to rebuild in a controversial modern 
style 
i think they were right said stanford lehmberg a historian 
of cathedrals who teaches at the university of minnesota arguing 
that england already has a wealth of real medieval churches and 
doesnt need to build copies here where we dont genuinely have 
any medieval buildings i think it is appropriate for us to have 
one 
san francisco roman catholics however built a modern cathedral 
after their 75yearold red brick gothic one was destroyed by fire 
in 1962 
the community at large expected the new cathedral to be a 
building of the future not a clever replica of a traditional 
style monsignor james p gaffey said in a lecture in 1983 
some didnt want it to be built at all 
twentyseven priests wrote to archbishop joseph t mcgucken in 
1967 that human inequities must take precedence over parish and 
diocesan building programs 
the archbishop argued there was no contradiction between 
building a cathedral and helping the poor the new st marys 
cathedral was dedicated in 1971 
in 1967 episcopal bishop horace w donegan of new york halted 
fundraising to complete the cathedral church of st john the 
divine begun in 1892 he said the structure located on the border 
of harlem would remain unfinished as a witness to the despair 
and anguish of the nearby slums 
this decision was reversed by bishop paul moore in the 1970s 
work has resumed and a fundraising drive is under way aimed at 
completing the cathedral early in the 21st century the diocese has 
launched a program to train young people from harlem and the south 
bronx in stone cutting and stone carving 
although it is a myth that cathedrals are never finished there 
are a number that have been unfinished for some time 
in philadelphia episcopalians broke ground in the 1920s for 
what was planned as the largest gothic cathedral in the world then 
the depression came along and there was a series of bishops who 
were concerned about the edifice complex said the rev tom 
mcclellan rector of st marys at the cathedral the parish church 
on the site 
all that was completed was the apse the front part of the 
church that includes the altar it is now part of st marys the 
diocese decided in 1975 to leave the cathedral unfinished and use 
the 100acre plot as a life care community for retired people 
in seattle ground was broken in 1930 for st marks episcopal 
cathedral there too the depression intervened the building has 
a wooden roof that was intended to be temporary and there has been 
rain damage in the sanctuary the exterior walls are a rough 
surface that was intended to be faced 
lisette trombley publications coordinator for the cathedral 
said a pledge campaign has been started to get the building 
finished starting with the roof

washington national cathedral is only one of 
several names by which the building on washingtons mount st alban 
has been known 
officially it is the cathedral church of st peter and st 
paul the name chosen by the cathedral chapter after the episcopal 
diocese of washington was carved out of the maryland diocese in the 
1890s 
as the building slowly rose and became the site of national 
observances people took to calling it national cathedral 
the late bishop william creighton who took office in 1969 is 
said to have thought this presumptuous so the name used on 
cathedral stationery and publicity was washington cathedral 
one of the three schools on the 57acre cathedral grounds is 
called the national cathedral school for girls 
a few months before his death in 1989 bishop john thomas walker 
approved the use of the name washington national cathedral 
the rev canon john frizell objected to the change in a guest 
editorial in the diocesan newspaper saying it does not do honor 
to other faith communities in this pluralistic country when we 
arrogate to ourselves a title which is illusory misleading and 
potentially divisive 
the rev canon leonard freeman director of communications for 
the cathedral however described the new name as a compromise 
national cathedral has long been kind of the other name of the 
place freeman said noting that the washington metro system uses 
it on bus schedules he said he always called the building national 
cathedral himself before he came to washington 
by any name the cathedral receives no financial support from 
the us government or the national episcopal church it is the 
official seat of the presiding bishop of the church but his office 
is in new york 
over the years many washington churches have come to call 
themselves national there are national presbyterian church 
national city christian church national baptist memorial church 
and the national shrine of the immaculate conception among others

from the start there was debate over whether 
washington national cathedral should be built in the medieval 
gothic style 
in the 1890s as the cathedral was being planned a committee 
voted 12 to 3 to approve a domed renaissancestyle design of white 
marble with a long colonnade submitted by noted american architect 
ernest flagg others favored the greek revival style of many of the 
capitals government buildings 
the cathedral chapter or board of trustees voted unanimously 
on may 21 1906 to build a gothic cathedral instead 
this is probably the last one says stanford lehmberg 
professor of history at the university of minnesota and an 
authority on english cathedrals 
some have questioned the appropriateness of using a 14th century 
style for a cathedral that will be serving 21st century worshipers 
its christianity as it were in a period costume says 
david l holmes jr professor of religion at the college of 
william and mary you have to ask what an unbeliever thinks he 
or she may be awed or may relegate the christian message to an 
irrelevant position because the building is so anachronistic and 
almost disneyland in character 
i dont think that it will ever happen again says ea 
sovik a leading church architect who works in the more modern 
style of the liturgical movement i think that it was a valiant 
gesture but it was started during a period when architecture and 
architects were looking back and not forward 
i think the whole gothic revival was a mistake but within 
that mistake things were done well and done badly and this one 
was done well

when it comes to writing screenplays two cooks 
often come up with a better broth some of hollywoods biggest hits 
have been the result of collaboration between two or more writers 
and in todays electronic age sometimes the collaborators rarely 
see each other in person 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
rarely has a longdistance relationship been so 
blissful 
jim cash and jack epps jr havent seen one another in more than 
a year and have met just five times in the last 14 years they live 
2000 miles apart 
yet they are one of this towns hottest screenwriting teams 
authors of the summer hit dick tracy and the 1986 blockbuster 
top gun as well as legal eagles and the secret of my 
success 
in an industry where collaboration often is considered a 
necessary evil a disruption of ones personal vision cash and 
epps and several other screenwriting partnerships are finding that 
two cooks dont spoil the broth 
indeed as in a good marriage a writing teams sum frequently 
exceeds its parts 
cash works in east lansing mich where he teaches in the film 
program at michigan state university epps writes in culver city 
calif handling much of the teams hollywood business the former 
is good at dialogue while the latter specializes in story 
the two bridge the continental divide with an electronic meeting 
of the minds linked by speakerphone and dual computer screens 
flashing text simultaneously in two cities 
its words and music were good at different things epps 
says and i happen to like the distance its kept us together 
its taken ego out of the equation 
at a time when such actors as bruce willis and arnold 
schwarzenegger command salaries well in excess of 5 million the 
entertainment industry suddenly has rediscovered the value of 
scripts in recent weeks several screenplays have sold for 1 
million and more in frantic bidding wars many of these deals were 
prompted by teamwritten projects 
brian helgeland and manny coto reportedly received 1 million 
for their script ticking man doug richardson and rick jaffa 
collected the same amount for hell bent and back 
the ultimatum written by laurence dworet and robert roy 
pool brought them 1 million pen densham and john watson earned 
12 million for the script prince of thieves 
the ultimate test of a screenwriting team is not the price of a 
single script rather its whether the team can remain together 
consistently creating stories that please film critics and studio 
accountants 
these writers known simply by the names cash amp epps gale amp 
zemeckis gideon amp evans and ganz amp mandel can split 500000 and 
more per script the moneys good and sos the symbiotic link that 
makes the productivity pleasant 
writers feel that given the key role they play in filmmaking 
they dont draw enough credit when a picture flops they take the 
blame when its a smash someone else collects the credit whats 
more just about everybody from the electrician to the gaffer 
believes he or she can make a scene better than the most 
experienced writer 
since so much of the movie business hinges on compromise 
writers working in teams are prepared better for that giveandtake 
its a wonderful thing in life to be heard and understood and 
your partner is always there to hear and understand says lowell 
ganz his nineyear association with babaloo mandel has yielded 
scripts for parenthood the academy awardnominated splash 
cowritten with bruce jay friedman gung ho and night 
shift 
babaloo could go to mars and id wait for him to come back 
ganz says 
other teams joke that they have suicide pacts they cant face 
a blank page of paper alone writers block in a team is a rarity 
when one writer hits a wall the other should be able to take the 
lead 
rick natkin and partner david fuller wrote the scripts for last 
years hbo film the heist and next springs feature the 
taking of beverly hills starring ken wahl 
we entertain each other which makes the lonely task of 
writing so much easier natkin says we always write faster 
than an individual does 
a good writing team should spot a bomb even before the fuse is 
lit dialogue is read aloud plot points are debated and character 
development is argued among the more successful teams theres an 
unbreakable rule if one half of the team doesnt like what the 
other half suggests the idea goes to the dumpster

writing teams tend to write less personal pieces but highly 
plotted pieces says producer lynda obst who cowrote the new 
hollywood novel dirty dreams with carol wolper their scripts 
have less internal logic less of an internal voice theyre not 
literary but they have an external logic that works in this 
business 
obst now making the fisher king with internal films are written 
by people who 
sit up late at night by themselves jim and i are pop writers 
writing for the masses 
some writing teams say differences of opinion rarely spark 
fights others say a bloodletting occasionally brings new life to 
the creative process billy wilders battles with charles brackett 
were legendary and golden the combative duo wrote oscarwinning 
scripts for 1945s the lost weekend and 1950s sunset 
boulevard written with dm marshman jr and the nominated 
script for 1948s a foreign affair written with richard breen 
weve had a lot of screaming says bruce evans whose 
12year association with raynold gideon has given birth to 
screenplays for stand by me an academy award nominee 
starman made in heaven a man a woman and a bank and 
the upcoming the day before midnight 
its very valuable having a partner disagree with you because 
if one partner can convince the other he can probably convince the 
audience too the end product outweighs the pain you have 
getting it like a good marriage evans says 
with most writing teams the screenwriting credit is shared 
evenly and some alternate the order in which their names appear 
the work however sometimes is not split justly 
michael beckner and jim gormans script for texas lead and 
gold recently sold in a deal valued at 1 million beckner is 
considered the writer of the team and gorman the producing partner 
writing little of the script 
novelist roger simon and directorwriter paul mazursky are 
listed as the writers for both enemies a love story and 
scenes from a mall a december release directed by mazursky 
starring woody allen and bette midler scenes from a mall is 
the first film allen has acted in but not directed since 1976s 
the front 
when mazursky works with a partner be it simon or leonidas 
capetanos he confers with his colleague outlining the story 
mazurskys partner then writes a first draft mazursky makes 
revisions to that draft and the process begins again with both 
writers sharing the keyboard 
its sort of like tagteam wrestling says simon im 
slightly more cerebral and hes slightly more theatrical 
although cash and epps work best many miles apart most writing 
teams find proximity improves the product 
ganz and mandel for instance who just finished a script for 
billy crystal titled city slickers sit across from each other 
in a small office before they begin writing their scripts in 
longhand they outline the story on a series of index cards the 
days work is typed up overnight which is reviewed the next 
morning and revised 
when we read what weve just written sometimes we weep 
sometimes we say were out of the business ganz said 
sometimes we dance together in the room

it was where millions of people were introduced 
to america a cavernous building on ellis island in new york 
harbor perhaps the largest building many of them had ever seen 
out of use and neglected for nearly 30 years it has undergone a 
156 million refurbishing and will reopen in september as the 
national museum of immigration 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the noble soaring spaces are radiantly clean 
and dry again light streams in on a summer day on one or two 
patches of wall restorers have left poignant graffiti scribbled 
names and drawings of outstretched hands 
the graffiti was the artwork of immigrants some of the 12 
million people seeking a new life who passed through this main 
building of the ellis island immigration station they were the 
forebears of perhaps 140 million presentday americans 
nowhere else can you say almost half the population of the 
country can trace their ancestry back through this building 
says architect john belle director of a 156 million ellis island 
restoration project 
the architects in charge of the renovations were belles firm 
beyer blinder belle and notter finegold amp alexander they began 
work in 1983 to rescue the 220000squarefoot building neglected 
for more than a quarter of a century and left in a state of 
nearruin it will reopen to the public on sept 10 as the national 
museum of immigration and is expected to draw 2 million visitors a 
year 
we began by getting to know everything about the building by 
documenting it to the umpteenth degree every nook and cranny 
says belle leading a tour of the beauxarts structure 
the familiar warmly handsome horizontal building in limestone 
and brick with four copperdomed towers dominates its island in 
the harbor alongside liberty island 
the present building opened in 1900 replacing an earlier wooden 
structure destroyed by fire in 1897 along with all the records 
the present building continued in use until 1954 when it was 
inherited already in deteriorated condition by the national park 
service 
the original design of the building with its east and west 
wings was a very classical plan and it was also a very efficient 
plan for moving people through belle says now starting in 
september were going to have numbers of people moving through 
again 
in addition to describing the history and experiences of those 
ellis island immigrants the museum will reflect the whole history 
of immigration into this country from all entry points it also 
will present some of the achievements of those immigrants 
visitors will be able to follow the immigrants route through 
the building from the dock where the ferry from manhattan will 
leave them as the steamshipcompany ferries used to leave their 
ancestors theyll walk to the main entrance under an airy new 
canopy described by belle as a contemporary interpretation of 
the original 
belle a native of wales who came to this country in 1959 
specializes in historic preservation in addition to the ellis 
island project he directed the restoration of new york citys 
grand central terminal and the south street seaport museum the 
boston customs house and the delaware aqueduct 
the park service is very strict about never faking history 
belle says thats a philosophy we share we dont want to fool 
anybody with our project this is a very very careful restoration 
when we came in the plaster was on the floor all that has 
gone back in place where elements no longer existed we tried to 
design the modern equivalents history will be the judge you will 
be the judge 
this is an attempt to interpret the building sometimes with 
elements that are not compatible in the design sense but that try 
to tell the story 
most immigrants spent most of their time on ellis island in the 
second floor registry room in its heyday it routinely handled 
5000 to 7000 people a day april 17 1907 is believed to have 
been the peak day when 11747 came through 
to many it must have seemed huge and intimidating the 
largest building theyd ever seen in their lives filled with 
noise a babel of languages belle says 
and the lamps glittering along the balconies and shining down 
from the chandeliers would have been the first time many of them 
coming from small villages and simple ways of life ever saw 
electric light 
at the far end of the great chamber is a memorable staircase 
the one by which immigrants left after negotiating the nervous 
passage through desks and register books and questioning officers 
the exit was to one of three destinations down one of the three 
lanes separated by the staircases two rails 
on the left you were off to catch a ferry into manhattan on 
the right to buy your ticket for a train heading out west but the 
center lane was the stair of separation down which immigrants 
were detoured for further formalities entry to the promised land 
heartsinkingly postponed 
they may have found themselves pleading their cases in the 
special inquiry room a kind of court of last appeal this is one 
of the few rooms that will be left as a period room with its 
carved wooden railings directing anxious steps toward the judges 
table 
many other interiors have been designed to accommodate exhibits 
not to simulate the rooms early appearance 
in addition to the major exhibition areas there are a library 
and reading room an oral history center with a recording studio 
where immigrants and former employees may chronicle their memories 
and a listening center where others may hear these recordings 
other public amenities include orientation areas museum shops 
two 146seat movie theaters meeting rooms and a restaurant with a 
terrace overlooking the harbor a curatorial complex contains 
offices research facilities and conservation labs

it pains lawyernovelist scott f turow that 
some big city critics have dismissed his work as unimportant it 
hurts a lot until he looks at his bank balance the author of 
presumed innocent has learned to spin best sellers from his 
experiences as both a prosecutor and a defense attorney 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
as a prosecutor who turned defense attorney 
novelist scott f turow knows how to mine the shadowy regions of 
the legal profession 
in turows fiction prosecutors are violated and when the 
defense rests it may be in the bed of the clients mistress in 
turows real life judges have been jailed and yesterdays 
prosecutorial target may be todays client 
at age 41 turow now a partner in a major chicago law firm is 
twofortwo on the fiction bestseller lists reaping considerable 
national publicity and fat paychecks 
all i can say is they wont be holding any tag days for scott 
turow he said in a telephone interview while on tour promoting 
his second published novel burden of proof 
in 1986 turow stepped down after eight years as an assistant 
us attorney in chicago he got a record 200000 advance for his 
first published novel presumed innocent and watched it climb 
to the top of the hardbound bestseller lists that was followed by 
43 million paperback sales and a 1 million movie rights deal 
the 20 million movie starring harrison ford and directed by 
alan pakula recently opened 
the publicity surrounding presumed innocent made much of the 
fact that a highprofile prosecutor had written a thriller about a 
prosecutor being tried for murder it was not noted widely that 
turows only job since graduating from harvard law school had been 
with the us attorneys office which does not handle murder cases 
perhaps coincidentally the prosecutorasdefendant theme had 
appeared in one of turows own reallife cases that of 
thenillinois attorney gen william j scott turow was one of the 
federal attorneys who obtained a tax fraud conviction against the 
states chief prosecutor in 1980 
i realize now and i think my wife annette understood 
before i did that writing about the prosecution of a prosecutor 
was part of my preparation to do defense work turow said 
defense attorney phillip kurland argued in his unsuccessful 
appeal of scotts conviction that turow and his federal colleagues 
had turned the trial into a roman circus 
the phrase found a possibly subconscious echo in presumed 
innocent when hero rusty sabich likens his murder trial to 
christians and lions back in rome 
before leaving his federal post turow also saw more legal 
ambiguities through his involvement in operation greylord the 
federal probe that sent many cook county circuit court judges to 
prison 
the turn to defense work which coincided with the publication 
of presumed innocent brought turow to sonnenschein nath amp 
rosenthal a 300attorney firm with offices in six cities 
i suppose you could say im a specialist in whitecollar 
criminal defense mostly in the grand jury phase he said none 
of my clients are currently under indictment although several are 
under investigation 
ive walked both sides of the street now and i really can see 
the system from both sides 
turow once got a slap on the wrist from the 11th us circuit 
court of appeals in atlanta 
in 1987 a miami cocaine trafficking defendant named ronald 
ofshe sought to have his indictment dismissed because his defense 
attorney marvin glass was serving as a federal drug informant 
glass himself was a defendant in the chicago greylord probe and 
was negotiating with turow for leniency with turows permission 
glass had secretly taperecorded at least one of his conversations 
with ofshe 
although the appellate court refused to dismiss ofshes 
indictment it appended a footnote calling turows agreement with 
glass reprehensible and recommending that turow be investigated 
by attorney registration officials in chicago 
turows former superiors in the us justice department later 
exonerated him but the appeals court refused to strike the 
footnote from the record 
turow was asked if the incident may have been reflected in 
burden of proof in which the lawyerhero burglarizes his own 
clients house and also has a romantic scene in a hot tub with his 
prosecutorial adversary 
theres no doubt that that contributed to my analysis of the 
attorneyclient relationship turow said everything after 
all becomes fodder for the fictional mill in retrospect im just 
glad i could find something useful in something that was very 
painful and i still feel very unneccessary 
some critics have objected to the frequent sex scenes in 
burden of proof as unconvincing but the author says that only 
the ultimately platonic hottub tryst caused him problems 
i really had to work up my nerve to write it and submit it 
he said 
presumed innocent had its steamy scenes too but the 
critics found them more acceptable in what was at heart a 
traditional and gritty murder mystery 
one of the exalted things about the mystery novel is its 
architecture says turow who taught creative writing at stanford 
university before going to law school 
while at stanford turow says he made three serious attempts 
to get a novel published and once cranked out a novel in three 
weeks to win a bet 
im not sure i really won he says in retrospect 
turows first published book was one l a nonfiction 
account of his first year at harvard law school written on 
contract but he says his early unpublished works may have helped 
him escape the second novel jinx 
maybe my good fortune with my second novel was that it aint 
my second novel he says 
reviews of burden of proof although less enthusiastic than 
those for presumed innocent tended to be favorable with 
several critics suggesting it was a more serious work than its 
predecessor 
of course the bad ones hurt turow said of the reviews 
but theyve been running about 8 or 9to1 favorably i 
sometimes wonder if some of the negative reviewers arent out to 
get me but theres always that old lawyers adage reasonable 
minds can differ 
and then again no tag days

when kevin conway the star of other peoples money left 
the play gallin replaced him with stephen keats an experienced 
stage actor but not known to most theatergoers 
we are kind of at the point in our run where we are a bit 
ambivalent gallin says of the play which has been running in 
new york since february 1989 we dont think we need a name yet 
but it would be nice to eventually have one 
and most television actors welcome the prestige of appearing on 
broadway 
i cant let opportunities like this go by busfield says 
ive been in the movie field of dreams ive been in a hit 
television series i needed a play i needed to establish to myself 
and to the people in this business that i can be a lead in a play 
and the play wont fall apart and close in one night 
perlman wasnt pursuing theater roles when he was offered the 
job in a few good men to replace stephen lang and quickly took 
it 
i use the same criteria for wanting to do this job as i use 
for any job perlman says is the role challenging is it 
allowing me to explore parts of humanity i havent had the chance 
to tap into is it a role i can have respect and enthusiasm for 
television stars coming to the new york theater are nothing new 
lucille ball tried it in 1960 with the musical wildcat it ran 
only six months closing when ball became ill and left the show 
mary tyler moore has played broadway several times with varying 
degrees of success her first attempt right after the dick van 
dyke show in 1963 was breakfast at tiffanys a huge flop 
that closed in previews and never officially opened her costar 
was richard chamberlain of dr kildare fame she had more luck 
replacing tom conti in whose life is it anyway in which the 
playwright changed the leading character from a man to a woman to 
accommodate the actress 
despite the powerful presence of tyne daly in gypsy its 
producer barry weissler discounts the attraction of television 
names to theater audiences movie stars like kathleen turner and 
dustin hoffman sell tickets he says 
tv stars do not sell tickets because the people who made them 
television stars dont go to the theater he says they watch 
television 
with gypsy we were up and down on the road before coming to 
new york weissler said it was an enormous risk but we had 
two things going for us we had a brilliant show and a woman 
playing rose who had the talent had she not been able to come up 
to the role we would have been dead in the water because she 
surprised everyone it helped us that had nothing to do with star 
power that had to do with people telling their friends youve 
got to see this 
still weissler cast lavin as dalys replacement 
linda is a very wellknown broadway stage actress he says 
so shes going to draw the theater public but she also hit it 
big with alice so maybe tourists coming in during the summer 
might choose to see gypsy because they remember the show i might 
have a double punch going for me 
producer james walsh toured im not rappaport the comedy by 
herb gardner with its original stars judd hirsh late of 
taxi and cleavon little star of the mel brooks movie comedy 
blazing saddles 
it probably was the most successful tour of a play anyone has 
done in the last decade he said we broke house records 
sometimes you can send a very good play out and because you 
want to satisfy the need for a star you end up doing half the 
production you should be doing 
when walsh sends his current broadway hit the heidi 
chronicles out on the road this fall the star in los angeles and 
possibly other cities will be amy irving an actress with theater 
and movie credits but without proven boxoffice appeal 
i dont want to take someone from a television series if they 
cant act on stage walsh says so i think its a better break 
for an audience if you get somebody who is really good who may or 
may not have a high profile but will serve the play so if i dont 
deliver them a big star i can promise them a really good 
production

in the brief ringing silence after the 
tornado passed donna ray realized 15monthold benjamin was gone 
the 250 mph wind had torn the rays only son from his mothers 
arms their trailer home had exploded the family of six was 
suddenly five 
i was the one who had hold of benny i was supposed to have 
held on to him and not let anything hurt him donna said 
theres nothing worse than knowing you cant keep things from 
hurting your kids that youve got no control 
and no one to blame it was nobodys fault donnas husband 
tim said flatly it is the tragedys randomness that is hardest to 
take 
i just want him back want to watch him grow up donna 
said we tried so long to have a little boy and then we get him 
and hes gone 
said geneva speer the babys greataunt they had three girls 
and wanted a boy so bad they really couldnt afford to have all 
them kids but they kept having them until they got them a boy 
more than a month after benjamins death the rays still are 
revisiting the moments before everything stopped making sense they 
retrace their steps but know there is no changing them 
the june 2 storm which killed eight people and injured 180 was 
the worst to hit indiana in 16 years it spun through town in four 
minutes devouring the rays home at riverview trailer park in 
seconds 
tim donna and their three young daughters were scattered in 
hospital emergency rooms their lives uprooted like the grove of 20 
poplar trees that used to shade the familys trailer on hot august 
afternoons 
the twoacre trailer park now resembles a haunted battleground 
littered with the munitions of everyday life dads ratchet the 
dogs rubber ball moms ironing board and the childrens 
brightcolored toys 
the thing that keeps us going are the three little girls we 
can still pick them up and hold them said tim 31 a wiry man 
with a freckled face but my little boy i was not ready to 
give him up 
the tornado struck without warning 
wed just come home from the store id no more than got the 
water on to boiling for dinner said donna 27 who first saw the 
greentinted sky churning outside the kitchen window 
they say tornados make a noise but we didnt hear anything 
we were already in the middle of it she said 
donna screamed for her husband get in back tim shouted 
the lights flickered then went out 
each parent grabbed two children donna had her left arm wrapped 
around benny with her right she dragged 6yearold abby by her 
blueflowered summer dress get in back tim screamed again 
too late the trailers four walls blew out donna looked down 
the ground was swirling beneath her hold on to benny hold on she 
thought 
then benny was gone oh my god donna cried and fell to the 
ground the tornado had passed 
when tim opened his eyes he saw benny lying facedown a few 
feet from his unconscious mother i picked him up and he was real 
limp tim said it was quiet like in a desert there was just 
silence all around 
then came tears 
abby ginny 7 and 3yearold melissa were halfburied by 
debris their pale skin gashed and wispy brown hair matted with 
blood tim groped toward them pulling himself out of the mud each 
time his broken leg collapsed 
donna soon came around but she still was in a daze 
all i could think about was getting help said donna whose 
forehead was slashed and collarbone broken when the winds current 
dropped her 
i wanted to get benny in the car because it was raining and 
cold i was telling myself im going to get help im going to 
take him to the hospital 
the rays strapped the baby into his car seat but they knew 
benny was motionless silent showed no sign of breathing his soft 
skull had been crushed 
i just didnt want to admit that it could be my baby that was 
taken said donna her expression more blank than bitter 
the funeral was a blur sad embraces prayers led by a 
pentecostal minister whom tim met back when he first started 
working at a local fastfood restaurant 10 years ago it took only 
two pallbearers to lift the blue metal casket into the hearse 
faith is the frequent counsel in this town of 14000 people 42 
christian churches and about 75 pastors 
friends and strangers tell the rays that benjamin is gods child 
now its of little comfort 
some would say its an act of god but try telling that to 
the woman whose baby is jerked out of her arms said the rev max 
toliver a methodist minister whose neighboring trailer also was 
destroyed in the storm 
tim and donna who dont attend church regularly have 
gratefully accepted prayers bibles pamphlets and other gestures 
meant to ease their despair they know about counseling the books 
on loss and talk shows on pain 
but nothing works nothing can restore benny or the domestic 
dream tim and donna nearly grasped before they were sucked into the 
vortex 
when we got married i set some goals i wanted to have little 
boys and ive always wanted to have a garden fence off a place 
get the kids a pony maybe build them a big old playhouse tim 
said 
that was eight years ago when the couple set out to create the 
kind of large and closeknit family they knew as kids growing up in 
this rural area about 60 miles south of indianapolis 
the night the tornado hit tim and donna were feeling good 
theyd made a dent in their debts and set aside part of the 
20000ayear salary tim earns managing a local hardees 
restaurant they were planning to buy a piece of land somewhere in 
the rolling green country near here 
now they are living in a rental house stocked and paid for with 
thousands of dollars from strangers family and friends like tims 
coworkers at hardees restaurants 
this community is a family said donna i dont know how 
were ever going to thank them and that bothers us

accepting the spontaneous charity has been painful for the rays 
who have always done for themselves they are the kind of people 
who fix their own cars or sew their own clothes as much out of 
pride as practicality 
they also took pride in their baby pictures and birth 
certificates the girls favorite dolls tims comic book 
collection donnas halfsewn dress even the red polkadot cutouts 
for learning abcs all of which the tornado spewed over miles of 
wooded and rainsoaked land 
you can tell they loved their kids a lot just look at all 
these toys said the rev johnny johnson of dive christian church 
he was among a band of family neighbors and preachers who in 
the hot days following the storm showed up to save for the rays 
what muddied belongings they could they burned the rest 
when i first saw this i went home and cried said beth 
cooper a mother of two who showed up to help a couple shed never 
met i suddenly knew how close we are to dust 
now in the wreckage of their lives the rays see the normalcy 
they once had the sense of control they are struggling to regain 
they are looking now for some small order amid the chaos 
donna wants a new blue mailbox with a red flag like the one she 
used to visit each day for bills and the occasional card when 
cuddles one of two family dogs turned up alive miles from home it 
was as though the slightly terrorized shaggy pup was a gift from 
god 
youve got to have certainties johnson said tossing a 
tattered garment into the bonfire they give you hope strength 
goals and everybody needs those because evidently what you own 
is not for certain 
tim and donna still are thinking about what they want on their 
sons headstone most likely it will be something simple our 
little benny 
mommy did benjamin die abby asked not long after the 
storm he went to heaven didnt he 
yes he did donna told her 
were telling the kids that he went to heaven i think it 
helps them she said but me i just want him back

15monthold son thrusting benjamin into the maelstrom when the 
tornado passed wreckage of the rays lives was everywhere to see

for miles and worst of all the lifeless body of their only son 
the boy they had wanted so much my little boy i was not

just in from the big sky country harrison ford 
faced a peril as hazardous as any encountered by han solo and 
indiana jones the press tour 
ford is a private man and he approaches an interview with the 
zest of roseanne barr facing a diet his verbal fencing especially 
on personal matters is notorious with news types 
jim brown of the today show recently tried to wheedle ford 
into disclosing the sex of his unborn baby ford knew but declined 
to say the baby turned out to be a girl born june 30 
unlike some major stars ford feels a responsibility to the 
studios who pay him huge salaries for his work upwards of 7 
million hence he came here for two grueling days of radio tv and 
print interviews for presumed innocent the warner bros film 
based on scott turows blockbuster book also taking part were 
costars bonnie bedelia brian dennehy raul julia and paul 
winfield and director alan j pakula 
his coworkers had revealing things to say about ford 
bedelia the film was the first time i had met him hes a 
very interior type of person he keeps his own counsel i think 
hes a marvelous actor in this picture he was very soulful 
he was very giving generous sensitive a lovely man 
winfield harrison and i first met when we were both under 
contract to columbia pictures in the mid1960s i was brought in 
after the watts riots because the studios decided they needed angry 
young men and i fit into that category it was the end of the 
contract period and the only friend i made was harrison he 
was the same as he is now except hes a lot richer 
pakula i thought of harrison from the beginning i wanted 
someone who was like everyman who had an allamerican kind of 
quality i am interested in characters who are twosided who 
can be a collection of opposites 
harrison is very bright he has a sense of storytelling 
especially a complicated story like this one its great to have 
someone who says have you told that does the audience 
understand that explain that to me i said to my wife 
harrison asks simple questions that sometimes have very 
complicated answers 
pakula added that he had worked with three people who became 
academy award directors james l brooks warren beatty and robert 
redford ford could have equal success if he wanted to turn 
director pakula said he doesnt acting is enough challenge for 
him 
in presumed innocent ford portrays a married prosecutor 
accused of murdering a beautiful colleague greta scacchi with 
whom he had a flaming affair the role calls for greater depth of 
feeling than ford has displayed on the screen before nothing 
unusual he said 
it seems to me its the same job every time trying to figure 
out what the ideas are and to give them expression the more of an 
idea there is the easier it is to give it life this was a 
character that was extremely wellwritten and had great complexity 
and the complexity was wellknit to the plot it was really an easy 
part to play 
ford had not read the turow novel and he held off until he 
could see the movie script by frank pierson and pakula 
i didnt want to prejudice my impression of the screenplay 
he said i immediately read the book afterward then i worked 
with alan for six or eight months before the films started 
the role is far far removed from fords portrayals in the 
star wars and indiana jones movies mixing drama and action 
has been part of his strategy it has always been my intention 
that that might help to keep my career alive i like doing 
different kinds of films i like facing different kinds of 
challenges 
ford grew up in suburban chicago drifted into acting at ripon 
college mostly as a way to meet women after a stint in summer 
stock he drove to california in 1964 with his new wife mary 
marquardt the columbia contract proved a dead end and harrison 
made more money from carpentry than from acting 
did he grow impatient in those years 
often he said impatient and frustrated but when i look 
back on it i really did know from the very beginning that it was 
the kind of job that took a long time to get into and that the 
really secret of it all was just outlasting the competition and not 
giving up as well as taking that period of time to develop your 
craft and to mature 
between building houses ford appeared in tv serials and such 
films as the conversation and american graffiti 
when i went away to do star wars i had the feeling that i 
might be packing up my carpentry stuff for the last time he 
recalled after that i was able to work when i wanted to work 
ford and his second wife screenwriter melissa matheson et 
the extraterrestrial make their home amid the tetons of 
wyoming about as far from the hollywood scene as is possible when 
the actor goes filming the entire family goes with him including 
son malcolm 3 and when theyre able two collegeage sons from 
the first marriage 
ford continues with drama in his next film regarding henry 
with mike nichols his director in working girl the role casts 
ford as a successful new york lawyer who becomes an amnesiac after 
being shot in the head therapy allows him to reinvent his life and 
relationships 
and if harrison ford could reinvent his life 
a faint grin appeared on the handsome face 
im quite happy with what ive got i cant imagine doing much 
better

doc tate nevaquaya doesnt know what course 
his life might have taken if his cousins hadnt happened along 
while he was trying to hitchhike 
i was going to oklahoma city to join the marine corps 
recalls nevaquaya they bought me a ticket and put me on thece kansas 
to enroll in a trade school i had 35 cents 
in my pocket 
times have changed for nevaquaya since then he no bus 
for lawrenw is an 
internationally acclaimed artist whose work includes designing a 
shield on the tomb of the unknowns at arlington national cemetery 
he also sold a painting to englands queen elizabeth ii for about 
1200 
nevaquaya paints in the traditional twodimensional indian 
style which often has the main object or feature outlined some 
work is a flat dimension resulting in a semiabstract work his 
canvas native american church depicts 16 figures involved in 
religious ceremonies 
nevaquayas paintings range in price from 500 tp 7000 
most of his work is done in watercolor i feel that most 
closely depicts the effects of the earth pigments nevaquaya 
says for some work he mixes the watercd interest in the indian flute

hailed him for being one of the few remaining artists to link 
past generations with the future 
people have asked me to play the flute for everything from 
banquets to weddings and church services nevaquaya says 
former us senator fred harris flew me to washington to play at 
the wedding of his daughter 
nevaquaya also has been the subject of television documentaries 
has appeared with country music star roy clark has played at the 
kennedy center for performing arts in washington and appeared on 
british television while on a goodwill tour sponsored by the state 
department and the smithsonian institution he has appeared in 
concerts or lectures in europe and the far east 
nevaquaya has taken the grand award for his paintings at various 
art shows including exhibitions in chicago and albuquerque nm 
however there was a time when the future didnt look all that 
bright 
nevaquaya formally joyce lee tate nevaquaya was orphaned when 
he was 13 he lived for a time with an older brother in the 
apachefletcher area of rural southern oklahoma both the nickname 
doc and the joyce are in honor of dr cw joyce a physician for 
whom many indian children in the fletcher area were named 
it was while he was living with his brother that he started that 
fateful trip to oklahoma city to enlist in the marines 
i had just started hitchhiking when my cousins picked me 
up nevaquaya says if they hadnt come by within a few 
minutes my whole life might have been changed 
nevaquaya says his brother didnt know where he was or where he 
had gone until he wrote him a letter from the trade school which 
now is haskell indian junior college 
although nevaquaya says he painted and sketched in the 1940s he 
stayed away from the art classes while attending the fort sill 
indian school because he did not like the policy that discouraged 
all painting except portrayals of traditional indian culture 
his interest in art was honed by the fact that an early neighbor 
had been allan houser a painter who now is an acclaimed sculptor 
he later met and became friends with artist black moon riddles 
although he sold a few of his paintings in the early 1950s he 
painted and sketched in his spare time while holding down a job 
then in 1955 doris littrell of oklahoma city sought him out after 
seeing some of his work at the southern plains indian museum in 
anadarko 
from that point on nevaquaya made art his vocation 
nevaquaya is in demand for his expertise with the indian flute 
as are his paintings by collectors throughout the world he 
frequently holds workshops at high schools and colleges and has 
taught his sons he has five along with four daughters to play 
the flute 
but although his fortune has changed for the better nevaquaya 
still lives in the rural town of apache and instead of a fancy 
northernlighted studio he still paints at home on a table in his 
bedroom

critics can be found in the strangest 
places try the back seat of chrissie hyndes car 
one evening this spring the pretenders leader popped a working 
tape of her bands new album into the cassette deck of her car she 
drove in circles around regents park in london trying to decide if 
the running order of the songs made musical sense 
hyndes 5 and 7yearold daughters were dozing in the back seat 
or so she thought suddenly a small voice peeped up from behind 
mummy her youngest daughter asked can we hear sense of 
purpose again 
smart kid the longingforlove ballad is probably the best of 
12 songs on packed the first new pretenders album since 1986 
since the early 1980 release of a debut pretenders album that 
has aged into a classic hyndes life and band have changed 
considerably her music hasnt 
hynde is the only constant in the pretenders life over the 
years shes seen two band members die drugrelated deaths fired a 
drummer and seen another guitarist quit to join paul mccartneys 
band 
she insists the pretenders are still a band although she and 
drummer blair cunningham are currently the only members the search 
is on for a guitarist and bass player in time for a tour of the 
united states expected to start in late september 
hyndes two daughters are aware of what their mother does for a 
living but the car ride was the first time she remembered them 
reacting to her work they usually listen to their nannys opera or 
classical recordings 
i feel like im more humanitarian because of my relationship 
as a mother she said during a recent interview when i walk 
through central park i want to be seen in the community as a 
mother i dont want to be seen as a celebrity or a show business 
figure 
her children are the product of relationships with fellow 
musicians ray davies of the kinks and jim kerr of simple minds she 
married kerr but theyre now separated 
motherhood hasnt necessarily softened the outspoken woman who 
wrote tattooed love boys just ask her opinion about the 
nations drug war more about that later 
but the differences in her life have obviously changed her 
approach to work its the chief reason why there was a fouryear 
gap between pretenders albums 
since ive been in the hotel the past week i wake up at 6 
oclock in the morning and the first thing i do is reach for a 
guitar said hynde who was over from london for a publicity tour 
i havent done that for years she said when im home 
the first thing i do is go downstairs and turn the television off 
and get breakfast together for the kids 
the new album she said is me going back down to my medium 
after recording her last disc while caring for an infant 
packed is a combination of hardnosed rockers such as hold 
a candle to this and downtown akron and such ballads as 
lets make a pact and when will i see you 
in spots it sounds eerily like the first pretenders album too 
much so for some critics tastes whove pointed out the 
similarity of packed to some of hyndes past work most often 
cited is the mournful first single never do that a close 
cousin to back on the chain gang 
thats ok hynde said let them all talk 
theyre allowed to say whatever they want she said if 
thats how they see it thats how they see it fine i use the 
same five chords rearrange them talk about different things and 
have different melodies i dont consciously think oh no this 
sounds too much like something else 
packed contains hyndes second song about her hometown of 
akron ohio the first my city was gone bemoans the citys 
economic slump downtown is about how the 1980s mall culture 
affected the city 
the critical eye she displays in the two songs doesnt lessen 
her feelings for her hometown she said she had a great time in 
her most recent visit hynde even toyed with the idea of buying a 
house where she used to live in the early 1970s but was 
sidetracked when she got back to london 
that visit also taught the 37yearold hynde an art student at 
kent state university at the time of vietnam war demonstrations 
how things have changed in the country she left in the mid1970s 
when i went to my high school reunion and tried to roll a 
joint half the room turned into my parents she said and shes 
angry about the rightwing fervor that has lumped marijuana use 
with harder drugs as criminal behavior 
as far as im concerned i reserve the right to smoke an herb 
that grows in the ground she said i dont drink i dont 
smoke cigarettes i dont take any drugs im completely 
vegetarian i lead a nice clean easy life and dont cause any 
trouble the fact that im automatically of a criminal status 
because i smoke pot her voice trailed off 
hyndes musical career took shape in londons fertile punk scene 
during the late 1970s 
these days shes found planning a tour is a lot more 
complicated than piling everyone into a van hynde may be the first 
rocker whose work schedule may be partly governed by her nanny 
my nannys in school training to be a dance therapist for deaf 
children she said i am sort of planning my career around her 
schedule because i like her shes part of the family and its 
important to have a secure setup its give and take

irving berlin once insisted there were nine 
rules to writing popular songs 
they must be original easy to sing easy to remember 
sexless so that a man or woman could perform them and should 
have attentiongetting titles but most important berlin stated 
the song writer must look upon his work as a business that is 
to make a success of it he must work and work and then work 
and he meant it american music it seems was created on a 
thousand restless nights by a shy little man with a high voice who 
insisted i sweat blood between 3 and 6 many mornings and when 
the drops that fall off my forehead hit the paper theyre notes 
he liked to write in the evening sleep in the morning and pitch 
songs in the afternoon sometimes he didnt bother sleeping 
on a winters night in 1941 berlin began working on white 
christmas he finished it the next morning and raced over to his 
office telling his stunned transcriber that not only is it the 
best song i ever wrote its the best song anybody ever wrote 
berlin always seemed to have a plan in 1909 he set himself a 
goal of writing four to five songs a night creating an enormous 
backlog of unused or trunk songs god bless america among 
them 
nearly 80 years later steven spielberg tried to negotiate for 
film rights to the great love song always but the director was 
curtly informed that berlin wanted to use it for a project never 
started of his own the movie also called always was 
released in december 1989 three months after the songwriters 
death at age 101 
what kept him going according to laurence bergreen author of 
the comprehensive biography as thousands cheer the life of 
irving berlin 2495 viking it wasnt love or greed or even 
artistic ambition the sound of applause the need for the publics 
approval was the songwriters greatest inspiration the author said 
he began by singing for pennies and nickels in the sidewalks 
of new york explained bergreen also author of james agee a 
life 
if people liked what he sang they gave him money and if they 
didnt like it they didnt give him money and he didnt eat 
you wrote songs they were performed and the audience heard 
it you would stay up all night and fix it to and try to make it 
better thats how you developed with the immediate feedback 
bergreen raises the same question again and again how did 
berlin remain so prolific for so long how did he change with the 
times for nearly 40 years until another selfmade man named elvis 
presley redefined popular music and pushed a frustrated berlin into 
retirement 
he was totally market driven bergreen said i think 
whats remarkable is that every 10 years or so he tried to reinvent 
himself as a songwriter popular songwriters then tended to come 
and go as quickly as they do now 
he consciously adapted himself to changing styles ragtime in 
the teens alexanders ragtime band to sob songs in the 20s 
always to romantic ballads cheek to cheek in the 30s in 
the 40s you notice a pronounced influence of swing music i got 
the sun in the morning 
irving berlin was born israel baline on may 11 1888 the son of 
a russian cantor and one of eight children his family emigrated to 
the united states in 1893 and settled into the heavily populated 
jewish community of manhattans lower east side 
while his parents and siblings stuck to the ways of the old 
country even speaking in yiddish berlin raced into the new world 
hustling to get out of his familys cramped dirty tenement as 
quickly as possible and make it to the classy world that waited 
uptown 
he hawked newspapers spoke in colorful new york slang earned 
coins as a singing waiter eventually he changed his name and 
tried writing his own songs reasoning once you start singing 
you start thinking of writing songs its as simple as that 
he wrote his first song marie from sunny italy in 1908 and 
soon joined a music publishing house called waterson amp snyder in 
1911 berlin contributed four songs to the ziegfield follies and 
hammered out alexanders ragtime band a lively update of the 
classic ragtime made popular by scott joplin in 1899 
like any quickthinking kid berlin was looking for an angle a 
gimmick some way to grab onto a trend and seized on ragtime as 
the answer but he was also willing to take chances play with the 
rules and invent the rules 
alexanders ragtime band the name inspired by the 
derogatorially named coon songs that had alexander in the 
title combined popular black and white music mixing ragtime and 
march the chorus ran 32 bars double the usual length and the 
song changed key in midcourse another innovation 
i humbly began to study my own song asking myself why 
why berlin recalled in 1915 reflecting on its international 
success 
and i got an answer its opening words emphasized by 
immediate repitition come on and hear come on and hear were 
an invitation to come and join in and hear the singer and his 
song 
there were distinctive yard marks in his songs that you could 
see bergreen said puttin on the ritz on the one hand and 
god bless america as the other you had anthems of basic american 
events white christmas easter parade ragtime songs like 
alexanders ragtime band 
and there was the counterpoint song just in love play a 
simple melody an old fashioned wedding there were two songs 
kind of going at the same time two singers singing against each 
other 
berlin could neither read nor write music and his business 
skills were equally crude equally effective he had dropped out of 
school at age 14 to earn money and had to scramble around town 
pitching his songs to publishers until his death in 1989 his 
office never had a computer 
but if berlin sweated blood as a businessman the drops that 
fell quickly turned to cash he realized early on that publishing 
was where the most money could be made and held on stubbornly to 
the rights of his songs boasting for years that he received the 
highest royalty payments in the nation

i think there are twin facts of the same painstaking 
approach bergreen said he was just as careful at selling 
songs as he was writing them he would make the rounds of the music 
stores to make sure the sheet music was stocked on the shelfs and 
would get angry if it wasnt selling 
berlins last major success came in 1950 with the musical call 
me madam five years later rock n roll ended his career and 
those of many tin pan alley writers 
he came to a country where you could do anything you want 
bergreen said his patriotism was incredible it was his 
religion thats what he believed in god bless america a 
merging of patriotic and religious sentiments 
with the rise of rock n roll everything he stood for tin 
pan alley and classical writing and the american values went out of 
favor 
berlin tried in 1962 he broke a fiveyear silence and 
announced he was working on a musical satire on the kennedys called 
mr president there were 22 songs including washington 
twist a take on the latest dance craze more than 1 million 
worth of tickets were sold before the cast was even announced 
it was a disaster elliot norton of the record american in 
boston labeled it dreadful anything milder would be 
misleading not to say dishonest when the show opened at the 
national theatre in washington president kennedy didnt show up 
until the second act and left soon after six months later with 
advance tickets used up the show quickly closed 
you dont have to stop yourself from writing songs a 
shaken berlin said in a radio interview the people who have to 
listen to your songs tell you to stop 
berlin outlived his peers harold arlen george gershwin cole 
porter jerome kern he outlived his siblings he outlived his two 
favorite performers ethel merman and fred astaire he outlived his 
wife of more than 60 years ellin mackey who died on july 29 1988 
and he even outlived some of his songs in 1986 alexanders 
ragtime band turned 75 lost its protection under united states 
copyright law and became part of the public domain an area berlin 
himself had long occupied 
he hoped that hollywood would produce a musical retrospective of 
his work say it with music but the deal fell through berlin 
spent most of his remaining years in virtual seclusion refusing 
interviews and making angry profanitylaced phone calls to 
journalists and friends who talked about him publicly 
he stayed at his house in manhattan bergreen said he 
watched a lot of television and rarely saw anyone except for the 
barber or his doctor or servants 
he built up a small network of music historians and pundits in 
the field of popular music and would endlessly talk shop with 
them also harold arlen that was how he stayed in touch with the 
world 
berlin avoided tributes including a lavish celebration of his 
100th birthday at carnegie hall that featured frank sinatra 
leonard bernstein and a chorus of girl and boy scouts 
he did however appear before an audience one last time 
john wallowitch a composer and cabaret singer had lived near 
the songwriter for years and the two occasionally chatted in the 
street he soon began an annual tradition on christmas eve 
wallowitch would stop in front of berlins building and softly sing 
white christmas his own private ceremony 
soon others joined him and they began to sing out loud by 
1983 there were 17 carolers 
it was 4 degrees and the place was dark wallowitch recalled 
in a telephone interview i never thought he was there it was 
just symbolic but one friend of mine said we should ring the 
droobell he might be there 
i finally rang the bell and the housekeeper answered we said 
we were serenading mr berlin and she said she was going to tell 
him he came down in his bathrobe and slippers and invited us in 
he said it was the nicest christmas present he ever had 
we told him we were coming back for the next 77 years to do 
that and he said good good we were all in a state of shock 
we floated out of there and went back to my house we sang his 
songs for 2 hours without repeating one of them

arachnophobia 
just when you thought it was safe to go play in the barn along 
comes a spider who makes killer bees look like bambi 
frank marshalls arachnophobia is the first release from the 
walt disney cos new hollywood pictures and steven spielbergs 
amblin entertainment spielberg is also coexecutive producer with 
marshall 
the movie has all the slick production values of a spielberg 
venture as well as the picture book americana that seem to 
permeate his movies it also is highly derivative of other scare 
movies even down to the norman bates shower scene in this case 
the specter of death is a spider 
but is arachnophobia really really scary no is it 
unsettling on occasion is it amusing sometimes is it 
entertaining yes 
the movie opens in the plump rain forests of venezuela where dr 
james atherton julian sands is seeking new insects for tagging 
and study his photographer jerry manley is bitten by a huge 
spider and dies only no one really knows it was a spider bite 
that did him in his body is shipped back to his hometown canaima 
calif named by the filmmakers after the venezuelan town where the 
movie was filmed with a stowaway the spider 
once in the canaima mortuary with the ancient gag of a 
sandwichchomping undertaker the spider escapes to the outside 
world terrorizing a dog and cat a hungry grackle plucks up the 
spider in its beak the spider bites the bird and the feathered 
creature falls dead right in front of the barn of the jennings 
family who have just moved from the perils of san francisco for 
the safety of the country 
oh happy day new meat 
ross jennings jeff daniels is a family doctor about to take 
over the practice of a country quack sam metcalf henry jones 
who at the last minute decides to stay on with the first death 
from a spider bite jennings one and only patient the two 
doctors lock heads over cause of death and an autopsy 
the next victim is also someone jennings examines and he soons 
earns the nickname even from his own kids of dr death 
the victims multiply and so do the arachnids 
there are the usual nearmisses jennings daughter shelley is 
playing with the her friend bunny beechwood a spider nears her 
foot ready to bite she doesnt see him but springs to her feet 
just as hes a lick away drops a book on top and then nonchalantly 
steps on the book 
there are also the usual missightings jennings awakens in the 
middle of the night in a cold sweat staring at the wall beyond the 
bed he shares with his wife molly harley jane kozak theres a 
spot and it looks like a giant ugly spider he 
eases from the bed to the wall but even before his toe touches the 
floor we know its a coat hook and the thrill that should come 
from his approach simply isnt there 
but what arachnophobia lacks in chills it more than makes 
up for in humor thanks especially to john goodman as delbert 
mcclintock bugs begone exterminating company the rambo of bug 
exterminators delbert reaches into his truck for his private 
stock bug killer straps on the nozzles and outfits himself for 
bug war now lets rock n roll 
he makes our day he also makes this movie because by and 
large arachnobobia lacks bite it doesnt have the mystical 
unknown of alfred hitchcocks the birds or the savage unknown 
of jaws all is just too predictable too pat and too cute 
steven kutchers spider unit the guys who handle the real live 
critters does a good job of rounding up the arachnids the 
welltrained little devils sure can make their marks the specially 
created spider was designed by chris walas and works with menace 
mikael salomons photography is lovely especially the early 
vistas of venezuela and the intricate lacework of the webbing in 
the barn 
the movie is rated pg13 the spider violence and deaths may be 
difficult for younger members of the audience or for the squeamish

the adventures of ford fairlane 
joe silver proves the ideal force to bring andrew dice clay to 
the screen the producer of the die hard lethal weapon and 
predator movies is of course the king of the lowest common 
denominator he has an absolute knack for spending megabucks on 
films that are full of flash with no redeeming social values 
the adventures of ford fairlane fits neatly into this silver 
pattern expensive cars explode a luxury beach house blown up 
pointblank killings fights atop a tall building heavy metal 
sound track language that would make a rap singer blush 
all this plus the dicemans brand of comedy no he doesnt 
parade his notorious gay and female putdowns but the level of 
humor remains below the belt with matching nomenclature lots of 
oral sex jokes spoken and visual colorful asides to set the 
frathouse boys sniggering 
theres a plot sort of clay is ford fairlane an la private 
eye who specializes in rock music cases a dullwitted philip 
marlowe he bumbles his way through murders drug deals and 
highlevel deceptions is the music world really that venal 
fairlane is assisted by his sleek secretary lauren holly and a 
ditzy groupie brandon call and beset by a host of opponents 
including an oily executive wayne newton his slinky exwife 
priscilla presley and a cockney crazy robert englund aka 
freddy krueger of the nightmare on elm street pictures 
the taste of the film is sometimes astonishing a college 
sorority is portrayed as some kind of sex academy a long sequence 
takes place in a cemetery where a limo and a hearse stage a 
murderous chase scattering mourners and toppling gravestones 
and what about andrew dice clay in his starring debut he has 
had smaller film roles he seems to have studied the howard 
cossell school of elocution pausing between each word 
his expressions range from distaste to smirk there may be more 
fords in his future but his versatility remains unanswered 
finnish director renny harlin who also directed die hard 2 
knows how to maintain a frenzied pace daniel waters james cappe 
and david arnott labored on the mindless script apparently working 
from the joel silver handbook steve perry coproduced 
the adventures of ford fairlane is a 20th century fox 
release rated r for all the above reasons and more running time

all dogs go the heaven mgmua home video rated g 
 
charlie a hoodlum mutt is in the slammer but not for long 
his faithful pal itchy is about to liberate him and wheres the 
first place charlie the escaped condog goes carfaces honkytonk 
carface a cigarchewing bulldog with a heart of nails runs the 
type of gin joint where people er dogs drink cheap booze and 
fight at the drop of a bone carface is also the dog who framed 
charlie 
and carface clearly does not want charlie around anymore so 
carface kills him with his car and charlie is quickly dispatched 
to heaven 
years ago this easily could have been the setup and plot for a 
james cagney or john garfield gangster flick but would you believe 
an animated feature for children 
don bluths all dogs go to heaven is the second major 
animated feature to come out this fall going up against walt 
disneys the little mermaid but where disneys has very little 
to frighten or rattle a 5yearold except a mean sea witch bluths 
effort dallies in the hereafter with haunting visions of hell and 
death 
charlie decides he really doesnt want to stay in heaven its 
soooooo boring he turns back his life watch and returns to 
earth with a warning from the whippet angel that he cant come 
back 
once back to his old haunts he discovers that carface has a 
little girl named annemarie who can talk to animals like race 
horses with annemarie as hostage carface never loses at the 
track charlie lures the little girl away with promises of helping 
her find a mommy and daddy annemarie is an orphan but we never 
know how or when her parents died or how shes managed to make it 
on her own 
charlie uses annemarie abusing her love and loyalty but in 
the end saves her life by giving up his own his reward is heaven 
along the way we meet a lady dog charlies good friend and 
her several puppies there is a strong suggestion here that charlie 
might be the dad theres also the overblown and ferocious king 
gator who leads a pack of cannibalistic rats in an underground 
kingdom 
king gator is a questionable character an almost racist 
concept he has large lips and speaks in a distinctive black ghetto 
lingo ken page does the voice though a hero of sorts in the 
story he is nevertheless offensive and presents the kind of racial 
stereotype that should have been gone from movies especially 
childrens movies by now 
bluth who led a dozen young artists out of disney in 1979 and 
set up his own company is a talented animator but he misses with 
his backgrounds and scenery there is no threedimensional 
richness just painted flats that look washedout and ordinary 
hes good with action but often it is too busy in a scene at 
carfaces club theres so much going on and so many dogs romping 
about that much of the scene is missed 
burt reynolds provides the voice for charlie and dom de luise 
does itchy other voices include melba moore whippet angel 
charles nelson reilly killer judith barsi annemarie loni 
anderson flo candy devine vera 
serviceable but unmemorable tunes are provided by charles 
strouse and tj kuenster ralph burns did the score

dmitri hvorostovksy sings tchaikovsky and verdi arias philips 
the rotterdam philharmonic orchestra conducted by valery gergiev 
compact disc 
 
a year ago no one had heard of dmitri hvorostovsky now on the 
strength of a few concerts the name of the 28yearold baritone 
from siberia is in the air as the next sensation about to hit major 
opera houses around the world 
is it all hype or is the fuss justified based on his first 
recording a collection of tchaikovsky and verdi arias its by no 
means hype 
he possesses a baritone voice of unusual beauty its a 
goodsize voice too one that should be capable of nicely filling 
even the biggest houses hes got phenomenal breath control 
spinning out the longest phrases with no apparent difficulty and 
hes an artist using his voice with considerable sensitivity and 
attention to the meaning of the words 
if theres a but its some doubt about his upper register 
which is impressive but doesnt have quite the same mellow sound as 
the rest of his voice it may be that it will fill out in time or 
it may be a sign of vocal dangers ahead 
hvorostovsky just 28 won the bbcs cardiff singer of the world 
competition last summer in a nationally televised performance he 
has since drawn ecstatic reviews for concerts at londons wigmore 
hall and at new yorks avery fisher hall and will soon be making 
opera debuts at covent garden la scala and san francisco 
his debut album is a collection of mostly familiar arias the 
biggest rarities are from tchaikovskys sorceress and 
iolanthe when it comes to the verdi hvorostovsky makes even 
the warhorses sound fresh the elder germonts di provenza il 
mar from la traviata for example 
great verdi baritones have been in short supply since the days 
of the late leonard warren and tito gobbi robert merrill and 
cornell macneil were among the best of his successors and now at 
last there may be another

a round and a bout irs squeeze 
 
when squeeze came onto the pop scene more than a decade ago 
critics hailed songwriters chris difford and glenn tilbrook as 
their generations lennon and mccartney but record sales have 
failed to match squeezes lofty reputation and promising young 
songwriting teams today are rarely referred to as the new difford 
and tilbrook 
blame the fickle music marketplace because a round and a 
bout a live album of main squeeze favorites from as far back as 
1978 shows that difford and tilbrook lived up to their early 
billing these songs are terrific and its likely that if one of 
the older ones had broken into the top 40 others would have 
followed 
a round and a bout also shows that squeeze remains a 
topnotch act the band recorded at two concerts in january 
performs 15 songs with both respect for the original versions and a 
playfulness that puts a new twist on the arrangements 
given that squeeze has played about 900 concerts since 1974 
the date and site of each is listed in the liner notes its no 
surprise that the band is terrific live helping to make it that 
way are the diverse piano stylings of jools holland who has since 
left the band and some remarkable vocal harmonies particularly 
on black coffee in bed and hour glass milli vanilli this 
aint 
but the bands strength is the songs themselves one bright 
catchy melody gives way to another while the themes vary from the 
sublime up the junction to the ridiculous she doesnt have 
to shave 
a quibble because lead singers difford and tilbrook are 
difficult to understand their clever couplets are easy to miss 
the album should have included printed lyrics still for the many 
millions who have yet to buy their first squeeze record a round 
and a bout is a good primer

in big cities like new york where most people 
live in apartments the perennial desire is for just a few feet 
more of closet space having space to squander is the greatest 
luxury of all 
burton kassell has plenty of closets and more than enough rooms 
in his fivestory limestonefront home on the upper west side of 
manhattan but he has discovered that space alone is not enough 
recently after 19 years of solving one decorating problem at a 
time piecemeal he hired designer rivka schoenfeld to reduce the 
confusion by working out a better floor plan at the same time he 
asked her to help him weed out furnishings and collectibles and to 
redecorate some of the rooms 
built as a private family home at the turn of the century the 
house had been turned into eight apartments when kassell bought it 
in 1971 he and his wife and children lived on one floor and the 
other four floors were divided into seven apartments over the 
years as tenants moved out and his finances improved kassell took 
over additional floors for his own use until by the end of 1987 he 
had the whole building to himself 
he wanted to create a separate apartment for each of two grown 
children ages 25 and 21 a weekend home for two other children by 
a second marriage ages 12 and 10 as well as a threestory space 
for himself 
considering the changes over the years its hardly surprising 
that when schoenfeld first saw the house her reaction was its 
a mess 
the proportions and ambience of the building were victorian 
and heavy we wanted to pierce this heaviness with actual physical 
light and a feeling of openness and space she says 
with this goal in mind kassell and schoenfeld chose a middle 
course between restoration and modernization they wanted to keep a 
turnofthecentury feeling without disguising its use as a 
20thcentury home 
schoenfeld suggested plain plastered walls painted white 
moldings that were not authentic to the orginal house were removed 
and ceilings were replastered much of the work was basic 
improvement and renovation like the upgraded electrical system 
track lighting was installed as was stereo equipment a multiroom 
control system and a security system all seven fireplaces in the 
house were put into working order 
since there was so much wood floors wainscoting some 
moldings and builtin cabinetry schoenfeld suggested furnishings 
made of other materials such as glass and steel for contrast 
in the living room for example seating is covered in white 
fabric the coffee table is steel and the only other significant 
furniture in the room is a low metalframed piece with open 
shelving along the wall opposite the fireplace there are stone 
shelves below and a glass shelf at waist level where kassell 
displays collectibles and memorabilia and stores sound equipment 
and books 
not every room conveys the same feeling while the living room 
projects a contemporary ambience the dining room is more 
traditional in mood oak wainscoting eight and a half feet high 
forms a backdrop to the large dining table designed by gustav 
stickley of the turnofthecentury american arts and crafts 
movement to provide counterpoint a large modern lighting fixture 
hangs directly over the table 
the kitchen which had been redone 10 years earlier did not 
need to be touched this pleasing room wears its past and present 
with distinction by removing many layers of accumulated paint 
kassell exposed the kitchens original honeycolor oak cabinetry 
and a carpenter matched some new sections to it a cabinet from a 
butlers pantry was a gift from neighbors during their own 
renovation butcher block countertops tile flooring and a 
restaurant stove give this room an oldfashioned and romantic feel 
space and quality materials work together to make the 10 by 
20foot master bath perhaps the most luxurious in the house the 
gleaming and expansive whitetiled room has a wall of new windows 
a separate shower whirlpool bath and a freestanding sink kassell 
says the room is in some ways his favorite because he was able to 
create more of it the other rooms were already complete and only 
minor changes could be made 
living in a private home in a big city is not without problems 
you are your own super and are responsible for all the 
maintenance and its difficult costly and frustrating to get 
things repaired says kassell yet it offers the luxury of 
space the feeling of home a basement for all your junk 
the monetary value of the house and the neighborhood have both 
risen substantially since he bought the property for 74500 says 
kassell renovation has cost several hundred thousand dollars more 
its latest redo has brought the house full circle it started as 
a comfortable family home and now has returned to this enviable 
state the results says kassell have been worth the effort and 
expense

when it comes to making decorating changes most 
people tend to let well enough alone but when they move they may 
decide that well enough can be improved on 
judith and martin gura went from formality and dark woods to 
pale colors and informal furnishings when they moved from a large 
family place to a small apartment in a new highrise on new yorks 
waterfront 
it was like moving to a different city says judith gura 
coowner with her husband of a public relations firm 
with their children grown the guras decided it was time for a 
change so they sold their threebedroom apartment on the upper 
west side of the city to move to a small twobedroom rental at 
battery park city built on a landfill in the hudson river at 
manhattans tip 
when completed the area will be a mix of highrise apartments 
offices shops and a marina meanwhile residents are urban 
pioneers of a sort who make do without some conveniences such as a 
nearby supermarket the compensation is a waterfront neighborhood 
that has an almost suburban feeling especially evenings and 
weekends when the daytime workforce is gone there is plenty of 
sun light view and access to water 
mrs gura who describes her new neighbors as mostly all 
single people had to severely prune possessions accumulated over 
two decades of family life 
the books were the only really hard thing to give up letting 
go of the rest was an unburdening she says to cushion the shock 
and absorb the overflow the couple rented offpremises storage 
space to hold things like bicycles furniture to start their son 
out in his first apartment and such encumbrances as a fish poacher 
and a lobster pot which will probably eventually go 
as a publicist whose specialty is the home furnishings industry 
mrs gura knows many designers with whom she could have worked 
however she decided to do the decorating herself she and her 
husband opted for a much less formal home than they were used to 
although they ended up bringing much of their furniture with them 
in the move they made enough changes to feel they were starting 
over 
the dark wood floors oriental rugs and elaborate window 
treatments are gone these days they live in light there are no 
formal window treatments just some thin blinds in the bedroom 
they enjoy their river views from rooms with white walls 
their new apartment is about half the size of the old place but 
its two terraces and great views give it an expansive feeling 
the first thing i did was to buy outdoor furniture and a barbecue 
grill says mrs gura 
they also bought a new sofa marble dining table and 
oatmealcolored berberstyle carpet for all the floors they had 
their old dining chairs recaned originally they planned to buy 
new bedroom furniture but when told it would cost 6000 they 
decided to keep what they had 
they discovered that some of the modern pieces theyd purchased 
new in the 1950s and 1960s such as chairs by arne jacobssen and 
marcel breuer qualify as collectibles so they had them 
refurbished 
all the things they brought including the craft and art 
collections look different in their new setting she says 
everything looks much fresher partly because weve rearranged 
things for example we put all the crafts in one place on an 
etagere 
smaller space is not always worse says mrs gura since the 
corridor kitchen she uses now is more efficient than the larger one 
she formerly had she got rid of many gadgets and serving pieces 
before moving gone are the yogurt maker and the clay pot and 
about a million casseroles 
nevertheless she describes the moving process as really 
painless the day we walked out on 22 years of living we didnt 
feel bad and i havent thought of the old place since we left 
the other apartment had been chosen as a place to rear children 
this time we have chosen just what we wanted she says 
such a course does not come cheaply the guras pay nearly 3000 
a month in rent almost double the monthly maintenance payments for 
their old apartment we sold the old apartment profitably and 
invested the money they decided to rent because they did not 
want to be tied down by ownership they put the cost of their move 
including the moving company reupholstery purchase of new 
furnishings and storage at between 15000 and 20000 
mrs gura says she and her husband acted out of character in 
their quickly accomplished move usually they weigh every decision 
and do a great deal of comparison shopping they liked battery park 
city so much the first time they saw it that they stopped looking 
elsewhere within a month they signed the lease

its amazing what paint floor coverings and 
some lively furniture can do for a house as legions of energetic 
people are proving all over the country redoing a handymans 
special is still the fastest and often the only affordable 
route to satisfying home ownership 
take richard marencic 31 and sarah vogt 29 of philadelphia 
this married couple bought a modest row house slightly outside the 
city center for 64000 without spending a lot more only about 
20000 over five years they won a contest sponsored by 
philadelphia magazine for their imaginative furnishings and setting 
marencic a 1981 graduate of the university of michigans design 
school and vogt a fine arts graduate of moore college of art in 
philadelphia chose the small threebedroom row house in a working 
class neighborhood near the philadelphia museum of art because it 
was convenient and they could afford it with a little financial 
help from his father 
though only about 1200 square feet excluding the basement the 
small house has room for a studio for each the location is 
convenient to vogts job as assistant manager of the philadelphia 
museum store and marencics job as an interior designer with daroff 
design inc what it needed most was a large helping of style 
as a designer marencic was able to come up with a number of 
inexpensive but stylish stratagems the couple hired a contractor 
to handle technical matters then did some of the work themselves 
to save money 
so far they have replaced virtually all surfaces on the first 
floor fixed a leaky roof removed partitions old flooring and 
wallcoverings redone ceilings and upgraded plumbing and electrical 
systems 
our idea is to use furnishings rather than architecture to 
create interest in the house as designers we enjoy being able to 
change the looks of our rooms says marencic who is a cofounder 
of tabula rasa a local group of architects and artists who exhibit 
their artwork and who are interested in interrelationships among 
various media 
marencic designed and built the dining room table two etageres 
two dining chairs and a number of art constructions virtually all 
the art objects and framed art in the house was made by the couple 
or their friends 
as designers they enjoy combining many different styles they 
updated old things with new colors or fabrics for example some 
boxy blond sunporch furniture from the 1950s has been given a new 
twist with a jazzy new fabric that looks a bit like a jackson 
pollock canvas with its abstract mix of purple magenta green 
black and white blotches 
from the outside their house is almost identical to the others 
in the row it has an indoor porch living room separate dining 
room kitchen and small back deck on the first floor the deck was 
rotten and had to be replaced a project they planned jointly with 
their nextdoor neighbor 
marencic provided the design wooden planks laid on the diagonal 
and a privacy screen made of strips of wood to create the illusion 
of more space a small round table with two chairs a barbecue 
grill and several small containers filled with flowering annuals 
make it a pleasant spot for sunday breakfast or an afternoon snack 
inside the floor plan no longer resembles those of neighboring 
houses there is a clear view from kitchen to sunporch with most 
obstructing walls taken down those that are left have been painted 
white a black and white scheme predominates 
for the kitchen the couple purchased selfassembly furniture 
inexpensive white cabinetry with simple ushaped hardware black 
laminate countertops have been installed 
the kitchen layout has been slightly rearranged to make room for 
a large peninsula that surrounds the sink perched on a stool at 
this counter used for quick meals and as a buffet surface for 
parties one can see through to the sunporch the floor has been 
tiled in a rosy terra cotta tile 
throughout the house the basic black and white background has 
been enlivened with a range of memphisinspired colors such as 
aqua rose and purple 
marencics furniture designs too are inspired by the funky 
memphis look with its odd angles and curves his enjoyment of the 
offbeat also is evident in the window coverings translucent 
plexiglass screens which he sanded for privacy small triangular 
cutouts create a peekaboo effect that amuses him 
the couple had a pleasant surprise when they removed existing 
shag carpeting oak flooring they finished it by buffing 
we take a commonsense approach to redecorating to keep costs 
down but still give us a place we can enjoy says marencic for 
example instead of ripping out a bad ceiling he repaired it and 
covered it with sheetrock not orthodox but less expensive and 
acceptable to him 
now that the main floor is complete the marencics are tackling 
the second floor the master bedroom and bath are two current 
projects two other bedrooms upstairs are used as working studios 
the downstairs was mostly rick the upstairs is going to be 
mostly sarah he says

home can be a feeling about a place as well as 
the place itself which explains why even an unconventional spot 
can make a satisfying place to live 
the sussman family of chicago for example enjoys living in a 
spacious threebedroom apartment that is sequestered on the second 
floor of woodward court a dormitory at the university of chicago 
each fall they welcome about 150 new students as an extended family 
as house masters arthur sussman who is also the universitys 
general counsel and vice president for administrative affairs and 
dr rita sussman his wife and a psychologist in private practice 
are there to make sure things run smoothly and to provide a sense 
of community 
they live at the dorm year round with their daughter johanna 
15 a high school student and two cats jr and patches their 
son eric 20 attends an outofstate college and is home during 
vacations 
the apartment was not carved out until the early 1970s when the 
school set up its resident master program although the building 
itself was designed by mies van der rohe in the late 1950s by an 
odd coincidence rita sussman can recall eating on the same spot 
when she was a graduate student and the space was part of the 
dining hall 
the apartment shows van der rohes modernism in its 
floortoceiling windows in an enormous living room its big 
enough to seat 50 or so and accommodates both a grand piano and a 
12footlong breakfront which once stood in one of the schools 
libraries 
the decorating problem the family faced is one which is likely 
to be familiar to others who live with a mix of their own and 
somebody elses furnishings 
it was a challenge to blend our own furnishings with the ones 
that were already there says mrs sussman they brought with 
them numerous art objects and paintings books and memorabilia 
countrystyle american antiques and a few other pieces of 
furniture they purchased some tables and found on the premises 
such useful furnishings as oriental rugs couches and tables 
the sussmans have two kitchens including one used by students 
to prepare occasional snacks and meals they also have a large 
dining room thats used frequently during the school year 
when summer arrives and the students leave the family finds 
itself living in slightly eerie quiet they mark the changes with 
certain rituals in june i remove the extra leaves from the 
dining room table then every september i put them back again 
says sussman 
family life in a college dormitory is a mixed blessing while it 
means never having to cook dinner and never having to worry about 
running out of staples like coffee or milk during the school year 
it also means always having to get dressed before you open your 
door for johanna sussman theres always somebody to talk to for 
the familys cats it means having a regular visiting route and a 
certain amount of notoriety their doings have occasionally been 
subjects of discussion on the dorms bulletin board 
being so much in the public eye also requires keeping a tidier 
home most of our mess stays in the back rooms but before 
someone comes theres usually that push to get things put away 
there are times when i would not do the dishes if someone will be 
coming i wind up doing them says mrs sussman 
more enjoyably entertaining has ceased to hold terrors i 
remember the first occasions two weeks one week the day before 
i would wake up with anxiety in the pit of my stomach now i know 
it will go well entertaining is just part of what i do 
we used to be very private people our evenings are scheduled 
more there is frequently an activity or we are on call or on the 
phone our range and network have expanded considerably i like 
that she says 
like other resident masters who are usually senior college 
professors or the resident heads who are often married graduate 
students or teachers with children the sussmans receive free 
lodging and board as well as a small stipend for their supervisory 
role they rent out the chicago home they own and plan to reclaim 
it when their openended tenure at woodward court is over they 
have a country home to go to when togetherness gets to be too much 
of a good thing 
when eventually they do return to their private lives rita 
sussman thinks she knows how shell feel i will miss the space 
here but there are places where you can have a lovely living room 
and the wonderful space and light which we have here not living 
with young people will be very hard i am already missing in 
anticipation their energy enthusiasm and concern

a frustrated shopper who cant find just the right fabric may 
not agree but the most important decorating trend today is freedom 
of choice say a number of home furnishings experts 
decorators manufacturers and magazine editors are less likely 
to dictate specific styles and more likely to ask people how they 
live and what type of furnishings would be appealing and practical 
says mary gilliatt there is more concern for how things work 
adds the designer and author of books about decorating 
decorating styles are much more eclectic more sophisticated 
and people seem bolder about mixing things not everything matches 
they are beginning to use more crafts there are so many little 
shops opening up that sell local things and seem to be doing quite 
well continues gilliatt 
the swing away from the decorator as dictator a star turn in 
some arenas during the 1980s is powered by home furnishings 
customers who are older better educated and know what they want 
says john young president of design america a furniture 
manufacturer in coral gables fla 
interest in interior design has been stimulated by a wider 
acquaintance with art according to young who points out that 
museum attendance has doubled seven times in the last decade 
this new savvy public is supporting a growing network of stores 
in which handcrafted and welldesigned factorymade objects are 
shown together says bill kraus author of contemporary crafts 
for the home kraus sikes inc new york 
products once sold only through architects and designers are 
available in these stores the good things are more widely 
available though too much is still sold only through designers 
says gilliatt 
she predicts that video will help to narrow the knowledge 
gapwe are a really visual society and videos are the ideal 
method of keeping consumers informed she says 
video is an important potential medium of information and 
learning about art says bronwyn dunn who has compiled a mail 
order catalog of art appreciation videos 
prices for art videos are coming down once it cost up to 500 
for a 16 mm print of an art appreciation program today videos of 
the same material cost about 40 says dunn her greenwich 
connbased company arts america catalogs and distributes more 
than 200 art videos recently she says a mail order customer in 
scottsdale ariz spent 900 on cassettes and another from 
california sent in a 700 order 
according to bette rosenberg home fashions director for the 
spiegel catalog people arent just learning about art theyre 
putting it in their homes one of the most important decorating 
trends is to use original art to give rooms a lift without having 
to change furniture 
last year spiegel introduced its first specialty catalog 
featuring original artworks and decorative art objects the product 
mix includes limited edition graphics handicrafts name brand 
collectibles from makers such as daum lladro waterford and royal 
doulton and signed oil paintings prices range from 80 to 2500 
and the average amount spent is 200 
we stress two points art doesnt have to be expensive and 
collectibles dont have to be a name brand she says 
still those wellknown designer names do appeal designer 
collections with the taste and talents of a wellknown master aimed 
at the mass market can be looked at as a sign of the greater power 
of the public says designer mario buatta 
besides bringing the prices down the designer collection makes 
it easier to get a particular look exactly the way you want it and 
so extends decorating choices recently buatta whose name already 
is on sheets fabric furniture and wallpaper added needlepoint 
potpourri table linens decorative accessories lamps and rugs to 
his product line 
although the essence of the new decorating attitudes is that you 
can have exactly what you want even if its vulgar excess buatta 
does see a general trend toward restraint 
people are using more classical decoration and adopting a 
lessismore attitude after a period of ostentation but still in 
18th and 19th century terms he says 
although some of his wealthy private clients are paring down 
the ornate look continues to appeal to the public especially in 
the bedroom where victorianpattern sheets and lots of fabric 
embellishments are more popular than ever 
the quieter victorian furniture pieces such as gothic revival 
bed have become popular with young people partly because they are 
affordable 
if however you find victorian a gothic horror skip it the 
decorating lesson of the day is this if you dont like it you 
still can have what you like

have you ever noticed that some chairs give 
you confidence while others make you feel inept how some relax 
you with cocoonlike comfort but others put you on edge 
swedish chair designer borge lindau suggests that understanding 
how a chairs form effects your physiology and frame of mind helps 
you select seats that suit your purposes for home or office 
pleasing proportions and color attract you but other factors 
figure into making a chair that sits well technically the depth 
and shape of the seat the height and angle of legs back and 
armrests as well as flexibility texture and weight of the 
materials from which it is made give each chair a unique 
psychology an attitude that influences you says lindau 
innovative scandinavian furniture designers leading the way in 
the ergonomics of chairmaking produce a wide range of 
fabulouslooking beautifullycrafted chairs that graciously 
accommodate the human body and psyche 
dozens of scandinavias best chairs including several by 
lindau are displayed at nordform90 an allscandinavian design 
exhibition in malmo through sept 2 
were showing chairs because we want people to be aware of the 
amazing variety of options they have when selecting something to

stackable chairs were selected because they exemplify scandinavian 
design principles and manufacturing skills

finlands alvar aalto to a futuristic prototype carbon fiber 
armchair strong as steel but weighing only 4 pounds by tuomo 
siitonen also from finland 
swedish design professor olle andersson says scandinavian 
designers generally favor simple shapes and uncluttered lines 
neutral colors and natural materials used in technically 
sophisticated ways but despite overall similarities each country 
has its own design personality 
finnish minimalism is exemplified by harri korhonens armless 
chair a plump leather cube seat on two stainless steel tubes that 
curve up the back and attach to a concave rectangular sheet of 
stainless steel its supportive but allows the sitter to lean in 
all directions

far from making jokes about european plumbing 
arrangements americans are now growing interested in fixtures from 
overseas according to the plumbingheatingcooling information 
bureau 
one of the reasons is the design itself says linda mayer the 
kohler cos marketing director in good design form follows 
functions and europeans do a good job at both she says 
european fixtures tend to be more rounded and come in interesting 
shapes some with art deco flavor 
thompson price a designer and president of the national kitchen 
amp bath association says the european look uses rounded gentle 
curves which follow the contour of the body traditional american 
fixture and faucet design tends to be more angular with more 
straight lines form follows function rather than aesthetics 
in recent years major american fixture manufacturers have gone 
into joint ventures with european companies to add some continental 
finesse to their lines eljer for example has contracted with 
swedish french and italian groups while kohler co recently 
acquired a french maker jacob delafon and the german firm ideal 
standard is part of the american standard corporate family 
during the past several years american manufacturers have 
made great strides in adapting the eurostyle look to domestic 
bathroom products says david l weiner the phcics executive 
director in turn european manufacturers particularly faucet 
producers have done a good job in cracking the american market 
the faucets have a soft rounded look and often are colored 
perhaps more importantly theyre quieter europeans are very 
sensitive to the noise made by their faucets says don arnold an 
industry consultant they have strict regulations on faucet 
operating noise american faucets would never pass these 
regulations 
european makers are courting the us customer joey von korff 
sales and marketing director for the europebased villeroy amp boch 
says that americans are enthusiastic about our designs and 
colors and they appreciate our superior quality our plan is to 
continue to build consumer awareness of our products 
but american firms still dominate the us market says mayer 
fixtures are difficult to import and theyre priced higher than 
domestic brands 
major differences that may not translate well for the american 
market are toilets and bidets scott atcheson eljers fixtures 
product manager points out that european toilets are not what 
americans are used to at home european toilets are all super 
water savers using as little as 15 gallons per flush regulations 
on water usage are stricter there than in the us he says 
although lowconsumption toilets are now on the scene in this 
country the american consumer is still accustomed to a good strong 
toilet flush 
and bidets in this country may be considered more a status 
symbol than a necessity adds price europeans on average take 
only about three baths per week as compared to seven or more for 
americans he says europeans couldnt do without the bidet

it is the room of many euphemisms the powder room cloakroom 
john or loo whatever you call it the american bathroom has become 
a status symbol fueling a 12 billionayear business according 
to the national kitchen and bath association 
quite a few of the bath layouts we show are larger than my 
entire apartment says timothy drew editor of house beautifuls 
kitchens and baths editions he observes that the numbers and kinds 
of bathroom equipment have dramatically increased in the past few 
years 
people like baths that are romantic comfortable even exotic 
partly because they spend so much time there says scott dee who 
with his wife jan owns studio bath in newport calif 
dee says that even one of his suppliers catalogs offers a pick 
of more than 4000 colors finishes and styles in bathroom 
fixtures and there are over 100 kinds of shower heads we can 
install a series covering every part of the bather from head to 
toe 
engineering advances have reduced the familiar sound of a 
dripping faucet he adds many designs have only one moving part 
bath design has become a highly specialized business says 
dee we work closely with consumers architects and outside 
designers to put together the proper fixtures colors spacings and 
other aspects of the customized bath 
his biggest job so far has been a 500squarefoot master bath 
with sevenfoot carved glass shower and toiletbidet doors with a 
sixfoot double tub illuminated from beneath the remodelling cost 
60000 
but a good designer can make a new or remodeled bath 
affordable for just about any budget he says 
interior designer susan pope thinks remodeling costs are good 
investments especially when the house is resold simply because 
the bath is one of the two or three key areas that catch a persons 
eye immediately 
pope who consults with a stained glass overlay maker says such 
overlays on windows and skylights are being used for privacy as 
well as to improve design other trends include black mauve and 
teal fixtures the california look is now combined with european 
designs emphasizing clean lines and hidden hardware she says 
elegant touches noted by dee are faucets set in semiprecious 
stones and overlaid with gold or silver but he says one of the 
best changes will benefit all those people who have had to scrunch 
down over the basin to shave designers he says have finally 
raised counters four to six inches to accommodate taller people

among floor coverings the oriental rug is the 
classic and it can last indefinitely if properly cared for 
tom jorjorian manager of the nahigian brothers cleaning plant 
says an oriental rug can last forever he offers these tips to 
owners 
turn your rugs every year to equalize traffic wear and light 
exposure 
be sure the rug has padding to reduce wear and inhibit 
slippage pads also add sumptuousness he says 
vaccuum the rugs in the direction of the nap which you can 
determine by running your hand over the surface 
sweep fringes with a broom instead of vacuuming which can 
break them 
do not beat your rug that can break the foundation 
broom sweeping not only removes loose dirt but helps bring out 
the wools natural sheen 
never put a house plant or flower pot on the rug no matter 
how careful you are moisture can penetrate or condense on the rug 
creating permanent mildew damage 
mop up spills by blotting not rubbing dilute the spillage 
with plenty of cool water and continue blotting until the rug 
appears to be clean try not to soak unaffected parts dry 
thoroughly first using absorbent towels on top and underneath 
then turning the rug over to dry the foundation finally turn it 
upright to finish drying 
if spills have dried get the advice of an experienced rug 
cleaner 
dont use steam cleaners or chemicals these can prematurely 
age the rug by removing the wools natural oils 
inspect your rug every few months looking for wear at the 
edges and ends check the back for moth damage which will appear 
as areas of missing knots even though the cotton foundation 
remains 
store oriental rugs not in use where they will be safe from 
excess humidity heat and moths have them mothproofsprayed by a 
professional or pack them with moth crystals if they are to be 
stored for any length of time 
roll do not fold for storage 
be wary of overthecounter stain removers they may not be 
right for your kind of rug and may cause permanent damage 
nahigian brothers maintains a hotline 1 800 5437888 to 
answer consumer information about oriental rug care the company is 
part of the torcom group a conglomerate of oriental rug retail 
manufacturing and service establishments

there may be more life in old carpeting than you suspect 
whether its what youve had for years or something you inherited 
from the previous owner when you bought a home 
dont count carpet that is down as necessarily out says 
shannon rench tyler of racine industries which makes a carpet 
drycleaning system called host she advises trying to restore 
carpet by deep cleaning to bring it back to life 
make cleaning the carpet the first step before moving into a 
new home she says if you start by bringing out the carpets 
true color that can set up the color scheme for wall finishes and 
furnishings 
once youve moved in she advises concentrate on hightraffic 
areas and spills spotcleaning where necessary leave furniture 
in place and dry clean around it where the carpet is soiled blend 
cleaned areas into surrounding clean carpet and maintain the rest 
of the carpet with vacuuming 
and to prevent stains from setting clean up spots and spills 
immediately if its a wet spill blot it with clean paper or cloth 
toweling standing on it to speed absorption pet spots should be 
blotted up with a halfandhalf mixture of white vinegar and water 
for more detailed instructions about removing a variety of 
substances from carpeting the company offers a free booklet 
carpet care made easy call 800 5589439 or in wisconsin 
800 2422023 
 
choosing carpet for your home is subjective when it comes to 
design color or texture but knowing some basics about carpet 
will help you make a good buy 
du pont which makes fibers used in carpeting including 
stainmaster which widens choices by being less liable to 
discolor outlines some things to watch for when youre at the 
carpet store 
be practical about color lighter more delicate shades are 
appropriate to bedrooms that get less traffic but for 
heavytraffic areas such as a playroom choose a darker richer 
shade 
look at a large sample color seems to intensify in larger 
spaces take samples home to look at in the room to be carpeted 
noting their appearance in both daylight and lamplight 
check the density of carpet by pressing it with your fingers 
to see how hard it is to penetrate to the backing or give it the 
grin test by bending back a corner to see how much of the 
backing shows through less visible backing means heavier sturdier 
pile 
check the yarn twist the tips of the fibers should be neat 
tight and cleanly sheared the tighter the twist meaning the 
fibers wont fray the better the carpet will stand up to daily 
traffic and cleaning ask if the yarn has been heat set heat 
setting locks the twist into place permanently 
consider the texture most carpets begin with a loop pile 
then are varied by cutting or not cutting the pile uncut loops 
equal in height offer a tight pebbly surface that will withstand 
heavy traffic and hide footprints and furniture marks dirt tends 
to stay on the surface of levelloop pile making cleaning easier 
in halls stairways childrens and family rooms cutpile carpets 
which du pont says accounts for a majority of carpet purchases 
have the top loop sheared off creating a luxurious texture these 
wear well hiding footprints soil and dust carpets with saxony 
textures made from yarns which have high twist levels are a 
good choice when you want a formal luxurious look theyre 
especially appropriate for dining and living rooms and master 
bedrooms 
choose the right fiber nylon is used in about 85 percent of 
all residential installations according to du pont it has good 
maintenance and performance characteristics and a wide selection 
of color and style is available a reasonable cost wool the oldest 
type of carpet is considered more luxurious and is more expensive 
but it may not hold up well under heavy household traffic other 
carpet fibers include polyester which is probably less durable 
than nylon but feels soft to the touch and polypropylene used 
mainly in indooroutdoor carpeting

the easiest and most affordable way to redecorate is the softest 
with fabrics and carpeting 
that means curtains bed linens table linens wallcoverings 
rugs carpets and those old standbys slipcovers and decorator 
pillows 
teflon often associated with pots and presidents now is 
protecting fabrics from soil and stains the du pont process is 
being used by makers of fabrics who supply both furniture 
manufacturers and home decorators 
among these are waverlys classics in its new traditions ii line 
the jacobean marlborough with an accompanying allover floral 
montchanin or the leafy malvern and the coordinating 
stripe kennett bloomcraft has a collection of designs inspired 
by fabrics and wallcoverings from the louvre a medallion floral 
accompanied by a chinoiserie stripe an allover floral and a vine 
and scrolled mini all in a brilliant lacquer red anju woodridge 
offers a large indianmotif medallion morgan and its 
coordinating stripe montecristo 
shower curtains that have been teflontreated are being given 
fullscale decorator treatments with balloon and swag valances 
embroidery ruffles appliques pleats and borders the departure 
from ordinary ringandhang curtains may owe to the characteristics 
of the treated fabrics which repel soapy water spilled shampoos 
and lotions and discourage mildew many of the fabric designs are 
matched with those used in the bedroom and accessories such as 
sink skirts window curtains towels lid covers and rugs can be 
coordinated floral prints against black backgrounds animalskin 
patterns and paisleys are being used to form a richer palette than 
that used in traditional bathrooms and bedrooms 
the unified bedandbath concept is exemplified in the newest 
bill blass for springmaid collection five new patterns by the 
designer castleton petit point stripe stanhope 
montgomery and riande are being marketed in sheets 
comforters bedskirts shams spreads draperies decorative 
pillows towels and shower curtains according to springmaid this 
collection celebrates the 20th anniversary of its collaboration 
with blass who was the first name designer to branch out into 
home furnishings lines 
the ensemble approach also applies to springmaids designs by 
lynn hollyn a designer whose european country look coordinates but 
does not exactly match the lynn hollyn at home collection features 
rugs from masterlooms in the designers muted pallette that 
coordinates with the bedlinen line and throws from the three 
weavers these area rugs are her versions of classic patterns 
oxford quarters secret garden and swedish hearth 
among them 
bordering and inset designs in walltowall carpeting are part 
of a new trend toward using the floor as a distinct architectural 
element lighter colors can be used with more frequency since much 
carpeting is now treated like the fabrics to resist stains and 
dirt combined styles for customdesign looks might include 
medallions area stripes borders and other designs many of these 
will be found with du ponts stainmaster label 
for a final soft touch the home decorator can have designer 
needlepoint pillows mario buatta known for his mastery of english 
country design has teamed with thimbelina the makers of 
needlepoint designs and products for his interpretations of

an illusory library marble looks decorators always have been 
able to achieve special effects at decorators prices 
now these effects can be achieved through wallcoverings in mary 
gilliatts faux finish background and borders a collection 
cooperatively produced by the british interior designer and writer 
and sandpiper studios 
the 90s will be a period of rich decoration ornamentation 
opulence and fine detail faux finishes and trompe loeil are 
lovely techniques that have moved out of the magazines into 
peoples homes says gilliatt 
one of the trompe loeil fool the eye wallpapers looks 
like a classical library with leatherbound books the faux 
finishes also emulate marble and other textures 
although many people have become adept at creating painted 
faux finishes on their walls such as marbleizing rag rolling or 
sponging for most achieving professional results is beyond their 
time or abilities says richard felber who heads sandpiper the 
new wallpapers make it possible to achieve the same effect with 
ease and affordability he says 
other trends noted by felber are pattern mixes and inspirational 
themes both covered in his companys collections victorianstyle

to connoisseurs elegant lead crystal means ireland where 
mouthblown fulllead pieces have been made for centuries 
irish crystal does come dear but a relatively young irish 
company tipperary crystal offers a line that equals the quality 
of the famous waterford but sells for about 30 percent less 
according to bernadette ryan who owns the grafton shoppe in new 
york city and the irish shoppe in block island ri the crystal 
is one of the bestselling lines at these two irish crafts stores 
my customers buy it for special occasions especially for 
weddings and anniversaries she says it also is much more 
readily available than waterford she adds many of the pieces are 
engraved either with initials or with dedications for special 
events a nice alternative to silver 
tipperary might be considered a lineal descendent of waterford 
since it is run by a group of former waterford craftsmen who formed 
the new company in the wake of waterfords restructuring a little 
over two years ago a leader of the group joseph foley was a 
24year waterford veteran who took advantage of a restructuring 
buyout option and found a backing partner to start the company the 
group makes crystal the traditional way by mouthblowing then 
handcutting each individual piece the lead content is over 33 
percent which gives the crystal strength durability and imparts a 
slight bluish color cutting serves the same function as faceting 
in gems adding sparkle and iridescence 
traditional suites or patterns are named after landmarks near 
the companys cottage factory in ballynoran county tipperary 
carrick after the historic village slievenamon named for 
the legendary mountain and dovehill a norman castle once 
commanded by connet omoore a 14th century irish chieftain 
ryan says one of the most attractive ways to display crystal is 
to mix patterns and use it every day its meant to be 
enjoyed 
the combination of quality and price a water goblet will sell 
for about 40 a wineglass for 33 has made it popular with 
americans who make up much of its market according to the 
company american sales have helped the company nearly quadruple 
its staff 
the crystal imported through kraftwaremorgan in new york is 
sold at irish and other specialty shops around the country as well 
as through the pj carroll catalog 1 800 2553933

new highend prestige line of gas and electric ranges using an 
eclectic black and white color scheme 
oster has brought out a designer collection a complete line of 
appliances in soft white with teal and gray accents with key items 
also available in black

scheme with soft rose accents and subtle gray striping 
osters redesign includes the companys flagship product the 
oster kitchen center appliance a singlemotor stand powering a 
mixer a doughmaker a slicershredder a food processor and a 
blender 
consumers are looking for quality products that will last but

oven doors freestanding units also have black glass backguards 
framed with black trim gas models have black porcelain sealed 
burners and porcelainized black cast iron burner grates electric

james paullin calorics vice president of marketing and sales 
says the company noticed that quite a few people raised the 
question of designer ranges in consumer surveys while this was 
not a majority opinion we heard this question often enough in 
different cities that we decided to commit ourselves to a series of 
such designer models 
the jennair line includes the selectiveuse oven a double wall 
oven unit which offers a choice of four cooking methods 
microwaving convection baking radiant conventional baking or 
broiling the line also includes a a choice of cooktops one which

in a nod to the designer movement the aga cooker also comes in 
a choice of vitreous enamel finishes red black cream white 
brown blue and green 
but the stoves main sales point aside from its fame as a 
status symbol for upperclass britons is its operation based on 
stored heat with no dials or knobs to regulate temperatures the 
stove has four ovens for roasting baking simmering and warming 
and three surface plates for boiling simmering and warming all 
seven plus grilling and broiling can be active at the same time 
its perfect for those who want a stove in classic design that will 
cook superbly but not require constant attention says phil tonks 
agas general manager in this country the aga has great 
potential in the us where quality is demanded but time is 
limited in addition using the slowcooking ovens meals can be 
prepared in the morning simmered all day yet be perfect at dinner 
time the even radiant heat minimizes shrinkage seals in juices 
retains nutrients and enhances the flavors

britains largest jewelry chain ratners plc said 
monday that it will stop selling jewelry made with south african 
gold after antiapartheid groups picketed its stores 
at least one of the groups end loans to south africa said it 
has suspended its action against ratners and has asked others to do 
the same pending a meeting with ratners officials in the next few 
days 
ratners which earlier this month made a friendly 328 million 
offer to acquire us jewelry retailer kay jewelers inc said its 
decision to stop using south african gold was part of a continuing 
switch to north american gold supplies 
south african gold is found in as much as 3 percent of its gold 
jewelry ratners said it had total sales of 16 billion in its 
fiscal year ended feb 3 
its a fairly simple process for us to remove the final few 
percentage points said a ratners spokesman who spoke on 
condition of anonymity the process should be completed in the next 
year or two he said 
the spokesman denied that the move was in reponse to 
antiapartheid pressure he said he believed only three of its more 
than 1000 british stores were picketed 
were a commercial organization not a political 
organization he said 
end loans to south africa said it and other groups had applied 
pressure on ratners in response to african national congress leader 
nelson mandelas call to intensify sanctions and boycott south 
african goods to end apartheid 
the anc is south africas leading black opposition movement it 
is seeking to end white minority rule of south africas black 
majority 
ratners has purchased much of its gold jewelry supplies from 
italy which according to a us general accounting office report 
gets 91 percent of its gold fom south africa the group said 
south africa produces onethird of the worlds gold the group 
said south african supplies dominate the european gold market and 
almost all gold jewelry sold in britain is made with south african 
gold the group said 
nonsouth african supplies of gold are plentiful it said 
this historic victory will send clear signals to south africa 
and will hasten an early end to apartheid said cosmas desmond 
head of end loans to south africa it shows that british business 
can no longer avoid the moral implications of collaborating with 
apartheid

the bush administration today dramatically 
boosted its official estimate of the fiscal 1991 budget deficit to 
1688 billion twothirds higher than its forecast just six months 
ago 
the increase could force automatic spending cuts of over 100 
billion if congress and the administration dont agree on a package 
of spending reductions and tax increases 
todays estimate did not even include the costs of bailing out 
the savings and loan industry when those costs are included the 
deficit for the fiscal year that begins oct 1 climbs to 2314 
billion the white house said in its official midsession review of 
the budget 
the administrations new forecast is far higher than the 1005 
billion deficit estimate included in the presidents budget when it 
was released last january 
it is also significantly higher than the 64 billion deficit 
target set by the grammrudman balanced budget law 
if congress is unable to reduce the deficit to within 10 
billion of the 64 billion it triggers acrosstheboard spending 
cuts 
along with its new deficit estimate the administration included 
dire warnings of what could happen if the current budget 
negotiations between congress and the administration fail and the 
acrosstheboard cuts are triggered 
white house budget director richard darman called 
acrosstheboard cuts of more than 100 billion unprecedented in 
their magnitude and highly disruptive to a host of government 
programs 
darman said such a reduction would require a 384 percent in 
nondefense spending and cuts of between 251 percent and 433 
percent in military programs social security and some other 
entitlement programs are exempt from grammrudman cuts forcing 
even sharper reductions in other programs 
darman said that the grammrudman cuts would force major 
cutbacks in air traffic control operations increasing delays for 
air passengers by 400 percent to 600 percent the cuts would also 
require a 40 percent cut in the head start program affecting 
200000 4yearolds and sharply curtailing other government 
programs ranging from poultry and meat inspections to cleanup of 
superfund toxic waste sites 
if the summit negotiation fails these effects are exactly what 
we will face in the fall darman told a crowded news conference 
the administrations new estimates make it highly likely that 
the grammrudman law will have to be at least modified given the 
size of the savings needs to reach a 64 billion target both the 
administration and congress have been discussing spending cuts and 
tax increases in a range of between 50 billion and 60 billion 
about half of what would be needed with the new estimates 
by emphasizing a deficit figure that did not include the savings 
and loan bailout the administration seemed to be laying the 
groundwork for removing this giant expenditure from the 
grammrudman calculations something that many members of congress 
have also proposed 
the administration blamed the sharp deterioration in the deficit 
from january until now on the higherthanexpected sampl bailout and 
weaker economic growth which cuts into government revenues and 
higher interest rates which raise the cost to the government of 
paying for the 3 trillion national debt 
the administration actually included three deficit estimates in 
its midterm review in addition to the 2314 billion with the sampl 
bailout included and the 1688 billion excluding sampls the 
administration cited an even lower 1484 billion deficit which 
excluded food stamp costs because the program technically expires 
this year 
the midsession budget review lowered projected economic growth 
from 26 percent down to 22 percent more in line with what 
private forecasters are predicting 
it projected a 48 percent rise in consumer prices this year 
matching last years inflation increase but up from the 
administrations estimate of a lower inflation figure of 44 
percent 
it raised the governments cost of borrowing shortterm by a 
full percentage point to 77 percent 
the january budget had assumed that interest rates would start 
to decline steadily this year instead rates rose through early 
spring the report noted the midsession review assumes 
interest rates will remain around current levels during the second 
half of this year and then move progressively lower during the 
following five years as inflation and the federal deficit are 
reduced 
both treasury secretary nicholas brady and michael boskin 
chairman of the presidents council of economic advisers said that 
the administrations interest rate forecast depended on the federal 
reserve easing up on its tightcredit stance 
while such administration entreaties have failed in the past 
the fed did take a small step last week to a looser monetary 
policy following growing signs of a weakening economy 
when president bush sent congress his 1991 budget on jan 29 he 
predicted a deficit of 1005 billion absent any changes in 
government policy for the fiscal year that starts oct 1 
to reduce that figure to the 64 billion required by the 
grammrudman law bush called for 36 billion in spending cuts and 
modest tax increases far lower than the more than 100 billion in 
cuts now being estimated 
the administration must make its official estimate of 
grammrudman cuts on aug 25 and then the cuts become final when 
the fiscal year begins in october 
bush has said the change in estimates was a major factor 
influencing his decision last month to reverse his stand against 
tax increases 
while economists were widely skeptical of the january economic 
assumptions used by the administration the july update was likely 
to bring more agreement 
roger brinner senior economist at drimcgraw hill an economic 
forecasting firm said he believes the 1991 budget deficit will top 
188 billion he said that assumes the current budget negotiators 
will be able to arrive at a tax and spending package that will 
reduce the deficit by 38 billion 
michael evans head of a private forecasting firm was even more 
pessimistic predicting that the 1991 deficit will hit 230 
billion he said the deficit in the current fiscal year was 
expected to total 205 billion compared to an actual deficit of 
152 billion in the last fiscal year

ncr corp said monday that record revenue 
and efforts to contain costs helped the cash register and computer 
company increase earnings by 5 percent to a record level in the 
second quarter 
earnings totaled 155 million compared with 110 million for 
the same period last year 
earnings per share increased by 17 percent to 166 also a 
record the company said compared with 142 in 1989s second 
quarter ncrs repurchase of 22 million shares during the second 
quarter helped pershare earnings but lessened the increase in net 
income 
the company said secondquarter revenue increased 5 percent to 
160 billion compared with 153 billion for the yearearlier 
period 
charles e exley jr chairman and chief executive officer said 
the higher revenue as well as efforts to contain expenses 
contributed to the increased earnings but he said they were 
partially offset by the share repurchase program and increased 
research and development spending 
earnings for the first six months totaled 167 million down 2 
percent from 171 million during the same period a year ago 
earnings per share were 238 down from 217 
revenue increased to a record 287 billion for the six months 
up 3 percent from 278 billion a year ago

secondquarter record offsetting a decline in us orders

a decade after a highspeed train linking this 
gaming community and southern california was first proposed a 
partnership today plunked down 500000 along with the first formal 
bid on the 5 billion project 
bechtel international inc of san francisco and transrapid of 
west germany are expected to be the only bidders for the right to 
build a train that would cruise up to 300 mph on elevated track 
running alongside interstate highways between las vegas and 
anaheim calif the bidding deadline is later today 
company officials presented the californianevada super speed 
train commission with a 3incthick proposal detailing the 272mile 
route 
we feel we are about to revolutionize ground transportation in 
the united states said arnie adamsen a las vegas city 
councilman and chairman of the commission 
bechtel vice president erv koenig told the group that the 
proposed hightech train using magnetic force to propel the 
trains will be a pilot system that will be the first part of a 
network that will eventually encompass the southwest and the 
nation 
once opposed by many alifornia officials as a gamblers 
special of little benefit to the los angeles area the train is 
seen now by some as the possible beginning of a mass transit system 
that could link large portions of southern california 
but even its strongest backers are not buying tickets quite yet 
the proposed train faces enormous hurdles not the least of 
which is its massive price tag and the uncertainty it would attract 
enough riders to be profitable the earliest it could be in 
operation is the late 1990s 
bechtel officials themselves say they will need to study the 
project at least another 16 months before deciding whether to 
proceed 
a lot depends on what we find in our own feasibility study 
koenig said last week all were working on now is the existing 
data and we have to go out and confirm or deny that data 
the proposed service would whisk passengers between the two 
cities in little more than an hour it now takes five hours by car 
i think it has a threeoutoffour chance of succeeding 
said paul taylor executive director of the train commission but 
anything like this has potential for environmental delay which 
could foul up the financing 
koenig said bechtel is taking a cautious approach to the project 
by applying for the franchise so it can do its own ridership 
surveys and other studies before deciding whether to go futher 
were famous for doing large projects said koenig citing 
the bart mass transit system in san francico but a project of 
this magnitude you have to take one step at a time 
a ridership survey done earlier by a consulting firm for the 
commission suggested that an anaheim to las vegas run would get 65 
million round trip passengers a year at a cost of about 110 
as projected by bechtel the train would also provide several 
southern california stops for commuters and could later be 
expanded to link other california communities 
aside from financing bechtel also faces major obstacles in its 
plan to use trains powered by magnetic levitation maglev trains 
float one to four inches above a single guideway lifted and 
propelled along by a wave of magnetic energy 
the only maglev train in existence is in emsland west germany 
where transrapids prototype glides along a 20mile test track at 
speeds of about 250 mph 
members of the bistate rail commission were impressed by the 
train during a visit to germany in march but questioned whether 
the technology was in place to build such an ambitious project 
ive tried to ride the maglev three times now and ive never 
been on the entire track because it wasnt certified for 
operation said california state sen bill leonard i need a 
better level of confidence that it can be done 
the idea of a speedy train linking las vegas with the lucrative 
southern california market that provides the bulk of the 18 million 
tourists who visit each year was first raised in 1979 by thenmayor 
bill briare 
it wasnt until 1988 however after a federally funded study 
showed the project was feasible that the bistate train commission 
was established 
since the train project received its first serious studies in 
the mid1980s the projected price tag has doubled from an 
estimated 25 billion to bechtels current estimate of 51 
billion

the bfgoodrich co said monday its 
secondquarter earnings rose 59 percent from the same period last 
year largely due to a gain on the sale of its rights in a tire 
venture 
the company reported net income of 554 million or 210 per 
share for the three months ended june 30 compared with 523 
million or 198 per share a year earlier 
revenue for the quarter edged up to 6325 million from 6288 
million a year earlier 
a key factor in the earnings rise was a 205 million aftertax 
gain resulting from the sale of the uniroyal goodrich tire co to 
michelin the company said 
uniroyal goodrich tire was formed as a joint venture in 1986 
when bf goodrich and uniroyal holdings combined their tire 
operations 
goodrich sold its 50 percent stake in the venture in june 1988 
and received cash plus a warrant to buy equity in the company 
but when michelin bought uniroyal goodrich tire in may goodrich 
surrendered its warrant to buy equity in uniroyal goodrich and the 
aftertax gain for the second quarter reflected what it was paid 
secondquarter income from continuing operations at bfgoodrich 
was 349 million or 129 per share down 34 percent from the 
same quarter of 1989 
our secondquarter results were in line with our 
expectations said john d ong bfgoodrich chairman and chief 
executive officer 
while prices for vinyl products remained below last years 
peak we benefited significantly from the increased contribution 
from our specialty chemicals and aerospace businesses which now 
account for half of the companys sales he said 
bfgoodrich said its geon vinyl products segment reported 
operating income of 247 million for the second period compared 
with 573 million last year 
its specialty chemicals division had operating income of 273 
million up 13 percent from the second quarter of 1989 
its aerospace business reported 191 million in operating 
income a 43 percent increase over the 134 million in last years 
first quarter 
for the first half of the year goodrich said it earned 716 
million or 266 per share down 32 percent from 1053 milliopn 
or 4 a share a year earlier 
revenue for the half from continuing operations slipped to 122 
billion from 124 billion a year earlier

the stock market advanced to another record 
level today and pushed the dow jones industrial average within a 
hair of breaking the 3000point barrier but sellers kept that 
psychological hurdle beyond reach 
the bestknown barometer of the stock market remained well above 
3000 for much of the session buoyed partly by a 
betterthanexpected midyear earnings report from international 
business machines corp an important component of the 30 bigname 
stocks that comprise the dow average 
but lateafternoon selling pushed prices off their highest 
levels of the day in indication to many professional strategists 
that a good deal of pessimism persists about the vitality and 
duration of the markets recent strength the volume and breadth of 
trading remained relatively light

boise cascade corp said monday it 
secondquarter profit tumbled 695 percent mainly due to falling 
prices 
the wood product manufacturer reported monday that earnings in 
the apriljune period totaled 23 million or 52 cents a share 
down from 753 million or 168 a share for the same quarter a 
year ago 
sales slipped to 106 billion from 110 billion a year earlier 
that left profits for the first half of 1990 at 566 million 
or 131 a share down from 1535 million or 342 a share a 
year earlier 
firsthalf sales slipped to 213 billion from 220 billion a 
year earlier 
chairman john fery said lower prices for products in the 
companys paper office and building segments were largely 
responsible for the earnings decline 
boise cascade posted a gain from completing the sale of its 
speciality paperboard division during the quarter but it was 
largely offset by the cost of signing bonuses in connection with 
labor settlements at paper mills in minnesota and alabama 
fery also said the 59 percent drop in operating income from the 
paper segment which accounts for over half of boise cascades 
sales was caused by operating problems at pulp and paper mills in 
maine washington alabama and louisiana that occurred during 
routine maintenance or capital improvements 
higher delivered log costs coupled with weaker prices for 
ponderosa pine which accounts for over half the companys lumber 
production contributed to the 43 percent decline in operating 
income from the building products segment fery said 
and slowing sales growth in the office products area along with 
lowerthananticipated margins forced operating income from that 
segment to retreat slightly from last years record level he said 
prospects for our building products business are uncertain as 
a result of weaker housing starts and high northwest wood costs 
fery said and we have planned major capitalrelated downtime at 
our paper mills in international falls minn and rumford maine 
however we believe we are at or near the cyclical trough for 
newsprint and uncoated papers

chase manhattan corp said monday its second quarter profit 
plunged 62 percent from a year earlier partly because it raised 
its loanloss provision to cover problem commercial real estate 
loans 
first chicago corp also posted lower results with its second 
quarter net income dropping by 35 percent due to higher expenses 
and a big addition to its loan loss reserve 
jp morgan amp co inc posted flat earnings while two other 
major banking companies security pacific corp and ncnb corp 
reported higher income 
chase based in new york said its quarterly income fell to 52 
million or 24 cents per share from 137 million or 131 a 
share in 1989 for the first half of 1990 chase netted 96 
million or 44 cents a share down 64 percent from 269 million or 
259 per share last year 
first chicago said its profit fell to 874 million or 122 
per share in the three months ended june 30 from 1344 million 
or 198 per share for the same period a year ago six month 
profit fell 398 percent to 156 million or 215 per share from 
2591 million or 383 per share a year earlier 
new yorkbased morgan earned 207 million or 106 per share 
in the quarter compared with earnings of 206 million or 109 a 
share halfyear income totaled 606 million or 316 per share 
up 57 percent from earnings of 386 million or 205 
los angelesbased security pacific reported a 6 percent rise in 
its quarterly profit to 1952 million or 159 per share from 
1845 million or 158 per share for the half year it earned 
3866 million or 313 per share up 5 percent from 36388 
million or 312 per share 
ncnbs net income totaled 1374 million or 130 per share a 
50 percent increase over earnings of 915 million or 1 a share 
in 1989 in the first half the charlotte ncbased company 
earned 27748 million or 264 per share up 66 percent from 
16732 million or 182 
chase one of the nations largest commercial construction 
lenders said its quarterly income was hurt by its decision to 
raise its creditloss provision by 75 million to 225 million all 
of the increase was to protect itself from declining real estate 
values in commercial markets 
the company said declines in foreign exchange trading revenue 
and higher operating costs also offset gains in net interest 
revenue and in fees and commissions 
first chicago increased its secondquarter provision against 
credit losses to 85 million from 60 million of the total 32 
million was allocated for commercial loan exposure and 53 million 
for consumer exposure 
net interest income slipped slightly during the quarter to 
3326 million from 3336 million while noninterest income rose 3 
percent to 282 million from 2725 million the chicagobased bank 
holding company said in a statement 
first chicago said it reduced its exposure to troubled third 
world loans to 465 million on june 30 compared with 693 million 
on march 31 through a combination of chargeoffs and loan sales 
morgan said its revenue rose from various trading activities 
such as dealings in foreign exchange precious metals and us and 
foreign debt securities however that was offset by lower 
corporate finance fees and net interest income and a 10 percent 
jump in operating expenses it said 
security pacific attributed its higher quarterly profit to 
strength in its primary markets california and washington state 
those areas have outpaced other parts of the country in economic 
growth particularly the northeast which is served by banks like 
chase 
the company said noninterest income grew by 12 percent while 
noninterest expenses were up only 2 percent 
ncnb also said it was affected by weakness in certain real 
estate markets but while there was an increase in reported 
nonperforming loans it said net interest income and noninterest 
income rose significantly

energy futures finished sharply higher in heavy 
trading monday led by a surge in wholesale gasoline prices 
reports of a weekend pipeline accident in the soviet union 
buoyed prices in london and the buying enthusiasm spilled over into 
the oil futures pits on the new york mercantile exchange 
crude oil prices also got a boost from continuing speculation 
about output reductions planned by opec members 
the contract for august delivery of west texas intermediate the 
benchmark grade of us crude oil jumped 31 cents to 1867 a 
42gallon barrel more than making up for fridays 10cent loss

production of natural gas touched off a rally in london which 
spread to new york 
she cited two reports one of a natural gas pipeline accident 
and another of an explosion causing an oil field fire details were 
unavailable but the disruptions in soviet output were expected to 
be temporary she said 
meanwhile the possibility that the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries soon might undertake some effective steps to 
prop up world oil prices continued to encourage buying she said 
oil traders are paying close attention to the oil cartel as it 
prepares for a meeting in geneva switzerland on july 25 the

mcdonnell douglas corp announced plans monday 
to reduce its workforce by up to 11 percent about 17000 jobs and 
cut other costs in an effort to shore up the aerospace giants 
sagging bottom line 
john f mcdonnell chairman and chief executive officer said 
the measures should save the company more than 700 million this 
year or about 5 percent of annual expenses and put the nations 
largest defense contractor on very solid footing 
he said the company has to become more efficient and profitable 
in order to ensure that its record backlog of commercial jet orders 
and other business opportunities were part of a bright future not 
a nagging nightmare 
we tried to work it without having significant job reductions 
but in the final analysis we had to come to this mcdonnell told 
a news conference 
mcdonnell douglas stock fell 250 to 4237 a share on the new 
york stock exchange 
company officials had said in june that they planned substantial 
layoffs although some securities analysts and union officials said 
the cuts were a little deeper than they expected 
weve seen a lot of changes at mcdonnell douglas and most of 
them have been rather ineffectual but positive effects from this 
plan should start showing up right away and thats when well 
become believers said paul nisbet a stock analyst for 
prudentialbache securities inc in new york 
nisbet said he would have liked to see mcdonnell douglas embark 
on a longterm costcutting program as competitor boeing co did 
several years ago with a fiveyear 25 percent costreduction plan 
thats why boeings making a lot of money and mcdonnell 
douglas isnt nisbet said 
mcdonnell douglas reported a 2 million profit for the first 
quarter of the year down 98 percent from the same period a year 
earlier for 1989 profit fell 37 percent to 219 million and would 
have been much lower if not for a onetime 178 million gain from 
an accounting change 
much of the financial weakness stems from losses at douglas 
aircraft co the companys long beach calif subsidiary which 
has been struggling with an overwhelming commercial jet order 
backlog cost overruns and a major overhaul in corporate work rules 
the company faces large investment costs in its 
notyetcertified md11 commercial jumbo jet and has experienced 
production problems with its md80 commercial airliners 
mcdonnell douglas also has had problems with defense aircraft 
and faces the prospect of major cuts in defense spending 
the senate armed service committee on friday approved a 289 
billion defense authorization bill that would slash the pentagons 
proposed budget and cloud the future of several major aircraft 
programs 
the company faces serious cost problems on three military 
programs the c17 cargo plane the a12 advanced tactical aircraft 
and the t45 goshawk trainer 
lawrence harris an analyst with bateman eichler hill 
richards in los angeles said he was taking a cautious view of the 
costcutting plans chances of success 
to be sure mcdonnell douglas faces a number of challenges 
several of their mature defense programs could be coming to an end 
and at the same time newer programs are incurring cost growth 
also the effort to turn around douglas aircraft is unfinished 
harris said 
the company expects to eliminate between 14000 and 17000 jobs 
through layoffs and attrition mcdonnell said the bulk of the cuts 
will be made in st louis and long beach calif 
about 4500 jobs will be cut in the st louis area where 
mcdonnell employs about 40500 workers and does much of its defense 
work about 8000 jobs will be cut in long beach where the company 
employs 47000 and makes commercial aircraft and does some defense 
work 
another 800 jobs will be trimmed at a helicopter operation in 
mesa ariz and another 1000 jobs will be eliminated elsewhere in 
the country the company said 
when attrition and job elimination are included the company 
said up to 17000 positions could be trimmed under the plan 
the costcutting plan also includes reduced capital budgets 
significant cuts in budgets for travel consultants advertising 
and other support activities restrictions on overtime and a 50 
percent reduction in company contributions to the salaried savings 
plans 
mcdonnell said job fairs resume services and counseling would 
be offered to help laid off workers find new jobs

health care cost issues will take up a 
lot of time in this summers auto industry labor negotiations a 
ford motor co executive said monday 
health care is just a megaissue said the executive who 
spoke only on condition of anonymity 
ford has three bargaining priorities during talks with the 
united auto workers union improving vehicle quality holding down 
costs and getting the union to agree to flexibility in how cars are 
made 
the union has said protecting current jobs for its members is 
the top bargaining priority for each of the automakers 
improvements in pensions wages and health care benefits follow 
negotiations between the uaw and ford open thursday talks 
between the union and general motors corp open wednesday chrysler 
corp and the uaw open talks friday uaw contracts with each of the 
big three expire sept 14 
the ford executive estimated his company pays about 4200 
annually in health care for each of its 175000 active and retired 
employees thats less than chryslers 4600 for its approximately 
60000 workers and slightly more than the 3800 a year that gm 
pays for each of its 400000 unionized workers 
automakers long have complained their health care costs put them 
in a hole compared with japanese companies making cars and trucks 
in the united states the average age of uaw workers at the big 
three is about 42 years the estimated average age of a worker in 
the so called transplant companies is in the mid to upper20s 
chrysler chief negotiator anthony st john has said simply 
continuing the current level of companypaid health benefits for 
its workers would add 16 percent to chryslers labor costs 
automakers and the union have been looking for ways to cut 
healthcare costs while maintaining benefits one is for employees 
to switch from traditional healthcare coverage such as blue cross 
and blue shield to health maintenance organizations or preferred 
provider organizations 
there is no doubt that the hmos are a cost savings the ford 
executive said thirty percent to 40 percent of uawcovered 
employees at the big three are members of hmos or ppos 
another expensive issue will be how to get cost of living 
protection for uaw retirees whose numbers nearly equal the unions 
active big three membership of about 500000 
union leaders are being pressured by the retirees to push for 
costofliving protection keyed to the inflation rate both sides 
say that could cost billions of dollars 
maybe the clue to pensions is what has been done in the last 
couple of agreements the ford executive said lumpsum payments 
have been used in the past to offset inflationspurred erosion of 
retirement benefits 
ford also wants more flexibility in its manufacturing plants and 
how they are supplied the executive said quality cost and 
delivery speed determine whether a part or component will be made 
at a ford plant the union wants that work done at plants rather 
than having the work sent to a company where labor is cheaper 
if negotiations proceed as they have in the past the union will 
bargain with each of the big three through july and august 
sometime around labor day the uaw will pick a target company 
talks will be suspended at the other two and focused at the 
target an agreement at that company then will be taken to the 
others resulting in similar contracts at each of the big three 
the ford executive said would like to see ford picked as the 
target because the no 2 automaker would be able to tailor the 
contract to its needs but he thinks the union will pick gm

rjr nabisco inc announced monday the details of 
a 69 billion recapitalization plan the company says will include 
the retirement of more than 3 billion in junk bonds and a 115 
billion bridge loan 
the recapitalization is aimed at reducing rjr nabiscos most 
expensive debt leaving the firm less vulnerable to the problems 
that have undermined other debtburdened companies over the past 
year 
under the plan rjr nabiscos debt will be reduced to less than 
20 billion from the current level of approximately 23 million 
said karl von der heyden the companys executive vice president 
and chief financial officer 
the recapitalization includes a previously announced 17 
billion cash infusion by kohlberg kravis roberts amp co the 
investment firm that engineered the record 2453 billion leveraged 
buyout of rjr nabisco last year kohlberg kravis said last month it 
planned to recapitalize the food and tobacco company but released 
few details of the plan 
the plan will be financed with the 17 billion from kohlberg 
kravis plus 225 billion in new bank loans the loans are expected 
to carry interest rates of 12 percent to 13 percent compared with 
the 16 percent to 17 percent rates that rjr nabisco junk bonds will 
carry 
rjr nabisco plans to repurchase at least 51 percent of its junk 
bonds known as subordinated exchange debentures with a maturity 
date of 2007 von der heyden said in a telephone interview 
the company also expected to retire at least 85 percent of junk 
bonds called senior converting debentures that are due in 2009 up 
to 85 percent of these securities will be exchanged for cash and a 
new issue of preferred stock in rjr nabisco with additional bonds 
possibly being acquired for cash von der heyden said 
after the recapitalization we will probably have something in 
excess of 3 billion of those two issues out of the 7 billion 
currently outstanding von der heyden said 
rjr nabisco said it hoped to complete the recapitalization by 
next april 
the company also announced it was resetting the interest rates 
on the junk bonds from the current 1407 percent to 17 percent for 
the subordinated exchange debentures and 17375 percent for the 
senior converting debentures 
by the terms under which the bonds were issued rjr nabisco had 
to reset the interest rate to make up for any price declines in the 
bonds because bond prices and interest rates move inversely and 
the market price for the securities has declined since their issue 
the company had to offer a higher rate at the reset 
the recapitalization also will allow rjr nabisco to repay the 
115 billion bridge loan used to complete the leveraged buyout 
in return for its 17 billion cash infusion kohlberg kravis 
will receive a new issue of common stock in rjr nabisco valued at 
625 a share rjr nabisco said kohlberg kravis also was 
exchanging 200 million of its own bridge loan to rjr nabisco for 
200 million in preferred stock 
von der heyden said rjr nabisco planned to reduce its debt load 
steadily during the next few years one of the things that will 
help us is were retiring a lot of junk debt he said 
after this recapitalization is completed the company will 
consider further debt retirement but this will not come up for 
quite a while von der heyden said 
we will always look at ways to bring down our effective 
interest rates and try to tackle the most expensive debt first 
he said referring to the remaining junk bonds 
he noted that junk bond debt cannot be retired without the 
agreement of rjr nabiscos bankers the companys bank loans have a 
higher repayment priority than do junk bondholders

analysts said the dollar continued to recover from a midday 
decline on friday when the federal reserve added funds to the 
banking system and financial markets interpreted the move as a 
relaxation of the feds credit policy 
when the fed relaxes credit and allows interest rates to fall 
the dollar tends to decline because it is supported by higher us 
rates

with greenwich capital markets inc in connecticut said the market 
was uncertain about what fed chairman alan greenspan might say 
wednesday about the central banks policy when he testifies before

i think the markets a little fearful of getting too far ahead 
of itself until they can understand why hes done what hes done 
and and how far hes going to go mcgroarty said

stocks hit record levels again monday and the 
dow jones industrial average reached its third straight alltime 
high tantalizing wall streeters by closing within a hair of 3000 
for the first time 
but trading was light in what some strategists regarded as an 
uncertain market many investors didnt participate and some 
expressed cynicism about an obsession with the behavior of the dow 
index which can move sharply if any one of its 30 bigname 
components rises or falls in one large trade 
the bestknown stock barometer which has risen nearly 100 
points this month and briefly forayed aboved 3000 for the first 
time friday remained in that territory for much of the session 
monday but it weakened in a bout of selling in the late afternoon 
and finished at 299975 up 1955 
its just another number another barrier said peter j 
dapuzzo head of world equities for lehman brothers in new york 
philip rettew a vice president at merrill lynch amp co called the 
dow3000 barrier about as important as your 50th birthday 
strategists said buying was largely motivated by the influences 
that drove the market last week and pushed the dow index to record 
closes thursday and friday indications that the federal reseve was 
easing interest rates to forestall a recession and an improved 
outlook for corporate earnings 
international business machiness announcement of 
higherthanexpected secondquarter earnings monday bolstered the 
optimism and set the tone for much of the day some other leading 
companies also reported strong earnings results the markets 
come a long way it barreled ahead got tired and backed away 
said lawrence wachtel a senior strategist for prudential bache 
securities inc 
and then theres the dow 3000 oh boy he said some 
people feel 299975 is the pits but 300015 would be salvation 
theres too much hype about it 
some brokers said events that could have hurt the market like a 
weakening dollar and word of a drastically higher federal budget 
deficit had little or no influence on stock prices an indication 
of market strength 
but others said the markets indecisive move higher as 
reflected in the dow averages inability to close above 3000 
showed that many investors are nervous and unwilling to commit 
money to stocks 
the only thing that worries me is the lack of volume said 
blake stephens vice president of overthecounter trading at 
interstate johnson lane securities in charlotte nc if it 
closes above 3000 with good volume youll see come money come out 
of the woodwork

after mondays close the weather service issued a sixto10day 
forecast predicting more good crop weather in the midwest 
abovenormal rainfall and normal to belownormal temperatures july 
2226 
that kind of weather would help the corn crop through its 
critical pollination phase which was under way in about 12 percent 
of the crop as of sunday according to a weekly agriculture 
department report issued after the close 
pollination is lagging behind the normal pace of 38 percent 
though and is likely to go on for an unusually long period this 
year because heavy spring rains delayed some corn planting said 
marty foreman a corn market analyst with agrivisor services inc 
in bloomington ill 
we probably will see some weather anxieties resurface he 
said but right now people seem pretty confident about what weve 
gotten so far 
the cropprogress report also showed 19 percent of soybeans 
blooming compared with a 40 percent average 
the usda rated 75 percent of the corn crop good to excellent

the white house hiked its forecast of next 
years budget deficit to 1688 billion on monday 2314 billion 
if savings and loan costs are counted and warned of devastating 
cuts in programs without a quick budget compromise with congress 
the new estimate was more than twothirds higher than the 
administrations projection just six months ago 
airport control towers could be closed student loans canceled 
food inspections interrupted and military forces halved by cutting 
perhaps one million people as the government buckled under what 
could be over 100 billion in automatic cuts this october said 
budget director richard darman 
it seemed unlikely that congress would permit cuts on such a 
huge scale and white house officials conceded that easing was 
needed in the nations deficitreduction law which mandates 
spending cuts across a broad range of programs if targets for 
reducing federal red ink are not met 
but administration officials insisted they would support a 
watering down of the grammrudman budgetbalancing law only if 
coupled with a 50 billion package of spending cuts and new taxes 
twomonthold budget summit talks between the administration 
and congressional leaders on a deficitreduction package have 
seemed bogged down despite president bushs reversal of his no 
new taxes pledge three weeks ago 
house budget committee chairman leon panetta dcalif said the 
consequences of a 100 billion grammrudman cut would be so severe 
that the budget negotiators must somehow work out a deal 
the crisis is real panetta told reporters these numbers 
should hit the white house congress and the summit like a fire 
alarm in the middle of the night 
however senate budget committee chairman james sasser dtenn 
said the numbers were nothing new and he contended the talks were 
stalled because of a lack of leadership from bush he called on the 
president to address the nation explaining the extent of the 
budget problem laying out his solution and explaining the 
consequences of failure 
the ranking republican on the senate budget committee pete 
domenici rnm said the new deficit figures would serve as a 
warning to any lawmakers who want the budget talks to fail and to 
those he said are making ultimatums 
mondays revised deficit projection was up 10 billion from the 
administrations informal estimate just a month ago and up sharply 
from januarys 1005 billion estimate 
the new figures contained in the administrations annual 
midyear economic review are based on the economic data that show 
slower economic growth than the administration expected the white 
house now projects that the economy will grow by only 22 percent 
this year down from the 26 percent it predicted in january 
in gloomy remarks that appeared directed partly at congressional 
budget negotiators darman spoke of acrosstheboard spending 
reductions of a totally unprecedented size if the 100 billion 
gap cant be bridged by a budget compromise 
added treasury secretary nicholas brady this problem is 
serious the law is the law and were going to obey it this 
is not a political wrestling match 
president bush issued a written statement saying that in light 
of the revised deficit estimate it is therefore all the more 
important that the budget summit reach agreement promptly and 
congress act responsibly to bring the deficit down 
any cuts under the grammrudman law would be split 5050 between 
domestic and military spending if bush decides to include military 
personnel in the defense cuts one million men and women could be 
removed from government payrolls about half the force darman said 
he gave these other examples of prospective cuts 
massive layoffs of air traffic controllers and the closing of 
100 airport control towers forcing sharp reductions in commercial 
flights and an increase in traveler delays of 400 to 600 
percent 
a halt to all new cleanups of toxic waste sites 
elimination of pell grants to 12 million college students 
a 40 percent reduction in head start enrollment for 
preschoolers from poor families 
a 140day curtailment of meat and poultry inspections sharply 
reducing the supply of these products in supermarkets and driving 
up prices 
sharp cuts in programs involving childrens vaccinations the 
elderly the war on drugs and prisons 
despite darmans warnings few in the administration appeared to 
believe that cuts of the scope of 100 billion would actually be 
seen 
michael boskin chairman of the white house council of economic 
advisers told reporters that cuts in excess of 50 billion in one 
year could be destabilizing and possibly tip the economy into a 
recession 
boskin said to win the administrations support for a partial 
easing of the grammrudman targets congress must agree to a 
successful multiyear enforceable deficit reduction plan 
figuring in the 1991 costs of rescuing the troubled savings and 
loan industry would add 626 billion to the total federal 1991 
deficit bringing it to a projected 2314 billion the 
administration said 
there is considerable sentiment both in congress and the 
administration to keep the costs of the savings and loan bailout 
out of the official budget calculations 
the administration blamed the sharp deterioration in the deficit 
from january until now on the higherthanexpected sampl bailout and 
weaker economic growth that cuts into government revenues it also 
cited higher interest rates that boost the cost of servicing the 
nations 3 trillion national debt 
the omb projected a 48 percent rise in consumer prices this 
year matching last yearsinflation increase but up from the 
administrations estimate of a lower inflation figure of 44 
percent 
and it raised the governments projected cost of shortterm 
borrowing shortterm by a full percentage point to 77 percent

international business machines corp said 
monday its profit rose 52 percent in the second quarter as revenue 
grew 84 percent results that generally pleased industry analysts 
demand across our product line remains good worldwide ibm 
chairman john f akers said revenue and earnings growth was led 
by software benefits from leasing activities and early results 
from our restructuring actions

billion or 245 a share in the three months ended june 30 up 
from 134 billion or 231 a share a year earlier revenue rose

the armonk nybased company said it would trim its work force by 
10000 jobs and repurchase about 4 billion of its stock 
ibm said the job cuts were expected to bring its us work force 
to 206000 by the end of this year down by more than 37000 since 
1985 
ibm took a 23 billion pretax charge against 1989s 
fourthquarter earnings to pay for the restructuring 
the company has been paring its operations since 1985 when 
growth in the computer industry began slowing 
jones said ibm is just beginning to see the benefits from the 
most recent employee reductions 
most of the results are going to be felt in the second half of 
this year he said if they can keep revenue growing at 7 to 8 
percent a year i dont think theyll need to downsize any more 
david korus a computer industry analyst at kidder peabody amp 
co said ibm needs to keep on top of changing market conditions 
adjusting its operations to fit the industry 
jones said one potential future trouble spot is the companys 
planned introduction of new highend mainframe computers call the 
summit line 
ibm is expected to announce the line sometime next year jones 
said he expects the company in the meantime to announce new models 
of its existing mainframes that can be upgraded to summit models 
once they are available 
by doing that it will offset the normal reaction of customers 
to stop buying before a major product rolls out the door he said 
but he said how that gets implemented will determine whether 
they can grow through the product transition or take a temporary 
slowing as their mainframe transition unfolds

eastern airlines facing possible criminal 
charges for allegedly falsifying aircraft maintenance records sent 
a team of lawyers monday to meet with federal prosecutors in 
brooklyn 
us attorney andrew maloney said he expected talks to continue 
for at least several days he declined to comment on whether a plea 
bargain was in the works 
eastern spokesman jim ashlock in miami also refused to say what 
was being discussed 
martin r shugrue easterns bankruptcy trustee met june 1 with 
maloney in what one source described as an effort to head off 
possible criminal charges the source spoke to the associated press 
on condition of anonymity 
shugrue reportedly is worried that any indictments would scare 
away passengers and possibly torpedo his efforts to save the 
strikebound airline 
according to published reports the grand jury is looking into 
allegations that eastern altered maintenance and safety records 
early last year at three airports kennedy international and la 
guardia in new york and hartsfield international in atlanta 
mechanics allegedly were ordered to disregard safety guidelines 
and then falsified log books to show that proper checks were made 
the investigation began last year after the federal aviation 
administration fined eastern 839000 for alleged maintenance 
violations primarily at kennedy 
the faa regularly fines airlines for improper maintenance 
practices but does not seek criminal charges 
maloney said the filing of criminal charges against an airline 
would be unprecedented 
easterns machinists union struck the airline march 4 1989 and 
the company filed for bankruptcy protection five days later the 
strike is continuing 
a federal bankruptcy judge appointed shugrue on april 18 to run 
the airline in place of frank lorenzo the chairman of easterns 
parent company the former texas air corp now known as

united steelworkers of america 
negotiators said monday they are seeking authorization for 5500 
employees to strike wheeling pittsburgh steel corp on aug 16 
the negotiators unanimously approved a resolution to seek 
permission from union president lynn r williams for a strike over 
terms of the companys bankruptcy reorganization plan said andrew 
lefty palm director of usw district 15 and the unions chief 
wheelingpittsburgh negotiator 
we have a pretty good idea that we will get authorization 
palm said at a news conference held in this washington county 
community 
the request was to be presented by tuesday to williams whose 
approval is needed under union rules an answer is expected within 
a few days palm said 
the workers current contract was negotiated following a 98day 
work stoppage that began in 1985 after wheelingpittsburgh filed 
for protection from creditors under chapter 11 of federal 
bankruptcy laws it will expire 10 days after a plan of 
reorganization is approved 
the unions membership unhappy with terms of the reorganization 
plan recently completed polling that gave negotiators the 
authority to strike 
the union claims the plan supported in bankruptcy court by the 
company and creditors treats employee bankruptcy claims unfairly 
palm said the plan offers union members 13 percent of the value 
of their stock which is worth about 26 million at the same time 
the average creditor would get 74 percent of the value of its 
stock he said 
palm said the workers made concessions in 1985 and lawyers for 
the company and creditors are asking them to give up more than 
their fair share under the reorganization plan 
theyve watched the bankruptcy lawyers for creditors and the 
company raise fees by as much as 100 an hour said jim smith an 
assistant to williams the cost of living is increasing for our 
members too 
galvie gardner president of local 1187 in allenport washington 
county said all the workers want is what other steel workers have 
we give and give and give he said if we dont get it 
were on the street 
he was among 13 local presidents who stood behind palm at the 
news conference 
little progress was made when union negotiators last met with 
the company june 12 palm said wheelingpittsburgh spokesman ray 
johnson said company negotiators are eager to resume talks 
well do whatever we can to avoid a strike johnson said 
thats why were ready to meet at any time

agriculture secretary clayton yeutter told the 
senate monday he would recommend that president bush veto the 1990 
farm bill if its cost to the government is not reduced 
the threat brought an immediate charge from senate agriculture 
committee chairman patrick leahy dvt that the bush 
administration was trying to kill the farm bill to have a freer 
hand in international trade talks aimed at cutting agriculture 
subsidies around the world 
from a budget standpoint the cost of the bill is excessive 
yeutter said in a letter that is deeply critical of the commodities 
subsidies in the legislation expected to be taken up by the full 
senate this week 
the committee has estimated that the commodity programs in the 
bill would cost 55 billion over five years but yeutter said its 
spending requirements amount to 59 billion 
about 79 billion was spent over the last five years under the 
1985 law expiring this year 
the government subsidizes farmers who produce wheat corn rice 
cotton soybeans sugar dairy products wool and mohair honey and 
peanuts either by direct payment or manipulation of the market 
the bill authorizes appropriations for a number of new 
programs and authorities which could result in over 3 billion of 
additional outlays said yeutter his letter criticized every 
government subsidy program in the senate bill 
leahy said in a statement the administration had cooked up new 
numbers in estimating the bills impact on the budget 
the reality is that the senate farm bill is over 6 billion 
less than what the president proposed in january for current 
services he said the administrations veto threat is a thinly 
veiled effort to kill the farm bill so the administration can cut a 
backroom deal in geneva out of sight from american farmers 
yeutter never mentioned the general agreement on tariffs and 
trade talks being conducted in geneva switzerland in his letter 
but criticized the bill as departing from the marketoriented 
approach of the 1985 law 
the bush administrations appeal to the countries covered by 
gatt is that they allow the market to operate free of 
pricedistorting subsidies 
americas farmers will see this for what it is a strongarm 
effort to sabotage the farm bill suppported by a majority of both 
democrats and republicans on the senate agricultture committee 
said leahy 
but yeutter said the instability of the commodity markets 
dictates that we must consider the variability as well as the 
absolute dollar estimate of spending for these programs

a judge on monday tossed out all charges 
against rite aid corp and its president after ruling the evidence 
against them in a bribery case was circumstantial 
martin l grass 36 and rite aid were accused of bribing a 
member of ohios board of pharmacy to resign so the panel would 
have a makeup more favorable to the drugstore company 
cuyahoga county common pleas judge lillian greene granted a 
defense motion asking for a judgment of acquittal after the 
prosecution rested its case 
greene said prosecution evidence was circumstantial and did not 
substantiate a case of willful intent to bribe 
some of the spectators in the courtroom gallery applauded and 
several hugged the smiling grass and congratulated him 
grass said he was sure he would be found innocent 
i never had a doubt it was a ridiculous prosecution he 
said 
grass and rite aid based in shiremanstown pa were charged in 
an indictment unsealed in august with bribery and possession of 
criminal tools described as a corporate aircraft 
both charges are felonies the bribery charge is punishable by 
up to 10 years in prison and a maximum fine of 5000 the 
possession of criminal tools charge carries a maximum sentence of 
five years and a fine up to 2500 
grass was accused of trying to bribe pharmacy board member 
melvin wilczynski 61 to step down so a new board member more to 
rite aids liking could be appointed 
grass gave wilczynski a check worth more than 33000 the 
defense had argued the payment was in fact a legal buyout of 
wilczynskis consulting contract for another drug store company 
lane drug co a division of peoples drug stores inc acquired by 
rite aid last year 
during the trial which began july 9 prosecutors contended that 
grass offered the buyout only on condition that wilczynski step 
down as a voting member of the board the government said rite aid 
had complained the pharmacy board harassed the company when 
enforcing state regulations over drugstores 
defense attorneys have said the state pharmacy board had a 
vendetta against rite aid because it challenged some rules and 
decisions which it thought were unreasonable 
the prosecutors had the jury hear and watch two secretlymade 
tapes a recorded telephone conversation between wilczynski and 
grass on april 26 1989 and a videotape the following day in a 
hotel room near cleveland hopkins international airport 
grass was arrested at the hotel room 
in the telephone tape wilczynski is heard arranging the 
followingday meeting with grass at the hotel to discuss the 
contract buyout and rite aids provision of health insurance after 
the buyout 
in the videotape wilczynski and grass are seen in the motel 
room leafing through papers some of which wilczynski signs 
prosecutors said the papers included six undated letters of 
resignation addressed to ohio gov richard celeste from which 
wilczynski was supposed to select for signing 
wilczynski remains a voting member of the pharmacy board which 
oversees drugstores adherence to state rules 
celeste has said he knew of no plans to get any rite aid 
officials or supporters appointed to the pharmacy board 
before the trial began greene dismissed as evidence three other 
taped conversations which the prosecution wanted to use the judge 
said they were made by pharmacy board investigators who did not 
have jurisdiction in the criminal case the two tapes that were 
allowed were made by cuyahoga county sheriffs officers

the commodities trading firm headed by chicago 
board of trade chairman karsten mahlmann said monday it is seeking 
an outside investor and parceling out some accounts to get its 
books in order 
the firm stotler and co has been directed by the board of 
trade to bring its amount of cashonhand up to 4 percent of 
customer funds as required by the commodity futures trading 
commission by the close of business wednesday according to a 
statement issued by the firms parent company stotler group inc 
if a brokerage does not maintain the required amount of capital 
the exchange can restrict the brokerage to trading only for the 
purpose of liquidation and can transfer that brokerages customer 
accounts to other firms said michael oconnell a board of trade 
spokesman 
he referred questions about the specifics of the case to 
chicagobased stotler group where spokesman vito piazza declined 
to comment beyond the prepared statement 
the statement said stotler planned to meet the requirement by 
transferring a portion of its customer accounts and stake in the 
market to other brokerages and by seeking a capital infusion from 
various parties 
the moves are likely to reduce the firms revenue and net 
income stotler said 
without a capital infusion stotler group may be unable to 
meet its debt obligations unless those obligations are refinanced 
or restructured the company said 
the chicago tribune reported saturday that stotler one of the 
nations 10 biggest futures brokerages may have run afoul of 
capital requirements because of its recent rapid growth 
stotler group said another subsidiary brokerage rg dickinson 
amp co of des moines iowa was not affected by the compliance 
problems at stotler and co 
mahlman is serving his fourth consecutive oneyear term as 
chairman of the bot stotler is one of the nations 10 largest 
futures brokers

an outside examiner appointed by a federal 
bankruptcy judge to look into the 1986 junkbond financed buyout of 
revco ds inc said monday he believes successful lawsuits could 
arise from the deal 
however the examiner barry l zaretsky said lawsuits should 
not be filed to avoid interfering with bankruptcy court proceedings 
our preliminary finding that the revco leveraged buyout 
amounted to a fraudulent conveyance is likely to lead to greater 
scrutiny of the financial condition of junk bondfinanced deals 
said zaretsky who was appointed examiner by us bankruptcy court 
judge harold f white last month 
zaretsky said his examination has not found actual fraud but 
that the deal was made with either fraudulent intent or without 
fair consideration of whether the company could pay its debts 
the examiner also said state law tort claims and other actions 
could arise from the buyout 
zaretsky is a brooklyn law school professor and counsel to the 
new yorkbased law firm of kelly drye amp warren 
revco went from a publicly held company to a private one during 
a 15 billion managementled leveraged buyout 
the revco buyout failed in 1988 revcos was the first major 
debtfinanced buyout to seek protection from creditors under 
chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws 
this year the suburban clevelandbased drugstore chain one of 
the countrys largest decided to sell more than 700 of its 2000 
stores in order to concentrate on eastern operations where sales 
are strongest 
the appointment of an examiner was requested by us trustee 
conrad j morgenstern who supervised the revco bankruptcy case
