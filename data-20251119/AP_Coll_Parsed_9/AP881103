a burglar who stole a heart surgeons 
instruments from a rented car has put the doctor out of operation 
for as much as three months 
among the tools stolen from dr beethoven brown was a customfit 
pair of magnifying eyeglasses that provide closeups of small blood 
vessels 
basically it is extremely difficult to see the coronary 
arteries without them brown said tuesday therefore it is 
impossible to work without them 
having a new individually fitted set of the 1200 glasses made 
could take three months brown said meantime he will have to 
restrict himself to nonsurgical treatment and rely on colleagues to 
perform operations 
its depressing brown said 
the customized glasses contained in a wooden box with his name 
on it are no good to anyone else he added saying he will gladly 
take them back at his miami office no questions asked

political pundits disagree on how lopsided an 
election must be to qualify as a landslide but seasoned candidates 
george bush and michael dukakis each could write a chapter in the 
book of landslide lore 
both men in the past have buried their share of opponents and 
been buried themselves which of their house senate and 
gubernatorial races can be classified as landslides and what it 
will take to claim a landslide on tuesday depends on which analyst 
is doing the analyzing 
william schneider a washingtonbased political analyst said 
democratic and republican candidates generally can count on getting 
at least 40 percent of the popular vote without doing much of 
anything 
its the dogfight for the middle 20 percent that makes or breaks 
a landslide he says 
sixty percent is earthshaking 55 percent gives you a landslide 
and you can get a solid majority of the electoral vote with just 52 
or 53 percent of the popular vote schneider said 
stephen hess a senior fellow in government studies at the 
brookings institution believes anything outside the 47th and 
53rdyard lines in the popular vote is a landslide 
new york gov mario cuomos standards are a bit more lax 
i believe i have defined a landslide as 52 percent or more 
he said last week as he predicted dukakis would win on tuesday but 
maybe not by as large a landslide as i had figured 
richard a brody a political scientist at stanford university 
says the definition of a landslide varies from election to election 
and is determined partly by how well a candidate does in comparison 
with expectations 
in my characterization i would say a landslide was an 
unexpectedly large share of the popular vote for a given 
candidate brody said its a term of art and people will 
attribute to it whatever they wish 
the dorsey dictionary of american politics doesnt play the 
numbers game instead defining a landslide as a decidedly lopsided 
political victory one in which the opponent is metaphorically 
buried in a landslide 
it notes that texan lyndon johnson earned the sarcastic moniker 
landslide lyndon when he was elected a senator by a majority of 
just 87 votes out of a million cast 
bush and dukakis have been on both ends of lopsided returns 
bush won his 1966 run for the house with a 57 percent to 43 
percent victory over democrat frank briscoe in texas won 
reelection without opposition in 1968 and reveled in the 1980 and 
1984 triumphs of the reaganbush tickets 
he was on the other end in two senate races in 1964 losing to 
democrat ralph yarborough by a 5644 percent margin and in 1970 
falling 5446 to the man who now is dukakis running mate lloyd 
bentsen 
in democratic massachusetts dukakis beat his gop opponents for 
the governorship by margins of 69 percent to 31 percent in 1986 
6037 in 1982 and 5442 in 1974 
but in 1978 he was stunned when edward king defeated him 5142 
in the democratic primary king went on to beat his gop opponent by 
a 5347 margin which may or may not be a landslide depending on 
whose definition is used 
bushs doubledigit lead in current polls could translate into a 
landslide if the numbers hold 
in presidential politics even a slim lead in the popular vote 
can translate into an electoral college bonanza since each state 
awards all its electoral votes to the popular vote winner even if 
the candidate wins by just a hair 
john white a former chairman of the democratic national 
committee noted that reagan won a modest 51 percent of the popular 
vote in 1980 to jimmy carters 41 percent but garnered 489 
electoral votes to carters 49 
under the theory of one man one vote or one woman one vote 
it is not fair but thats the way the law is he said 
hess says the measuring stick for electoral college landslides is 
calibrated on the bigtime losses of the past 
alf landon barry goldwater fritz mondale they are the 
losers in landslides those are the comparedtos he said 
those guys got buried 
1936 landon was outpolled 61 percent to 37 percent and got 
eight electoral votes to franklin d roosevelts 523 
1964 goldwater lost 6139 to johnson and collected 52 electoral 
votes to johnsons 486 
1984 walter mondale went down 5941 to ronald reagan and claimed 
just 13 electoral votes 10 from his home state of minnesota to 
reagans 525 
george mcgovern would feel right at home in that crowd he was 
defeated by richard nixon by a 61 percent to 38 percent margin and 
won 17 electoral votes to nixons 520

the supreme court is studying government 
drugtesting programs which are being challenged in two key cases 
as an unlawful periscope into the private lives of innocent 
people 
the court is expected to announce by july whether testing 
programs for many railroad and customs service employees violate 
their privacy rights 
the two testing cases mark the first time the high court has 
confronted the constitutionality of drug testing in the american 
workplace 
the justices were urged by the reagan administration wednesday to 
uphold the drug tests attorney general dick thornburgh personally 
argued part of the administrations case underscoring the 
importance attached to the issue 
but thornburgh stumbled a few times when the justices asked him 
about details of the tests for railway workers 
im not going to palm myself off on this court as an expert 
thornburgh said 
he had difficulty answering questions about which railroad 
workers were required to undergo the tests 
thornburgh last argued before the high court in 1977 when he 
headed the justice departments criminal division 
this is a case about railway safety he said in defending 
mandatory blood and urine tests for railroad workers after accidents 
or rules violations 
he said the case was about the hazards created by use of drugs 
and alcohol by those in charge of trains 
while thornburgh encountered some problems wednesday his 
opponent in the case also faced sharp questioning 
lawrence mann an attorney for the railway workers said the drug 
tests are unconstitutional because they are incapable of proving 
onthejob impairment 
for example he said the tests can show residue from a drug that 
may have been taken by someone 60 days ago in the privacy of their 
home 
justice antonin scalia asked if it werent reasonable for the 
railroad to want to know if someone responsible for train safety 
has cocaine traces in their system 
the idea scalia continued is to prevent someone using cocaine 
from driving the train the next time 
solicitor general charles fried the reagan administrations top 
courtroom lawyer defended the customs service program in which 
urine tests are required for anyone applying for a promotion or 
transfer to a job involving drug enforcement 
fried noted that critics of the drug tests call them a 
periscope probing the lives of people who are not suspected of 
wrongdoing 
but fried said there is rather special urgent and symbolic 
significance in assuring the public that an agency responsible for 
preventing drug smuggling has a drugfree workforce 
the customs service is indeed entitled to take a fine filter to 
show to itself its workers and the public that workers are not 
involved in drug use he said 
while few customs service workers have tested positive for drugs 
fried said there may have been many who were scared off from 
applying for key jobs because they knew drug use would be exposed 
lois williams representing the customs service employees said 
forcing workers to provide a urine sample while a test supervisor 
waits outside a stall is a humiliating invasion of privacy 
she added that innocent persons have a great deal of reason to 
be apprehensive about the program 
ms williams said the tests will turn up drugs used legitimately 
with a doctors prescription and will force workers to justify 
using the medication to their superiors 
the eventual rulings by the court will not deal generally with 
drug tests for private employees but the decisions could have an 
important psychological impact on whether businesses will demand 
that their workers undergo such tests 
tests conducted by federal state or local governments could be 
affected directly by the courts action 
in the railroad case the federal railroad administration issued 
regulations in 1985 aimed at alleviating a significant safety 
problem caused by alcohol and drug use among employees 
the government said that from 1972 through 1983 railroad 
accidents linked to drug or alcohol abuse killed 42 people injured 
61 and caused some 19 million in property damage 
a federal appeals court struck down the tests for railway 
workers a different federal appeals court upheld tests for customs 
service workers

matthew byrne thinks his son eddie would have 
cast a vote for george bush on tuesday if he had lived to vote 
instead the slain police officer has provided bush with something 
more powerful a symbol 
byrne 22 was killed last february a casualty of the war 
against illegal drugs now his police shield which his father 
presented to bush last month has become a potent totem for the vice 
presidents campaign 
again and again bush has pulled the badge out of his breast 
pocket during speeches held it aloft for the crowd to see and told 
the story of how matthew byrne gave it to him of all the honors he 
has received over the years bush says none means more than 
this 
matthew byrne 54 a cop turned lawyer isnt troubled that bush 
is getting political mileage out of his sons death 
i dont have a problem with that byrne said in a telephone 
interview eddie does stand as a symbol of the terrible 
consequences of drugs and we dont feel that bush is 
exploiting his name 
edward byrne a rookie police officer was shot to death in his 
patrol car on feb 26 as he guarded the home of a witness in a drug 
case the brazenness of the attack shocked the police department 
which deployed massive forces in an effort to track down the killers 
and crush the drug trade in the neighborhood where the killing 
occurred south jamaica queens 
it also galvanized the byrne family within hours of the 
shooting matthew byrne was appearing in public to challenge 
political leaders to put your money where your mouths are to 
fight the drug trade 
with donations they received in eddies memory the byrnes helped 
form a foundation the patrolman edward r byrne substance abuse 
fund that makes grants to organizations involved in drug 
education prevention and rehabilitation 
and matthew byrne has continued to speak out in schools before 
civic groups and law enforcement associations against illegal 
drugs 
weve had to come to grips with the terrible loss the elder 
byrne said but what we as a family decided to do was to take a 
very negative event and try to turn it into something positive 
byrne has criticized past efforts to fight drug abuse blaming 
congress not the reagan administration however he did praise 
congress for recently passing the omnibus drug bill which provides 
money for drug treatment education and enforcement 
the bill also permits the death penalty for drugrelated 
killings although byrne insists that the death penalty is not the 
sole basis for his support of bush it is obviously important he 
calls michael dukakis opposition to the death penalty a 
disgrace 
byrne said he has been a registered democrat for 37 years and 
supports democratic sen daniel patrick moynihans bid for 
reelection but he will split the ticket at the top and believes 
his son would have done the same 
i would say that if eddie were alive today he would support 
the views taken by vice president bush as opposed to michael 
dukakis he said 
nonetheless he conceded that his sons political views were not 
fully formed after all he said he was only 22 years old

the picture shows a grinning george bush 
wearing a hat that looks like a pigs head and alongside the 
headline reads would you want your sister to date this guy 
the picture and headline are on a flier prepared for the michigan 
aflcio the leaflet is part of the quiet and sometimes vicious 
trench warfare going on in the states outside the control of the 
campaigns and the national parties 
a fundraising letter asks republicans in north dakota where 96 
percent of the population is white to imagine life in 1989 with 
jesse jackson as secretary of state 
in michigan a flier titled democratic leadersrepublican 
lies being distributed by the state democratic party shows three 
photographs of bushs friends irans ayatollah khomeini 
panamas manuel noriega and republican vice presidential candidate 
dan quayle 
michigan democratic chairman richard weiner said the flier was 
produced because of republican attacks on democratic presidential 
nominee michael dukakis over the massachusetts prison furlough 
program 
we are handing it out in large quantities weiner said of the 
flier which was supposed to raise questions about bushs judgment 
i think any reasonable person who reads that knows what the 
point of this article is he said 
north dakota gop chairman layton freborg said that he raised the 
hypothetical image of a secretary of state jackson to draw 
attention to him as a liberal not to appeal to racial prejudice 
we did not pick jackson because he was black freborg said 
we picked jackson because of his liberal philosophy and we didnt 
think that would wash too well in north dakota 
under federal election law the state parties can spend unlimited 
sums of money on fliers mailings by volunteers buttons and other 
such traditional tools of the trade 
and then there are the mailings by special interest groups such 
as labor unions antiabortion organizations and others who support 
one presidential candidate or another but are not formally 
affiliated with a campaign or political party 
the scope of the effort is difficult of gauge because there are 
so many groups in so many different places democratic and 
republican officials can say little more than that it is big 
the edge belongs to the republicans because they got into 
computerized mailings years before the democrats 
through dint of experience and experience in direct mail is 
gathered from being able to spend money on it the republicans are 
able to basically flick a switch whereas in a lot of cases the 
democrats are building the machine said bob boorstin deputy 
national field director for the dukakis campaign 
i assume its much bigger because its a presidential election 
year said john grotta deputy director of victory 88 the 
republican national committees program to help state parties 
conduct such efforts we really dont know what is going on out 
there 
the dukakis campaign has tried to keep track of the material sent 
out on its behalf but the volume of the task makes it hard to keep 
up 
there are hundreds and thousands of pieces of literature 
produced during an election year and we have tried to review 
them boorstin said 
for the presidential campaigns much of what is being said for 
them and about them in the states is home grown sometimes 
regrettably so 
in maryland a gop fundraising letter mailed out several weeks 
ago has been repudiated by the bush campaign and brought calls for 
the resignation of state republican chairman daniel fleming from his 
own partys candidates 
the letter ran a picture of dukakis and one of willie horton a 
convicted murderer who escaped while on a massachusetts prison 
furlough and raped a woman in maryland is this your profamily 
team for 1988 the letter asked 
in illinois another gop leaflet also on the prison furlough 
issue issue was denounced as garbage by democrat michael 
dukakis and even drew a letter of protest from convicted mass 
murderer john wayne gacy who the leaflet said would be eligible for 
a weekend pass from prison if he had committed his crimes in 
massachusetts 
i think what happens is you have a lot of local people doing 
mailings and they sometimes step out of line whether theyre a 
jesse jackson liberal or a bush conservative said richard 
viguerie who helped the republicans pioneer use of direct mail

sen dan quayle a staunch foe of abortion 
spoke approvingly of a postrape medical procedure considered by 
many in the field of gynecology as a way to terminate a pregnancy 
faced with the hypothetical question of whether he would oppose 
abortion for a rape victim quayle on tuesday repeated his 
longstanding position that he would allow termination of pregnancy 
only to save the mothers life 
but then quayle said he would accept a postrape emergency 
medical procedure that he said is aimed at preventing conception 
from taking place 
he was referring to a procedure known as dilation and curettage 
dandc a scraping and cleaning of the victims uterine lining 
dr robert shesser an expert in emergency medicine at the george 
washington university medical center said this procedure is not 
normally the firstresort option for physicians treating rape 
victims 
it is not standard in the immediate postrape procedure 
shesser said explaining that the dandc would likely be used only 
if doctors determined that the woman was impregnated by her attacker 
quayle refused to acknowledge under questioning by reporters 
that an abortion in fact would occur if fertilization of an egg by a 
sperm cell had taken place by the time the dandc procedure was 
used 
shesser said that doctors far more frequently give rape victims 
arriving for treatment a kind of morning after pill aimed at 
chemically destroying the ability of a fertilized egg to grow in the 
uterus 
speaking of the dandc procedure he said that we do not do 
that in the immediate postrape period of 36 to 48 hours 
the republican vice presidential candidate who campaigned in 
tennessee and kenucky was attending a private gop breakfast here 
today before flying to greenville sc to appear at a rally and 
mix with voters at a drivein theater quayle was to round out the 
day with a speech at oklahoma state university in stillwater 
quayle conceded later wednesday that the dandc procedure 
happens very seldom but said no one should question his 
opposition to abortion he said he had voted for a constitutional 
amendment to reverse the landmark roe vs wade supreme court 
decision legalizing abortion and that he had voted against 
legislation authorizing the use of federal money to pay for 
abortions 
of the dandc procedure however he said that i dont 
perceive that happening right after a rape as being tantamount to 
abortion 
i think it really is nitpicking because of the votes that we 
have had against abortion the republican vice presidential 
candidate said youre getting into all sorts of very difficult 
sensitive areas that i dont have all the answers to 
leonard dinger a spokesman for the national righttolife 
committee said he had no problem with quayles statements 
our position is that there are certain medical procedures that 
can prevent conception within 24 hours of that rape taking 
place he said if conception has taken place and they would be 
killing that life we would oppose it 
quayle said that while he personally opposes abortion except to 
spare a mothers life he accepts that existing federal law permits 
a woman to have one 
quayle campaigned in tennesee and a heavily democratic part of 
western kentucky wednesday telling a republican rally at an 
owensboro airport hangar that he wants conservativeminded democrats 
to come home to the gop 
he also said that the democratic ticket had tried to distort his 
and george bushs position on gun control and charged that 
democratic nominee michael dukakis doesnt believe in the 
constitutional guarantee of a citizens right to bear arms

sen lowell p weicker jr suddenly 
battling for his political life in a race that many thought just 
weeks ago would be a walkaway is flooding connecticuts airwaves 
with a series of ads striking back at his aggressive democratic 
challenger 
but weickers assault one he all but promised he would never 
launch has not yet brought the thirdterm republican back to 
safety according to a new poll that shows a virtual deadlock with a 
high number still undecided 
joseph i lieberman 46 the states softspoken democratic 
attorney general who has matched the incumbents spending dollar for 
dollar trailed weicker 57 by one point 3837 percent in a 
hartford courant poll released tuesday 
the survey which had a margin of error of three percentage 
points mirrored a poll released two weeks ago that showed the 
combatants with 39 percent each that survey transformed the race 
energizing lieberman and putting weicker on the defensive 
the most telling information from the recent poll was the number 
of undecided voters 25 percent in the last full week of a 
wellpublicized statewide campaign the undecided bloc was less 
than half of that at the same point in 1982 in weickers race 
against democrat toby moffett then a popular fourterm congressman 
the lieberman camp is euphoric over the poll results which the 
democratic challenger said was more than we originally thought 
possible 
for a threeterm incumbent after 18 years to be in trouble as 
deep as he is in a week before the election clearly shows the people 
of connecticut believe its time for a change said marla romash 
issues and communications director for lieberman 
but g donald ferree director of the poll said the news is not 
all cheery for lieberman 
its been a loss of support for weicker rather than a 
conversion into the other camp ferree said 
each candidate blames the others negative tv ads for the large 
number of undecided voters they say the attack ads have distorted 
records and positions confusing voters 
media consultant carter eskew began creating attack ads for 
lieberman early on including a series depicting weicker as a bear 
who slept through votes while collecting thousands in speaking fees 
but weicker who had a solid doubledigit lead in polls through the 
summer said he would resist the temptation to retaliate 
i hope two things happen when the election votes are counted 
no 1 lowell weicker would have won and no 2 it will be the 
first nail in the coffin of the negative campaign that has become 
the vogue in america weicker said just days before the first poll 
showed his big lead had evaporated 
a week later he was on the air with his own series of ads 
denying liebermans charges and attacking the democrats state 
senate attendance record and votes on taxes and drug sanctions 
weicker campaign manager jay malcynsky said the ads are 
clarifying the record 
the media war is the chief contributor to the campaigns 
recordsetting spending weicker plans to spend about 28 million 
and lieberman anticipates spending 25 million at that rate the 
campaign will be the costliest in connecticut political history 
while the video sniping likely is adding to the confusion the 
candidates positions on issues strikingly similar on many and 
seemingly reversed in roles on others undoubtedly has added to 
voters hesitation to back a candidate 
weicker known as a maverick who bolts from the gop rankandfile 
on a range of social and foreign policy issues has built one of the 
most successful political careers in connecticut history by forging 
a delicate base of republican voters independents and democrats 
swayed by his leadership role on civil rights and other social 
issues 
this year he has won endorsements from the aflcio the national 
organization for women and a state nuclear freeze group 
although he has never lost a campaign in his quartercentury 
political career a 32 democratic voter advantage in the state 
makes weickers reelection bids inherently risky 
you could run a blank face in connecticut as a democrat with a 
wellfunded campaign and it puts the republican in a position of 
having one foot in the grave and the other on a banana peel 
malcynsky said 
lieberman in trying to punctuate the differences between himself 
and weicker has attacked the senator variously from the left and 
right often sounding like the republican facing a democratic 
incumbent 
he accuses weicker of wanting to raise taxes says he is too 
close to cuban leader fidel castro and criticizes his opposition to 
a moment of silence in public schools 
but lieberman must walk a political tightrope luring 
conservatives while keeping liberal democrats in line 
the lieberman strategy is to hold democrats split the 
independent vote and capture conservative republicans such as 
national review editor william f buckley jr who would rather have 
anybody else even a democrat in office

raytheon co won a 180 million contract from 
the federal aviation administration to install special radar 
equipment to detect wind shears at major airports beginning in the 
early l990s 
a wind shear is a sudden change of wind direction that causes a 
powerful downburst of air much like water gushing from a faucet the 
air gust is enough to drive a jetliner into the ground when it is 
landing or departing 
the transportation department announced the contract wednesday 
and said the doppler radar will give air traffic controllers and 
pilots a significant safety improvement 
powerful wind shears called microbursts have been the cause of at 
least five airline accidents that claimed more than 500 lives in the 
last 15 years including the l985 crash of a delta air lines jet 
that killed 137 people near dallas 
faa spokesman fred farrar said no final decision has been made on 
where the radars would be installed agency officials previously 
have said the 47 airports would be those with the highest traffic 
levels and a history of wind shear problems 
the faa also said it has an option for 55 additional radars at 
other airports costing another 100 million in the event that it 
receives final approval from administration budget planners and 
congress to expand the program 
the terminal doppler system has a greater potential for 
realizing safety gains than perhaps any other individual item of 
equipment in the faas air traffic modernization program said 
transportation secretary jim burnley in a statement 
faa administrator allan mcartor said the introduction of the 
radar along the approach and departure paths of major airports is 
a major step in providing controllers and pilots with better and 
quicker adverse weather warnings 
last summer in a 60day test program at denvers stapleton 
airport a doppler radar prototype detected 47 strong shears within 
five miles of the airport and more than 200 over the entire area of 
its coverage officials said 
under the multiyear contract raytheons equipment division at 
wayland mass will provide the first terminal doppler radar to the 
faas technical center in atlantic city nj in the fall of l991 
with the first radar for airport delivery in late l992 the faa said 
the faa has had mechanical wind monitoring equipment at many 
major airports for a number of years but experts have said the 
equipment cannot cover along the entire approach and takeoff paths 
used by jetliners and therefore is of minimal benefit 
the wind monitors were in use at the dallasfort worth 
international airport when a delta air lines lockheed l1011 
encountered a powerful microburst during an approach aug 2 1985 
causing it to crash and kill 137 people 
the mechanical monitors also were at the new orleans airport on 
july 9 l982 when a pan american world airways jet encountered a 
wind shear as it took off the boeing 727 crashed killing 153 
people

mental illness or substance abuse will affect 
almost one in three americans at some point during their lifetimes 
according to a federal survey of mental health in the united states 
the survey released wednesday by the national institute of 
mental health found that more than 15 percent of those interviewed 
in five us cities experienced a mental or substance use problem 
during the month prior to the study 
it also found that mental and emotional disorders were most 
common among the younger age groups and that men were more likely 
than women to have substance use and antisocial behavior problems 
women the survey showed had higher rates for affective 
disorders such as depression anxiety and disorders of 
somatization or mental states that are reflected by physical 
symptoms 
published in the november issue of the archives of general 
psychiatry the survey involved interviews with more than 18500 
persons aged 18 or older the interviews were conducted in five 
cities new haven conn baltimore st louis durham nc and 
los angeles 
each person surveyed was asked if he or she had experienced 
symptoms of a mental or substance abuse disorder during the past 
month the past six months or at any time in life 
the results showed that 15 percent reported symptoms of a 
disorder during the month prior to the survey and 322 percent 
reported a disorder at some point in their life for the six months 
prior to the survey 191 percent reported a disorder 
the most common mental disorders reported were socalled anxiety 
and affective disorders anxiety would include phobias and panic 
affective disorders would include depression and manicdepression 
for anxiety the onemonth rates were 73 percent and for 
affective disorders the onemonth rate was 51 percent 
abuse of alcohol and drugs were reported by 68 percent of the 
group under the age of 45 severe cognitive impairment such as

the defense departments personnel security 
system relies almost entirely on background investigations and does 
little onthejob monitoring after a clearance is issued according 
to a critical review 
the report by the federally funded rand corp also criticizes the 
way the department is using a new research center set up to 
investigate more potent defenses against spies 
instead of seeking new methods of safeguarding the nations 
secrets it said the research center is focusing on improvements to 
current procedures it likened that to producing patches for a 
leaky bucket that gets a new patch with every new espionage case 
the rand report says that what is needed instead is a new 
bucket 
the 84page study does not offer specific recommendations of its 
own for changing the militarys approach to document classification 
background checks and employee security 
but it does attack a personnel security program that has been 
based almost entirely on background investigations for the granting 
of clearances 
onthejob monitoring and education have been relatively minor 
efforts by comparison the study notes other than 
debriefings the program has no provisions for personnel whose 
clearances have ended 
the rand corp headquartered in santa monica calif is a 
federally funded think tank that frequently performs special studies 
involving security issues for the defense department and individual 
armed services 
its review of the pentagons personnel security program 
requested by the deputy under secretary of defense for policy was 
completed in september and just recently published 
the team of three rand investigators was asked to review the work 
plans at the new personnel security research and education center 
the center was established at the naval postgraduate school in 
monterey calif in the aftermath of the walker family spy scandal 
that scandal which involved three navy men from the same family 
has been called one of the most damaging cases of espionage in us 
history the spy ring funneled navy submarine secrets to the soviet 
union for about 20 years 
while those who are responsible for personnel security may 
reasonably hope that technology and adequate funding will aid them 
in the future the adverse trends are all too apparent the study 
said 
it said those adverse trends include the militarys increasing 
reliance on computers legal and societal trends that favor more 
litigation and less government secrecy a change in the motivation 
of spies from ideology to avarice and a huge increase in the 
types of things that must be safeguarded 
the only secrets on a battlefield were once maps and messages 
but even the circuit boards or microchips in a projectile may be 
secret today the study noted

a proposed merger of two major corporations 
silicone operations likely would harm competition the federal trade 
commission said as it threatened court action to block a joint 
venture 
the federal agency said wednesday it would seek a court 
injunction if general electric co and union carbide corp decide to 
go ahead with the proposed merger 
ge spokesman jack batty did not say what the two companies 
planned to do but he said they had told the ftc they would not 
proceed with a joint venture without first notifying the federal 
agency 
ge disagrees with the initial decision of the ftc regarding the 
proposed joint venture of union carbide silicones and ge 
silicones batty said we remain committed to working with the 
ftc to resolve any existing issues since we feel the planned merger 
is good for both companies and for us industry 
a union carbide spokesman was unavailable for comment wednesday 
evening 
the proposed joint venture is likely to diminish actual or 
potential competition in a number of different product markets 
the ftc said in a statement 
the federal commission said it voted 40 tuesday to authorize its 
staff to ask a federal district court to grant a preliminary 
injunction blocking the venture if the two companies go ahead 
ftc spokeswoman anna holmquist davis said the commission would go 
to court only if it appeared the joint venture would be carried out 
ge based in fairfield conn is the secondlargest seller of 
silicones worldwide and it owns siliconeproducing plants in new 
york and the netherlands union carbide based in danbury conn 
ranks third in us silicone production and sixth worldwide 
the largest silicone producer is dow corning silicones are used 
in a wide variety of products ranging from fiberglas to foam and 
auto wax 
ge silicones spokesman gregg bronk said ge and union carbide are 
strong in different areas of silicone production and thus complement 
each other the two companies plan to share equally in ownership and 
management of the joint venture he said 
total sales of all silicone products in the united states were 
about 11 billion in 1986

legislation signed by president reagan directs 
the environmental protection agency to draw up a plan to track 
infectious medical wastes such as those that washed up on atlantic 
coast beaches last summer 
white house officials on wednesday announced that reagan had 
signed the bill the president was campaigning for vice president 
george bush in wisconsin at the time 
in a statement reagan was quoted as calling the bill an 
important step forward in the protection of our environment because 
it will ensure that those who generate handle or dispose of medical 
waste are accountable and it will encourage proper handling and 
disposal of such potentially dangerous waste 
the tracking system for medical waste initially would apply to 
only 10 states connecticut new jersey new york pennsylvania 
ohio indiana michigan illinois wisconsin and minnesota 
the program however could become national in scope because any 
other state could decide to have its medical waste covered by the 
plan and gain authority to act against incoming waste not meeting 
the tracking requirements 
congress acted after waves of used syringes vials of 
aidsinfected blood and other hospital waste washed up on beaches 
along the east coast lake michigan and lake erie during the summer 
the waste became a health problem closing some beaches because of 
the threat of hepatitis and other diseases 
the new law requires epa to set up a system to track dangerous 
waste from hospitals labs and clinics to its disposal 
blood hypodermic needles scalpels and surgical and laboratory 
waste that had been in contact with infectious agents all would have 
to be tracked the materials would have to be segregated from other 
medical waste and documented to make sure they reached a proper 
disposal facility 
lawmakers had accused epa of failing to use its regulatory 
authority to resolve the problem 
in 1978 the agency announced plans to regulate medical waste 
but six years later it said it lacked evidence that the wastes were 
causing enough harm to justify regulations 
instead epa released a package of advice to hospitals on 
handling and disposal since then the agency has formed a task 
force to reexamine the issue

the case of a 20yearold woman who served as a 
surrogate mother for her own mother has lifted the veil off a 
thriving business of artificial procreation in italy and spurred 
demands for tighter controls on the practice 
the case possibly the first of its kind in the world has also 
raised difficult ethical questions and provoked protests from 
doctors politicians and the vatican 
and while italy has no laws governing surrogate motherhood the 
episode has prompted a criminal investigation to determine which of 
the two women was registered as the legal mother of the child 
the affair involves a woman who carried to term the artificially 
inseminated egg of her 48yearold mother the egg was fertilized by 
the sperm of the daughters 35yearold stepfather and implanted in 
her uterus 
the arrangement was disclosed in an oct 21 program on staterun 
rai television the two women and the man appeared on the show with 
their faces concealed to protect their identities and their names 
have not been revealed 
the young woman gave birth to a boy at a rome clinic days after 
the program was broadcast newspapers reported 
initially newspapers and some doctors expressed doubts over 
whether such an episode occurred but most became believers when a 
rome gynecologist severino antinori said he performed the 
procedure 
the mother who had three children by an earlier marriage 
explained on the program that her new husband wanted to have 
children but that she was advised by doctors not to have more babies 
because of a uterus condition 
the couple went to antinori who proposed they adopt a child 
but after consulting among themselves the family members returned 
and proposed the daughter act as surrogate mother 
the rai program immediately touched off a debate in medical and 
religious circles over the ethical issues including whether the 
woman who gave birth is the childs mother or sister 
by his act antinori has shattered the meaning of the words 
father mother child and even grandchild said eolo parodi 
president of the italian doctors federation 
on oct 29 the vatican newspaper losservatore romano denounced 
the case in a frontpage editorial 
the young woman was painfully used as an object the paper 
said she was used for nine months as an incubator a prisoner of 
the egotism of the mother and of the detestable techniques 
the gynecologist defended himself and the family 
the uterus was not rented but only donated like a kidney for 
free antinori 43 told italian newspapers genetically the 
situation is very clear the ovule is that of the mother the sperm 
is that of her husband and the uterus is that of the daughter who 
agreed to lend it 
its time for civil society to face up to the problems raised 
by the new biotechnologies without hypocritically burying ones head 
in the sand he said 
the case raised the question of who is the childs legal mother 
according to italian law the woman who gives birth must be 
registered as mother but the older woman said on the program she 
planned to declare herself the mother 
a state prosecutor has opened an investigation to determine 
whether the law was violated a crime punishable by five to 15 years 
imprisonment 
in the united states a landmark february ruling by the new 
jersey supreme court in the socalled baby m case outlawed surrogate 
motherhood for pay 
the court granted custody of a child born under contract to the 
natural father but restored parental rights to the mother a lower 
court later granted the mother mary beth whiteheadgould gradually 
expanded unsupervised visitation with the child 
the outcry over the italian case has led to the first widespread 
public examination in the country of artificial procreation 
including the more ordinary techniques that have been growing in 
popularity in recent years 
luigi la ratta president of the italian association for 
demographic education a nonprofit organization that deals with 
family planning issues said there are 50 public and private sperm 
banks in italy today 
la ratta said 15000 to 20000 italian women visit his 
associations clinics each year with sterility problems 
we have gone from sperm banks which by now no one even blinks 
an eye at to egg transplants to testtube babies and now to the 
surrogate mothersister la ratta said 
health minister carlo donatcattin said he has asked the 
ministrys bioethics commission to devise recommendations for 
regulating artificial procreation

the attorney representing a man in his third 
capital murder trial brings unique insight to the case he was the 
foreman of the jury that convicted the man and sentenced him to 
death nearly 10 years ago 
at first blush i said he cant do that attorney wes hocker 
said after state district judge woody densen appointed him tuesday 
as attorney for john charles zimmerman 
but after i thought about it and asked some legal scholars 
about it i found i really dont have a conflict of interest 
hocker said ive never heard of such a thing but theres no 
impropriety 
hocker served as jury foreman in zimmermans second trial for the 
kidnapping rape and fatal stabbing of his 10yearold niece the 
verdicts in the first and second trials were overturned 
zimmerman 41 had written a letter asking the court to name 
hocker to represent him 
a defense attorneys function is to protect every one of his 
clients rights regardless of guilt or innocence hocker said 
its not the judges or the lawyers place to judge its the 
jurys 
hocker said zimmerman approached him through his law partner 
robert morrow who worked with one of zimmermans attorneys in the 
1979 retrial 
during that trial prosecutors presented letters zimmerman wrote 
to his wife sherry in july 1977 while he was held on charges of 
killing ramona ann abner of jacinto city on march 24 1977 
zimmermans motherinlaw found the letters in which he 
described committing the crime and secretly sent them to the slain 
girls mother who gave them to investigators 
in april the texas court of criminal appeals threw out 
zimmermans conviction and ordered a new trial ruling that the 
letters were confidential communication between husband and wife and 
should not have been admitted as evidence 
hocker said his role as a juror may give him an advantage in 
defending zimmerman in the trial which is scheduled to begin next 
year 
ive sat in judgment of him with 11 others the attorney 
said maybe i can find some insight into what the jurors are 
thinking ive heard what they thought while back there 
deliberating ill have that little something

theft is so rampant at state enterprises in 
cuba that 1 million police couldnt stop it according to a 
secret documentary produced by cuban security forces for the island 
nations leaders 
copies of the crime documentary and another on the alienation of 
cubas young people were smuggled out of the island by a defector 
a screening of the two documentaries produced by the national 
revolutionary police in 1986 was held tuesday evening under the 
sponsorship of freedom house a new yorkbased human rights group 
the second documentary concludes that many of cubas young people 
are alienated lack revolutionary fervor and complain that 
recreational facilities are often run down nonexistent offlimits 
or inaccessible 
freedom house said the tapes were smuggled out of cuba by juan 
antonio rodriguez manier a major in cuban intelligence who defected 
to the west in january 1987 
the extent of crime at state enterprises was such that the 
documentary on that issue concluded with an observation by defense 
minister raul castro that 1 million police couldnt resolve the 
problem without additional accounting controls 
president fidel castro has publicly acknowledged that crime is a 
major problem the documentary shows castro saying in a speech that 
a fierce struggle is needed to wipe out crime 
socialism cant permit this cancer to corrode it that this 
cancer devour it he said 
the documentaries were intended for viewing by high party and 
government officials as a means of dramatizing the magnitude of 
criminal activity and how efforts to inculcate cuban youth with 
revolutionary values have fallen short 
the documentary on crime showed repeated instances of how 
employees at state enterprises were able to take advantage of lax 
accounting to steal cash or goods 
most of the testimony was provided by convicted criminals but 
there was no indication of how they were caught one convict spoke 
of how he was able to make off with 224 cases of coffee worth 67200 
pesos under cubas exchange rate the peso is worth slightly more 
than a dollar 
another witness said he was able to pocket about 100 pesos a day 
in daily receipts from the enterprise where he worked he kept up 
the activity for three years 
yet another said he was able to steal fabric for womens clothes 
and leather for shoes in a gambit that appeared to require little 
planning or imagination a security guard was posted at the 
warehouse where the goods were kept but he was deaf the convict 
said 
several cubans responsible for taking daily cash proceeds from 
their respective enterprises to banks for deposit said they 
routinely undertook the trips alone either on foot or by bus 
without protection 
in the second documentary cuban youths complained to 
interviewers that the best beaches often are reserved for tourists 
and that transportation to the seashore is difficult because of a 
shortage of buses cubas television fare was described as 
garbage and there were scenes of a havana amusement park which 
was in a state of almost total disrepair 
who is the president of cuba one young man was asked 
a perplexed look crossed his face armando dorticos no he 
answers not realizing that dorticos was a former president that 
his first name was osvaldo and that he died several years ago 
castro is the current president

a good samaritan who shot two muggers 
killing one of them as they beat and robbed a screaming woman on a 
brooklyn street was arrested hours later wednesday on a weapons 
charge police said 
clovis fearon 31 who was praised by friends and neighbors 
throughout the day for rescuing 43yearold gertrude george from her 
attackers initially gave his name as anthony dixon after he was 
identified at his latenight arraignment on a gun charge police 
discovered he was a convicted drug dealer fearon pleaded guilty in 
february 1987 to thirddegree criminal sale of a controlled 
substance punishable by up to seven years in prison said assistant 
district attorney starlet jones 
he failed to appear for his sentencing and an arrest warrant was 
issued in march 1987 the prosecutor said 
at his arraignment wednesday before criminal court judge joseph 
silverman fearon pleaded innocent to a felony charge of criminal 
possession of a weapon and bail was set at 500 but he remained 
held on the 1987 warrant 
the gun charge carries a prison sentence of up to seven years 
authorities said 
fearon stepped in to help ms george when he heard her screams 
from his apartment police said 
his actions of course were not criminal in any way in my mind 
except for the possession of the gun police inspector edward 
cappello said before fearons record was known 
one of the two men shot by fearon was arrested for robbery 
assault and criminal possession of stolen property the other was 
found dead a block away clutching the womans jewelry in his hand 
said cappello 
both suspects had arrest records the man who died had three 
robbery charges authorities said 
fearon was inside his apartment at about 1 am when he heard a 
commotion outside and saw two men attacking ms george who lived on 
the same street cappello said ms george was assaulted as she 
returned home from her shift as a nurse at st clares hospital one 
of two jobs she holds police said 
fearon a chef at a restaurant came out of his house with an 
unlicensed 38caliber handgun and fired three shots hitting each 
man once in the back as they stood over ms george said cappello 
i was just screaming dont kill me because i thought that 
was what they were going to do kill me ms george told 
reporters at one point i thought i was going to die 
she described fearon whom she had never met before as a 
decent young man and a good citizen 
hes the only one after i was being robbed and choked he 
was the only one who came to my assistance she said i dont 
think he shot him to kill him but unfortunately the shot was 
fatal 
she said it was difficult to feel bad for her attackers 
it could have been me dead ms george said the guy that 
died showed me no mercy he was very very rough he jumped me from 
the back he squeezed me by the throat burst the chain off my neck 
while the other man was searching my pockets 
cappello identified the dead man as raymond plowden 25 ms 
georges watch and gold chain were found in plowdens hand the 
inspector said timothy lewis 25 was arrested shortly afterward 
when he went to a hospital for treatment of his gunshot wound 
although a police spokesman initially characterized fearon as a 
good samaritan cappello before learning of his criminal record 
refused to call him a hero i dont want to characterize him in 
any way 
cappello said fearon whose car was recently burglarized 
complained to police at the scene about crime in the flatbush 
neighborhood 
ms george was cut and bruised on her face but did not require 
medical treatment authorities said

president was reported captured 
united news of india said president maumoon abdul gayoom 50 who 
was reelected to a third fiveyear term in september was seized 
along with two of his senior cabinet ministers 
the news agency attributed its report to maldivian residents in 
colombo who had been in touch with friends and relatives in male 
uni quoted them as saying about 20 tamilspeaking men wearing 
military uniforms attacked the palace at 430 am and gunfire was 
heard 
that the attackers spoke tamil was an indication they were not 
maldivians 
tamil is the language of ethnic minority groups in sri lanka and 
india the maldivians who are mostly moslem speak divehi which is 
akin to the sinhalese language of sri lankas ethnic majority 
maldives 400 miles southwest of sri lanka and india consists of 
1200 lowlying coral islands only 200 of which are inhabited by 
the estimated 190000 people 
a senior sri lankan government official said a resident of the 
maldives telephoned him from male and gave him the news of an 
assault on the palace the official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity did not identify his informant and gave few details 
officials at the maldivian high commission in colombo also 
speaking on condition of anonymity said they had heard the same 
report but had not been able to reach their capital by telephone to 
confirm it

a soho loft was the scene of a historic moment in 
soviet art this week when mihail chemiakin was invited to be the 
first emigre visual artist to return to his homeland for an 
exhibition devoted solely to his work 
when he returns to the soviet union in march for his first visit 
since being exiled in 1971 chemiakin will join the ranks of dancer 
mikhail baryshnikov and pianist vladimir horowitz other emigres 
invited back to share their talent with their native land 
tair salachov the first secretary of the union of soviet 
artists arrived without fanfare tuesday night at chemiakins studio 
loft crammed with the art soviet authorities had once found so 
objectionable that the artist was forced to live in an insane asylum 
for six months 
salachovs visit formalized the unions invitation to chemiakin 
whose moscow exhibition has been in the planning stages since june 
the show will open march 24 at the house of artists the unions 
exhibition space at the tetyakov gallery 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachevs policies of glasnost or 
openness and improved relations with the united states have made it 
possible for the two cultures to begin interaction the union 
leader said 
chemiakin was chosen for the historic show he said because of 
the extraordinary scope of his work and the soviet art 
communitys admiration for him 
moreover salachov added i like his art 
the 47yearold artist says he has mixed emotions about 
returning to moscow 
im not bubbling with enthusiasm chemiakin said in russian 
as his associate sarah dekay translated the russians should have 
woken up a long time ago 
but he added if the policies of gorbachev are going to 
continue i would like to have more substantial contact with 
russians to restore and fill in the gaps of the art students 
there 
chemiakin dressed in a camouflage jacket and black boots 
escorted salachov around the loft where he lives and works 
everywhere are examples of his insatiable creative energy 
illustrations he did for dostoevskys crime and punishment 
authentic african masks that inspired the colorfully grotesque 
characters of his carnival in st petersburg series and 
sculptures of skulls that he designed and a fellow emigre artist 
executed his paintings which defy categorization sell for up to 
125000 
skulls are a recurrent theme in chemiakins art he currently is 
working on a triptych about the holocaust each panel shows a dark 
skull with the name of a concentration camp dachau buchenwald and 
auschwitz emblazoned in red 
i grew up amid skulls chemiakin explained 
his father was a colonel in the soviet army and after world war 
ii was appointed commandant of the countrys occupation forces in 
konigsberg the capital of east prussia that today is the soviet 
city kaliningrad 
roaming with my young friends through destroyed konigsberg i 
would often come across halfmummified bodies naturally these 
images stayed with me the artist wrote in a two volume book on 
his oeuvre entitled chemiakin 
in 1957 chemiakin and his family moved to leningrad where he 
entered an art school for gifted children his difficulties with the 
authorities began almost immediately he was expelled from school 
but he continued his artistic education on his own copying the 
works of french and dutch masters during his spare time as a mover 
at the hermitage museum soon he grew restless with the dogmas of 
socialist realism and began to experiment with new ways of depicting 
soviet life 
his work was labeled an ideological diversion by soviet 
authorities chemiakin said and his exhibitions were closed down 
and often the works were confiscated 
we were labeled psychologically abnormal people and so attempts 
were made to either hide us away in insane asylums which happened 
to me and which happened also to many of my friends or they tried 
to send us off even further away 
chemiakin was exiled from the soviet union in 1971 he lived in 
paris until 1981 when he came to new york he currently is seeking 
american citizenship 
salachov an artist who has held government appointed positions 
in the art field since 1968 was philosophical about past soviet 
intolerance for chemiakins art and his treatment by authorities 
it was a different time he said 
the goal today is to support everything that has talent 
because there are people on the right and people on the left but 
everything that is truly talented as a new step we will support 
salachov said through an interpreter 
chemiakin is critical of the united states where he says the art 
scene is controlled by big money but he says he doesnt consider 
returning to his homeland to live 
im glad ive found a second country and im glad that on my 
poster for this exhibition that i will be identified as an american 
artist

next year residents of this rural community 
dotted with ranches will be able to saddle up trigger trot past 
hitching posts and then order a big mac to go at a drivethrough 
window 
bowing to popular demand mcdonalds will level its fastfood 
restaurant and replace it next may with a 1 million woodandbrick 
outlet resembling a saloon 
franchise owner mickey maros said he was inspired to renovate the 
restaurant after increasing numbers of customers on horseback began 
showing up at his drivethrough window 
it sounds funny in 1988 to say that maros said people 
think of south florida as being so urban davie is so rural 
after beating sand off their chaps davie cowboys will be able to 
water their horses in a corral out back which will offer salt 
licks hay and troughs of water 
maros said he hopes the new restaurant will draw more horseback 
customers by making them feel at home but the newcomers may fuel 
demand for a different type of gadget for the restaurants cleanup 
crew 
i hope we have a need to buy more pooperscoopers maros said

the marine mammal commission said it would look 
into allegations that navy trainers beat and starved dolphins in a 
classified surveillance program but a navy spokesman denied the 
animals were mistreated 
we dont punish mammals or any of the animals for not 
performing tasks but we reward them with food for satisfactory 
performance said lt ken ross a navy spokesman at the pentagon 
we aim to keep them as healthy as possible because they are very 
valuable to us 
ross was responding wednesday to allegations by dolphin trainer 
rick trout who this week told a meeting of marine animal trainers 
that he witnessed incidences of abuse weight loss corporal 
punishment and damage to animals after transport 
trainers also use very negative methods including food 
deprivation corporal punishment and other aversive techniques 
said trout a civilian hired to work with the dolphins in san diego 
where they are trained by the navy to help detect mines or enemy 
frogmen 
ross insisted that the program operated out of the naval ocean 
systems center was running smoothly but he said an 
investigation will be conducted to ensure the animals are being 
cared for properly 
those are allegations we are checking ross saidour 
primary concern is the health and safety of the animals and the 
treatment of all our animals is well within the marine mammal 
protection act we never have and never intend to do anything that 
could bring harm to the animals 
a veterinarian is always either present or on call during 
training he said adding that the navy considered the programs 
dolphin mortality rate of 5 percent to be better than the species 
mortality rate in the wild 
trout who no longer works for the navy made his comments in an 
appearance before the international marine animal trainers 
association meeting in san antonio texas 
the seattle postintelligencer citing unidentified sources 
reported wednesday that four of the navys three dozen dolphins have 
died during the past 18 months and that an undetermined number of 
others were blinded or crippled by abusive handlers 
john twiss executive director of the washingtonbased marine 
mammal commission said the navys dolphin training center met or 
exceeded all standards published by the animal and plant health 
inspection service of the department of agriculture in 1986 
nevertheless he said the commission which advises federal 
agencies on the handling of marine mammals wants to find out if 
there is any truth to the allegations 
well try to find out what is actually happening were 
certainly not going to disregard a story like this twiss said 
navy officials said they were aware of two dolphin deaths within 
the program in recent months and were checking the reports of 
additional deaths 
one of the dolphins died while on assignment in the persian gulf 
last year from complications of a bacterial infection the second 
died of unknown causes while on being trained near indian island off 
washington state

auctioneer eric nelson standing in a barren living room of the home 
that was once the scene of some of this citys swankiest parties

twostory property with 10549 square feet of living space by

angeles and the remainder is on display at the liberace museum a few 
blocks from the home 
there are a lot of fond memories in this place said dora 
liberace sisterinlaw of the entertainer and head of the museum 
there were a lot of fun times here 
it bothers me today because you know its so final

the guerrilla raids wednesday followed by hours a rebel mortar 
attack on national guard headquarters in san salvador that left four 
dead and 37 wounded 
rebels attacked a sugar refinery nine miles north of the capital 
before dawn wednesday said the head of plant security who 
identified himself only as sgt sandoval 
they attacked us with mortars and rifle fire but they didnt 
destroy the machinery they damaged the offices and they killed 
four soldiers and wounded four others he said 
about the same time rebels killed two national guardsmen in a 
30minute attack on a post at a nearby highway bridge military 
sources said 
in washington state department spokesman charles redman said the 
guerrillas were mounting a coincident diplomatic effort in the 
region to portray themselves as somehow more moderate in their 
stance and more powerful than they really are 
redman said the attacks did not alter plans by secretary of state 
george p shultz to attend a foreign ministers meeting of the 
organization of american states in san salvador in midnovember 
four soldiers were killed and 37 people including seven

the assailants along with three other inmates demanded 
political asylum in mexico in exchange for releasing the hostages a 
nurse and two prison guards 
communications minister roberto viera told reporters that about 
100 prisoners not involved in the hostagetaking had tried to flee 
the prison which was surrounded by troops 
the attempted escape provoked the six hostagetakers who threw a 
grenade and began shooting at the troops and fleeing prisoners 
viera said 
when the rioters began firing the special forces intervened 
viera said 
reporters on the scene saw the commandos blow open the doors of 
prison cells and toss tear gas grenades inside to force the 
prisoners out 
viera said three of the six hostagetakers and one of the guards 
they had held were killed the nurse and the other guard were freed 
unharmed while a prisoner not involved in the hostagetaking was 
slightly wounded he said

lie

revival band came to him in january 1985 with a copy of fogertys 
newly released solo album and an earlier creedence song 
fantasy records creedences label from 1967 to 1972 is suing

fourteen workers at the troubled savannah 
river nuclear weapons plant were exposed to tiny amounts of 
plutonium outside buildings and five went home with the potentially 
deadly contaminant on their shoes officials said 
the soles of their shoes effectively screened out any harmful 
radiation and none of the workers homes were found to have 
unusually high levels of radiation plant officials said wednesday 
approximately 120 small spots of contamination were found most 
of which were found on the ground said becky apter a spokeswoman 
for du pont which operates the plant for the us department of 
energy 
the ground contamination in the chemical separations area has 
been cleaned up but decontamination was continuing on the roof of 
one building she said 
however officials said they did not know how the plutonium got 
outside the buildings in the area or its exact source 
the plutonium could have come from a buildings stack which 
vents the buildings air filter system or from improper handling of 
waste material or moving of nuclear material from one building to 
another said du pont health protection superintendent bill reinig 
the amount of contamination was small about one microcurie 
you could pick up all the spots you could eat it all and you 
would still be less than 10 percent of the federal limit of 
plutonium in the body reinig said 
michael lowe a spokesman for the environmental watchdog group 
greenpeace charged that the oct 26 incident was just another 
indication of poor safety standards at the plant located across the 
savannah river from augusta ga 
heres a good example of where normal procedures which would 
be considered arguably safe would be safe if the doe was diligent 
with safety he said how many operations at savannah river a 
day are performed that have the same institutional problems 
the plant is the largest complex in the governments nuclear 
weapons production system its three reactors were the only ones in 
the nation still producing the major nuclear weapons materials 
plutonium and tritium before they were shut down by doe in april 
for safety reasons 
some congressmen have expressed concerns over continuing health 
problems at savannah river and other nuclear weapons plants last 
month the physicians for social responsibility called for the 
creation of a national medical board to assess the problems 
at another plant in fernald ohio state officials said 
wednesday that more radioactive radium was released into the great 
miami river from uranium processing than earlier realized 
increasing the potential health threat to nearby residents 
after the savannah rivers oct 26 incident workers conducted a 
survey and detected low levels of plutonium between two buildings 
and on the roof of one of them said ms apter 
reinig said plutonium emits radioactive alpha rays small amounts 
of which can be completely shielded by a thin piece of paper 
the alpha rays can be stopped by the soles of the shoes he 
said employees sustained no radiation dose it doesnt become a 
hazard unless it is ingested into the body 
he said there was no indication whatsoever that any of the 
material was ingested and monitoring devices indicate no 
contamination was carried off the site in the air or water 
ms apter said du pont investigators checked 200 workers and 
found that nine who were on the site at the time had picked up 
contamination they later found five more had picked up 
contamination but had gone home before it was detected 
their homes were checked and no radioactivity was found ms 
apter said 
in ohio the new information about the river contamination was in 
documents filed by the department of energy as part of the defense 
the department has prepared for national lead of ohio inc the 
plants former operator in a classaction lawsuit 
its definitely new stuff said graham mitchell a spokesman 
for the ohio environmental protection agency 
residents of the fernald community filed the lawsuit in us 
district court in cincinnati earlier this year contending the 
operator allowed radioactive uranium dust to escape from the plant 
damaging their health and property

television and radio interviews with the ira and 10 other militant 
groups in northern ireland 
the 650seat house rejected by 244 votes to 183 an amendment by 
the socialist opposition labor party seeking to condemn the ban as 
incompatible with a free society 
but several members of mrs thatchers conservative party sided 
with labor in criticizing the ban as damaging censorship 
tv journalists at the british broadcasting corp and commercial 
tv companies in london and wales and journalists at the london 
headquarters of the bbcs world service plan 24hour strikes to 
protest the ban 
the bbc world service broadcasts to a worldwide audience of 120 
million 
the ban covers interviews with members and supporters of the 
outlawed irish republican army its legal political wing sinn fein 
and nine other groups in northern ireland four of them protestant 
it applies only to facetoface interviews and television and 
radio reporters remain free to cite the views of the 11 groups 
provided they do so indirectly the ban does not apply to newspapers 
or foreign television and radio services and will not apply during 
elections 
home secretary douglas hurd the cabinet member responsible for 
law and order among other matters imposed the ban on oct 19 using 
legal powers he possesses over broadcasting authorities 
the ban did not require parliamentary approval but hurd 
nevertheless promised a commons debate on the issue the debate 
began wednesday night 
the rejected labor amendment said the ban was likely to help the 
guerrillas by providing them with the opportunity to argue that 
the government will not allow the wide expression of opinion which 
is essential to democratic debate and peaceful change 
but hurd said during the debate those who live by the bomb and 
the gun and those who support them cannot in all circumstances be 
accorded the same rights as the rest of the population 
he added we shall soon be putting to parliament new and 
stronger measures of this kind bearing in particular on the funds 
of terrorist organizations 
he did not elaborate but the government has said it plans to 
introduce measures to enable authorities to seize the funds of 
guerrilla groups 
the moves follow an upsurge of ira attacks this year on british 
security forces in northern ireland mainland britain and 
continental europe 
the mainly roman catholic ira wants to end british rule in 
predominantly protestant northern ireland and unite the province 
with the mainly catholic republic of ireland under socialist rule 
protestant militants oppose all talk of unity with the republic 
conservative legislators who criticized the ban in the debate 
included cyril townsend he said the government in its haste has 
come forward with a measure that is going to damage our party and 
damage our country this is a measure of censorship 
television journalists at the bbc voted wednesday to join a 
oneday strike on nov 10 called by the national union of 
journalists 
journalists at commercial television companies in london and 
cardiff in wales and at the bbc world service plan similar 24hour 
strikes but no date has been announced for the stoppages

oliver north the stoic former marine 
ignored angry taunts abusive banners and constant interruptions and 
praised the virtues of free speech in an address at boston college 
after a month of controversy over his scheduled appearance north 
quipped wednesday night about his 25000 honorarium hinted he 
might someday seek public office and claimed he voted for john f 
kennedy in 1960 when he was 17 
the former national security council staffer indicted for his 
role in the irancontra affair received a minutelong standing 
ovation and wild support from a crowd that jeered hecklers and 
chanted usa usa usa as police dragged demonstrators 
from a campus gym 
in a previous occupation i could have gotten combat pay for 
this said north who was protected by a phalanx of police 
but he stared at his notes when a melee broke out in the crowd 
and was eventempered when a protester yelled hes a drugrunner 
and another tossed a placard bearing a swastika and called north a 
fascist 
i quite honestly resent the label of fascist north said 
my father was terribly wounded in the war against the fascists 
there were no arrests but police forcibly evicted six people 
from the crowd of about 4000 who paid 7 each to hear north loud 
organized protests and counterprotests preceded the speech at the 
normally tranquil jesuit college 
i welcome the fact that there are those with dissenting views 
and i welcome the fact that in this wonderful and blessed country of 
ours there is an opportunity to express those views he said 
in many of the countries which claim a great deal of support 
to include nicaragua the same power of free speech is not given 
north said to cheers 
north 45 is awaiting trial on 16 counts of conspiracy to 
defraud the us government by selling arms to iran and transferring 
the profits to the rebels fighting the overthrow the leftist 
nicaraguan government he said he has spoken in 30 states during the 
last four months to raise money for his defense estimated to cost 
more than 1 million 
with his voice cracking as it did during the televised 
irancontra hearings in the summer of 1987 north wearing a dark 
suit and red tie quoted thomas jefferson winston churchill and 
kennedy the first president i was blessed to vote for 
but north was born oct 7 1943 which would have made him just 
17 shy of the voting age when kennedy was elected in 1960

hourlong speech north said his goals are to finish up this legal 
case pay off the money from that and return at some point to the

riot police with firebombs and rocks today in seoul and other 
cities and demanded the arrest of former president chun doohwan on 
corruption charges

leading to chuns house to repel the protesters police used tear 
gas whenever students tried to break through their lines 
traffic came to a standstill and most shops in the areas were 
closed as the fighting persisted for several hours many pedestrians 
wore gauze masks or put hankerchiefs over their noses to filter out 
the acrid tear gas 
in front of sogang university at the center of seoul clashes 
about 700 students brandishing hundreds of firebombs repeatedly 
charged about 500 riot police who were blocking their march police 
retaliated with tear gas 
firebombs exploded in showers of orange flames near or amidst 
columns of police who deflected the missiles with shields and put 
out blazes with handcarried extinguishers

a un report on human rights in iran says 
a renewed wave of executions occurred about the same time the 
countrys islamic fundamentalist government agreed to a ceasefire 
with iraq 
a copy of the report to the general assembly obtained wednesday 
calls for continued scrutiny of irans human rights practices 
citing executions of political dissidents and other reports of 
abuses 
the first secretary of irans un mission amir hossein 
zamaninia said the mission had seen the report and had no comment 
un special representative reynaldo galindo pohl of el salvador 
said in his report a large number of prisoners members of 
opposition groups were executed during the months of july august 
and early september 1988 
the ceasefire putting at least a temporary halt to a war that 
since 1980 has left at least 1 million dead and injured was signed 
aug 20 by iran and iraq 
most of those executed since midsummer were said to be members of 
the peoples mujahedeen an outlawed opposition group but the 
report said about 20 belonged to such other opposition groups as the 
tudeh party a marxist organization and the peoples fedayeen 
it did not say how many people had been put to death but 
mentioned groups of executions cited in iranian and other media from 
july through september that included 1140 political executions and 
others for common crimes 
the washington office of the peoples mujahedeen said there has 
been a dramatic rise in political arrests torture and executions 
in iran since september 
specifically in the last three months alone more than 10000 
persons have been arrested and thousands executed on the charge of 
opposition to ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis regime said a 
statement by spokesman aladdin touran distributed at un 
headquarters 
the un report notes that the executions followed a july 2528 
raid into iran by national liberation army the armed wing of the 
peoples mujahedeen 
it said persecution of bahai worshipers appears to have 
decreased although irans attitude toward members of the faith has 
not changed bahais are denied the right to practice their faith in 
iran and cannot obtain higher education or work for the government 
by july 1988 a number of bahais including some prominent 
members of the bahai community who had been arrested allegedly 
because of their faith were released from prison and some prison 
sentences were reduced the report said 
galindo pohl interviewed seven bahais and nine sympathizers of 
the peoples mujahedeen who formerly lived in iran in addition to 
obtaining written accounts and information from iranian media his 
report said 
the report noted irans contention that islamic law may not match 
every tenet of international law and its disagreement with the 
principle that adherence to international law is a must for every 
state

a convicted drug dealer who skipped his 
sentencing a year ago and lived as a fugitive was caught when his 
good samaritan instincts led him to aid a neighbor who was being 
beaten and robbed officials said 
clovis fearon 31 gave police a false name anthony dixon after 
he killed one attacker and injured another with his unlicensed gun 
early wednesday in brooklyn rescuing 43yearold gertrude george 
but after he was arrested on a gun possession charge police 
learned his real identity and found an outstanding arrest warrant 
against him 
police said fearon rushed out to help ms george when he heard 
her screams from his apartment early wednesday morning ms george 
lived on the same street but said later she did not know fearon 
i was just screaming dont kill me because i thought that 
was what they were going to do kill me ms george said at one 
point i thought i was going to die 
ms george said fearon was the only one who came to my 
assistance 
his actions of course were not criminal in any way in my mind 
except for the possession of the gun police inspector edward 
cappello said before fearons true identity was revealed 
fearons gun was found by police inside his apartment the 
inspector said fearon whose car was recently burglarized 
complained to police at the scene about crime in the area 
at his arraignment wednesday night before brooklyn criminal court 
judge joseph silverman fearon pleaded innocent to the gun charge 
and bail was set at 500 but he remained held on the outstanding 
warrant 
fearon had pleaded guilty feb 9 1987 to thirddegree criminal 
sale of a controlled substance punishable by up to seven years in 
prison said assistant district attorney starlet jones 
he failed to appear for sentencing and a warrant was issued on 
march 23 1987 the prosecutor said 
timothy lewis 25 of brooklyn one of the men shot by fearon 
was arrested for robbery assault and criminal possession of stolen 
property the other alleged bandit raymond plowden 25 of 
brooklyn was found dead a block from the scene clutching ms 
georges jewelry in his hand said cappello 
lewis escaped but was arrested a short time later when he arrived 
at brookdale hospital for treatment of his gunshot wound police 
said he was in stable condition there 
plowden had been arrested five times including three times for 
robbery and was wanted on a bench warrant at the time of his death 
police said lewis had three previous arrests two on drug charges 
police said 
ms george a longtime resident of the flatbush neighborhood was 
attacked while she was returning home from her job as a nurse one 
of two jobs she holds police said 
fearon a chef came out of his house with a 38caliber handgun 
and fired three shots hitting each man once in the back as they 
stood over ms george cappello said 
it could have been me dead ms george said the guy that 
died showed me no mercy he was very very rough he jumped me from 
the back he squeezed me by the throat burst the chain off my neck 
while the other man was searching my pockets 
ms george suffered cuts and bruises to her face but declined 
treatment cappello said she later identified both suspects

plaintiffs in a securities fraud trial 
involving a 225 billion municipal bond default that was the 
largest in us history say theyll fight a 10 million settlement 
offer they consider chicken feed 
meanwhile us district judge william browning denied a request 
for a mistrial wednesday by one of the four remaining defendants in 
the washington public power supply system case 
the trial which resumed wednesday after a fiveday recess was 
to continue today 
a 226 million settlement between the plaintiffs mostly wppss 
bondholders and most of the defendants was reached monday it 
includes contributions of 181 million from 14 public utility 
defendants 35 million from the federal bonneville power 
administration and 10 million from washington state 
arthur hoffer chairman of a committee of bondholder plaintiffs 
which also filed a separate classaction suit in washington state 
court against the state of washington for alleged negligence said 
wednesday in seattle that his group would fight the states 
settlement offer in the federal suit 
the offer is contingent upon the dropping of the bondholders 
statelevel suit which seeks 725 billion 
hoffer said browning should not have jurisdiction to dismiss the 
state case its a different court different defendants 
different courses of action different damages he said 
c richard lehmann treasurer of the bondholder committee said 
bondholders were unhappy with bonneville power administrations 
offer lehmann said they were quite happy with the 181 million 
offered by the utilities but he called the other offers chicken 
feed 
four defendants remain in the trial the snohomish county wash 
public utility district the sole remaining utility defendant 
engineering firms ebasco services inc and united engineers and 
contractors inc and financial adviser blyth eastman paine webber 
inc 
they are accused of conspiring to lie and hide information that 
might have discouraged potential investors of wppss municipal bonds 
that were used to build two nuclear power plants 
the unfinished plants were scrapped in 1982 and wppss defaulted 
on the bonds a year later 
on wednesday chemical bank attorney thomas barr played tapes of 
meetings by the sevenmember participants committee that made 
decisions for the 88 utilities involved in the projects 
the tapes from mid1981 revealed the utilities feared that 
terminating the plants would drive some of the utilities into 
bankruptcy and that the committee discussed the merits of defaulting 
on the bonds 
the trial was recessed oct 27 when browning told the jury that 
efforts were under way that might shorten the trial 
before the trial resumed browning denied a request for a 
mistrial by the snohomish county utility attorneys in the case 
refused to discuss the request citing the judges gag order 
when the trial resumed browning told the 17 jurors that 
settlements had been reached but that the jurors should not infer 
anything from them 
browning reminded the jury who the remaining defendants were he 
also reminded the panel that chemical bank of new york a trustee 
for bondholders was suing only the snohomish county utility and 
that the class plaintiff representing more than 24000 past and 
present bondholders had claims against all the remaining defendants 
browning had ruled before the trial begain sept 7 that no 
mention of settlements be made to the jury even though key former 
defendants including wppss itself were no longer in the case but 
frequently were mentioned in opening statements and testimony 
the trial was moved to tucson because it was not felt an unbiased 
jury could be found in washington state

global cooling put dinosaurs and other 
creatures in jeopardy of extinction says a study suggesting neither 
volcanic eruptions nor asteroids striking earth could be the sole 
cause of a mass wipeout 66 million years ago 
the climate was going through a severe change approximately 
200000 years before the mass extinctions said university of 
california santa barbara geologist lowell d stott who presented 
the findings wednesday at the geological society of americas annual 
meeting in denver 
stott said he and his coauthor ucsb geologist james p kennett 
believe the cooling trend may have made these organisms 
susceptible to events associated with an asteroid or comet impact 
or other phenomena such as volcanic eruptions 
the extinctions appear to have resulted from several things 
happening within a relatively short period of time kennett said 
many scientists believe the mass extinctions happened because 
eruptions or objects smashing into earth sent enough dust and soot 
skyward to block out sunlight plunging the planet into darkness and 
cold that killed foods many creatures needed for survival 
the new study doesnt rule out either possibility but shows 
earths climate started getting colder earlier stott said by phone 
from denver 
stott and kennett studied the amount of two forms of oxygen in 
tiny fossil seashells they determined that ocean temperatures near 
antarctica dropped 2 to 4 degrees about 200000 years before 
dinosaurs and about twothirds of other species died 
certainly this major change in climate must have had a 
significant effect on plants and animals living at the time stott 
said however it appears to be more of a contributing factor to 
rather than a direct cause of the extinctions 
the theory that an asteroid or comet striking earth triggered 
mass extinctions was first proposed in 1980 by a team of university 
of california berkeley scientists led by nobel laureate physicist 
luis alvarez 
many fossil experts countered that the mass extinction 66 million 
years ago occurred in a stepwise fashion with the dieoff 
stretching over a period of hundreds of thousands of years 
that prompted the berkeley team to modify the theory saying the 
extinctions were caused by a shower of asteroids or comets over a 
longer period 
a growing number of researchers support that theory although 
others insist volcanic eruptions were responsible some say asteroid 
impacts could have smashed deep enough to trigger eruptions others 
dispute the impact and volcanic theories arguing that gradual 
climate change coupled with changes in sea levels caused extinctions 
the ucsb study suggests there may be truth to all the theories 
no one knows what caused the cooling detected by kennett and 
stott one possibility is that the amount of carbon dioxide in the 
atmosphere declined causing a reverse greenhouse effect in 
which less solar radiation was trapped by the gas causing 
temperatures to drop 
another theory stott said is that new seaways gradually opened 
and closed as the continents drifted resulting changes in ocean 
circulation could change global temperatures he explained 
it also is possible that an earlier impact before the big one 
that killed the dinosaurs was responsible both for cooling and for 
some extinctions that took place earlier said astrophysicist 
richard muller a member of alvarez team at ucberkeley and 
lawrence berkeley laboratory 
the idea that extinctions had multiple causes also is possible 
muller said by phone from berkeley 
stott and kennett detected ancient climactic cooling by studying 
the ratios of oxygen18 and oxygen16 in fossilized plankton shells 
taken from rocks beneath the weddell sea in antarctica the shells 
absorbed oxygen when the creatures lived oceans contains less 
oxygen18 when the water is warmer and more when the water is cooler

the american medical association moved to stop 
sales of a new smokeless cigarette being marketed by rj 
reynolds co saying the product is nothing more than a delivery 
system for the drug nicotine 
the nations largest medical association filed petitions in two 
states wednesday in an effort to halt distribution of the product 
called premier 
rj reynolds countered with a news release saying the ama was 
both inaccurate and hypocritical 
premier smoke substantially reduces many of the chemical 
compounds that the critics of smoking have been complaining about 
reynolds release said reynolds finds it difficult to understand 
how the ama can in good faith suggest that premier be banned 
premier is a cigarette not a drugdelivery system as the 
ama has alleged 
the amas legal challenge was filed in petitions in arizona and 
missouri where the product is being test marketed 
in april the association petitioned the federal food and drug 
administration to regulate premier as a drug although cigarettes 
currently are not regulated that way that petition is pending 
premier contains nicotine an addictive drug which has been 
implicated in cardiovascular disease complications of 
hypertension and other medical problems the ama said 
the scientific evidence is crystal clear about the adverse 
health effects of nicotine and carbon monoxide dr roy schwarz of 
the ama said at a news conference 
the fda currently does not regulate tobacco products unless they 
make a medical claim spokesman william grigg said he said the ama 
maintains in its fda petition that premier should be regulated 
because it makes an inherent health claim 
the main difference between premier and other cigarettes is that 
the tobacco in them is warmed not burned said reynolds spokeswoman 
maura payne in winstonsalem nc 
she said the cigarettes contain a nicotine level of 04 
milligrams and carbon monoxide at about the same level as a 
lights brand 
the cigarettes also show a virtual elimination of sidestream 
smoke or smoke off the lit end of the cigarette the elimination of 
ash and no tobacco aroma she said 
but rj reynolds a subsidiary of rjr nabisco said it has 
treated premier no differently than any other cigarette 
the company began selling premier in tucson ariz phoenix and 
st louis around oct 1 but no date had been set for national 
distribution ms payne said the cost per pack would run about 25 
percent higher than other cigarettes 
health officials in arizona and missouri said the issue in their 
states boils down to a question of jurisdiction 
dr robert harmon director of the missouri department of health 
said his state had been considering action against premier for some 
time but he expected any decision was at least a week away 
i agree that the product should be regulated as a drug and i 
wrote to the fda on feb 25 asking it to do so harmon said it 
is mainly a matter of state or federal jurisdiction 
joe rowan deputy director of the arizona board of pharmacy 
which received the amas petition said the document has been 
taken to the state attorney generals office 
they will advise the board as to what action they can take or 
should take if any he said

vietnam today turned over to a us 
military team what it believes are the remains of 23 americans 
unaccounted for from the vietnam war a us spokesman said it was 
one of the largest such turnovers 
a us military honor guard solemnly saluted as the remains in 
coffins draped with folded us flags were loaded onto a hercules 
c141 transport plane during a short ceremony at hanois noi bai 
airport maj dan trout said 
the plane left the vietnamese capital for guam en route to 
honolulu there the us central identification laboratory will try 
to confirm the preliminary analyses done by the vietnamese said 
trout spokesman for the us pacific command 
trout said the remains included 21 sets the vietnamese found in 
their own searches and the two sets that usvietnamese teams 
recovered during unprecedented joint field investigations near hanoi 
from sept 25 to oct 5 
the vietnamese provided a list of some names and information on 
the remains trout said without elaborating sources said earlier 
that vietnam has given the united states a list of at least nine 
names 
todays return was among the largest since the january 1973 paris 
peace accords ended us military involvement in a war that claimed 
58000 american lives the communists defeated the usbacked south 
vietnam government in april 1975 
trout said that since the accords the united states has received 
the identified remains of 196 missing persons including 168 from 
vietnam 26 from laos and two from china that leaves 2387 
americans missing in action or mia in vietnam laos and cambodia 
in august 1987 vietnams foreign minister nguyen co thach and 
a special us presidential envoy retired gen john w vessey 
reached agreement to hasten cooperation on the mia issue 
todays turnover brought to 90 the number of suspected remains 
vietnam has provided since the thachvessey agreement so far the 
us laboratory has identified 25 set of remains as those of missing 
americans 
also today seven us military specialists returned to bangkok 
after winding up a second joint field investigation with the 
vietnamese they were to have inspected us warplane crash sites 
and other areas west of hanoi during the 10day project trout said 
they didnt run into any serious weather problems trout 
said they did not find any specific remains this time 
he said that as with the first joint investigation the teams 
were trying to resolve discrepancy cases those in which the 
united states says there is evidence vietnamese authorities have 
information on the servicemens fate these includes cases of airmen 
captured but never returned 
most american losses in northern vietnam were airmen shot down 
during bombing runs 
vietnam had for years refused repeated requests for the field 
investigations us officials said they were gratified by the 
recent cooperation on the issue long subjected to emotional 
bickering between the two countries 
but ted sampley head of the national steering committee for 
american war veterans on wednesday accused the vietnamese of using 
turnovers for political ends 
they are timing it for the presidential election sampley 
said in a telephone interview from the united states 
the committee a private lobbying group has accused washington 
of pursuing only the remains of the dead while covering up purported 
evidence of americans still held prisoner in indochina

a jury took less than two hours to convict 
a 26yearold woman of murder and kidnapping for helping her 
boyfriend abduct prominent businessman stephen small and bury him 
alive

scheduled for dec 6 
ms rish cried as the jurors filed from the crowded courtroom 
after delivering their verdict to kankakee circuit judge john 
michela the jury had deliberated for only one hour and 40 minutes 
after a nineday trial 
i am very disappointed that this jury didnt consider the case 
longer said defense attorney vincent paulauskis i think there 
was reasonable doubt 
paulauskis contended that ms rish had no idea what edwards was 
plotting and that edwards real accomplices have not been 
apprehended ficaro however said there is no evidence anyone else 
helped with the kidnapping 
in his closing arguments ficaro told jurors that rish was the 
actress and accomplished liar her boyfriend needed to lure 
small from his home so he could be abducted

of a former illinois governor was kidnapped sept 2 1987 and 
buried in the coffinlike box in a remote area between kankakee and 
the indiana border his body was unearthed two days later 
ficaro said it was ms rish who called small to get him out of 
his house while edwards waited in the garage to kidnap him she 
pretended to be a police officer reporting a burglary at a building 
small was restoring he said

federal narcotics officers were poised to make the 
biggest cocaine bust ever in dallas but it turned out the white 
powder they confiscated was for baking not snorting 
and the elderly man who attempted to pull off the drug deal wound 
up in custody and in the hospital instead of being in the money 
said phil jordan who is in charge of the drug enforcement 
administrations dallas office 
it turned out that the 100 kilograms of cocaine the man was 
attempting to sell to dea agents posing as drug dealers was 220 
pounds of flour and sugar jordan said 
we found out he wasnt selling the real thing and he found out 
we were the real thing said jordan said 
jordan said he expects that state charges will be filed against 
the man accusing him of attempting to sell substances misrepresented 
as drugs it is a felony under texas law to attempt to sell any 
substance represented to be illegal drugs 
jordan said the 71yearold man suffered an anxiety attack 
after learning the men were agents and not drug dealers and was 
hospitalized with chest pains he was listed in serious condition 
today at st paul medical center 
hes lucky he was dealing with law enforcement rather than a 
vicious criminal drug element jordan said the underworld 
doesnt take kindly to fraud 
if hed been dealing with the cubans the jamaicans or the 
colombians he wouldnt have lived to tell his story to the judge 
jordan said 
the deal began a month ago jordan said when a man approached an 
undercover dea agent and asked if the agent was interested in buying 
100 kilos of cocaine 
dea officials decided the man might be serious because one of his 
associates had recently been arrested with five kilos of cocaine 
jordan said 
the man was arrested after he produced the substance in an 
airport parking lot at love field a quick field test of the white 
substance revealed that it was sugar and flour 
the man had offered to sell the bogus drugs at 18000 per kilo 
making the entire buy worth 18 million he said 
it wasnt a total loss jordan said 
well we got the flour and sugar just in time for the 
holidays he said after we use it as evidence we plan to 
donate it to one of the area food banks

and won a 24 million settlement 
thirets parole from canon city penitentiary is mandatory under

a shipping company that was ordered 
closed after one of its ships sank in 1987 with thousands of people 
aboard and another went down during typhoon ruby was cleared of 
blame today in the 1987 tragedy 
a 69page coast guard report blamed the december 1987 disaster on 
the 630ton oil tanker vector which collided with the passenger 
ship dona paz off mindoro island more than 3000 people are 
believed to have died 
the dona paz was owned by sulpicio lines whose passenger 
operations were suspended by the government on wednesday after 
another of its vessels the dona marilyn sank oct 24 during 
typhoon ruby killing at least 76 people 
in the report pio garrido coast guard commandant said a board 
of inquiry found the vector at fault because it lacked qualified 
crew and equipment and had sailed without valid licenses 
the operation of the mt vector was not only risky but unlawful 
for want of the requisite licenses and certificates for her vessel 
and her officers the report said mt vector and her registered 
owners are adjudged solely at fault and responsible for the 
collision 
sulpicio vice president vicente gambito praised the coast guard 
report we welcome this opportunity to vindicate the idea that our 
ships are unsafe and there is something patently wrong with our 
ships he said 
on wednesday president corazon aquino ordered sulpicios 
passenger services suspended while the government inspects its crews 
and ships 
sulpicio which operates 22 passenger and cargo vessels accounts 
for 20 percent of domestic sea traffic among the countrys 7200 
islands 
but gambito said today that sulpicio had still not received the 
suspension order and was operating normally 
in its report the coast guard said the vector rammed the dona 
paz on the port side immediately knocking out the engine and 
generator oil from the tanker ignited and the two vessels 
disappeared in a huge fireball 
only 26 people survived all but two from the dona paz only two 
junior crewmen from the vector were rescued 
the coast guard said the vector had a steering defect and sailed 
without a certificate of inspection the ship had no radio operator 
and its radio license had expired nearly 18 months earlier the 
report said 
it also found that the ships master who was killed did not 
have the required chief mate license and that there was no lookout 
on duty on the vectors bridge when the collision occurred 
mrs aquinos order suspending sulpicio came nine days after the 
2855ton dona marilyn sank during typhoon ruby with about 500 
people aboard 
the two accidents prompted calls from the press and congress for 
tougher enforcement of maritime safety regulations and for 
investigations into the seaworthiness of the interisland fleet 
meanwhile the search for victims of the dona marilyn sinking 
continued today like the dona paz it has been difficult to 
determine the number of victims because of confusion over how many 
people were aboard 
the dona marilyn sailed oct 23 from manila after it sank 300 
miles southeast of manila 161 passengers and 39 crewmen were 
rescued gambito said at least 76 people were confirmed dead but 
only 54 bodies had been recovered

donald gene franklin whose appeal 
halted executions in the state for more than nine months was put to 
death early today for abducting and murdering a nurse 13 years ago 
franklin 37 made no final statement before a lethal injection 
was administered at the texas department of corrections wall unit 
franklin stared at the death chamber ceiling and coughed several 
times as drugs flowing through needles inserted into his arms took 
effect he was pronounced dead at 1230 am six minutes after 
doctors began administering the injection 
franklin was the second person executed this year in texas which 
leads the nation with 28 executions since the us supreme court 
restored capital punishment in 1976 he was the 102nd person 
executed in the united states since then 
franklin spent 12 years on death row and had three trials and 
at least five execution dates his own attorney once described him 
as therawford 
said today i feel really relieved i feel i can be at peace and 
peggy can be at peace 
at the time of the execution she said she was looking at a 
picture of her daughter 
its been a long hard day she said its been a very very 
long 13 years 
franklins hopes for a reprieve were blocked late wednesday when 
the us supreme court voted 72 to refuse him a stay 
the nations highest court had granted franklin a stay in october 
1987 to consider his challenge of texas capital punishment law his 
attorneys argued that the law does not say how much weight a jury 
should give to a defendants mitigating circumstances 
the challenge put a halt to executions in texas after jan 7 
when robert streetman 27 was put to death for murdering a woman in 
a 1 burglary 
in june the nations highest court voted 63 to reject 
franklins challenge 
franklin spent his final day in a small cell next to the death 
chamber and was visited by his parents 
in 1975 ms morans disappearance from a san antonio hospital 
prompted a highly publicized citywide search five days after her 
abduction she was found in a vacant lot nude bleeding from 
multiple stab wounds and barely alive she died later in a hospital 
franklin was on parole for a rape conviction when he was arrested 
about four hours after the abduction but consistently denied any 
involvement in ms morans disappearance 
he just told me he was framed for something he didnt do a 
fellow death row inmate johnny penry said wednesday 
witnesses provided the license plate number of a car speeding 
away from the hospital the car was franklins 
police also found the nurses belongings in his garbage can and 
blood found on his clothing matched ms morans 
this is a case i use as the classic circumstantial evidence 
case said bill harris a bexar county district attorney who 
handled franklins case we had overwhelming evidence its an 
appropriate case for the death penalty and hes an appropriate 
subject 
the worst part in my mind is that franklin is the most hated 
man in san antonio at least in recent history said allen cazier 
who defended franklin at his third trial

a month after 176 people died in 
antigovernment riots algerians voted today on political reforms 
that would shift power away from the single party that has ruled for 
26 years 
the referendum to modify 14 articles of the constitution was 
proposed in october after youths rioted in the streets of algiers 
and other cities to protest shortages of food and jobs lower living 
standards are blamed on the dropping price of oil algerias chief 
export 
first reported results were of absentee ballots cast by algerians 
living in southern france the algerian consulate in marseille said 
nearly 90 percent of those voting favored constitutional change 
it announced results of 41039 yes to 3532 no with 1126 people 
casting null ballots a form of abstention 
its the beginning of change 34yearold businessman joubi 
wacer said after voting at a school in bir mouradais neighborhood 
after this things will be different at least we hope so 
under clear blue skies several elderly veiled women walked to 
vote at the bir mouradais school men milled in the courtyard 
smoking and discussing political changes their country seems to be 
experiencing in remote southern parts nomads traveled long 
distances to cast their ballots 
president chadli bendjedid soothed the unrest by promising a 
greater role in decisionmaking to people outside the national 
liberation front as this north african countrys only legal party 
it has ruled since algerias independence from france in 1962 
todays voting appeared calm there were no indications of 
heightened security in algiers the capital where soldiers and 
police fired on demonstrators last month officials set the 
nationwide death toll from a weeks rioting at 176 but other 
reports say three times as many people died 
the justice ministry announced today that it released on 
wednesday all 3357 people still held after being arrested during 
the rioting that figure was much higher than the 1500 previously 
believed to remain in jail but there was no immediate explanation 
for the discrepancy 
algerian television showed film of dozens of young men emerging 
from el harrach prison near algiers into a crowd of families and 
supporters who patted them on the backs or shook their hands 
because most votecounting is computerized in algeria nearly 
complete results were expected before midnight 
state radio said an estimated 25 percent of those eligible voted 
within three hours of the polls opening 
more than 90 percent of algerias 12 million eligible voters have 
turned out in past elections 
bendjedids proposal to shift power out of the hands of the party 
is extraordinary a veritable revolution for algeria said kamel 
belkacem publisher of the proreform weekly newspaper algerie 
actualite 
provisions before voters would make subtle but important changes 
separating government from the party the constitution would say the 
president incarnates the unity of the nation replacing wording 
that he incarnates the unity of the party and the state 
another change would allow the president to shift unspecified 
powers to the premier who would in future answer to the peoples 
national assembly algerias parliament 
if independent candidates eventually are elected to parliament 
this would separate the daytoday working of the government from 
party control

men were missing officials said 
there doesnt appear to be very much hope for any survivors

the engineer were changing over to another generator in the engine 
room marrs said 
stephen m hobbs the first mate said an explosion knocked him 
down in the wheelhouse at the front of the vessel according to dan 
gregory a fire battalion chief

radiant heat forced him off the ship gregory said hobbs was in 
good condition 
the barge owned by motor vessel constructor co in homer had 
20000 gallons of gasoline and 36000 gallons of diesel fuel below 
decks marrs said

holding tanks at a crudeoil processing facility operated by 
marathon oil co the crew had pumped 1000 gallons of gasoline into 
the truck before the explosion marrs said 
missing were the captain the engineer and a fueltruck driver

newspapers today hailed the us 
prosecution of ferdinand and imelda marcos but some saw it as a 
warning that washington can turn on an ally if that serves american 
interests 
others said american indignation should have been aroused in 1972 
when marcos declared martial law jailed thousands of political 
opponents and allegedly began plundering of the philippine treasury 
the commentaries appeared after american tobacco heiress doris 
duke on wednesday put up 5 million for the former philippine first 
lady to secure bail on racketeering charges 
us district judge john keenan postponed marcos arraignment 
pending results of a medical examination the former philippine 
president claimes he is too ill to travel to new york from hawaii 
where he has lived since his ouster in a popularmilitary revolt in 
february 1986 
the marcoses will find that american justice cannot be trifled 
with as marcos trifled with justice columnist vicente albano 
pacis wrote in the philippine daily inquirer 
foreign secretary raul manglapus disclosed to reporters wednesday 
that the united states asked manila two months ago to waive immunity 
for marcos as a former head of state the government gave 
permission manglapus said 
malaya another daily noted the reagan administration strongly 
supported marcos until the final days of his 20year rule the 
indictment should serve as a warning to president corazon aquino it 
said 
they americans have the power over the fate of other 
governments like the marcoses and presumably that of mrs aquino 
the big brother who can discipline punish or destroy anybody who 
becomes a threat to them or their interests the paper said 
columnist ninez cachoolivares wrote in the newspaper 
businessworld that the boos and catcalls hurled at mrs marcos 
outside a federal court in new york were reminiscent of old 
barbaric days of the romans 
today the american media make fun of her she wrote but 
where were the indignant crowds in 1972 the american media as 
well as american officials were in the early days all praise for 
marcos and his wife imelda

iran today accused iraq of using humanitarian 
issues to delay withdrawing its troops from iranian territory and 
said all war prisoners could have been repatriated by next week if 
iraq had cooperated 
irans foreign minister ali akbar velayati was reacting to 
iraqi allegations that iran was delaying the exchange of prisoners 
of war 
iraq has offered to release its more than 30000 prisoners if 
iran would do the same the two sides have been at war since 
september 1980 
in refusing to accept an immediate exchange of prisoners iran 
said it already has agreed in principle to a un proposal that 
links the prisoner exchange to military disengagement 
velayati said that because of continued iraqi occupation of 
iranian territory hundreds of thousands of iranians continue to be 
homeless he spoke to reporters after meeting with the president of 
the international committee of the red cross cornelio sommaruga 
velayati renewed irans offer to release immediately all sick and 
wounded prisoners as well as civilian detainees on a reciprocal 
basis 
a un ceasefire resolution calls for the countries to withdraw 
forces to internationally recognized boundaries without delay 
dispute over the definition of their common border has been stalling 
peace talks which began aug 25 
iran claims that 400 square miles of iranian territory are still 
occupied by iraqi forces 
it is indeed regrettable that iraq has turned the humanitarian 
issue into a diplomatic tool to cover up and prolong its occupation 
of iranian territory velayati said in a prepared statement 
had iraq accepted the original timetable for implementation of 
resolution 598 all pows would have been released and repatriated by 
this coming tuesday he said 
iraq claims that iraqi territory of unspecified size is held by 
the iranians

leaders of the national religious party today 
ruled out a coalition with the leftleaning labor party and said 
they preferred joining a government headed by the rightwing likud 
bloc 
the move by the fiveseat party boosted likuds chances of 
forming a government without labor its main rival likud took a 
narrow victory in tuesdays parliamentary elections over labor 
which today appeared increasingly pessimistic over its chances of 
forming a government 
labor sources today said party officials are considering ousting 
shimon peres as its leader because of the partys poor showing 
labor and likud need the support of the religious parties 
kingmakers despite their small size to control a majority of seats 
in parliament the rightoriented orthodox parties advocate banning 
practices favored by israels secular majority 
prime minister yitzhak shamir the likud leader today opened 
coalition talks with two secular rightwing parties 
the tzomet crossroads and moledet homeland parties which 
each won two seats call for the annexation of the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip moledet also demands the ouster of the 15 
million palestinians living in the occupied lands a policy its 
refers to as transfer 
likud officials have said moledets expulsion platform could be 
an obstacle to it joining a likudled coalition 
the moledat leader former gen rehavam zeevi said after meeting 
with shamir and other likud leaders that he would not insist that 
transfer be adopted as government policy if the party joined the 
government 
there is a 999 percent chance for a likudled government 
zeevi told reporters 
peres the foreign minister met today with labors leftist 
allies mapam which won three seats the citizens rights movement 
which won five and shinui which won two 
likud and parties to the right won 46 seats while labor and 
parties to the left won 48 fewer than the 61 needed to form a 
government the orthodox religious parties won 18 seats an increase 
of four 
the orthodox community in israel has been growing steadily 
because of a high birthrate and immigration 
in contrast the number of secular israelis always a large 
majority has been dropping steadily because of a lower birthrate 
and emigration 
likud leaders said the orthodox parties had an affinity for the 
likud 
we all feel clearly that we should go into the government 
together cabinet minister moshe katzav of likuds negotiating 
team said after talks with religious leaders 
leaders of the national religious party said they ruled out 
joining a laborled coalition after disagreeing with labor on 
foreign policy issues wednesday the religious party supports 
annexing the territories and increasing jewish settlements and 
opposes labors plan to hold peace talks with arab states within an 
international conference 
it looks like talks with the labor have collapsed cabinet 
minister yosef shapiro of national religious party told israel 
radio adding that the party was much closer to likud 
i dont think theres a wide basis for continuing talks 
agreed rafi edri a member of labor negotiating team 
the orthodox are demanding a long list of religious legislation 
including an amendment to the who is a jew law stipulating that 
only orthodox rabbis may convert nonjews the small religious 
parties have often battled with the israelis secular majority 
during the states 40year history 
avraham shapira a legislator for agudat israel told israel 
television his party would ban movies and soccer games on the jewish 
sabbath from sundown friday to sundown saturday 
the issue of films and soccer games on the sabbath has been a 
source of great tension among religious and secular israelis 
provoking clashes outside movie houses last year 
during the election campaign labor pledged to oppose changing 
the who is a jew law because it would undermine the status of 
thousands of people in the united states and other countries who 
were converted to judaism by conservative or reform rabbis 
likud is not saying how far it is willing to go in embracing 
orthodox demands but it has in the past said it would support the 
amendment to the who is a jew law 
likud governed the last four years with the leftist labor party 
in an uneasy coalition but both sides indicate no such 
powersharing is now in the offing palestinian leaders have sharply 
condemned the election outcome 
more than 300 palestinians and 10 israelis have died in the 
nearly 11monthold uprising against israeli rule in the occupied 
lands

a firebomb thrown by a young man riding a 
bicycle today destroyed a controversial monument built by a 
germanamerican sculptor to recall nazi terror in the southern 
austrian city of graz police said 
local radio and newspaper reporters said the wooden monument put 
up in the city center three weeks ago for an exhibition has been 
defaced before 
graz was a nazi stronghold when austria was incorporated into 
adolf hitlers third reich in 1938 
the obelisk by germanamerican sculptor hans haacke was built 
around a pillar honoring the virgin mary 
the wooden obelisk covered with a cloth bearing the nazi eagle 
emblem recalled a pillar of victory put up by the nazis in 1938 
near the virgin mary pillar unlike the nazi monument haackes 
structure had at its foot a list of the number of jews gypsies 
prisoners and political opponents murdered by the nazis in styria 
province of which graz is the capital 
previous attacks on the monument prompted city authorities to 
guard the monument at night police said but the guard failed to 
stop the predawn firebomb attack a young cyclist was seen racing 
from the scene after he hurled the firebomb at the structure 
setting it afire 
police said the monument was destroyed and some damage spread to 
the pillar honoring the virgin mary 
peter vujica director of the styrian autumn arts festival 
for which the monument was built told austrian radio the attack was 
regrettable 
there is some kind of crisis of confidence in a town when a 
memorial becomes an object of shame vujica said but i hope 
graz will not get the label nazi city again it isnt

opponents of polands communist government immediately afterward 
she began her first meeting with the communist party chief gen 
wojciech jaruzelski 
earlier mrs thatcher met with polands prime minister but did 
not respond to his appeal for western aid to help polands economy 
an aide said 
mrs thatchers silence apparently reflected her cool response to 
general suggestions initiated by west germany last month that west 
european governments give unconditional aid 
the wreathlaying came during a hectic day of official talks and 
sightseeing mrs thatchers threeday visit is the first by a 
british prime minister to this soviet bloc country 
about 2000 people packed the graveside near the st stanislaw 
kostka roman catholic church the church is a stronghold of the 
banned solidarity trade union federation and the parish of the rev 
jerzy popieluszko he was slain in 1984 by four secret policemen who 
were later imprisoned 
their hands raised in a vforvictory sign the solidarity 
salute the crowd broke into a traditional hymn god watches over 
poland after mrs thatcher placed the wreath of roses lilies and 
irises on the tombstone 
she also spoke with popieluszkos parents marianne and wladyslaw 
we are extremely grateful that she found the time to come 
here said mrs popieluszko we know that deep in her heart she 
has been with our beloved son we know she supports people suffering 
in poland 
church stewards held solidarity banners a giant redandwhite 
banner hung from the church railings declared solidarity was and 
will be

autograph book at her and several women wept with emotion as 
hundreds in the market cried bravo and maggie maggie 
maggie 
earlier mrs thatcher met with prime minister mieczyslaw f 
rakowski a british official said rakowski complained that polands 
39 billion foreign debt is like a noose round our necks and 
appealed for western help 
the prime minister did not respond said the official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity the prime ministers also met 
wednesday 
the british view is that the international monetary fund to 
which poland has appealed and the paris club of leading western 
creditor nations should decide on debt rescheduling and other aid 
and make it strictly conditional on austerity package of economic 
reform 
before meeting rakowski mrs thatcher went to warsaws victory 
square and laid a wreath on the tomb of the unknown soldier a small 
crowd watched in icy temperatures in light snow 
she later watched an emotional film of the nazi invaders razing 
warsaw during world war ii in reprisal for a popular uprising 
on wednesday jarulzelski issued a veiled warning to the british 
leader not to interfere in polands tense politics 
i hope mrs thatcher will allow us to tackle our own problems 
in a sovereign way using our own methods and instruments he said 
in a british television interview 
it was the first official warning to the conservative party prime 
minister hailed by polish government leaders for her rigorous 
economic policies and by solidarity for her anticommunist views 
in the baltic port of gdansk where mrs thatcher planned to 
travel friday for a meeting with solidarity leader lech walesa 
nearly the entire 10000member workforce of the lenin shipyard 
rallied wednesday 
the workers vowed to fight the governments decision to close the 
yard where solidarity was born during a 1980 strike wave 
mrs thatcher will be the first western leader to make the trip 
to meet walesa at his headquarters in gdansk 
the government said monday it planned to close the lenin shipyard 
on dec 1 for economic reasons though walesa called the move an 
attempt to weaken solidarity the yard would be the first large 
enterprise shut down in a new goverment attempt to revive a limping 
economy

a pennsylvania couple who claim they lost 
their daughter in a hospital babyswap 10 years ago now say they 
wont necessarily seek custody of the florida girl they believe is 
theirs their lawyer says 
in an amended lawsuit filed wednesday in state court ernest and 
regina twigg of langhorne pa said they still want a judge to 
order a genetic test to determine the biological parents of 
9yearold kimberly mays of sarasota 
the suit omits a previous contention that the child lacks a 
stable home life the girl lives with her father robert w mays 
her mother is dead 
because of the amended lawsuit a hearing set for friday on the 
original request for a blood sample from the girl was postponed no 
new date was set 
the amended suit will streamline the proceedings according to 
john blakely and william post attorneys for the twiggs 
we did not make any allegations that we felt were unnecessary 
for the judge to decide whether or not to order the genetic test 
blakely said 
the original suit filed in october said the twiggs would seek 
custody of kimberly if she proved to be their biological daughter 
but blakely said wednesday that the twiggs want to find the girl 
first and then investigate her lifestyle before deciding on the 
basis of what they believe is the childs best interest whether to 
seek custody 
mays last month insisted he is kimberlys real father and will 
not give up the child under any circumstances 
the twiggs filed a 100 million federal lawsuit in september 
against hardee memorial hospital three doctors and a nurse 
alleging their healthy daughter was switched shortly after birth 
with a child with a heart defect 
the child raised by the twiggs named arlena died in august a 
genetic test conducted in the summer proved she was unrelated to 
either twigg

republican george bush branded as grossly 
unfair and untrue today suggestions that his campaign tactics were 
racially motivated and rejected attacks on running mate dan 
quayles civil rights record 
the vice president vowed during an interview on nbctvs 
today show to leave the tired baggage of bigotry behind 
bush heatedly denied that his relentless attacks on democratic 
rival michael dukakis over the massachusetts prison furlough program 
had racist overtones in citing the case of willie horton jr a 
convicted black murderer who escaped from a 1986 furlough and raped 
a white maryland woman 
there is no bigotry the gop nominee said in the live 
halfhour interview i oppose that furlough program 
but to go out as my opponent did and try to assign me 
something that is not in my heart this charge of racism is grossly 
unfair and untrue bush said 
bush did not directly challenge interviewer bryant gumbels 
statement that quayles civil rights record was terrible 
gumbel asked bush whether voters would be getting the bush who 
supported early civil rights legislation in congress or the one who 
selected quayle who has a terrible civil rights record 
youre going to get both bush said because i stand by my 
record on dan quayle and i dont like these attacks on his integrity 
or his civil rights or anything else 
bush called himself a man who was out front for civil rights 
and i will be again 
he added i dont have one ounce of bigotry in my body nor 
does my running mate 
the vice president said that even though a lot of civil rights 
leaders automatically endorse whoever the democratic candidate is i 
think most of them know in their hearts that i am a decent 
honorable person who cares about race relations and will leave the 
tired baggage of bigotry behind 
on the economy bush said spurring economic growth was his answer 
to reducing the federal budget deficit and fulfilling his promises 
to boost spending for some government programs without cutting 
defense outlays or raising taxes 
speaking two days after the government reported another sluggish 
performance by the econoy in september the vice president said his 
proposals would be made possible by future economic growth at a 28 
percent rate i hope it will grow at even more and if it does 
youve got tremendous revenues coming into the federal government 
he said 
later addressing a rally in downtown columbus before he flew to 
chicago the gop nominee said he was discounting the polls and 
political pundits who are telling us what we think he said 
its the people who will decide the outcome of next tuesdays 
balloting 
as national polls showed him holding onto a doubledigit lead 
over the massachusetts governor a hoarsevoiced and buoyant bush 
insisted wednesday that he was campaigning allout until the 
election 
ys things look pretty good nationwide but im going to 
outhustle that liberal governor he told a high school rally in 
lansing 
the rest of his schedule today called for rallies in illinois 
ohio and new jersey all significant electoralvote states where the 
race is close 
press secretary sheila tate said the campaign was keeping its 
strategy options open but for the most part bush will hold a series 
of rallies in battleground states and will stress some of the 
themes that he outlined in a wideranging speech tuesday at notre 
dame university 
on friday the campaign will begin airing two new commercials 
nationwide both positive spots rather than attack ads with bush 
talking about the reasons hes running for president said 
campaign manager lee atwater 
on wednesday bush stumped in illinois and michigan at three 
raucus rallies two of them at high schools illinois has 24 
electoral votes michigan 20 
bush stole dukakis on your side slogan when he talked about 
differences between himself and the democrat 
at the rally at lansing catholic central high school bush told 
the students to tell their parents george bush is on your side of 
the great divide 
bush said the differences between him and dukakis are as deep 
and wide as the great divide another term for the mountain 
watershed known as the continental divide 
and i represent the mainstream the mainstream views the 
mainstream values and they are your values and my values and the 
values and values of the vast majority of the american people 
bush told a rally in grand rapids mich where he was introduced by 
former president gerald ford

frank naylor will resign as chairman of the 
farm credit administration effective nov 10 an agency spokesman 
said today 
the 49yearold naylor plans to announce at a luncheon friday his 
departure from the regulatory agency to join a newly formed 
washington consulting company agricredit inc spokesman bill 
hendrix said 
naylor was named to head the farm credit administration in may 
1986 when the farm credit system was in the throes of fearsome 
financial crisis that saw 48 billion in loans turn sour in just 
one year 
the money crisis that swept over rural america in the 1980s has 
frequently been pinpointed as the culprit along with slack 
management that locked the system into high overhead and capital 
costs 
since then the network has returned to the black and regained a 
measure of stability in part because of legislation that opened the 
door to an overhaul of the system and provided it with a 4 billion 
line of credit with the federal treasury 
but the system of 24 major banks and more than 1000 local 
lending institutions a bulwark of us agriculture since its 
founding in 1912 has shrunk from a loan portfolio of 80 billion to 
one of 50 billion the 2 billion federal land bank in jackson 
miss closed because of insolvency 
naylor has been an official in four republican administrations 
during the carter administration he held a position at the 
sacramento calif federal land bank 
he was appointed by president reagan as head of the farm credit 
administrations threemember board after a stint as undersecretary 
of agriculture for small community and rural development a post 
that placed him in charge of the farmers home administration 
he represented the reagan administration when congress drew up 
1985 legislation that tightened federal regulation of the farm 
credit system and transformed the farm credit administration from a 
sort of unofficial lobbying agency for the system into an 
armslength regulator 
more extensive legislation approved in 1987 has spawned a 
socalled farmer mac secondary market in farm real estate loans 
under which banks and insurance companies are able to sell debt to 
investors 
hendrix said us agricredit would provide training consulting 
and other services to commercial bankers interested in entering the 
secondary market

avtex fibers inc today began closing its 
plant today as the government worked to avert the shutdown of the 
sole supplier of rayon yarn used in space shuttle rocket nozzles 
morton thiokol inc the maker of space shuttle motors said 
avtex had produced enough of the yarn for the next 10 shuttle 
launches 
employees are being released from their jobs as their jobs are 
completed avtex spokesman nick nichols said from washington 
people will be working for the next couple of days to shut it down 
and secure it 
production for all intents and purposes is stopping today by 
midnight tonight production will cease he said 
morton thiokol was talking today with avtex as were nasa the 
pentagon and other contractors in hopes of finding a way for 
production to continue uninterrupted no details were available on 
the talks today 
avtex based in valley forge pa announced this week it was 
closing its plant here today idling 1300 workers it said it 
suffered big losses because of the challenger disaster which 
grounded shuttle flights for 2 years 
on wednesday morton thiokol said it had determined enough of the 
fiber was already made for shuttle launches through december 1989 
we have enough material on hand or on order for 11 flights out 
of our current contract of 13 said rocky raab a morton thiokol 
spokesman in ogden utah but the number will be 10 now since 
weve flown discovery 
but the spokesman could not say how much of the fiber was 
available for numerous military rockets the compnay produces 
including the small icbm the mx missile and the harm and standard 
tactical missiles 
practically every project we have uses it in the nozzle raab 
said its safe to say billions of dollars of projects 
once avtex makes the fiber it is processed by three further 
layers of contractors who weave it and treat it to make it 
heatresistant before rocket makers assemble it into nozzles 
avtex chairman john gregg did not immediately return telephone 
queries about the progress of his companys talks with the 
government 
i really dont know what the discussions are leading to said 
dave drachlis a spokesman at nasas marshall space flight center in 
huntsville ala i know the government and avtex are discussing 
options and looking at what could be done 
neither contractors nor the government could say how long it 
would take to certify another manufacturer for the fiber if that 
were necessary 
avtex spokesman john kelly in new york said the company could 
continue production only at the front royal plant avtexs other 
plant in lewistown pa lacks the equipment and the machinery in 
front royal cannot be moved he said 
cheap imports and environmental problems had taken their toll for 
years on avtex front royals dominant employer 
on wednesday avtex was hit by a 1968 million lawsuit in which 
virginia attorney general mary sue terry alleged the plant violated 
state water discharge levels 1968 times over the past eight years

democratic nominee michael dukakis 
declaring he is sprinting for the finish line in the 
presidential election proposed today a federal state and local 
alliance to combat drug use in the nations schools 
at a town meeting at pennsbury high school in bucks county 
dukakis said his proposed alliance will set for its goal drugfree 
schools in the 1990s in every community in the united states 
earlier in an interview on the cbs this morning television 
show the massachusetts governor insisted that up to 30 percent of 
the voters remain undecided with only five days remaining until 
election day 
in an effort to overtake republican presidential rival george 
bush dukakis has focused heavily on combating drugs 
he lambasted bush on wednesday for saying he would not 
automatically cut off foreign aid to nations that fail to cooperate 
with us efforts to stem the flow of illegal drugs 
dukakis shifted the focus today to the need for comprehensive 
measures to discourage drug use especially among young people 
he outlined a program that would include drug education starting 
in kindergarten and creation of community advisory councils to 
coordinate local efforts 
the democratic nominee said he would advocate making such 
councils permanent not just something to do this year they 
would include educators parents children and leaders of business 
sports and the media 
he also called for special grants targeting highrisk kids and 
highrisk communities 
a fact sheet distributed by dukakis aides said the program would 
have a federal commitment of 400 million 
in his tv interview earlier today dukakis claimed that we are 
either tied or moving ahead in the major states essential to his 
hopes of scoring an upset victory over bush 
that assessment is contradicted by many public opinion polls 
which suggest that dukakis still has a lot of ground to make up 
on his 55th birthday the massachusetts governor was hammering 
away at bush on the issue of drugs which he said marked a clear 
difference between him and bush 
as for the tougher tone of his rhetoric dukakis said he had been 
a little too restrained perhaps earlier in the campaign 
voters are taking a very strong second look at me he said 
dukakis often has compared the presidential campaign to a 
marathon race this one is going to go down to the wire he said 
today were sprinting for the finish line and we hope and 
expect that were going to win 
at rallies wednesday in chicago and philadelphia dukakis quoted 
bush as saying he wouldnt strip us foreign aid from countries 
that refused to cooperate in efforts to stem the flow of drugs 
ill be damned if ill let those countries send their poison 
into the united states of america he said using unusually strong 
language 
ill say to foreign leaders if youre prepared to work with 
us well work with you he went on to the cheers of partisan 
crowds but if youre against us dont expect a dime from american 
foreign aid 
bush spokesman mark goodin responding to dukakis comments said 
the democratic nominee has distorted the gop nominees position on 
the issue 
the vice president would never hesitate to use aid as a lever 
on the war on drugs goodin said 
dukakis also returned to two of his favorite themes the link 
between bush and panamanian ruler manuel antonio noriega and bushs 
plan to put his vice president indiana sen dan quayle in charge 
of the war on drugs 
the democratic candidate said he would tell foreign leaders if 
you think you can do to mike dukakis what noriega did to george 
bush if you think were going to risk our childrens lives by 
putting somebody like dan quayle in charge of the war against drugs 
then youre in for a big surprise on january 20 1989 
after a rally in pittsburgh dukakis told reporters that bush 
was offering people a lot of talk and very little action 
i dont think mr bush is serious about the war against 
drugs he said 
at nearly every stop for two days crowds sang happy birthday 
to the candidate who turned 55 today 
his wife kitty had planned to be with him for his birthday but 
she was hospitalized in minneapolis recovering from a respiratory 
infection aides said she hoped to join him on friday in chicago 
with time running out for his campaign dukakis was dogged by 
national polls released earlier this week showing him trailing bush 
by up to 13 points 
dukakis told crowds to ignore the polls and encouraged them by 
saying that this is one election where millions of people are 
going to be looking and thinking and listening and theyre not going 
to be making up their mind until very close to the moment when they 
go into that polling booth

michael dukakis contending hes catching up in major states 
said today hes ready for a dash to the finish line as voters take 
a very strong second look at me frontrunner george bush 
defended his campaign against suggestions of racism 
five days from the election the democratic governor of 
massachusetts and the republican vice president took advantage of 
invitations to appear on morning network television programs to 
press their cases 
on nbcs today bush was asked about democratic suggestions 
that his campaign had a racist tinge in that his speeches and 
commercials have emphasized the case of a black massachusetts 
convict who escaped while on furlough and attacked a maryland couple 
there is no bigotry bush said i oppose that furlough 
program but to go out as my opponent did and try to assign 
me something that is not in my heart this charge of racism is 
grossly unfair and untrue 
i dont have one ounce of bigotry in my body nor does my 
running mate he said even though a lot of civil rights leaders 
automatically endorse whoever the democraitc candidate is i think 
most of them know in their hearts that i am a decent honorable 
person who cares about race relations and will leave the tired 
baggage of bigotry behind 
dukakis in an interview on cbs this morning shrugged off 
national polls showing him well behind saying that we are either 
tied or moving ahead in major states he needs to score an upset 
victory 
he said 20 percent to 30 percent of voters have not finally 
decided for whom to vote and he contended that as decision time 
nears they are taking a very strong second look at me 
dukakis celebrating his 55th birthday today said this one is 
going to go down to the wire were sprinting for the finish 
line and we hope and expect that were going to win 
later in fairless hills pa dukakis outlined a proposal for a 
federal state and local alliance to combat drug use in the nations 
schools 
at a town meeting in pennsbury high school he said his 
presidents alliance against drugs will set for its goal drugfree 
schools in the 1990s in every community in the united states 
he called for community advisory councils to coordinate local 
efforts including educators parents children business sports 
and media leaders with special grants targeting highrisk kids 
and highrisk communities 
with the race for the white house down to less than a week the 
campaigns were bringing out their final tv ads including one in 
which president reagan asks viewers to vote republican up and down 
the ticket to continue the change we began in 1981 
the democrats contend in a new ad that they are the party of 
average working people while under the republicans millions of us 
jobs were shipped to workers overseas 
dukakis in chicago on wednesday assailed the republicans 
recent claim on harry trumans memory have they no shame he 
asked 
with democrat dukakis taking full advantage of national 
television interview invitations bush tossed another barb loaded 
with the l word or liberal label 
it seemed like he appeared on every television show except 
wheel of fortune bush joked you see he was afraid that 
vanna might turn over the l word vanna white is hostess on the 
popular game show 
still dukakis television apperances prompted bush to accept 
several of his own including 30 minutes live on nbcs today 
show today 
the campaign grew more heated for the vice presidential 
candidates democrat lloyd bentsen blasted bush for selecting dan 
quayle as his running mate the choice bentsen said in illinois 
showed a real disdain disregard for our country 
quayle found himself caught up anew in a controversy over 
abortion 
while he ardently opposes abortion even in cases of rape quayle 
told questioners he had no quarrel with a medical procedure known as 
dilation and curettage or dandc and said it would prevent 
conception if performed soon after rape 
the medical procedure is considered by many in the field of 
gynecology as a means of terminating a pregnancy 
questions about abortion have hounded quayle in recent days 
particularly following his suggestion to a 12yearold girl that she 
should go ahead and give birth in a theoretical situation in which 
she was raped by her father and became pregnant 
dukakis with fatigue from his frenetic pace showing in his 
voice campaigned with jesse jackson in philadelphia late wednesday 
night where the former democratic candidate received a rousing 
reception 
dukakis introduced by jackson sparked the crowd at martin 
luther king high school when he stressed his antiapartheid theme 
nelson mandela is still in jail and manuel noriega is still 
running panama its time that changed dukakis said 
he earlier unleashed some of his harshest rhetoric yet blasting 
bush for antidrug efforts and saying a day before that he would not 
necessarily halt aid to nations that refuse to cooperate with us 
antidrug effort 
if youre against us dont expect a dime of american foreign 
aid dukakis said 
ill work with other countries but ill be damned if i will 
allow those countries to send their poison into the united states of 
america dukakis said maybe bush thinks there are other 
things more important than the future of our children i say you 
have to draw the line somewhere 
bush spokesman mark goodin responding to dukakis comments said 
the democratic nominee has distorted the gop nominees position on 
the issue 
the vice president would never hesitate to use aid as a lever 
on the war on drugs goodin said

a police recruit who collapsed from heat stroke and 
dehydration sept 19 on the first day of boot camplike training at 
an academy in agawam has died officials said today 
timothy m shepard 25 of pittsfield died late wednesday said 
susan ruth a spokeswoman for presbyterianuniversity hospital in 
pittsburgh at the familys request the hospital withheld word of 
his death until today 
the cause of death awaited a coroners report ms ruth said 
shepard was the sickest of the 16 cadets in a class of 50 who 
were hospitalized with exhaustion and dehydration following a 
grueling regimen of pushups confusion drills and punishment laps 
under the direction of state police drill instructors ten other 
cadets also suffered kidney ailments 
attorney general james shannon today called for an inquest into 
shepards death saying the family is entitled to a full explanation 
of his death 
the pittsfield police department recruit had lapsed back into a 
coma and underwent surgery for a blood clot on the brain monday 
five weeks after undergoing a liver transplant 
the family is obviously devastated he came so close to making 
it said michael d hashim the lawyer for the shepard family 
hashim called for the indictment of two state police officers at 
the academy saying the death was a clearcut case of involuntary 
manslaughter last month shannon investigated the program and 
declined to bring charges 
the director of the state criminal justice training council 
resigned wednesday and his replacement immediately abolished the 
grueling training 
we can never allow what happened at agawam to happen again 
said peter w agnes jr who was appointed interim director upon the 
resignation of gary f egan 
the programs modified stress training combines constant 
exercise and unexpected situations during training and was partially 
blamed for the dehydration suffered by cadets that led to the 
illnesses 
shannon investigated after cadets reported they were pushed to 
the limits of their endurance with hours of laps pushups and other 
exercises the first day of class on just a few small cups of water 
he found the training was a massive failure that was to blame 
for the kidney ailments suffered by 26 cadets 
shannon said he would not prosecute but that the chief of the 
agency responsible for the training should resign or be dismissed 
shepard was hospitalized in critical condition after collapsing 
on a running track and underwent a liver transplant a week later 
he gradually emerged from the coma and his condition was upgraded 
to serious last week but he still was unable to breathe on his own 
or speak 
just two days before his relapse shepard wrote a note to his 
pregnant wife holly i made it the couple married in june 
friends remembered the young man who had dreamed of being a 
police officer as having a way with youngsters he was just so 
nice i couldnt see him arresting people said james mooney 
executive director of the pittsfield boys club 
his wife recalled how shepard had run in a park near their home 
borrowed law books from friends in the police department and 
practiced shooting so he could be ready for the training 
he wanted to be tops at the academy she said he wanted to 
graduate no 1 in his class

late last week volunteers for democrat anna 
eshoo finished doortodoor delivery of 110000 copies of a video 
she produced as part of her 800000 campaign for a house seat from 
californias silicon valley 
at around the same time and nearly a continent away 79yearold 
rep william h natcher found a parking spot without a meter for his 
car in franklin ky clambered out and began the kind of 
campaigning he knows best visiting the communitys shops and 
talking to people on the street 
natcher a democrat and 35year veteran of the house as usual 
expects to spend about 5000 in this years reelection bid all of 
it his own money and hes expected to defeat republican martin 
tori a 48yearold businessman who plans to spend 100000 
that kind of a race is a rarity among house campaigns and while 
eshoos is the other extreme its closer to the norm in congress 
these days 
the san mateo county supervisor plans to pour 800000 into her 
campaign against republican thomas campbell a stanford university 
law professor who will invest 11 million in the race making this 
one of the most expensive of the 435 house contests campbell 
defeated rep ernest konnyu in the republican primary the only 
incumbent to lose such a contest this year 
the amounts are outrageous but our viability is tested out by 
how much money you raise says the 45yearold eshoo this is 
not the way it should be but its one of those unfortunate facts of 
life 
indeed while the cost of living tripled between 1974 and 1986 
the average cost of a house campaign increased nearly fivefold 
from 53384 to 260032 
incumbents who have a much easier time attracting contributions 
outspent their challengers by an average of 334223 to 124739 two 
years ago while each candidate for an open seat shelled out an 
average of 436847 
everyone expects the amount to increase once again this year and 
with it the money solicited from special interest groups and 
individuals 
herbert alexander a political science professor at the 
university of southern california who specializes in campaign 
financing says the mushrooming costs are caused by the 
professionalization of politics a growing use of expensive 
technologies like computers and direct mailings and of lawyers 
pollsters and other professionals 
alexander says the will to spend these amounts of money comes 
from candidates who increasingly see politics as lifelong careers 
wellstocked treasuries increasingly translate into reelection 
very little movement is expected in the 255177 
democraticrepublican split in the house three seats are vacant 
their ambitions are to stay in the house for 20 years or to 
move up to the senate or a governorship he said they want job 
security 
in the eshoocampbell 12th district race the financial stakes 
have skyrocketed despite both candidates decisions not to use 
television advertising an expensive proposition in the san 
francisco bay area 
eshoos video cost her 134000 and shes spending most of the 
rest of her money on direct mail a widely used technique in 
california telephones computers and a staff of 23 paid workers 
campbell is relying heavily on direct mail radio advertising 
computers and telephones and has a smaller paid staff of 15 
this is a very expensive district to get a candidate 
wellknown says ronald smith a consultant to campbell he 
started out with zero name recognition 
other candidates have used videos before but eshoos aides say 
no campaign tapes have ever been as widely distributed they say 
with 80 percent of the districts residents owning vcrs the 
novelty of the idea is likely to entice many voters to watch the 
cassette which features the candidate talking and is called anna 
eshoo challenges the sacred cows 
campbell workers say their polls show that eshoo has received 
little help from the tapes it was a cute gimmick but for that 
money she could have bought some nice television sniffs smith 
the most expensive campaign in the country is being waged 200 
miles to the south where seventerm gop rep robert lagomarsino 
62 is facing a spirited challenge from democratic state sen gary 
k hart 48 in the states 19th district each candidate was 
wellknown when the race began and each plans to spend about 12 
million in a campaign that is relying heavily on television 
advertising and direct mail 
other expensive house races according to campaign finance 
documents are in 
the new york 20th district where twoterm gop rep joseph 
dioguardi plans to spend about 1 million against former new york 
assistant secretary of state nita lowey who has raised 747000 
the nebraska 2nd an open seat where republican jerry schenken 
a pathologist has spent 821000 and democratic former state sen 
peter hoagland has spent 600000 
the indiana 3rd where gop rep john hiler has raised 689000 
and democratic lawyer tom ward has garnered 403000 
no race this year is expected to eclipse the total 3 million 
that rep matthew rinaldo rnj and democratic challenger adam 
levin spent in 1982 but natcher says that from the lectures he 
gives entering house freshmen every two years theres little doubt 
that campaign expenditures will keep rising 
this last time when i told them they should leave the money 
alone i could tell by the expressions on their faces that they 
didnt agree with me he said

top labor party officials are considering 
ousting shimon peres as party leader because of labors poor showing 
in parliamentary elections party sources and published reports said 
today 
five israeli newspapers and israel radio said as many as five 
ranking leaders in the leftleaning party have discussed a party 
shakeup in private consultations 
a party official who spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed 
the reports and said peres was under fire primarily for spearheading 
a campaign which focused too closely on his own personality and the 
need for an international peace conference 
shlomo avineri a political scientist and labor activist also 
confirmed the criticism of peres if the party doesnt head israels 
next government there is going to be a groundswell in labor to 
get rid of peres avineri said in a telephone interview 
an aide to a labor minister who demanded anonymity said there 
are voices in the party that believe the time has come for peres to 
go 
but peres aide yossi beilin who is also a newly elected 
legislator denied that peres leadership is threatened 
certainly there is disappointment after the elections and some 
soulsearching beilin told israel television i dont think 
there is any challenge to peres leadership we have no other 
leader 
peres has led the party through four elections losing three 
times and managing a tie in the 1984 parliament balloting some 
party members believe he has acquired a losers image as a result 
election results gave prime minister yitzhak shamir of the 
rightwing likud bloc which outscored labor 39 seats to 38 a clear 
advantage in getting a majority of 61 seats in israels 120seat 
knesset or parliament 
likud and parties to the right won 46 seats while labor and 
parties to the left won 48 the orthodox religious parties won 18 
seats and have indicated a greater willingness to join a likud 
government than one formed by labor 
fueling the antiperes atmosphere was a report in the independent 
hadashot daily that shamir would consider forming a joint government 
with labor only if peres and his deputy cabinet minister ezer 
weizman are replaced 
however another labor official said arranging a reshuffle and 
overcoming peres expected resistance would take too long and not be 
concluded before likud built a coalition on its own 
news reports have suggested defense minister yitzhak rabin could 
replace peres rabin who served as prime minister from 197477 is 
more popular among rightwing israelis because of his tough policies 
in suppressing the 11monthold palestinian uprising in the occupied 
territories

lloyd bentsen was hoping to round up 
support for michael dukakis and himself during a bus tour of east 
texas where democrats abound but tend to be conservative 
bentsen knws the ticket is behind in the polls and struggling to 
deliver his home state and its 29 electoral votes he needs to bring 
in east texas by a wide enough margin to offset republican strength 
to the west in dallas and the texas panhandle 
east texas is right at the core of any democratic strategy you 
have said joe oneill bentsens chief of staff bentsen and 
dukakis have both already visited the area and the democrats 
contend theyve been making progress 
the trip today includes stops in longview mt pleasant paris 
and sulphur springs to help get out the crowds the senator planned 
to have at his side movie actor rob lowe and country music singer 
gary morris an east texas native 
were doing the maximum saturation of east texas we can do in a 
day he said 
traditionally democratic the area is full of voters known as 
yellow dogs because of the saying that theyd vote for a dog if 
it were a democrat 
but the area is also conservative especially among the younger 
white voters and recently pundits have been referrng to that group 
as the bubba vote 
the rural 1st congressional district which makes up the heart of 
the area gave ronald reagan 61 percent of the vote in 1984 
democrats are confident dukakis will do better but the campaign has 
been hurt there by republican advertising that paints the 
massachusetts governor as soft on crime and defense and in favor of 
taking peoples guns away 
bentsen has been fighting those claims every day calling them 
distortions and lies 
i wouldnt be on the ticket with a fella whod take my shotgun 
away he said reminding crowds that hes a quail hunter a pun 
aimed at george bushs running mate dan quayle 
bentsen has been stepping up his attacks on quayle again lately 
campaigning in illinois ohio and west virginia on wednesday bush 
blasted at quayle at every stop

federal prosecutors today threatened to seek 
contempt of court charges against ferdinand and imelda marcos for 
failing to provide fingerprints palm prints and handwriting and 
voice samples 
a hearing was scheduled today before us district judge john 
walker who could order the former philippine president and first 
lady jailed 
walker previously had ordered the couple to comply with the 
requests contained in subpoenas issued earlier this year by the 
grand jury that indicted them on charges of looting the philippine 
treasury of more than 100 million 
a federal appeals court late last month upheld walkers decision 
that the marcoses no longer have headofstate immunity and must 
honor the subpoenas 
on wednesday tobacco heiress doris duke said she put up mrs 
marcos 5 million bail on the racketeering charges because she is 
disgusted embarrassed and ashamed with the way the us 
government has treated the marcoses 
virtually all of the couples assets are frozen or otherwise tied 
up in litigation 
i have always believed that an accused person is innocent until 
proved guilty i wish the rest of america agreed with me miss 
duke 75 said in written response to questions submitted by the 
daily news 
miss duke once called the richest girl in the world said 
she would gladly testify as a character witness for the marcoses 
whom she said she considers her dear friends 
i am disgusted embarrassed and ashamed of my countrys 
mistreatment of imelda and her ailing husband ferdinand miss 
duke wrote why should america spend millions and millions of 
dollars prosecuting two people who for a generation have been our 
closest allies including our pacific outpost against communism 
a lawyer for miss duke donald robinson said wednesday the 
wealthy recluse posted the bond because she knows that mrs marcos 
didnt commit any crimes 
miss duke who has a 2700acre estate in new jersey pledged 
more than 5 million in municipal bonds on behalf of mrs marcos a 
lawyer for mrs marcos said she planned to visit with miss duke 
through the weekend even though she would be free to return to 
hawaii as soon as the bail paperwork was completed 
us district judge john f keenan loosened travel restrictions 
for mrs marcos previously confined to the new york area 
allowing her to travel between new york city and newport ri 
where miss duke has a mansion 
once the bail documents are signed mrs marcos will be allowed 
to travel anywhere in the united states her husband however 
cannot leave the island of oahu without permission of the justice 
department under a prior restriction 
lawyers said miss dukes bonds would be worth between 53 
million and 54 million depending on market fluctuations the exact 
types of bonds were not revealed 
it was miss dukes idea to help robinson said after 
wednesdays hearing conducted by keenan 
mrs marcos 59 who has been staying in an 1800aday suite at 
the waldorf towers did not attend the hearing 
like president reagan miss duke regrets the indictment the 
lawyer said referring to the presidents comment after the 
marcoses racketeering indictment was announced last month 
mrs marcos is extremely grateful and was tearful when she 
learned of the offer robinson added 
mrs marcos flew to new york from the couples homeinexile in 
hawaii aboard miss dukes lavishly appointed private jet 
prosecutors said the bail documents would have to be signed by 
miss duke mrs marcos and a clerk of the court as well as keenan 
mrs marcos attorney john j tigue said his client plans to 
visit with miss duke this weekend in new jersey and perhaps in 
newport she then will return to her ailing husband 
marcos 71 remained in hawaii where the couple have lived since 
their ouster in a popular uprising in 1986 defense attorneys argued 
last week that he was too frail to make the 10hour flight keenan 
postponed marcos arraignment pending an examination by a government 
physician 
assistant us attorney charles labella said the examination was 
completed monday but the physicians report is not ready 
in a statement issued wednesday through an aide marcos blasted 
the way the press has covered the case the media he said have 
declared president ferdinand marcos guilty of several charges 
filed against him whatever happened to the timehonored legal maxim 
that anyone is presumed innocent unless proven otherwise 
the marcoses are charged with racketeering accused of plundering 
103 million from the philippine treasury funneling it to foreign 
bank accounts and using it to buy prime new york city real estate 
and art 
their eight codefendants including saudi arabian financier 
adnan khashoggi remained at large outside the country said 
labella

raw or undercooked fish such as sushi can cause a 
serious intestinal illness often mistaken for appendicitis doctors 
warned today 
the disease anisakiasis is caused by eating fish infested with 
larvae of worms known as anisakid nematodes cooking kills the worms 
the doctors said about 50 cases of aniskaiasis have been reported 
in the united states but this may be the tip of the iceberg 
drs james h mckerrow and judy sakanari of the university of 
california san francisco and thomas l deardorff of the us food 
and drug administration described the infection in a letter in 
todays new england journal of medicine 
the doctors said the emergence of the disease was partly due to 
the popularity of sushi and sashimi and lightly cooked fish salmon 
and pacific snapper are most commonly implicated in the disease 
another factor they said is the increasing number of seals sea 
lions and other marine mammals that harbor the parasites in their 
stomachs the animals expel worm eggs in their feces which are then 
eaten by other sea creatures including fish 
people who eat wormy fish sometimes cough up live worms or feel 
the worm in their throats a condition known as tingling throat 
syndrome 
in more serious cases the worms burrow into the wall of the 
stomach or the intestines they are removed by a tube that is pushed 
into the digestive system

the white house today defended president 
reagans veto of a wilderness bill against democratic charges that 
the action was politically motiviated 
in all these kinds of environmental questions tradeoffs have 
to be considered and this was a case where the administration felt 
that for a variety of economic and environmental reasons it was 
best not to designate this area as wilderness presidential 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
the department of agriculture had recommended a veto from the 
beginning so there wasntf where we stood on it 
the spokesman said 
the bill would have designated 143 million acres of forest 
service land in much question o montan as protected wilderness the forest 
service 
is an agency of the agriculture department 
this bill was vetoed for petty politics and thats all sen 
max baucus dmont said wednesday night shortly after the white 
house announced reagans pocket vetoes of the wilderness bill and a 
second measure establishing a corporation to provide development 
capital to indian businesses 
this is an affront to the people of montana baucus said in a 
statemes is likely to find it difficult to fulfill campaign 
pledges 
despite a relative success in agriculture venezuelas economy 
has been hardhit by persistently low prices of oil the nations 
major source of export revenue oil has plunged from a high of 30 a 
barrel in the 1970s to its current level of around 13 
current prices on world markets continue to slump a sharp 
contrast to the market boom during perez first term when he 
nationalized the oil industry the slide in oil prices this year 
alone may cost the nation as much as 3 billion in revenue nearly a 
third of the 107 billion originally expected 
coupled with a foreign debt of 35 billion latin americas 
fourth largest after brazil mexico and argentina a continuation of 
this trend may pose a heavy political and social burden to the 
government to be installed in february 
according to official statistics real income for the average 
venezuelan family has shrunk by 20 percent since 1982 when oil 
prices began to fall 
while less than 15 percent of the population enjoys 35 percent 
of the nations income 40 percent do not earn enough to cover their 
basic nutritional needs according to a venezuelan central 
university report 
perez and fernandez agree that drastic changes must be 
implemented to reverse this trend but while perez proposes to 
expand public sector expenditures as a means to boost the economy 
fernandez says he would rely more on the private sector 
rather than emphasizing their differences both perez and 
fenandez have devoted most of their efforts trying to discredit each 
other 
intense hostility kicked off the early part of the campaign when 
both candidates accused each other of receiving campaign money from 
drug traffickers 
the exchange of accusations ceased only when the supreme 
electoral council which supervises the campaign called on perez 
and fernandez to avoid injurious attacks 
ad and copei have traditionally alternated in power with ad 
winning over copei four out of six times in the 30 years of civilian 
rule 
both parties together totalled 90 percent of the vote in the 1983 
elections won by the ads jaime lusinchi now the incumbent 
president 
twentyone other candidates also are in the running covering a 
wide range of the political and social spectrum 
one is a witch doctor romulo abreu duarte who professes a 
fervent belief in the legendary goddess maria lionza descended her 
devotees say from a spanish conquistador and an indian princess 
others include the former procastro guerrilla leader teodoro 
petkoff of the leftist movement toward socialism and ismenia 
villalba of the centrist democratic revolutionary union 
aware of the overwhelming strength of ad and copei the minor 
parties are aiming instead to win some of the 229 congressional 
seats at stake 
both villalba the first woman to ever run for president in 
venezuela and petkoff expect to improve their parties 
congressional strength now respectively 11 and 9 seats 
the tiny venezuelan communist party is running in a coalition led 
by edmundo chirinos former rector of venezuelan central university 
ad and copei stand to lose considerable legislative power if the 
minor parties make gains in the congressional balloting analysts 
say

communist party general secretary zhao ziyang told 
foreign businessmen that chinas economic reforms erred in giving 
too much power to local governments rather than to local 
enterprises sources said thursday 
zhao also said in a meeting wednesday with 80 participants in an 
international business forum that there will be a slowdown in new 
contracts with foreign companies as china imposes austerity measures 
to cool off its overheated economy 
the sources who attended the meeting said zhao emphasized the 
tightening of economic controls to last at least two years will 
have no effect on chinas longterm commitment to reform 
zhao chinas foremost advocate of rapid reform said the process 
of decentralizing controls over the economy had gone offcourse in 
giving power to local governments rather than local enterprises 
he was very tough on local governments the sources speaking 
on condition of anonymity said he said china wanted to correct 
the situation 
a key to chinas retrenchment program is beijings attempt to 
regain controls over loans project approvals and foreign trade that 
it has ceded to local authorities in the past decade as it switched 
from central planning to a marketdetermined economy 
provincial and municipal governments have ignored beijings 
orders to cut spending and lending and that has led to an excess of 
new construction projects severe raw material shortages 
unsustainable industrial growth and an inflation rate of more than 
20 percent 
zhao also emphasized the contracts of foreign businessmen in 
china wont be affected by government orders to cancel hundreds of 
construction projects and stop exports of some materials 
zhao said china badly needs foreign investment but will limit it 
to priority areas of energy transportation agriculture and other 
infrastructure development 
the sources however said that in the threeday annual meeting 
of the swissbased world economic forum chinese officials 
acknowledged that some contracts will be canceled they said all 
exports of nonferrous metals will be halted and indicated that 
grain exports will also be affected 
foreign businessmen at the forum said the chinese have already 
refused to respect some export contracts for nonferrous metals 
the sources quoted zhao as saying that political and economic 
fluctuations are normal in all countries and that foreigners should 
stop thinking we are different from other countries 
he gave as an example of political changes the us presidential 
election to take place next week and the justconcluded elections in 
israel 
chinas decision to put the brakes on some economic reforms led 
to speculation that zhao might have been overshadowed by the more 
cautious premier li peng as the nations top decisionmaker on 
economic matters 
there has been no indication however that zhao is in political 
trouble as a result of the economic problems 
zhao said the communist partys role as the ruling political 
group will not change but there will be a change in style under 
political reforms aimed at separating party and government functions

the government of maldives for help to repulse a coup attempt us 
officials said today 
a request for help was received by the us embassy in sri lanka 
which represents the united states in the tropical island chain some 
400 miles away said the officials who declined to be named 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the exact 
status of the situation on the ground is a little uncertain we have 
not provided any direct assistance of any kind at this point the 
maldives are friendly to the united states and we generally support 
them but in terms of this existing situation it appears to be 
resolving itself 
in response to a question fitzwater said there had been no 
indirect us assistance either 
the united states is also consulting with india which has 
received a similar request for help the officials said 
we are reviewing the situation and discussing options with the 
maldives friends mainly india said one official 
he said the united states does not have a presence on the indian 
ocean islands and is therefore short of information about the armed 
attack on government offices in the capital of male 
fighting appears to be continuing around the national police 
headquarters but the presidential palace appears to be in 
government hands with the president inside the official said 
he said the situation is confusing and fluid and the united

advertisement on the comics page 
bryan said he just took the panel out that would have been 
cathy and right where cathy has been put in big type vote for 
bush after today he said he will replace cathy with 
another strip

one other newspaper said last week that it was canceling cathy 
altogether

voters next week will settle a fouryear 
dispute over whether the city should open its golden gate to the 
historic battleship uss missouri on which gen douglas macarthur 
accepted japans surrender in world war ii 
supporters led by former mayor dianne feinstein believe that 
serving as the home port for the 58000ton ship will bring san 
francisco at least 5000 new jobs increase city revenues and 
revitalize the waterfront 
opponents led by mayor art agnos argue that it could cost the 
deficitplagued city millions while generating unwanted and possibly 
hazardous environmental consequences 
environmentalists fear that extensive port dredging to 
accommodate the ship could stir up deadly toxic wastes antinuclear 
activists charge the missouris weaponry would increase the 
likelihood of a nuclear accident and gay rights advocates oppose 
the navys hiring practices 
agnos placed measure r on the ballot requiring the federal 
government to foot the bill for keeping the missouri at the old 
shipyard at hunters point it also would require that 351 promised 
new jobs go to san franciscans under union contracts 
but feinstein who originally proposed the city as the missouris 
home port in early 1985 disagrees its a good deal to the city 
for an upfront investment of 2 million the city brings in 200 
million a year in ship repair payroll and services she said 
supporters of feinsteins plan have placed a rival measure s on 
the ballot instructing the city to implement feinsteins nonbinding 
1987 agreement with the navy to improve port facilities and 
requiring the city to process and approve all actions necessary to 
carry out the agreement including the allocation of 2 million to 
pay for dredging 
she and her allies fear that if approved measure r would send 
the navy elsewhere 
indeed navy secretary william l ball iii has rejected agnos 
terms saying there is no way in which the navy could proceed with 
the missouri homeporting were such a plan adopted by the city 
but agnos has said the city is serious about wanting the navy 
in a way that works for san francisco the current plan works 
only for the navy 
he called feinsteins agreement a onesided sweetheart deal 
that doesnt guarantee one job for san francisco and doesnt 
guarantee one dollar for san francisco 
feinstein counters that agnos is philosophically opposed to 
basing the missouri in san francisco despite public opinion polls 
showing a majority of residents favoring the plan 
a public vote is the only way to get the plan back on course 
said feinstein adding when i left office i thought it was all 
set 
most of us who are native san franciscans want to do our share 
we want to do our part to provide a strong defense she said 
this is not a patriotic issue insisted agnos its not a 
good business deal for the local taxpayer who is being asked to foot 
the bill

both george bush and michael dukakis have 
promised vigorous attempts to revive stalled arabisraeli peace 
talks but the next president will face either a hardline israeli 
government or a stalemated one 
the israeli elections tuesday appear to have handed a narrow 
victory to the rightwing likud bloc which got one seat more in 
parliament than the labor party of foreign minister shimon peres 
likud is trying to form a coalition government with a bloc of 
religious and ultranationalist parties if that doesnt work likud 
may invite labor to join the government as a junior partner 
replicating the current government which has been paralyzed by 
internal conflict 
either way the elections which were viewed as referendum on the 
future of the israelioccupied territories failed to give the 
liberal labor party a clearcut mandate to negotiate peace with the 
arabs peres backed by the united states and moderate arab 
governments campaigned on a platform of relinquishing some lands in 
return for peace 
the israelis have obviously circled their wagons said fouad 
adjami a scholar at the school of advanced international studies of 
johns hopkins university the 11month palestinian uprising in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip pushed voters to the right 
precluding an opening for peace he said 
likud spokesman binyamin netanyahu formerly israeli ambassador 
to the un rejects such bleak predictions speaking from israel on 
nbc netanyahu appealed to the next american president to support 
direct talks between israel and the arabs on autonomy for the 13 
million palestinians in the occupied territories 
likud leader prime minister yitzgak shamir is sensitive to us 
desires and he will try to offer some ideas for peace talks said 
middle east analyst joyce starr 
but this wont succeed in the long run because hes not willing 
to consider giving up lands for peace she added starr is a 
researcher at the center for strategic and international studies an 
independent think tank 
both the bush and dukakis proposals on arabisraeli peace have 
been vague dukakis has talked about sending a special emissary to 
push the sides to the negotiating table bush has never been 
specific but his aides have indicated he would continue reagan 
administration policy 
that policy formulated by secretary of state george shultz 
called for arabisraeli talks under the auspices of the superpowers 
but despite four shuttles by us officials to the region this 
year the shultz plan encountered tough opposition from the likud 
the palestine liberation organization and several arab governments 
it now appears dead 
bush is likely to support any israeli initiative for the sake of 
preventing an irreversible freeze of the peace process analysts say 
if likud comes forward with sincere proposals bush will want 
to work with them he doesnt want confrontation said martin 
indyk director of the washington institute for near east policy a 
washington think tank 
whichever candidate comes to power in washington clashes with a 
shamir administration are virtually certain in view of a likud 
promise to quash the palestinian uprising once and for all 
that means more brutality more palestinians killed more 
probably expulsions perhaps even the idea of some attempt at a 
mass transfer of palestinians out of the west bank and gaza said 
edward said a professor of english at columbia univerity and a 
member of the palestine national council which is the plos 
parliamentary arm 
the reagan administration has repeatedly chastised israel for its 
harsh tactics against the palestinians massive expulsions or a 
higher palestinian death toll are unlikely to be tolerated in 
washington said indyk 
on the other hand if the measures arent horrendous and they 
come within a framework of a likud peace proposal the us may be 
more tolerant he added 
a rightwing government will also seek to augment jewish 
settlements in the occupied territories the settlements have been 
anathema to past us administrations 
the next us president will also face a dilemma with the plo 
its parliamentary arm is scheduled to meet in algeria later this 
month amid predictions that it will announce recognition of israel 
and call for an independent palestinian state sidebyside with the 
jewish one 
if that happens the americans will have to talk to the plo 
because they will have met our conditions for dialogue and that 
too is a potential clash with israel said ms starr 
likud rejects any dialogue with the plo which palestinians view 
as their only representative but which israel views as a terrorist 
organization

soviet criminal law will be revised by the end of 
the year and then there will be no basis to speak about political 
prisoners foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said 
thursday 
he would not state clearly however if all laws used to 
prosecute people for their political beliefs would be repealed 
nor would he say whether all current political prisoners will be 
freed west german chancellor helmut kohl said last week soviet 
officials told him in his meetings in moscow that all political 
prisoners would be freed by the end of the year 
there was nothing new in discussions with the west german 
chancellor on that issue in moscow gerasimov said 
when asked directly if that meant the prisoners would not be 
freed by the end of the year he simply repeated that kohl was told 
nothing new 
the attempts to interpret our explanations as a concession to 
western pressure are groundless he continued 
members of the western alliance reportedly have demanded that all 
soviet political prisoners be released as a condition for concluding 
the current security talks in vienna and for an international 
humanitarian conference in moscow 
gerasimov denied western reports of 200 to 250 political 
prisoners in the soviet union and said that as of thursday only 11 
people still were being held under the four laws involved in western 
complaints there are another 25 insane people not condemned 
because they were sent for compulsory medical treatment 
gerasimov said that as of thursday two people are in prison and 
five are in internal exile under article 70 which bans antisoviet 
agitation and two people are in prison under article 190 which bans 
antisoviet slander 
he said two people are incarcerated under article 227 which bans 
criminal offenses under the pretext of practicing religion and no 
one is imprisoned under article 142 which requires the separation 
of church and state 
justice minister boris kravtsov said monday that article 190 is 
to be repealed and article 70 will be narrowed under the pending 
revision of the criminal code

american actress koo stark a former girlfriend of 
prince andrew won 534000 in libel damages today from a newspaper 
that falsely implied she had an adulterous affair with the prince 
after her marriage 
a high court jury unanimously found that two articles printed in 
the tabloid sunday people newspaper on successive weekends in 
december 1985 had defamed the 32yearold actress 
the jury also awarded ms stark undisclosed costs against the 
newspapers publisher robert maxwell 
ms stark said during the threeday trial that the newspaper was 
wrong to allege she had kept secret dates with the prince or that 
she felt a lingering love for him after her marriage in august 
1984 to timothy jeffries 
she testified she met the prince queen elizabeth iis second 
son only once after her wedding and on that occasion was 
accompanied by her husband heir to the green shield trading stamp 
business reportedly worth 85 million 
ms stark said the allegations implied she was deceiving her 
husband and having an adulterous affair 
her lawyer desmond browne told judge michael davies that 
articles had been published at a time when ms stark was 
experiencing difficulties in her marriage 
he said ms stark had been feeling wretched about her 
marriage and was hoping for a reconciliation but the cruelly 
damaging and wholly untrue newspaper stories dashed all hope of 
that he said 
the couple has since separated but are not divorced 
her lawyer said the newspaper had used a headline secret dates 
after she wed he said that by putting the word after in 
capital letters the newspaper had deliberately given emphasis to 
the authors insinuation that she was deceiving her husband 
the sunday people in publishing all this smoke was playing with 
fire and it was miss stark who got burned browne told the court 
the sunday people did not defend the truth of their articles but 
denied they were defamatory 
the judge ordered that all except for 88000 of ms starks 
damages be retained by the court pending an appeal by the newspaper 
ms stark who once starred in a softporn movie created world 
headlines in octover 1982 when she and prince andrew slipped out of 
britain under false names to vacation together on the caribbean 
island of mustique 
she won substantial undisclosed libel damages in march when 
another newspaper falsely claimed her supposed reaction in 1986 to 
the princes new girlfriend sarah ferguson whom he later married

the commerce department demonstrating its new 
computer system for export licensing said thursday it wants to help 
japan west germany and other allies develop similar technology for 
keeping strategic goods from flowing to communist nations 
commerce undersecretary paul freedenberg said the japanese have 
lagged on this but now theyre interested and that almost all 
other major allies had inquired as well about the advanced licensing 
system 
freedenberg demonstrated a new optical character reader which 
scans typed applications for export licenses and automatically 
stores them in a computer licensing officials can then call up the 
information on their desk terminals and grant or deny the licenses 
their decisions also go into the computer so that us customs 
officials can easily find out if a particular shipment has been 
licensed and can be shipped whether or not they have the actual 
paperwork in hand 
freedenberg said 90 to 100 billion worth of us exports each 
year are strategic goods subject to licensing out of total exports 
of 220 billion 
a commerce department statement said the new system will be able 
to process 1200 licenses a day instead of the current 400 
michael e zacharia assistant secretary for export 
administration has been on a trip to explain us willingness to 
help computerize other countries systems their business people 
complain of red tape and long delays just like ours do he said 
if we can help them speed things up theyre more likely to back 
us in our number one job preventing really strategic goods from 
being diverted zacharia said 
according to the department it took 60 days on average to 
process a us license application in 1984 and 17 days last year 
the department is trying to bring the average down to 14 days for 
1988

the man whose conviction for the 1963 
career girl murders led to the abandonment of new york states 
death penalty has been denied parole a third time officials said 
thursday 
edward elwin executive director of the division of parole said 
a threemember panel unanimously denied richard robles parole 
application wednesday and robles was informed a few hours later 
robles can apply for parole again in november 1990 
robles 45 began serving a life sentence in 1965 for the murders 
of janice wylie 21 and emily hoffert 23 in their manhattan 
apartment 
robles said he was in the process of turning around his life 
after years of of drug abuse and burglary and was committing one 
last burglary to get necessities for his family when he 
entered the womens apartment which he said he thought was vacant 
but miss wylie was there and he raped her at knifepoint according 
to police 
he bound and robbed miss hoffert when she walked in authorities 
said robles said he killed the women after miss hoffert vowed to 
remember him for police 
george whitmore jr then 19 admitted to the killings in a 
confession that was later said to have been coerced by police 
whitmore was exonerated when robles was arrested in january 1965 
the conduct of the police and the possibility that whitmore could 
have been executed was a significant factor in the legislatures

huge quantities of cash and merchandise are 
stolen each year from state enterprises in cuba because of lax 
security procedures according to a secret cuban documentary that 
was smuggled out of the island by a defector 
the tape concludes with an observation by cuban defense minister 
raul castro that 1 million police could not solve cubas crime 
problem without additional accounting controls 
the principal theme of a second government documentary is that 
many of cubas young people are alienated lack revolutionary fervor 
and complain that facilities for recreational activities are too 
often run down nonexistent offlimits or inaccessible 
a screening of the two documentaries produced by the national 
revolutionary police in 1986 and intended for government and party 
officials was held this week under the sponsorship of freedom 
house a new yorkbased human rights group 
the director of freedom houses washington office frank calzon 
said he has no doubt that the tapes are legitimate videos made by 
cuban police no one would have the capacity to make such films 
except the cuban police 
calzon said the tapes were smuggled out of cuba by juan antonio 
rodriguez manier a major in cuban intelligence who defected to the 
west in january 1987 
raul castro brother of president fidel castro summed up his 
feelings about the crime issue in brief remarks shown at the end of 
the presentation 
flanked by fellow communist party members castro said the tape 
was more illustrative than 100 speeches about the problem 
because it aired the comments of the convicted criminals themselves 
the present system he said invites delinquency 
president castro has publicly acknowledged that crime is a major 
problem the documentary shows castro saying in a 1986 speech that a 
fierce struggle is needed to wipe out crime 
socialism cant permit this cancer to corrode it that this 
cancer devour it he said 
the documentary on crime showed repeated instances of how 
employees at state enterprises were able to take advantage of lax 
accounting procedures to steal cash or goods 
most of the testimony was provided by convicted criminals but 
there was no indication of how they were caught one convict spoke 
of how he was able to make off with 224 cases of coffee worth 67200 
pesos under cubas exchange rate the peso is worth slightly more 
than a dollar 
another witness said he was able to pocket about 100 pesos a day 
in daily receipts from the enterprise where he worked he kept up 
the activity for three years 
yet another said he was able to steal fabric for womens clothes 
and leather for shoes in a gambit that appeared to require little 
planning or imagination a security guard was posted at the 
warehouse where the goods were kept but he was deaf the convict 
said 
several cubans responsible for taking daily cash proceeds from 
their respective enterprises to banks for deposit said they 
routinely undertook the trips alone either on foot or by bus 
without protection 
in the second documentary cuban youths complained to 
interviewers that the best beaches often are reserved for tourists 
or that transportation to the seashore was impossible because of a 
shortage of buses cubas television fare was described as 
garbage and there were scenes of a havana amusement park which 
was in a state of almost total disrepair 
who is the president of cuba one young man was asked 
a perplexed look crossed his face armando dorticos no he 
answers not realizing that dorticos is a former president that his 
first name was osvaldo that he died several years ago and that the 
current president is fidel castro

the national republican senatorial 
committee ordered a us senate candidate to yank a campaign 
commercial that shows a bloody fetus side by side with senate 
majority leader robert byrd 
byrd dwva said wednesday that gop challenger jay wolfes 
television advertisement was contemptible and an outrage 
it sensationalizes a very serious issue just for the sake of 
political shock value byrd said 
the 30second spot which prompted complaints from viewers 
opened with a closeup of a bloody fetus then showed a picture of 
byrd next to that of the fetus 
wolfe a firstterm state senator defended the commercial when 
asked if it upset viewers wolfe responded i was upset when i 
realized what was going on with abortions i think its in poor 
taste that byrd has consistently voted for abortion 
byrd said the commercial distorted his record on abortion adding 
that he believes federal funding for abortions is warranted in cases 
of rape or incest or where the life of the mother is endangered by 
the pregnancy 
the commercial listed as its sponsor the republican senatorial 
committee but the group the political arm of the us senate 
republican leadership denied any involvement 
committee spokesman tom mason said wolfe was not authorized to 
broadcast the ad with committee funds 
its the only ad that weve refused to pay for mason 
said that should tell you what we think of it we talked to the 
campaign and told them to pull the ads 
i think the ad is disgusting deplorable and never should have 
been run said summersville mayor steve lerose a member of the 
state republican committee 
i am against abortion except in the case of a lifeordeath 
situation to the mother but to have a political ad show a fetus 
like this is totally disgusting to me and im sure to many people 
in the state 
wolfe said he will continue to run the advertisement but drop the 
senatorial committees name and replace it with his own 
several television stations said they received calls from viewers 
and referred them to wolfes campaign office 
people were irate they said it was rather a disgusting ad 
said ruth damron a receptionist at wowktv in huntington 
stan siegal general manager of wboytv in clarksburg said his 
station received 50 to 75 telephone calls from viewers since the ad 
began running monday 
theyre mostly upset with the content of the commercial and 
second they generally ask would you control what time it airs so 
children dont see it the general public does not understand tv 
stations have no control over what the ads say he said 
wolfe said he wrote the ad copy he said he received about 60 
calls from around the state during the past two days both for it 
and against it 
he said he spent more than 100000 running seven ads including 
the one on abortion he said about 80 percent of the money came from 
the republican senatorial committee 
bill green an attorney for the national association of 
broadcasters said federal law forbids stations from censoring the 
content of political advertisements in which the candidate appears 
he also said stations cannot be held liable for the contents of such 
an ad

the pentagon hoping to contain the cost of its 
health insurance plan for dependents and retirees has approved 21 
projects aimed at expanding the capacity of military hospitals to 
handle such patients 
the approvals given by assistant defense secretary william 
mayer will allow army and air force hospitals in 12 states to 
expand facilities or hire additional nurses and other staff to 
provide more surgical obstetrics gynecology cardiology and 
psychiatry services 
similar navy projects are now under consideration 
the pentagon estimates the new projects will cost the two 
services 146 million but that the defense department will still 
save 139 million compared with the cost of paying civilian 
hospitals to treat the patients under the civilian health and 
medical program of the uniformed services an insurance program 
military hospitals are required to serve dependents and retirees 
on a spaceavailable basis giving first priority to men and women 
on active duty

approximately 14 million by returning nearly 1000 admissions and 
20000 outpatient visits to military treatment facilities the

selfproclaimed millionaire maker ed 
beckley is pulling out of iowa and not contesting the courtordered 
liquidation of his real estate marketing company 
beckley made millions in the mid1980s by selling real estate on 
television programs that carried inspirational testimonials and 
promises of financial freedom but beckley group inc found itself 
awash in claims for refunds after instituting a sixmonth 
moneyback guarantee 
in 1987 the company sought court protection from creditors while 
it tried to reorganize its finances under chapter 11 of the federal 
bankruptcy code 
the company still lost 601000 last year and it pulled its 
programs off the air two weeks ago in what turned out to be an 
unsuccessful shift to directmail marketing of its courses 
the iowa attorney general on behalf of consumers asked that the 
case be converted to chapter 7 a liquidation and the shutdown was 
approved in federal bankruptcy court wednesday with beckleys 
consent 
im sort of a battler but im out of gas here said beckley 
a california native who in 1985 joined the transcendental meditation 
movement in fairfield the home of maharishi international 
university 
ill leave iowa peaceably get a little rest and try to figure 
out what im going to do he said 
beckley said he is writing a book about spiritual and financial 
wealth 
the court action means the assets of beckley group will be sold 
to pay claims of creditors but donald neiman a lawyer for beckley 
said its unlikely the company will be able to repay 10000 
customers seeking 26 million in refunds 
the iowa attorney generals office still is suing beckley for 
consumer refunds and the bankruptcy court trustee said he looking 
into possible action to recover 24 million beckley owes the 
company terry gibson a lawyer for the trustee said officials are

soviet refusal to destroy a disputed siberian 
radar facility is prompting the reagan administration to consider 
expanding strategic weapons programs us officials said thursday 
among the steps being weighed are reversing the planned 
dismantling of three poseidon nuclear submarines deploying a 
limited ballistic missile defense and speeding up the testing of 
space weapons said the officials who spoke only on condition of 
anonymity 
they said a decision was expected within two weeks the jury is 
still out an official said 
in the meantime william f burns director of the us arms 
control and disarmament agency plans to begin briefing members of 
congress on friday on failure to resolve the dispute with the 
soviets 
acting on a request from the white house last summer the options 
were prepared by the pentagon and are being circulated to the state 
department the arms control agency and other us offices for their 
recommendations 
on wednesday us and soviet technical experts in geneva 
discussed the radar installation at krasnoyarsk siberia and a 
soviet proposal to construct a space institute there 
the us group headed by burns had no objection to the idea of 
an institute but said the krasnoyarsk facility had to be dismantled 
after the soviets refused state department spokesman charles e 
redman said the united states may take appropriate and 
proportionate responses or declare krasnoyarsk a material 
breach of the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty 
that would be a first step toward abrogating the arms control 
accord 
unfortunately the soviet experts did not have any new 
proposal redman said wednesday in giving an account of the 
session 
in two reports to congress the administration charged the 
soviets with violating the abm treaty by constructing a radar 
facility that could be used to organize a national defense against 
missile attack 
the theory behind the treaty is that if both sides were unable to 
mount a defense they would hesitate to launch an attack otherwise 
their territory and populations would be open to devastating 
retaliation 
the geneva session was held at the soviets request viktor p 
karpov the foreign ministrys senior arms control specialist had 
said in july that the soviets would dismantle the krasnoyarsk radar 
if the two sides resolved their differences over the 1972 treaty 
we had hoped they were prepared to meet us concerns about the 
radar redman said we listened to what they had to say 
unfortunately the soviet experts did not have any new proposals

pakistan said it shot down an 
intruding afghan warplane thursday inside its borders and 
afghanistan said pakistani jet fighters downed two aircraft in 
afghan territory 
western diplomats also reported thursday that communist forces 
fired six missiles at afghan guerrillas near the border 
the steppedup activity in the 10yearold afghan war follows 
wednesdays capture by guerrillas of a key afghan frontier post and 
the introduction by soviet forces of new longrange missiles 
neither afghanistans sovietbacked government or pakistan 
acknowledged the others claims of border air battles but both 
lodged official protests it was not clear whether they were 
reporting on the same attacks 
the pakistani government said a usbuilt pakistani f16 shot 
down a sovietmade su22 fighterbomber thursday morning when two 
su22s penetrated 10 miles into pakistans northwest frontier 
province 
the pakistani government said an afghan pilot was captured and 
was being questioned pakistan television showed film of the 
wreckage near the village of thal about 160 miles west of islamabad 
however afghanistans official radio kabul later said pakistani 
f16s shot down an afghan reconaissance jet in the morning and a 
training jet in the afternoon 
the afghan report monitored in islamabad thursday night said 
both attacks came near the city of khost about 12 miles inside 
afghanistan it did identify the type of afghan planes involved 
khost is about 36 miles southwest of the pakistani village of 
thal 
the afghan radio said the communist authorities protested to 
pakistan over the alleged pakistani downing of the planes inside 
afghanistan 
pakistans foreign ministry summoned the afghan charge daffaires 
and launched a strong protest about the pakistani claims of an 
air incursion officials said 
the ministry later summoned soviet ambassador vp yakunin to 
protest this weeks deployment of the new missiles and other 
advanced aircraft and weapons in afghanistan pakistani television 
said 
western diplomats in islamabad reported that communist forces 
have fired at least six new soviet ss1 missiles at guerrilla 
positions close to the boundary 
the official soviet news agency tass reported that sovietafghan 
forces fired a powerful missile wednesday night at a guerrilla 
base near the border 
late wednesday the guerrillas claimed they captured the town of 
tokram from government forces after two days of fighting afghan 
guerrillas said they gained control of about 24 miles of the road 
leading west to the besieged city of jalalabad in afghanistans 
nangarhar province 
despite the raging civil war between the guerrillas and 
sovietafghan forces pakistan had allowed nonmilitary goods to 
pass through its territory to torkham at the foot pakistans khyber 
pass 
however guerrillas announced thursday they were closing the road 
to commercial traffic which could cause shortages of basic 
commodities in jalalabad and kabul the afghan capital 
the united states which backs the guerrillas along with 
pakistan has complained over the soviet introduction of advanced 
aircraft and weapons in afghanistan the state department called it 
a dangerous escalation of the war and a violation of a un accord 
that provides for a soviet troop withdrawal 
in april the soviet union agreed to remove its troops from 
afghanistan by feb 15 1989 moscow met its pledge to withdraw the 
first half of it forces by aug 15 according to un observers but 
no major units have left since then 
the soviets intervened in afghanistan in december 1979

west european nations began a round of 
talks thursday with the soviet union to expand economic ties but a 
top european official said the west would move cautiously 
we should not throw away 30 years of cautious approach with 
eastern europe just in a wave of sudden optimism or a wave of 
naivete said willy de clercq the top trading official of the 
12nation european economic community 
i dont think its our feeling to do that he said 
thu trading bloc opened two days of discussions with a soviet 
delegation led by ivan ivanov vice president of the soviet state 
commission for foreign economic affairs 
the meetings described as exploratory talks are designed to get 
a feeling for what each side would like to see in any agreement 
later worked out in negotiations 
during previous contacts the soviets indicated they would be 
interested in an agreement with the wealthier european countries 
covering a wide variety of areas including high technology the 
transfer of such sensitive technology to moscow is tightly 
controlled 
they asked for everything de clercq said in an interview 
before the talks it is a question if the community can accept or 
will accept so broad a cooperation that is very likely going to 
be asked 
de clercq said an agreement with the soviet union could cover 
cooperation in the environment energy transportation and exchange 
of information and statistics 
west european businessmen are interested in gaining greater 
access to the soviet marketplace he said 
the trading bloc also known as the common market generally 
works out agreements with other countries that lead to greater 
trade but the soviet union has limited products that west european 
countries would be interested in buying 
de clercq said any serious negotiations on such a pact likely 
would not take place until next year at the earliest 
the common market nations imported 152 billion in goods from 
the soviet union in 1987 and had exports totaling 107 billion 
according to eec figures 
the improved eastwest relationship has raised some concern that 
moscow will gain access to high technology that could improve its 
military might 
there is this concern about transfer of technology said 
alfred h kingon us ambassador to the european economic community 
we all feel strongly that whatever is happening in eastern 
europe could be used to our mutual advantage he said 
the export of sensitive western technology such as supercomputers 
is controlled by the 16nation coordinating committee for 
multilateral export controls which maintains a list of items 
embargoed for export to the soviet bloc 
the discussions with the soviets are the latest in a series 
recent trade talks the community has held with the east 
in june the common market signed a declaration establishing 
official relations with the 10nation sovietled socialist economic 
bloc called the council for mutual economic assistance 
in september the common market signed a trade and economic 
cooperation agreement with hungary and recently finished 
negotiations on a trade accord with czechoslovakia 
common market members are britain ireland denmark france 
belgium luxembourg the netherlands germany spain portugal 
italy and greece

polls indicate men like george bush better than 
michael dukakis a gender gap that analysts say bush has 
successfully reinforced by depicting the democrat as soft on crime 
and defense 
much has been made of the other gender gap the one that finds 
women favoring democrats over republican presidential candidates 
but polling data also shows that men have a distinct set of 
standards by which they measure the two candidates 
houstonbased republican pollster lance tarrance said bush struck 
a chord among male voters with television advertisements that 
attacked dukakis 
men tend to be far more concerned with preserving the status 
quo men also can be appealed to on socalled macho issues such 
things as national defense and the crime issues tarrance said 
the attacks seem to have driven home with male voters because 
they make a stronger decision on who they dont want women 
make a stronger decision on who they do want tarrance said 
he said men also were suspicious of dukakis because they sensed 
there was more to dukakis than he was letting us know and they 
did not know what that something was in addition bush tapped into 
a male penchant for a more structured analysis of things that made 
them lean away from what they saw as a lack of national experience 
on the part of dukakis 
experience really counts strongly with men tarrance said 
the very fact that bush put dukakis on the defensive for weeks 
and thus was able to set the agenda for the campaign gave him status 
as a strong leader a factor which also attracted men said ethel 
klein associate professor of political science at columbia 
university 
men really dont think hes strong she said of dukakis 
every time michael dukakis has had a chance to define himself 
hes let bush define him she cited dukakis nowfamous tank ride 
following a drumbeat of softondefense attacks from bush 
klein said bush put the democrats in a metoo position hes 
been on the offensive all along and that was a strong message 
that men liked 
in recent polls both men and women favor bush over dukakis but 
the margin for men is greater 
the latest abc newswashington post poll showed bush preferred by 
56 percent of men 40 percent of women the most recent cbs newsnew 
york times survey put bushs advantage among men at 5639 
pollster louis harris said men seem to be drawn to bush in large 
part because he is the only alternative to dukakis whom bush has 
succeeded in portraying negatively 
what bush did was to make it reactive against dukakis because 
bush doesnt have the same inspirational qualities that ronald 
reagan has reagan was able to inspire men now men are able to 
react against dukakis said harris 
political analyst william schneider however contended that the 
male penchant for bush is really just a reflection of a pattern that 
has emerged for several years now 
it has to do with the image of the parties and the role of 
government in peoples lives he said 
women support a protective government identified with the 
democrats while men agree more with the republican push to shrink 
government he said 
it has very little to do with bush and dukakis and a great deal 
to do with the direction the parties have moved in

sen dan quayle is settling uncomfortably 
into his role as loyal no 2 to george bush grousing about a lack 
of national media coverage and sudden schedule changes dictated by 
headquarters 
he acknowledged that whatever george bush wants george bush will 
get even when that meant quayle will await the presidential 
election returns in washington instead of his hometown of 
huntington as first planned 
im learning im a quick study he told reporters tuesday 
night quayle related that bush thought one of the two should be in 
washington on election night but the candidate at the top of the 
ticket was determined to watch the returns back in his adopted texas 
if he wants to be in houston hell be in houston quayle 
said ive got a lot of friends in washington so ill go there 
through the last week of the campaign quayle repeatedly voiced 
the republican gospel about not taking victory for granted but he 
also dealt with questions about what kind of vice president he would 
be 
i think my role will be very much like george bushs role he 
said the way he served ronald reagan was helpful to the 
implementation of his policies 
my image is not important whats important is george bushs 
image 
the transformation of quayle has been marked he groaned to 
reporters this week that he cannot get national media exposure 
put me on the air he exhorted a network television producer 
this from the politician who three months ago suffered through the 
most negative campaign publicity since gary hart 
ironically as quayle voiced irritation with his lesserlight 
role bush campaign aides and even some quayle staffers rejoiced 
that the controversial quayle of august had graduated to the 
position of ordinary vice presidential candidate 
it indicates that he is now campaigning in about the mode we 
have always learned to expect from vice presidential candidates 
said mitch daniels a former reagan white house political director 
who is constantly at quayles side on the campaign trail 
traditionally no no 2 candidate attracts regular national 
coverage but theyre always news in all but the biggest media 
markets 
quayle nevertheless complained about lastminute schedule 
changes dictated by bush campaign headquarters in washington and 
the man who sought to avoid reporters in the torrid days of august 
amid heavy questioning about his past now took pains to be 
accessible to the press 
when the bush campaign bumped south bend ind from quayles 
schedule tuesday because the vice president was appearing at the 
university of notre dame the senator used the spare time to host a 
luncheon for traveling reporters 
besides canceling the appearance in south bend quayle had to 
call off a planned trip to missouri and north carolina and he 
traveled to south carolina instead not all of the campaign schedule 
changes were keyed to presidential votegetting strategy 
quayle aide lanny wiles said its a kind of dartboard 
technique the last week of the campaign if you overcommit to 
appearances you leave ill will so you leave room on your schedule 
so you can add on its always been that way 
but wiles then said the major aim of quayles south carolina 
appearance was to help a republican trying to wrest from a democrat 
a congressional seat once held by gov carroll campbell you know 
carroll is a good friend of george bushs he said 
quayle took all of this in stride even with his complaints 
telling an audience in jeffersonville ind at one point that 
schedule of mine changes every minute wherever that plane 
hoosiers pride goes ill be right on it 
daniels said that quayle has been spending his days in small 
towns and some outoftheway spots not to hide him but to appeal 
to voters in less populated areas 
hes a small town guy just like ronald reagan a dixon ill 
native daniels said the republican party is a party of the 
small town 
while he tries to stymie any urge for more national attention and 
bigcity campaign galas quayle says hes surmounted questions about 
the circumstances under which he joined the indiana national guard 
at the height of the vietnam war in 1969 and questions about his 
academic performance at depauw university and indiana university law 
school 
quayle said that while he believes some of the reporting about 
his past was reckless and irresponsible news reporters had a very 
short time to examine me a hurryup rush situation so its 
not their fault 
to those who may harbor lingering doubts about his fitness for 
high office he says give me a chance

a soviet official said thursday that soviet jews 
wont be participating in the world jewish congress any time soon 
although initial contacts have been made 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov also said the 
soviets will allow private teaching of hebrew once punished as a 
crime in the soviet union 
gerasimov was commenting on wednesdays announcement by an 
official of the world jewish congress that soviet officials had 
agreed to allow the teaching of hebrew and permit the countrys 18 
million jews to participate in the international organization 
a working knowledge of hebrew is considered an essential part of 
the religious instruction given to every jew but soviet laws on the 
books bar the private teaching of religious subjects to anyone under 
18 
gerasimov told a government news briefing that hebrew has been 
taught as a foreign language at moscow leningrad and tbilisi 
universities and now private instruction would be allowed 
the foreign ministry spokesman said soviet jews are just 
beginning to organize within the country 
gerasimov said officials of the international jewish group were 
told by konstantin kharchev chairman of the governments council 
for religious affairs that such groups now have only initial 
contacts with the world jewish congress and it was too early to 
speak about possible developments 
elan steinberg executive director of the world jewish congress 
said thursday that we have overcome the unwillingness of soviet 
authorities to allow soviet jews to participate in the international 
body 
he said soviet jews have no national organization yet that could 
affiliate with the umbrella group which represents jewish groups 
from 70 countries whose combined jewish populations total 11 million 
to 12 million 
on wednesday following talks with soviet officials steinberg 
said soviet authorities had agreed that the soviet jewish 
community can participate in the activities of the world jewish 
congress 
he said at the time that the exact form of participation remained 
to be worked out 
steinberg also said the teaching of hebrew would be allowed again 
the unsanctioned teaching of hebrew was once treated here as a 
criminal offense and several jewish activists went to prison for 
giving unauthorized instruction in the language they included josef 
begun who was allowed to emigrate to israel this year 
however an agreement signed by the ministry of culture to 
establish the first jewish cultural center in the soviet union in 
more than 50 years says the building may be used in its second 
phase for classes in hebrew and yiddish steinberg said 
at thursdays briefing gerasimov also said that 15700 soviet 
jews received permanent exit visas in the first nine months of 1988 
in october jewish emigration from the soviet union reached an 
8year high with 2473 jews allowed to leave according to the 
genevabased intergovernmental committee for migration

decision to issue an entry visa to a former us resident accused of 
war crimes saying the man had valid travel documents and was not 
charged in the united states 
boleslav maikovskis was detained oct 19 in muenster where he 
was living while awaiting a decision on a request for political 
asylum in west germany he is being held in prison while war crimes 
prosecutors investigate the allegations against him 
before coming to west germany in november 1987 maikovskis 84 
had lived in mineola ny 
this man possessed a valid passport that allowed him reentry 
into the united states foreign ministry spokesman reinhard 
bettzuege said 
mr maikovskis was issued a visa of limited duration based on 
the validity of his passport he had requested entry to pursue legal 
matters bettzuege added 
bettzuege said he did not know details of maikovskis legal 
matters 
the soviet union in 1965 sentenced maikovskis to death in 
absentia for his alleged role in burning down a village and helping 
murder more than 130 people in the latvian village of audrine 
the united states began deportation proceedings against him in 
1976 but they were held up by several appeals his last appeal was 
denied by the us supreme court in 1986 
maikovskis visa was issued by the west german consulate in new 
york bonn officials said 
west german government sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity noted that us officials had not seized maikovskis 
passport and had not brought charges against him 
at the time of departure maikovskis was free to come and go as 
he pleased to the united states said a government source 
if us officials had really wanted him that badly they could 
have easily gotten him long before he left the country the source 
told the associated press 
last month the us justice departments office of special 
investigations said it had lost track of maikovskis and had just 
discovered he had left the country 
maikovskis was granted a visa based on a passport issued by the 
latvian government in exile

drive but now he loves it and i dont want to pull him out 
her son joey is not permitted to take the bus because the 
milwaukee public schools system prohibits the busing of children in 
its kindergarten classes for 4yearolds if the youngsters live less 
than a mile from school older pupils including those in 
kindergarten for 5yearolds get bus service 
the problem according to richard f wenzel assistant director 
of transportation for the district is state law it requires that 
if bus transportation were provided for pupils in 4yearold 
kindergarten it would have to be offered to all children in that 
age group 
that would include 4yearolds at daycare centers all over the 
city as well as to five miles outside the city wenzel said 
there would be quite a financial impact 
if its too hazardous for a 5yearold or my thirdgrader to 
walk certainly its too dangerous for a 4yearold said a 
frustrated kiesner whose 8yearold son gets bused to the same 
school 
she said she walks a neighbors daughter a 5yearold 
kindergarten pupil to her bus stop each day waits for the bus to 
pick up the girl and then walks her younger son about six blocks 
along a busy city street to get him to the same school 
to put one little kid on that bus and then have to walk my own 
child up to the same school seems ridiculous kiesner said 
its not like im asking for a special bus it already stops 
right here and theres plenty of room she said 
school officials said they would like to bus joey but they are 
restricted by the school boards policy and even though joey has 
turned 5 he is still covered by the policy because he remains 
enrolled in 4yearold kindergarten 
the board has directed superintendent robert s peterkin to 
review the districts student assignment process but peterkin said 
no changes are likely to be made until 199091 
school officials said there are two options for kiesner 
she can select another school farther from her home according to 
wenzel busing is provided to youngsters in 4yearold kindergarten 
if they attend a school more than a mile from home and their 
attendance enhances the schools racial balance 
but kiesner said she wants to keep her two children in the same 
school i feel better knowing he joey is in the same school with 
his brother 
the second option wenzel said is for kiesner to negotiate a 
private contract with the bus company a bus company spokesman 
estimated such a contract would cost about 250 a day 
thats beyond my budget i couldnt afford that kiesner said

the nottoodistant future 
i am not much worried about the student protests their 
complaints will eventually disappear in a huge melting furnace of 
democratic political reforms roh told reporters aboard a plane

police who blocked their march to chuns house in a fashionable 
residential district 
police in armored vans retaliated by firing barrages of tear gas 
many pedestrians and residents cried with pain and choked in a 
dense fog of the acrid gas 
traffic came to a halt and most shops in the area closed as the 
fierce fighting continued for several hours

vietnam returned thursday what it 
believes to be remains of 23 americans missing from the vietnam war 
a us spokesman said 
a military honor guard saluted solemnly as the remains each in a 
metal casket covered with a folded us flag were loaded onto a 
us air force c141 transport plane on the sunbaked tarmac of 
hanois noi bai airport said maj dan trout 
it was among the largest turnovers since the january 1973 paris 
peace accords ended us military involvement in the war in which 
58000 americans died before the communists defeated the usbacked 
south vietnam government in april 1975 
the caskets were flown out of the vietnamese capital en route to 
honolulu where the us central identification laboratory will try 
to confirm preliminary analyses by the vietnamese 
trout spokesman for the us pacific command said vietnam 
provided a list of some names and information on the remains but he 
had no other details 
sources said earlier that vietnam has given the united states at 
least nine names 
trout said among the remains are those of 21 troops the 
vietnamese found in their own searches and two soldiers recovered 
during the first joint field investigation near hanoi sept 25oct 
5 
another american military team returned to bangkok on thursday 
after completing the second joint field investigation with the 
vietnamese to determine what happened to us airmen lost in 
northern vietnam 
trout said since the paris accords the united states has 
received the identified remains of 196 missing people including 168 
from vietnam 26 from laos and two from china that leaves 2387 
americans missing in action in vietnam laos and cambodia 
in august 1987 vietnams foreign minister nguyen co thach and a 
special us presidential envoy retired gen john w vessey agreed 
to hasten cooperation on the issue 
thursdays turnover brought to 90 the number of suspected remains 
vietnam has provided since then from them the us laboratory so 
far has identified 25 missing americans 
seven us military specialists returned to bangkok after the 
joint field investigation during which they inspected us warplane 
crash sites and other areas near hanoi trout said 
they did not find any specific remains this time he said 
during the 10day project two joint teams searched areas many 
of them mountainous in son la ha son binh and hai hung provinces 
as with the first joint investigation they were trying to 
resolve some of the 70 compelling discrepancy cases where the 
united states says there is evidence that vietnamese authorities 
should have information including on airmen who were captured but 
never returned 
most american losses in northern vietnam were airmen shot down 
during bombing runs 
thach previously gave americans until the end of november to 
complete such investigations and repeated hopes the united states 
will provide more help in resolving vietnams own humanitarian 
problems hanoi is eager for development aid from washington 
us officials say they hope the joint projects will break down 
some of the deep mistrust that has marked dealings on the issue for 
many years

a marble head of achilles once displayed at 
the j paul getty museum as a 2300yearold work of art was 
probably made this century by a student working from a plaster 
model an official said 
the head removed from view at the museum in october 1987 because 
the museum believed it to be a fake was probably copied from a cast 
taken from a head on display at the national archaeological museum 
in athens said getty curator marion true 
the head was apparently also rejected as a fake in the early 
1930s by the metropolitan museum of art in new york city according 
to letters found at the met last year by a curator researching a 
different subject 
the letters were just one more element in the whole detective 
process this correspondence was an important component lori 
starr a spokeswoman for the museum said thursday 
ms true said a painstaking study of the marble head by 
scientists and art experts had answered many of the questions 
surrounding the head of achilles a mythological hero slain by an 
arrow to his heel 
the head has always been a problem but its one thing to say a 
thing is false and quite another to prove it she said if you 
condemn something you have to support your argument 
questions remain however including whether the museum was 
knowingly misled by parisian art dealer michel de bry who sold the 
piece to the getty in 1979 for an undisclosed price published 
reports placed the heads value at around 25 million 
de bry has been unavailable for comment 
the museum has taken the necessary steps to return the head to 
the seller said ms starr refusing further comment for now 
though she said the bust was in storage 
the marble head had been dated 350340 bc and was believed to 
have been created by the greek sculptor and architect skopas as a 
temple decoration depicting a trojan war scene 
many scholars had believed that the head and another titled the 
head of achilles in the greek museum came from the same studio 
probably the same artist or the artists assistant and from the 
same monument 
but when placed sidebyside the getty head and the greece 
museum head proved to be too similar 
crosssection measurements of many parts of the two heads were 
within a millimeter of each other said jerry podany conservator of 
antiquities at getty 
its an incredibly impressive copy he said 
getty officials dont know who crafted the phony achilles head 
but plaster casts were a popular teaching tool in the late 19th 
century and early 20th century ms true said that the precise 
workmanship leads her to believe the head was made in the early 20th 
century 
other evidence proving the head to be a fake were scientific 
tests on the marble that found the getty head was made of an 
entirely different kind of marble than the greek museum piece said 
ms true 
with a 21 billion endowment from oil baron j paul getty the 
malibu museum is the richest art institution in the world

by rights chic hecht ought to be on the 
ropes the republican senator has committed numerous verbal gaffes 
been down by double digits in the polls and as democratic 
challenger richard bryan loves to point out been designated the 
least effective member of the senate 
so why is this race with less than a week to go until the nov 8 
election one of the most hotly contested in the nation 
his survival has been even more spectacular than the alaskan 
whales says jann olsten director of the national republican 
senatorial committee the partys senate campaign arm 
hecht has climbed back to a virtual dead heat with bryan 
according to recent polls the incumbent has been spending heavily 
on advertising and has brought in president reagan to take advantage 
of his states heavily republican character 
reagan made a whistlestop visit to reno this week and bryan 
conceded it would give hecht a bump of a few percentage points 
but he still predicted he would win the tight race 
there had been a brief lull in the acrimony that had surfaced 
early in the campaign including references to bryans sex life and 
hechts intelligence but there were new accusations of lies and 
distortions during a final debate this week 
hecht raised allegations that lt gov bob miller who would take 
over as governor should bryan win the senate seat was linked to 
organized crime figures 
the outraged governor in turn accused hecht of mccarthyism 
naked and blatant and called the remarks character 
assassination in the worst way 
he challenged hecht to provide specifics hecht declined saying 
he based his statement on a newspaper article that reported miller 
had talked to people later exposed as organized crime figures 
hecht 59 complained earlier in the campaign about news accounts 
citing his verbal miscues he once referred to a nuclear repository 
to be located in nevada as a nuclear suppository and in a tv 
interview last week he mixed up the meanings of the words overt 
and covert in describing his army intelligence experience 
overt is what i did that means youre undercover hecht is a 
member of the senate intelligence committee 
and one bryan ad pointed out that a senate staff poll had ranked 
his opponent at the bottom of the 100member list for effectiveness 
bryan 51 has sought to distance himself from michael dukakis 
despite his earlier endorsement of the democratic presidential 
nominee he says he supports the old liberalism of franklin 
roosevelt and john f kennedy but calls himself a progressive rather 
than a modern political liberal 
hecht says bryan by entering the senate race deserted voters 
who elected him to a second fouryear term as governor in 1986 as 
part of the criticism the hecht camp continues to incorrectly say 
bryan would be the first nevada governor to quit in midterm to get 
a us senate seat 
bryan repeatedly criticized hecht for canceling a northern nevada 
debate however bryan did much the same thing in his successful 
1982 challenge of thengov bob list 
hecht outspent bryan more than 2to1 during most of october 
according to federal reports filed by the two candidates hecht said 
he spent nearly 1 million from oct 1 to oct 19 while bryan spent 
just over 416000 in the same period 
in addition to the heavy spending and the reagan visit olstens 
washingtonbased gop campaign committee began airing new generic 
television ads in the closing week of the capaign 
the spending blitz prompted bryan to file a federal election 
commission complaint against hecht in one case to stop the american 
medical association from spending more than 100000 on hechts 
behalf 
but hecht aides said the ama political action committee spending 
was independent of their campaign and charged bryan was engaged in 
untruths to say hecht and the ama were trying to buy the 
election 
also a potential boost to hecht was george bushs overwhelming 
lead in the state but bryan campaign chief sam singer said nevadans 
wont blindly follow a gop ticket down the line 
endorsements were mixed the largest newspapers in the state were 
divided with the las vegas reviewjournal going for hecht and the 
reno gazettejournal backing bryan 
hecht a las vegas businessman upset sen howard cannon in 1982 
after the incumbent was bloodied during a tough primary fight 
cannon testified just before the election in the trials of 
thenteamsters president roy lee williams and mob figure allen 
dorfman 
bryan also from las vegas served in the state legislature and 
also as attorney general prior to his successful bid for governor in 
1982 and reelection in 1986

solidarity leader lech walesa said thursday 
that no climate exists for talks with authorities and he wont 
reply to a government proposal for a meeting until britains prime 
minister ends her visit 
walesa said at a news conference that he received a letter from 
interior minister gen czesalaw on wednesday 
the letter invited walesa to meet to remove obstacles to 
convening longpromised talks between the government and 
representatives of the outlawed solidarity trade union movement 
it was the first time kiszczak approached walesa directly about 
setting up a meeting their previous three meetings since aug 31 
were arranged by mediators 
the staterun pap news agency said kiszczak proposed a meeting to 
discuss the number and list of participants the question of 
chairing the debate and the sequence of speeches press coverage and 
time length of the proposed talks 
though he has not formulated his reply due to preparation for a 
meeting with prime minster margaret thatcher walesa said he was 
interested to meet kiszczak to discuss important issues 
at st brygidas church where mrs thatcher will dine with 
walesa and other solidarity leaders friday workers put up a giant 
union jack and a sign saying solidarity gdansk welcomes mrs 
thatcher 
walesa said he would repeat solidaritys position that the 
composition of his team to the talks is not open to discussion 
if there are other subjects than our internal and personnel 
problems important problems then i am ready to take up talks on 
those subjects at any time but talks cannot concern our internal 
affairs he said 
government objections to longtime solidarity advisers jacek kuron 
and adam michnik delayed the start of the talks which the 
authorities first proposed during a strikes in august 
walesa ended the strikes polands worst labor unrest in seven 
years after the government promised the talks and said they would 
include discussion of solidaritys future 
kiszczaks letter came two days after the government announced it 
would close the lenin shipyard where solidarity was formed for 
financial reasons 
the decision made by prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski 
appears to have soured solidaritys attitude toward the government 
but walesa an electrician at the gdansk shipyard said solidariy 
was still eager for the talks 
there is no climate for the round table but we want it very 
much we are ready at any moment he said 
walesa said solidarity was a catalyst for reform and it favored 
reforming the economy but he said what happened to the shipyard 
is unclear and illogical and it is simply a political mistake 
the solidarity leader is on unpaid leave from the shipyard 
dealing with union business he said if the yard closes he will 
work in a shipyard somewhere else because his years in the yard 
were the most beautiful of my life

a police academy cadet has died six 
weeks after he and two dozen other trainees fell ill from rigorous 
exercises and his familys lawyer urged thursday that the 
instructors be charged with manslaughter 
timothy shepard 25 died late wednesday at a pittsburgh hospital 
where he had undergone a liver transplant operation he was in a 
coma for two weeks then emerged only to lose consciousness again 
monday 
doctors removed a blood clot from his brain but could not stem 
the hemorrhaging 
an autopsy was scheduled and a formal state inquest into the 
death is planned state attorney general james shannon said 
thursday flags were lowered to halfstaff in pittsfield 
the familys attorney michael d hashim described the shepards 
as devastated he came so close to making it hashim said 
just four days before shepard died he had written his pregnant 
wife of five months holly im going to make it 
hashim said the state troopers who oversaw the cadets training 
at the agawam academy should be indicted 
i believe we have a clearcut case of involuntary manslaughter 
here hashim said they ignored conditions that placed the 
cadets in harm 
cadets reports of hours of exercise on only a few cups of water 
sparked at least four state reviews shannon announced last week at 
the end of his investigation that the agawam academy was a massive 
failure 
the investigations have begun a shakeup of the agency that runs 
the states regional police academies and supervises training for 
other law enforcement groups 
the director of the state criminal justice training council 
resigned wednesday and his replacement immediately abolished 
socalled stress training a grueling program of intentionally 
confusing orders verbal abuse and demanding exercise that was 
blamed in part for the cadets dehydration and exhaustion 
sixteen cadets were hospitalized during their first week at the 
academy where state troopers trained recruits for police 
departments in western massachusetts half the class of 50 suffered 
kidney ailments because of the training regimen according to 
shannons report 
on thursday he said hampden district attorney michael j ryan 
had agreed to conduct an inquest into shepards death 
the shepard family and the public are entitled to a full 
explanation of mr shepards death the attorney general said 
he said he did not believe he had evidence to bring criminal 
charges but hinted that the inquest could lead to an indictment 
there are potentially different legal consequences when death 
occurs he said 
gov michael s dukakis said in a statement nothing can make 
up for the shepard familys loss but they should know that the 
circumstances of this tragedy are of great concern to me this 
administration is already moving swiftly to do all we can to ensure 
that it never happen again 
shepard was pronounced dead at 1120 pm wednesday at 
presbyterianuniversity hospital in pittsburgh word of the death 
was not released until thursday at the familys request 
shepard never regained the strength to breathe and speak on his 
own after falling unconscious on a running track sept 19 but he 
communicated with his family in writing 
shepards wife who maintained a vigil at the hospital with his 
parents recalled last week how he had run laps to prepare for the 
academy and borrowed law books from friends 
he wanted to be tops at the academy she said he wanted to 
graduate no 1 in his class 
friends and coworkers raised 10000 for the young man voted 
youth of the year by the pittsfield boys club in 1981 his medical 
bills exceeded 330000 according to mayor anne wojtkowski 
he was a kid with intestinal fortitude who wasnt a quitter 
said james mooney executive director of the boys club he stood 
right up against the training and it killed him he even showed his 
fortitude by clinging to life as long as he did he never gave up 
weve got to straighten out that system so young fellows dont have 
to go through that

published in canada

the 81yearold author agreed to the plans for a shortfiction 
prize during a promotional visit to toronto earlier this week he 
and pierre berton whose popular histories of northern canada 
figured in the research for alaska made a joint appearance 
monday night 
michener was quoted by the star as saying he was caught up by

a conservative politician on 
thursday urged the government to deny political asylum to refugees 
from eastern europe and deport them 
the suggestion by bavarian interior minister edmund stoiber drew 
immediate rebukes from other politicians and added fire to a 
nationwide debate on whether liberal asylum rules should be 
restricted 
stoiber said asylum seekers from countries like poland and 
hungary generally were not politically persecuted and only came 
to west germany in search of jobs 
he said asylum laws should be changed so that economic 
refugees from eastern europe can be sent back at west german borders 
a record influx of people seeking asylum has stretched west 
germanys social services on thursday frankfurt airport opened a 
14 million building to house 200 asylum seekers 
although west germany rarely officially grants asylum to soviet 
bloc refugees they are in most cases allowed to remain in the 
country and usually given internationally accepted travel documents 
we must reconsider this policy toward the east in light of 
political changes there stoiber said referring to soviet 
president mikhail gorbachevs drive for reforms 
he also noted sweden recently announced it will stop giving 
asylum to soviet citizens 
anke fuchs a leading member of the opposition social democrats 
called stoibers statement irresponsible 
there is no place for appeals to lower insticts of many 
people said ulrich irmer a lawmaker of the government coalition 
free democratic party 
the political debate began when a senior social democratic 
official suggested in october that ethnic germans arriving from the 
soviet union and other east european countries should be treated in 
the same way as other asylum seekers 
oskar lafontaine a leftist deputy chairman of the social 
democrats was criticized even by party colleagues 
the west german government has been urging soviet bloc countries 
to allow more ethnic germans to leave for many years the ethnic 
germans automatically receive german citizenship when they arrive 
third world immigrants seeking asylum however often face a long 
and uncertain battle to get residence and work permits 
more than 132400 ethnic germans arrived in the first nine months 
of this year from the soviet union poland and romania the number 
of newly arrived ethnic germans was 51900 at the same time last 
year 
federal officials say they recevied 68285 asylum applications 
from jan 1 to sept 30 more than double the number of 36869 
during the same period last year

the leader of west german jews said thursday a 
dispute over whether he should address parliament on the 50th 
anniversary of a nazi pogrom should not cloud the memorials to its 
victims 
in no way should the somber weight of crystal night be 
overshadowed by partisan bickering and personal selfinterest 
said heinz galinski head of the german jewish council 
galinski made the remarks after a leader of frankfurts jewish 
community accused him of trying every means to address parliament 
the bundestag the lower house of parliament declined to invite 
galinski to address a special nov 10 session marking the 
anniversary of kristallnacht when nazi thugs ransacked jewish 
property and synagogues 
the pogrom got its name meaning crystal night because of the 
shards of glass that littered the streets after the rampage 
opposition greens legislators had called for the bundestag to 
invite galinski but the motion was rejected on procedural grounds 
galinski said thursday he was drawn into the embarrassing 
discussion 
the main kristallnacht anniversary ceremony in west germany will 
be in frankfurt on nov 9 and will be attended by president richard 
von weizsaecker and chancellor helmut kohl 
extensive ceremonies are planned throughout the country to mark

the government imposed a sixhour curfew beginning at 11 pm 
wednesday to counter the strike call which it said was part of a 
plot to disrupt general elections

would try to disrupt normal life thursday as a forerunner to a 
planned attempt to disrupt the presidential and parliamentary 
elections and deny people the right to vote

parliamentary elections are due by august 1989

assassinations

ten rare species of animals including the asian 
elephant and the black gibbon will disappear from china in 40 years 
if the population keeps growing at its current rate the world 
wildlife foundation says 
the foundations report said that because china must concentrate 
on providing food clothes and shelter for its growing population 
it lacks the funds to protect endangered species 
the report quoted by the overseas edition of the official 
peoples daily said other animals facing extinction are the argali 
a wild sheep huanan tiger northeast tiger bactrian camel crest 
ibis black neck crane chinese alligator and globefish 
some of the animals exist outside china 
china is the worlds most populous nation it has 108 billion 
people and the population is expected to be at least 125 billion 
by the end of this century 
the wildlife foundation report noted that many endangered species 
live in isolated areas inhabited mainly by minority nationalities 
who are exempt from the nations strict family planning policies and 
are using more and more natural resources 
some rare animals including the giant panda and the golden 
monkey are caught and killed it said 
chinese experts say there are now fewer than 1000 pandas living 
in the wild in several areas of southwest china the wildlife 
foundation has spent 4 million over the past eight years to help 
the chinese protect pandas 
the report said wild animals have almost been wiped out in

the district of columbia council filed a 
lawsuit against the federal government thursday claiming that a 
congressional order changing a city statute on gay rights is 
unconstitutional 
sen william armstrong rcolo attached an amendment to the 
citys spending bill for the current fiscal year directing the city 
to allow religiously affiliated educational institutions to deny 
certain rights to gay student organizations should the city fail to 
comply with this order all federal and local funds would be frozen 
after dec 31 
we have been placed upon the horns of a dilemma by the 
armstrong amendment the 13 members of the council said in a 
statement noting that each member has sworn to uphold the 
constitution we feel that we would violate this oath if we were 
to adopt the language directed by the armstrong amendment 
the lawsuit was filed in us district court only after city 
officials were unable to persuade armstrong to withdraw the measure 
council chairman david clarke said 
the suit seeks a preliminary injunction against the cutoff of 
district funds while the matter remains in litigation under federal 
law the citys budget must be approved by congress 
the suit claims the amendment violates first amendment 
prohibitions against governmental establishment of religion and 
abridges first amendment protection of free speech and association 
by authorizing discrimination against gay student groups 
the suit also charges that the amendment violates the council 
members right to free speech by requiring them to vote to enact the 
amendment 
never before has congress been so coercive in dealing with a 
state or local government said attorney michael greenberger who 
helped prepare the lawsuit here theyre saying in effect if 
you dont do this one little thing your government is down the 
drain 
sen tom harkin diowa who chairs the senate appropriations 
panel that reviews the citys budget has advocated legal action 
against the federal government 
i would encourage the district government to seek legal redress 
from enforcing the armstrong amendment harkin stated in a 
letter to clarke dated oct 7 in my opinion this provision 
raises legitimate constitutional questions about the rights of 
district of columbia council 
the districts nonvoting house delegate walter fauntroy said 
the lawsuit was the only action available to the city 
the suit is the legitimate exercise of the right of any local 
government within the united states to seek redress through the 
judicial branch when a significant legal question is at stake 
fauntroy said in a prepared statement 
mayor marion barry jr was out of the country and not immediately 
available for comment 
the citys human rights office had found georgetown university 
discriminated against gay groups by not providing them rooms and 
meeting space the roman catholic school agreed earlier this year to 
provide the groups meeting space and access to student funds only 
after two courts had upheld the citys finding 
the university has stated it will abide by the agreement with the 
city despite the congressional action

the general assembly voted overwhelmingly 
thursday to approve a resolution calling for vietnam to withdraw its 
troops from cambodia the 10th straight year it has done so 
us ambassador vernon a walters told the assembly that 
vietnams illegal occupation of cambodia remains the root cause of 
the conflict in cambodia today 
walters said an essential element of any political settlement 
is the removal of khmer rouge leader pol pot and his lieutenants 
who presided over the deaths of 2 million cambodians from 1975 to 
1978 
applause rippled through the hall after the 12219 vote was 
announced there were three abstentions 
vietnamese ambassador trinh xuan lang said the resolution 
continues to distort the realities in kampuchea the cambodian 
capital and does not stress strongly enough that the khmer rouge 
must be barred from power 
chinaa ambassador li luye said the vietnamese authorities 
continue to prolong their gross violation of the sovereignty of 
kampuchea and violation of the rights of its people 
china is the main supplier of the cambodian resistance coalition 
which also receives us aid the soviet union backs vietnam and the 
government it has installed in cambodia 
walters called for internationally supervised free elections by 
the cambodian people 
he also called for an international monitoring and peacekeeping 
force to oversee vietnams troop withdrawal and the disarming of all 
cambodian factions particularly the khmer rouge 
the us envoy said that for the first time in nearly 10 years of 
vietnamese occupation there is reason for cautious optimism 
regarding cambodias future 
he cited vietnams announcement in may that it would withdraw 
50000 of its 130000 troops from cambodia by the end of the year a 
meeting in jakarta indonesia among cambodian factions the 
vietnamese and southeast asian nations and talks between chinese 
and soviet vice foreign ministers in beijing in late august 
but walters said that there have been few concrete signs of a 
major movement of vietnamese forces out of cambodia 
the resolution sponsored by the association of southeast asian 
nations calls for international supervision to make sure there is no 
return to the universally condemned policies of a recent past 
cambodias seat in the 159member general assembly is shared by 
an antivietnam resistance coalition that includes the khmer rouge 
now led by khieu samphan 
the other members of the resistance coalition are noncommunist 
forces led by former cambodian head of state prince norodom 
sihanouk and followers of former prime minister son sanns khmer 
peoples national liberation front 
son sann said wednesday the cambodian government should dissolve 
and merge with the three resistance partners in a transitional 
government 
he said the vietnamese have been using genocidal tactics such 
as moving peasants from their villages and using them to clear 
minefields near the border he said 70 percent of them contracted 
malaria

much of the soviet unions state archives the 
repository for memories long denied to the soviet people remain 
closed to scholars even during this era of glasnost says the man 
who trains the nations historians 
the process of democratization and accessibility of the 
archives is going very slowly much more slowly than any of us 
want said yuri n afanasyev director of moscows state 
historical archives institute since 1986 and a confidant of 
president mikhail s gorbachev 
afanasyev whose institute has 270 professors and 4500 students 
also said in an interview that key documents including the 
stalinhitler pact that helped spark world war ii have disappeared 
from the national archives 
i dont know for a fact that the stalin archives havent been 
destroyed i do know that some very important documents have 
disappeared he said 
for instance the hitlerstalin pact and the secret protocols 
that go with it have vanished theyre simply not in the soviet 
archives afanasyev said he was referring to the 1939 
nonaggression accord that freed nazi germany to invade poland and 
led to the soviet seizure of polish territory and the takeover of 
the baltic republics of estonia latvia and lithuania 
the soviet union has traditionally denied the existence of the 
pacts protocols because they would raise embarrassing questions 
about the historical basis for eastern european boundaries the 
soviets however have recently suggested the original protocols and 
maps copies of which were discovered in nazi archives and published 
in the west might have been lost 
for many soviets the first opportunity to learn the details of 
the pact came in an article in sovietskaya rossiya one of the 
soviet unions largest newspapers in august following widespread 
independence demonstrations in the baltic republics 
the 54yearold afanasyev a vocal advocate of glasnost or 
selective openness was asked about other state papers covering 
stalins conduct of the war the great terror of the 1930s the 
collectivization of agriculture and the famine and purges that 
killed millions 
there is no basis for assuming that the archives are untouched 
and undamaged after all a regime that murdered millions of people 
certainly wouldnt hesitate to destroy a piece of paper said 
afanasyev a member of the communist party since 1961 
afanasyev did not say when he believed the documents had 
disappeared asked about the possibility of archives being shredded 
nowadays he said it would be very difficult and that he knew 
of nothing to sound an alarm about 
i am the victim along with all other historians i stand with 
those who suffer from the hardship of lack of access said 
afanasyev who has kept a high profile by writing unprecedented 
critical items in the mainstream soviet press 
in a muchdiscussed letter to the editor in pravda this summer 
he questioned some of the fundamental notions in the current system 
of soviet socialism he also has pushed for the rehabilitation of 
soviet nonpersons such as leon trotsky 
afanasyev also is a proponent of perestroika the restructuring 
of soviet society which has included efforts to discredit the 
stalinist regime and many aspects of its brutally imposed command 
economy 
the trouble is that in archives as in many other things in the 
soviet union the dominant theme seems to be uncertainty and 
vagueness said afanasyev 
you cant talk about perestroika until we know what we want to 
restructure we have to have an exhaustive complete picture of what 
the reality is said afanasyev 
for the moment archives are mostly inaccessible i mean the 
interesting parts afanasyev some of those interesting parts he 
added are accessible only in the united states 
the interview with afansyev who also is a specialist in french 
history was conducted partly in russian with the help of an 
american translator and partly in french 
afanasyev traveled to about a dozen us universities last month 
to discuss expanding their exchange programs with his institute

doctors will give free heroin to a 
group of drug addicts in an experiment to prevent the spread of 
aids the national health and medical research council said thursday 
the council has approved the trial provision of prescription 
heroin in singleuse syringes for a number of carefully selected 
intravenous drug users said tony basten chairman of the councils 
liaison committee on acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
the experiment will begin next year 
basten said australia had two years at the most to stop aids 
spreading from intravenous drug users and their sexual partners to 
the community at large 
the studys results are expected to help decide whether australia 
should move toward fighting aids by permitting legal prescription of 
limited amounts of drugs 
if we get it wrong then we are going to be like new york city 
where 85 percent of intravenous drug users are infected basten 
said 
he estimated 1 percent to 3 percent of intravenous drug users in 
centers like sydney were infected with aids he said recreational 
users posed the greatest threat as unlike addicts they were 
difficult to reach with educational messages 
the details of the study had not been decided but would be 
finalized as a matter of urgency he said 
australia has reported more than 1000 aids victims half of whom 
have died

the soviets have fired ss1 scud missiles on 
afghan rebels in an escalation of the war in afghanistan the state 
department said thursday 
the attack involving six to eight missiles was carried out in 
the nangaraq region near the border with pakistan spokesman charles 
e redman said he gave no estimate of the damage or of casualties 
repeating an earlier warning redman said if the introduction 
of this weaponry is an attempt to intimidate pakistan then moscow 
should know that pakistan enjoys our full support the use of this 
weapon represents a further escalation in the level of violence 
the spokesman said us diplomats in moscow had registered their 
concern at the soviet foreign ministry and deputy secretary of state 
john c whitehead complained wednesday to soviet ambassador yuri v 
dubinin 
the arrival of new soviet missiles in kabul had raised us 
concern about pakistans security and whether there would be a delay 
in the second stage of the red armys withdrawal from afghanistan 
the ss1 scud rockets were displayed in the afghan capital after 
undersecretary of state michael h armacost complained to dubinin on 
monday about sending longrange tu26 backfire bombers into combat 
there for the first time 
the soviets are backing the afghan government against usarmed 
rebels in a war that has raged for nearly nine years on aug 15 
the soviets completed the pullout of more than half the 100000 
troops that had fought alongside the promoscow government 
the remaining troops must depart by feb 15 under an agreement 
signed in geneva last spring the soviets hinted recently that the 
second stage would begin nov 15 but a us official said earlier 
this week that it might be delayed 
the official who demanded anonymity also said the united states 
would ensure that the rebels had an adequate arsenal although 
missiles to match the scuds probably would not be provided through 
pakistan 
two scudb missiles which have a range of about 175 miles were 
displayed in kabul on tuesday it was not clear how many of the 
mobile weapon the soviets had shipped to afghanistan 
us weapons to the guerrillas are delivered through pakistan 
which also has given sanctuary to millions of afghan refugees 
the afghan news agency in a dispatch tuesday accused pakistan 
of instigating attacks by extremist guerrillas on population 
centers and demilitarized areas this is why a new kind of weapon 
mainly longrange missiles with a great destructive power was 
adopted for service by the afghan army the afghan general staff 
said 
the missiles will be used to stop the criminal activities of 
the extremist group the dispatch added without referring 
specifically to the scudb 
gennady gerasimov the spokesman for the soviet foreign ministry 
said at a news conference last month in new york that pakistans 
support for the rebels could have unpredictable consequences 
we dont want to be specific he said but he left open the 
possibility that the withdrawal of soviet troops might be suspended 
redman said thursday that the use of new aircraft and scud 
missiles is not consistent with soviet assurances that they would 
not undertake offensive operations during the withdrawal period 
except in defense of their own forces 
he said the introduction of new weapons into the war does not 
contribute to the political solution the soviets had promised to 
pursue he said the missiles were fired from kabul on tuesday and 
wednesday

george bush rejected allegations of 
racial overtones in his campaign as grossly unfair and untrue 
thursday while looking beyond the election to appeal for a closing 
of political wounds 
bush also suggested he could balance the federal budget by 1992 
while resisting tax raises and increasing federal spending by 100 
billion over five years 
in an interview on nbcs today program and in campaign 
appearances bush spoke of a need for national unity after the 
election 
i think the country will come together immediately behind 
whoever wins this election he told nbc in a 25minute interview 
from columbus ohio 
i would work my level best if im elected to heal any wounds 
that might be there 
and he later told a downtown crowd of several thousand in 
columbus this country will be together once this election is 
over 
but that didnt stop bush from continuing a stinging assault on 
democrat michael dukakis as he campaigned through delegaterich 
industrial states in the midwest in the closing days of the race 
the liberals look at your paychecks the way colonel sanders 
looks at chicken bush said referring to the fastfoot chicken 
franchise chain 
he told a jammed rally in a woodenroofed high school field house 
in this southwest chicago suburb that dukakis was outside the 
mainstream 
the rally was attended by about 3000 persons most of them 
students because of poor acoustics many of bushs words were 
difficult to hear 
in the today interview bush rejected democatic suggestions 
of racism in his campaigns repeated mention of willie horton a 
black murder convict who attacked a white maryland couple after 
failing to return from a weekend furlough from a massachusetts 
prison 
i dont have an ounce of bigotry in my body nor does my running 
mate sen dan quayle of indiana bush said 
to go out and try to accuse me of something that is not in my 
heart this charge of racism is grossly unfair and untrue and 
everybody that knows me knows its untrue bush said 
he called attacks on quayle a lot of smoke and frenzying of 
bluefish out there going after a drop of blood in the water 
bush also defended quayle indirectly at the rally in columbus 
saying no one on the republican side is running away from any 
other candidate we are one ticket representing the mainstream 
traveling with bush on thursdays campaign stops was actorbody 
builder arnold schwarzeneger who told audiences my movies are 
just fiction i only played the terminator in the movies but when 
it comes to the american future michael dukakis would be the real 
terminator 
the race in illinois with 24 electoral votes is considered a 
tossup while polls show bush ahead in ohio 
the vice president was also to attend a rally later thursday in 
hackensack nj he planned campaign stops on friday in connecticut 
and ohio 
in the tv interview bush defended anew his proposal for a 
flexible freeze as a way of eliminating the nations federal 
budget deficit by 199192 
the proposal calls for holding increases in spending to the level 
of inflation 
bushs proposal assumes economic growth of about 3 percent a year 
and a reduction of interest rates by at least 2 percentage points 
you can grow by 100 billion in spending over the next five 
years and if my economic model is correct still get the deficit 
down bush said many economists have challenged bushs contention 
that the budget could be balanced without some form of tax increase 
i am challenging the conventional wisdom that you need to go 
raise taxes bush said he said he would reject a tax increase 
even if one was proposed by a blueribbon bipartisan commission now 
studying the deficit

experts from iran and iraq met for the first time 
thursday to discuss technical details of the unmediated gulf 
peace talks a development un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar called a good sign 
the meeting included experts from the two countries and the 
united nations said un spokeswoman therese gastaut she refused 
to say what type experts 
absent were iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati his 
iraqi counterpart tariq aziz and perez de cuellar who has been 
mediating 
jan eliasson the un special representative to the talks 
refused to disclose details of the 2hour meeting 
we have today entered into detail into certain important 
matters this is progress that you enter into detailed 
discussions said eliasson 
a member of the iranian team sirous nasseri who is irans 
ambassador to geneva said the two sides discussed withdrawal to 
internationally recognized boundaries and the question of freedom of 
navigation 
eliasson said the talks would continue friday with perez de 
cuellar meeting separately with velayati and aziz 
asked if this represented a departure from perez de cuellars 
announcement tuesday that future meetings would be facetoface 
eliasson replied i think it should be seen as an advantage that 
one has both possibilities both separate meetings and plenaries 
and we certainly envisage the possibility of continued plenary 
meetings 
there is simply a need to discuss matters directly with the 
ministers sometimes he said but he refused to elaborate 
the talks are aimed at implementing a un security council 
resolution calling for a ceasefire in the 8yearold war a fragile 
truce has been in effect since aug 20 
reporters asked perez de cuellar whether it was a bad sign that 
the experts were meeting without the ministers no its a good 
sign he said 
also thursday iran charged iraq was using humanitarian issues to 
delay withdrawing from iranian territory 
velayati speaking after a meeting with officials of the 
international committee of the red cross was answering an iraqi 
charge that iran was delaying the repatriation of prisoners of war 
on both sides estimated by the united nations to number at least 
100000 
velayati reiterated that pow repatriation must come under the 
terms of the un ceasefire arrangement 
he renewed irans offer to release immediately all sick and 
wounded prisoners as well as civilian detainees on a reciprocal 
basis 
iraq proposed last month that the two sides immediately begin a 
pow exchange independent of the un talks 
in a separate development a new un report expresses concern 
about reports of a renewed wave of executions in iran just 
before and immediately after tehran accepted the ceasefire 
the report to the general assembly calls for continued un 
scrutiny of irans alleged execution of political dissenters and 
other reported abuses

the us customs service fined eastern airlines 1 
million thursday for allowing 68 pounds of cocaine to be shipped on 
one of its flights but agreed not to seize the plane involved 
the cocaine was discovered monday aboard flight 972 from colombia 
hidden in an unmanifested box of ground coffee in the baggage 
compartment said customs spokesman cliff stallings 
no arrests have been made 
customs levied a fine of 1000 per ounce of the illegal drug or 
just over 1 million stallings said 
the cocaine shipment was the second found aboard an eastern 
flight from colombia in as many weeks but in this case eastern can 
keep the plane unless it balks at paying the fine stallings said 
customs at the present time is not seizing the 727 since 
eastern appears to be making serious efforts to improve its security 
measures against drug smuggling stallings said 
the improvements include a council to work with customs on 
security he said 
eastern spokesmen did immediately return calls seeking comment 
last week customs seized an eastern l1011 and fined the company 
896000 after 56 pounds of cocaine were found in an unmanifested 
mail bag the plane was released after eastern posted a bond for the 
value of the fine

avtex fibers inc officials met with 
defense contractors thursday as the company shut down its plant 
here threatening the supply of a rayon fiber crucial to nasas 
space shuttle and leaving 1300 workers without a job 
john n gregg avtex chairman was in utah to meet with officials 
of the morton thiokol inc aerospace group which manufactures the 
shuttles rocket boosters as well as other defense contractors 
said rocky rabb a morton thiokol spokesman at the companys ogden 
utah headquarters 
he said the meeting in salt lake city involves many of the 
companies and users there were about 14 different companies 
invited 
raab said he did not believe representatives of the national 
aeronautics and space administration were at the session 
avtex announced the closing of the worlds largest rayon factory 
on monday blaming foreign competition and environmental 
regulations avtex was the governments sole sanctioned supplier of 
rayon 
the rayon fiber produced by the front royal plant goes through 
several layers of contractors before it is formed into the engine 
nozzles of the shuttle and a variety of tactical missiles nasa has 
said it has enough of the material in the supply line for the next 
10 shuttle flights 
raab said enough fiber was available through february for morton 
thiokols standard missile morton thiokol is working with hercules 
inc on the submarinelaunched trident d5 missile and enough fiber 
is available for production to continue through mid1989 raab said 
fiber supplies are adequate for air force deployment and testing 
plans on the peacekeeper intercontinental ballistic missile raab 
said 
officials in this northern shenandoah valley town of 11000 said 
the community would survive the loss of 1300 jobs at the 
manufacturing plant because its economy has evolved dramatically 
from the days when it was a onecompany town 
but workers said the plant closing came as a shock 
about the only thing they told us was to come down and get 
unemployment benefits said billy fields 42 whose 16year career 
at avtex came to an abrupt end this week my last shift was 
tuesday evening right now im just going to file for 
unemployment 
i think they should have given us more of a notice said 
fields wife diane who worked eight years for avtex which is 
based in valley forge pa i didnt know anything about it until 
my husband came home and told me about it 
town manager brackenridge bentley said he believes front royal 
will prosper as a combination of a factory town if several plants 
employing 200 to 300 people can be lured in and as a bedroom 
community for the thriving washington dc metro area about an 
hours drive to the east 
front royal began diversifying seven years ago when a du pont 
plant opened employing 350 people it is already becoming a bedroom 
community with some 600 to 700 singlefamily homes under 
construction 
bentley and other area officials also hope any new industry they 
attract will be cleaner than avtex which had a history of 
environmental and safety problems the company was hit wednesday by 
a 20 million lawsuit in which virginia attorney general mary sue 
terry alleges a host of environmental problems were caused by the 
plant 
bentley said area employers already are advertising for displaced 
avtex workers though the new jobs will likely pay lower wages 
involve a longer commute and offer fewer benefits 
an avtex spokesman in washington said production at the plant 
ended thursday but an undetermined number of employees would stay 
on to shut down the plant

the pending soviet legal reforms should include 
clear guarantees of human rights andrei sakharov says in a magazine 
article to appear friday 
sakharov who was released from internal exile just two years ago 
for his own support of human rights writes in the soviet magazine 
new times the new criminal code should clearly state that criminal 
prosecutions for beliefs and nonviolent actions stemming from them 
are intolerable 
the official tass news agency reported on the article in a 
dispatch thursday 
soviet officials have been quoted in recent days as saying the 
draft legal reform will eliminate at least one of the laws now used 
to prosecute political prisoners 
sakharov also said the new laws should be in keeping with 
international norms an apparent reference to the human rights 
agreements signed by the soviet union that western countries say it 
has ignored these include the helsinki agreements and a united 
nations covenant 
the scientist who won a nobel peace price for his efforts on 
behalf of soviet human rights further argues that the lawgoverned 
state promised by president mikhail s gorbachev should mean that 
everyone is subordinate to the law tass said 
that is a clear objection to a provision of both current soviet 
law and a draft reform that grants immunity from prosecution to 
members of the soviet parliament 
a lawgoverned state means first of all the primacy of law all 
hierarchy all government bodies all persons no matter what high 
posts they may hold are equal to all citizens before the law 
tass quoted sakharov as saying 
the news agency report also says sakharov touched upon freedom of 
assembly freedom in choosing ones country of residence and 
citizens rights to monitor state decisions

scientists believe they are finally beginning 
to unravel the marvel of natural chemistry by which the human brain 
stores and recalls its trove of facts and sensations 
whether the agony of childhood piano lessons the warming smell 
of moms apple pie or mundane essentials like phone numbers and zip 
codes they all trigger chemical changes in brain cells called 
neurons as the mind absorbs new information or stimulation research 
has shown 
and experiments have also demonstrated differences in blood flow 
and chemistry between healthy brains and those affected by disease 
or drugs or genetic disorders 
but precisely how the experiences and knowledge of a lifetime are 
stored for instant recall among the billions and billions of brain 
cells and how that process is disrupted by disease or drugs are 
questions only now beginning to yield to research 
why do some people learn more quickly than others why are some 
talented in music or in math or in the ability to hit a baseball 
thrown at 95 miles an hour while others are not what is the 
cellular difference between smart and dumb how does drug 
addiction affect the brain 
these are among the hundreds of mysteries that scientists in 
laboratories all over the world are struggling to answer said 
daniel l alkon of the laboratory of molecular and cellular 
neurobiology at the national institutes of medicine 
there is still much about learning and memory and how it works 
that we simply dont understand said alkon there are a lot of 
different views in the field and we are not always in agreement 
alkon was one a series of experts who spoke at a seminar 
sponsored by science the journal of the american association for 
the advancement of science in connection with a special issue of 
the magazine released on friday 
in his laboratory alkon has used snails and rabbits to 
demonstrate some of the chemical changes in a portion of the brain 
called the hippocampus 
he said the studies shows that certain stimulations can trigger 
the discharge of a protein called ckinase in a specific portion of 
neurons hippocampus cells shaped vaguely like a tree 
the chemical change was demonstrated said alkon using a pacific 
sea snail called the hermissenda in a laboratory a snail was 
stimulated by first light and then rotation at first the snail 
reacted by drawing up only when his cage was rotated but 
eventually the snail associated the light with the rotation and 
would react to the light alone 
other snails received the same stimulation but in a different 
pattern they did not associate the light with the rotation 
an analysis of the neurons in the brain of the first snail said 
alkon showed that ckinase was deposited in the branches of the 
cell in snails that were not taught to react to the light he said 
there was no change in the ckinase deposition 
experiments with rabbits using lights and puffs of air produced 
a similar finding alkon said 
it is believed he said that the ckinase also causes the 
branches of the neuron cell to narrow perhaps a sign of a stored 
memory 
it is clear that ckinase activation can elicit longlasting 
changes in a cell and may play a role in the creation of a 
memory alkon said 
another speaker michael kuhar a researcher at the national 
institute on drug addiction said that scientists have discovered 
how cocaine affects the brain and why it is the most addictive drug 
known 
kuhar said that cocaine acts in the limbic section of the brain 
the portion that is associated with emotions and the sense of 
pleasure 
the brain acts to give a feeling of pleasure or well being when a 
neurotransmitter protein called dopamine moves across a synapse 
which is a gap between two neurons the dopamine is released on one 
side of the synapse leaps to the receptor side and delivers an 
impulse the dopamine is then released by the receptor and returns 
to its original side of the synapse this release ends the reaction 
kuhar said studies have shown that cocaine attaches itself to the 
receptor side of the synapse and blocks the return of dopamine 
causing the reaction which is a sense of pleasure to continue 
until the cocaine is metabolized 
the action initially he said is a great rush because the 
dopamine causes the impulse in the synapse to keep firing time 
after time 
the pleasure pathways are hyperstimulated kuhar said 
but when the cocaine actions halts there is a shortage of 
dopamine and the user experiences a steep letdown and a strong 
impulse to use more of the drug to restimulate the pleasure 
pathways thus the cellular basis for a cycle of addiction is 
reinforced 
cocaine is the most powerful reinforcer known said kuhar 
he said crack cocaine which is smoked or injected delivers more 
of the drug to the synapse and gives a much quicker and more 
intensive rush but afterward there is also a quicker and 
steeper letdown and a greater impulse for reuse

a man who spent 10 years in prison for a fatal 
supermarket fire was released thursday when a lawyer working for 
free after he became convinced of the mans innocence persuaded a 
judge to set aside the verdict 
eric jackson 31 gasped and then smiled when state supreme court 
justice joseph slavin granted him a new trial on arson and murder 
charges in the deaths of six firefighters 
our prayers have been answered justice is for real said his 
brother phillip moore 
jacksons five children and stepchildren ages 5 to 16 also were 
in the courtroom his eldest son cried 
slavin said he decided to set aside the verdict after reviewing 
boxes of documents from the district attorneys office and 
discovered a memo that may have helped clear jackson and which was 
not turned over to the defense during his first trial 
hes been in jail for pretty much 10 years in my opinion he 
has a very good chance of not being convicted at a new trial the 
judge said 
assistant district attorney michael gore said he would appeal the 
ruling 
jackson was sentenced to 158 years in prison after being 
convicted of arson and six counts of murder in connection with the 
fire aug 2 1978 at a waldbaums supermarket in brooklyn 
six firefighters fell to their deaths in the burning supermarket 
when the roof collapsed 
jacksons attorney robert sullivan had helped represent widows 
of the firefighters in civil suits he said he decided to represent 
jackson without pay after discovering information in the civil cases 
that pointed to his innocence 
when i read all the evidence i found that the district 
attorney had held back evidence two that the fire was accidental 
and not an arson and three that jackson had been railroaded 
sullivan said 
the march 1979 memo cited by slavin written by an assistant 
district attorney michael gary to another assistant said that a 
fire marshal told investigators that there were four separate fires 
that day at the supermarket and that the fourth fire was the one 
that caused the roof to collapse the memo said 
according to sullivan he has evidence from a police investigator 
that the fourth fire actually was an electrical fire not an arson 
fire 
sullivan also cast doubt on a confession presented by the 
prosecution at the first trial 
he said jackson had denied any involvement in the supermarket 
fire but did tell investigators that he set a fire in 1976 at 
another brooklyn store no one was hurt in that fire 
slavin who released jackson on his own recognizance scheduled 
pretrial proceedings dec 12

part of the landing gear on a twa airliner was 
replaced by inadequately trained mechanics hours before the gear 
jammed forcing an unscheduled stop at scott air force base in 
illinois a government report said thursday 
however the report by a national transportation safety board 
investigator did not blame either trans world airlines or any 
individuals for the aug 22 1987 mishap that left three people 
with minor injuries 
this report is just a finding of fact ntsb spokeswoman 
drucella andersen said we have yet to issue a report which will 
determine the probable cause of the accident 
twa spokesman bob blattner in st louis said company officials 
had no immediate comment on the investigators report 
the boeing 767 with 181 people on board was en route from san 
francisco to st louis international airport when its flight crew 
discovered the right main landing gear would not lower into place 
after attempts to dislodge the gear including a dipping maneuver 
intended to shake it loose the pilot decided to avoid the crowded 
st louis airport and land at the base a few miles across the 
mississippi river near belleville ill 
the plane landed safely on two of its three landing gears and 
skidded down the runway with its right engine touching the ground 
one passenger sprained an ankle while being evacuated using 
emergency slides and two others were treated for other minor 
injuries the ntsb said 
according to the investigators report twa maintenance workers 
at san francisco had replaced a tire and the brake assembly on the 
failed landing gear early on the morning the airplane left for st 
louis 
the examination of the right main landing gear after the 
gearup landing revealed the brake rod separated from the brake 
torque arm and had jammed over the top of the gear door pad 
the report said 
it said the workers who replaced the wheel and brake both 
experienced aircraft mechanics licensed by the federal aviation 
administration told the ntsb they complied with the procedure 
outlined in the maintenance manual for boeing 767 aircraft 
however company training records showed that neither mechanic 
had been trained or instructed as to the differences in procedures 
of changing the wheelbrake assembly on the boeing 767 and other 
boeing airplanes the report said

agriculture secretary richard e lyng said 
thursday that he will go to europe later this month for one last 
series of meetings on trade problems with the european economic 
community 
lyng who said he will leave the secretarys position jan 20 
with the outgoing reagan administration will be in brussels around 
midnovember with us trade representative clayton yeutter and 
chief us agricultural trade negotiator daniel amstutz no firm 
dates have been set however 
international trade particularly involving the eec and japan 
has been at the top of lyngs list of priorities all long he said 
in an interview and that includes negotiations under the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade 
lyng said the difficult parts of gatt negotiations relate to 
the attitudes and problems with japan particularly on rice and 
the eec primarily concerning its common agricultural policy high 
support prices and export subsidies 
one of the most immediate and pressing problems lyng hopes to 
address in his talks with eec officials is the 12nation blocs 
determination to ban imports of meat containing traces of 
growthpromoting hormones beginning jan 1 1989 
theyre insisting theyre going to implement that ban on jan 
1 lyng said that would be a very serious problem for us 
us livestock interests have estimated an eec ban would cost 
130 million a year in lost trade 
the meat industry trade policy council which includes a number 
of farm business and commodity organizations has asked the reagan 
administration to use authority under the new trade law to cut off 
meat imports from the eec if the jan 1 ban goes into effect 
lyng said also he and yeutter along with other us trade 
officials will attend the special meeting of the 96 member 
countries of gatt which will begin dec 5 in montreal canada 
after the next administration takes over on jan 20 lyng 70 
said he plans to take it easy 
we have no plans to move from the washington area but we 
havent made a commitment to stay where we are he said have no 
plans whatsoever 
what about starting up again in the consulting business which 
lyng was in just before he became secretary in march 1986 
no plans for that either he said although there may be some 
special parttime jobs that come up from time to time 
i really want to take life at a much slower pace lyng said

eleven senators following similar action by 90 
house members called thursday for cincinnati financier carl lindner 
to upgrade worker safety at the john morrell amp co meatpacking plant 
in sioux falls sd 
if the guarantee of safe working conditions for any morrell 
worker is denied the conditions for all of our nations meatpacking 
workers are threatened the senators letter to lindner said 
it was mailed one day after 90 house members sent a similar 
request concerning morrell the nations fifth largest meatpacker 
which last week was fined 43 million for conditions at the plant 
it was the largest fine against a single employer in the 17year 
history of the occupational safety and health administration 
lawmakers asked lindner chairman of cincinnatibased american 
financial corp which owns morrell to take a more active safety 
role at the plant which has been the target of a union safety 
campaign for more than a year 
calls to lindners office were referred to morrell chairman 
milton schloss who said in a telephone interview from american 
financial offices that this is a john morrell matter and im the 
one in charge of john morrell and know the most about it 
schloss said lindner has taken a highly active role through me 
and has been kept informed completely through me 
all the details of what we have done have been given to osha 
and completely ignored period so i dont know what else i could 
do he said 
some of those congressmen have gotten a letter from me

the stepchildren who kept the fate of andrei 
d sakharov known to the world during his years of internal exile in 
the soviet union are scrambling to prepare for his first visit to 
the west 
sakharov is expected to arrive in boston on sunday for a twoweek 
trip to receive medical treatment meet a granddaughter born here 
and promote the international foundation for the survival and 
development of humanity 
the 67yearold nobel laureate is a member of the board of 
directors of the foundation formed in january by soviet and 
american scientists and educators to foster arms control 
environmental protection international development and human rights 
sakharov is expected to travel without his wife yelena bonner 
but he will start the trip by visiting two of her children who live 
in boston suburbs 
we have started to prepare food for him but we dont know 
exactly what hell want mrs bonners soninlaw efrem 
yankelevich said thursday theres a lot to be done especially 
preparing his schedule 
yankelevich said sakharov will go to massachusetts general 
hospital for a cardiological examination and possible implantation 
of a heart pacemaker a procedure that usually requires a twoday 
hospital stay 
from boston he plans to travel to new york and washington but 
the dates of his visits to those cities remain uncertain relatives 
said 
yankelevich said sakharov hopes to be in washington on nov 15 
when the soviet physicist is expected to receive the 50000 albert 
einstein foundation peace prize for 1988 
but the personal highlight of the trip yankelevich said 
probably will be sakharovs first meeting with alexandra semyonova 
the 4yearold daughter of stepson alexei semyonov and his wife 
elizaveta alekseyeva 
sakharov went on hunger strikes to win permission from soviet 
authorities for his wife to come to the united states for medical 
care and for miss alekseyeva to come here to marry semyonov 
for his defense of human rights in the soviet union sakharov 
received the 1975 nobel peace prize five years later in january 
1980 he was banished to gorky a city closed to westerners 
his wife also was banished there in august 1984 both were 
released in december 1986 by soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 
sakharov is expected to be accompanied during part of his visit 
by yevgenii velikhov vice president of the soviet academy of 
sciences and roald sagdeev director of the soviet space research 
institute 
velikhov is chairman of the international foundation for the 
survival and development of humanity which is headquartered in 
moscow and has offices in washington and stockholm sweden sagdeev

the national aeronautics and space 
administration confronting a critical shortage of a key material 
for the second time this year is planning a partbypart study of 
shuttle supplies to spot such troubles in advance 
nasa was taken by surprise this week when the company that makes 
the rayon yarn used in space shuttle rocket nozzles announced it was 
closing its plant in virginia the avtex fibers facility is the only 
one in the country producing the yarn 
nasa faced a similar crisis in may when the henderson nev 
plant of pacific engineering and production co was destroyed in an 
explosion and fire the plant was one of only two producing ammonium 
perchlorate the oxidizer in the solid fuel that powers the 
shuttles booster rockets 
no one at nasa headquarters or at the agencys marshall space 
flight center in huntsville ala would say thursday how many other 
materials used for shuttle flights have only a single supplier 
however sources who declined to be identified said shuttle 
program boss richard truly was concerned enough to order a thorough 
study to identify other critical parts with only one supplier 
rockwell international corp builds the shuttle at its palmdale 
calif plant but depends on more than 250 subcontractors for 
various systems and components 
the presidential commission that investigated the challenger 
disaster criticized the space agency for not having enough spares on 
hand which fostered a practice of borrowing parts from one shuttle 
for use on another 
that problem has not been completely solved after the flight of 
discovery last month engineers found evidence of a leak in one 
engine they had to borrow an engine from shuttle columbia to 
prepare discovery for its next mission 
the impact of the fuel and nozzle problems wont be felt for more 
than a year an allocation board that included the defense 
department nasa and other government agencies met recently to 
divide up ammonium perchlorate production 
we have been allocated sufficient quantities for nine flight 
sets said rocky raab spokesman for morton thiokol in utah the 
allocation board meets again in early 1989 to make additional 
allocations so presuming pepcon pacific engineering gets the 
plant going again in early or mid1989 that would mitigate that 
situation 
only the latenovember flight of atlantis remains this year and 
there are seven more missions scheduled for 1989 
the ammonium perchlorate manufacturer is rebuilding its plant in 
henderson and has broken ground for a new facility for finishing 
work in cedar city utah presuming everything goes as planned 
our concerns about the fuel are minimized raab said 
it is too soon to know what will be done about avtex which began 
closing its plant at front royal va on thursday and letting its 
1300 employees go production for all intents and purposes is 
stopping today said avtex spokesman nick nichols people will 
be working for the next couple of days to shut it down and secure 
it 
morton thiokol nasa the pentagon and other contractors were 
talking with avtex in hopes of finding a solution to the shutdown 
raab said thiokol had enough material for 10 flight sets 
its a possibility that rayon might be available elsewhere but 
it has to be a qualified source he said rayon is the root stock 
for what ends up as carbon phenolic a fireproof material that lines 
the inside of the booster nozzle the same cloth is used to make 
nozzles for mx missiles small intercontinental missiles and the 
trident ii system 
you cant force somebody to manufacture some product raab 
said

a woman trying to move a revolver out of the 
reach of her three young children shot and killed her 7yearold 
daughter police said 
rochell porter was shot once in the left cheek with a 25caliber 
pistol wednesday she died at brackenridge hospital shortly 
afterward 
travis county medical examiner robert bayardo on thursday ruled 
the death a homicide 
homicide merely means that a persons life has been taken by 
another bayardo saidbut this was very reckless the girl was 
shot at very close range 
the ruling he said indicates a higher degree than just 
accidental death 
the pistol was on a table when the girls mother ulene porter 
37 was getting rochell and her 9yearold sister ready for school 
said sgt don bredl a 2yearold girl also was at home when the 
shooting occurred he said 
police spokesman cf adams said ms porter told investigators 
one of the girls moved an ashtray that nudged the gun prompting her 
to take the pistol away she told officers she was turning around 
with the gun in her hand when it fired once 
her mothers just very crushed understandably so adams 
said she had a handgun because of problems shes had in the past 
with burglars and prowlers and the like 
two burglaries and eight domestic disturbances had been reported 
to police from an apartment where the woman lived until recently 
police plan to forward the results of their investigation to the 
travis county district attorney 
the facts details remain the same adams said were not 
going to go out and arrest the woman

alcoholics with acute liver disease should 
not be required to stop drinking to become eligible for liver 
transplants because they are as likely to benefit from the 
procedure as anyone else researchers said 
to the extent that objections to liver transplantation are 
moralistic these undermine the modern understanding of alcoholism 
including the recognition that this is a treatable disease not a 
vice the researchers said in a report in fridays journal of the 
american medical association 
researchers at the university of pittsburgh and veterans 
administration medical center in pittsburgh reviewed cases of 56 
patients with alcoholic cirrhosis who received liver transplants in 
pittsburgh and denver from 1963 to june 1987 thirtyfive of the 
patients survived six months or longer 
in general 70 percent of patients with other forms of liver 
disease who receive a transplant survive at least one year 
alcoholic cirrhosis occurs when a persons liver no longer can 
remove toxic substances such as alcohol from the blood about 20 
percent of chronic alcoholics suffer from this disease 
although only a small number of alcoholics would qualify for 
liver transplants because of other ailments those who do qualify 
stand a good chance of surviving the researchers said 
since 1980 the results with alcoholic patients have been as 
good as in adult patients with a broad spectrum of other liver 
diseases they said in fact the results have been better than 
with diseases that can recur in the transplanted liver such as 
type b hepatitis cancerous liver tumors or buddchiari syndrome 
in which the livers blood vessels are malformed 
the researchers led by dr thomas starzl of the university of 
pittsburgh said criticism over treating alcoholic cirrhosis with 
liver transplants is based on the mistaken view that alcoholism is a 
moral failure the authors said they wanted to compare the merit of 
liver transplants against the criticism 
the authors said no patient was required to stop drinking to 
receive a liver transplant they argue that such a waiting period 
would be medically unsound or even inhumane as it would allow the 
patients medical condition to deteriorate and reduce the patients 
chances of survival 
in one such case described in a commentary written by three 
researchers from the national council on alcoholism and published in 
the journal in march a young alcoholic man was twice denied 
medicaid funding for a liver transplant despite being sober for six 
months 
the decisions were based on a michigan department of social 
service requirement mandating a twoyear period of abstinence before 
transplantation the decision was challenged in court and 
overturned but the young man died before the transplant could be 
arranged 
of 41 pittsburgh alcoholics in the study 34 patients had stopped 
drinking before they were admitted to the hospital seven continued 
drinking until admission to the hospital three of those died and 
four were alive after 22 to 26 months 
all but two of the 56 alcoholics who received new livers no 
longer drank after the operation the researchers said noting that 
the two appeared to resent what had been done while they were in a 
coma or mentally incompetent one was from the denver group the 
other from the pittsburgh patients 
wanda bond of the united network for organ sharing which runs 
the federal organ procurement and transplantation network said 
1159 livers were transplanted last year 
very few hospitals require alcoholics to stop drinking in order 
to become eligible for liver transplants said thelma thiel a 
spokeswoman for the american liver foundation 
but she said the foundation has expressed concerns about the lack 
of a required period of abstinence prior to receiving a donated 
liver because of the fear that the alcoholics would continue 
drinking and damage their transplanted livers she said researchers 
must continue investigating the successful use of transplants to 
treat alcoholic cirrhosis 
dr allan wolkoff a researcher specializing in liver function 
and a professor of medicine at the albert einstein college of 
medicine said previous consensus statements issued by the national 
institutes of health have mentioned concerns about the use of liver 
transplants as a form of treatment for alcoholic cirrhosis without 
requiring abstinence 
the illness side effects bleeding salt retention and blood 
pressure problems can increase the risks of surgery and lower the 
life expectancy of a transplant recipient he said 
wolkoff said the potentially important pittsburgh study could 
represent a changing of minds on the use of liver transplants

at least 12 percent of students at one large 
medical school showed major symptoms of depression says a new study 
of the stresses on future doctors 
the spring of the second year of medical school appeared to be 
the most distressing period said the study published in fridays 
journal of the american medical association 
the fouryear study involved a class of 121 students at rush 
medical college in chicago it was conducted by david clark 
associate professor of psychiatry at the school and peter zeldow 
associate professor of psychiatry at chicagos northwestern 
university medical school 
the study documents what many medical educators have long 
assumed which is that medical school is a depressing place to be if 
youre a medical student zeldow said thursday 
the two researchers said depression in students was caused in 
part by the stresses involved in attending medical school 
its just a pressure cooker and if we dropped any 
crosssection of the population into it they would get depressed 
clark said 
but the type of people who go to medical school is also a factor 
the qualities that make you a conscientious fanatical student 
have a cost clark said 
the majority of medical students are quite unhappy or 
miserable whether they are suffering from depression or not 
zeldow said 
he added that theres no doubt that medical schools themselves 
are part of the problem that the curricula they provide are too 
dense with information theres no doubt inadequate attention is 
paid to the emotional needs of the students 
at any point in students four years in medical school at least 
12 percent of the doctorsintraining show signs of depression the 
study said 
the authors emphasized that the study did not use official 
medical diagnoses of depression and said that they couldnt say 
whether surveys at other medical schools would necessarily show 
similar findings 
the authors found no significant differences between the 
percentage of men and women medical students showing symptoms of 
depression 
at the end of the second year the figure of those showing 
symptoms of depression rises to about 25 percent and then it 
recedes zeldow said 
theres something wrong if medical school cant make it fun and 
exciting clark said its the joylessness in their education 
that im worried about 
by contrast only about 5 percent of the us population suffers 
from depression the researchers said 
depression in the students is not likely to affect patient care 
because medical students have so much supervision zeldow said 
they have interns residents and attending physicians looking over 
everything they do 
but the two researchers differed on whether depression suffered 
by medical students would influence the care they give patients when 
they become practicing physicians 
if a medical student is treated badly and a students emotional 
needs are ignored during training then there is a greater chance 
they will ignore the psychological needs of their patients zeldow 
said 
but in an interview clark said there was no evidence that 
students who suffer from depression while in medical school will 
have depression when theyre in practice 
the study used questionnaires filled out by students and 
evaluated by using a scale known as the beck depression inventory a 
21item measure of symptoms of depression the researchers said 
the symptoms of depression found in students included sleep 
disturbance pessimism sense of failure suicidal wishes and loss 
of sex drive the study said 
students who were very depressed were more likely to drop out of 
medical school regardless of how well they were doing academically 
the study said

prime minister yitzhak shamir refused demands by 
possible coalition partners thursday to annex the occupied lands and 
expel palestinians from them but he supports more jewish 
settlements an aide said 
the united states considers such settlements in the west bank and 
gaza strip an obstacle to peace between israel and its arab 
neighbors 
violence continued in the occupied territories where a rebellion 
that began dec 8 1987 has cost the lives of 10 israelis and more 
than 300 palestinians israeli soldiers blew up three palestinian 
houses thursday and sealed another and 11 palestinians were 
reported wounded by army gunfire 
sources in the labor party said foreign minister shimon peres 
might be dumped as leader after the centerleft partys poor showing 
in tuesdays general election 
critics say the labor campaign focused too closely on peres 
personality and his support for an international conference on 
middle east peace an arab demand that stirs controversy in israel 
shamirs rightwing likud bloc which has been in a tenuous 
national unity government with labor since indecisive 1984 
elections opposes a conference and wants to retain all the lands 
captured in the 1967 war peres has expressed willingness to trade 
some land for peace 
likud won 40 seats in the 120member parliament one more than 
labor according to revised official figures that added one seat to 
each partys total likud seeks to end its coalition with labor and 
form an alliance with small religious and rightist parties 
labor also has courted religious parties but its chances for a 
coalition are considered slim 
leaders of the national religious party which has five seats on 
thursday ruled out a coalition with the labor party and said they 
preferred joining a government headed by the rightwing likud bloc 
the 73yearold prime minister expressed confidence thursday that 
he could form a government i cant give an exact date but i hope 
it wont take long he said on israel television 
he completed a first round of coalition talks thursday after 
meeting with the moledet homeland and tzomet crossroads parties 
which want to annex the occupied territories ech has two seats in 
the knesset as israels parliament is called 
moledet also demands the expulsion to arab countries of the 15 
million palestinians living in the territories party leader rehavam 
zeevi a retired general calls the policy transfer 
shamir clarified that the idea of transfer will not be included 
in the guidelines of the next government said yossi ahimeir the 
prime ministers aide the concept is rejected by the likud 
zeevi said he would join a likud government even without 
acceptance of his platform 
ahimeir said shamir also told tzomet and the rightwing party 
tehiya that annexing the west bank and gaze would violate the 1978 
camp david accords that led to the 1979 peace treaty with egypt the 
accords call for negotiations on palestinian autonomy and the final 
status of the occupied lands 
shamir agreed however that a government led by likud would 
increase jewish settlement in the occupied territories dramatically 
ahimeir said and the only restraint will be economic 
considerations 
the jerusalem post quoted tehiya sources as saying a settlement 
boom would crush any peace moves based on palestinian autonomy 
making formal renunciation of the camp david accords unnecessary 
gush emunim a settlement movement said thursday it plans 50 new 
settlements in the next three years and may start building 11 this 
month about 70000 jews now live in 131 settlements in the west 
bank and gaza 
israeli media speculated about cabinet posts in a likud coalition 
and generally agreed that moshe arens a hardliner allied with 
shamir was the leading candidate for defense minister 
ariel sharon a former defense minister wants the job again but 
speculation was that he would become police minister and strengthen 
border police units in the occupied territories during the 
campaign sharon said security forces should form special squads to 
eliminate terrorists and rioters 
shamir said he has neither chosen ministers nor approached 
candidates

the percentage of the votingeligible public 
that is registered this election cycle is down 22 percent from 
1984 according to a private study released thursday that said 
republicans have gained while democrats have lost 
the study projects a national registration of 129483000 or 
709 percent of the votingeligible population compared with 
127500000 or 731 percent four years ago 
based on the results as well as other indications of low public 
interest in the campaign the authors of the study predicted that 
voter turnout next tuesday would decline below 525 percent making 
it the lowest since the 511 percent of 1948 voter participation in 
1984 was 531 percent 
the percentage of registered voters drops when new registrations 
fail to keep pace with the growth in the countrys votingage 
population or with the deaths of registered voters or with the 
number of voters who move and fail to reregister 
the study based on preliminary registration figures from 30 
states and the district of columbia was conducted by the committee 
for the study of the american electorate a nonpartisan group that 
monitors voter participation 
the study said that from 1984 to 1988 the republican partys 
share of the votingeligible public in 16 of the states studied 
increased 21 percent to 244 percent that brought the number of 
gop registered voters in those states to 16050098 compared with 
13764907 in 1984 
the democratic share meanwhile dropped 23 percent to 359 
percent for a total of 23630915 registered voters in the 16 
states compared with 23579425 in 1984 
republicans made gains in 11 states and the district of columbia 
headed by louisiana with an increase of 33 percent democrats 
recorded losses in 13 of the 16 states adding significantly to 
their rolls only in the district of columbia up 31 percent 
if there is a trend in these figures it seems the gop is 
picking up strength in the south at the expense of the democrats 
curtis gans director of the committee wrote in his summation 
only three states reported gains in registration this year 
nevada up 55 percent arizona up 45 percent and virginia up 
02 percent the other 27 reported declines with alaska leading at 
11 percent 
while there was less money and less effort directed at voter 
registration than in 1984 the study said several states have 
liberalized their registration laws 
it is becoming abundantly clear that the erosion in the quality 
of our politics made evident by this years campaign is 
undermining the citizens will to vote gans said 
the 40year declining trend in voter participation interrupted 
briefly in 1984 makes the united states the democracy with the 
lowest participation in the world he said

the gap between the mortality rate for black 
and white infants born in the united states continues to widen a 
childrens advocacy group said thursday 
the childrens defense fund basing its study on data released by 
the national center for health statistics a federal agency said it 
found a blackwhite infant mortality ratio of 202 in 1986 the most 
recent year for which figures were available 
the findings mean a black baby was more than twice as likely to 
die in infancy as a white baby that compared to a 196 ratio in 
1985 and 169 in 1940 
it added that while the death rates among black and white 
infants for nonpreventable birth defects was virtually identical 
black babies were far more likely to die of preventable causes such 
as inadequate prenatal care 
they were four times more likely to die of prematurity and low 
birth weight three times more likely to die of pneumonia influenza 
and homicide and two times more likely to die as a result of newborn 
and maternal complications infections and accidents the fund said 
overall the us infant mortality rate declined slightly from 
106 deaths per 1000 live births in 1985 to 104 in 1986 
the mortality rate for black infants in 1986 was 18 per 1000 
births and for white infants 89 per 1000 births

the roman catholic church in chile urged 
both the military government and the opposition on thursday to make 
some gestures of reconciliation to ensure a smooth transition to 
democracy 
in a written statement monsignor carlos gonzalez president of 
chiles bishops conference suggested that government gestures could 
include 
speeding up trials of political prisoners 
a real reform of the political police force which has been 
widely accused of torturing prisoners 
claryfing so many facts that have not yet been duly explained 
to the nations public opinion a reference to human rights 
violations that occurred after the military took power in a bloody 
1973 coup headed by gen augusto pinochet now president 
ending the 1year internal exile imposed last month on the 
nations two top labor leaders for calling an illegal general strike 
last year 
i submit these facts as gestures that would help in promoting a 
climate of peace that we all desire gonzalez said 
he said the opposition should recognize the economic achievements 
under the pinochet government but added it must also be accepted 
that the social distribution of the economy requires policies that 
take into account in a wider manner the dignity and the respect that 
workers deserve 
gonzalez said gestures are needed following the oct 5 
referendum in which voters rejected a military proposal that 
pinochet who has ruled since the coup remain in power until 1997 
it is not good for the country to ignore the referendum and 
believe that everything remains unchanged the prelate said 
signs and gestures of rapprochement are needed from both sides 
under the 1980 constitution the pinochet defeat in the 
referendum makes an open presidential election mandatory in december 
1989 with the president and army commander handling over power to 
the winner in march 1990 
the opposition has asked a dialogue with the military on proposed 
constitutional changes including an earlier departure of pinochet 
from power 
pinochet has rejected opposition demands 
one fact that can be drawn from the referendum is that chileans 
want to follow a pace of respect dialogue and peace gonzalez 
said in his statement

kaufman charging them in superior court with grave desecration 
they are seeking 1 million in damages 
eternal homes policy is set by sinai a spokeswoman said the 
associated press could not reach sinai attorney william e joost for 
comment on wednesday 
rader however said sinai officials told him the ban was because 
it is against jewish religion to have graven images photographs of 
the deceased are allowed to be placed into the tombstones 
rader a tall talkative man with a rich russian accent called 
the ban unbelievable 
rader learned sculpture and painting at an art academy in the 
soviet union later working in an artists factory painting 
giant canvasses of lenin and marx and other murals glorifying the 
workers revolution 
later he studied gravestone art with an old master working in 
a cemetery at chernovtzy in the ukraine near the romanian border 
you cannot learn this from nobody rader said this 
technique is a secret technique to do this you have to be an 
artist 
you have to know the material granite does not forgive a 
mistake he said 
rader came to the city in 1980 and in 1984 opened art stone 
monuments his business located near colma a community of 
graveyards south of san francisco 
the dispute began this fall when rader installed an engraving of 
a popular member of the russian jewish emigre community despite the 
ban 
according to attorney richard a canatella sinai officials were 
angry and visited raders shop to inspect gravestones for solganik 
who died in january at 74 and simyon flek who died in april at 57 
despite protests by the family that they would use the required 
stone cemetery workers dug up huge foundations for gravestones at 
the head of both graves 
rader said the torah teaches that the soul of the dead resides at 
the grave for 11 months 
they disturbed her peace said portnoy as tears formed in 
her eyes 
i cant even talk about it she said

estonians are unhappy about proposed amendments to 
the soviet constitution because they would abolish the right of 
republics to secede and shift the balance of power toward russia 
residents of the baltic republic say 
newspapers in estonia are filled with complaints said the 
residents who spoke on condition their names not be used they said 
the complainers include even some communist party officials who say 
they had no voice in the constitutional revisions presented by 
moscow two weeks ago 
estonias ruling presidium is to consider the kremlins 
constitutional and election reforms friday and may recommend 
rejecting the entire package the residents said 
the newspapers say the amendments make the constitution even 
more antidemocratic that it is at the present moment one 
estonian resident said 
another declared its no good for anything its certainly not 
more democratic like they promised at the communist party 
conference in june 
of primary concern to estonia is a clause giving the new national 
congress of peoples deputies power to determine the composition of 
the soviet union a resident explained the current constitution 
grants each republic the right of selfdetermination 
all three baltic republics estonia latvia and lithuania have 
developed strong independent political organizations in the past six 
months that pressed greater autonomy from moscow demands have 
included the right to print their own currency and control their own 
foreign trade 
the revised constitution gives power to the national 
legislature over economic issues and we were expecting to increase 
our control over our republic economy one estonian said 
president mikhail s gorbachevs reforms would create a new 
congress with twothirds of the members elected by the public and 
onethird chosen by certain organizations it would would meet once 
a year to elect a working supreme soviet parliament and the national 
president 
estonians also are upset because more seats are assigned to the 
socalled autonomous regions and territories almost all within the 
russian republic which they say will shift power to the russians 
under the new allocation plan the proportion of seats held by 
the russian republic in the soviet of nationalities one of the two 
houses of the supreme soviet will go from 32 percent to 43 said 
the estonian newspaper maalaht 
one resident said estonians are trying to stir the other 13 
nonrussian republics to join them in opposing the changes the 
estonian academy of sciences has denounced the amendments and sent 
copies of its objections to its counterparts in other parts of the 
soviet union he said 
the estonian popular front a broadbased independent political 
group has appealed to all citizens of estonia to send copies of 
the decisions to their friends in other republics because the 
allunion national media cannot be trusted the resident said 
major soviet media have not mentioned the estonian complaints 
although they have printed articles about the reforms

british prime minister margaret thatcher 
told gen wojciech jaruzelski thursday that the west would provide 
financial aid to poland when authorities begin real dialogue 
with solidarity 
mrs thatcher made the comments to the communist party chief at a 
banquet hours after she honored the memory of a slain prosolidarity 
priest at a warsaw church 
hundreds of supporters of the banned independent trade union 
movement who had gathered at the church shouted to her that they 
represent the real poland 
here is poland here is poland the crowd chanted as mrs 
thatcher walked into the yard of the st stanislaw kostka church to 
lay a wreath on the grave of the rev jerzy popieluszko 
at the banquet hosted by the polish leader mrs thatcher said in 
a toast that she was planning to go to gdansk friday to hear the 
views of solidarity leaders 
she suggested that jaruzelski too should listen to solidarity 
which was outlawed after the imposition of martial law in 1981 but 
is still the focal point of opposition to the communist government 
freedom and responsibility go hand in hand those who seek the 
one must be prepared to offer the other mrs thatcher said 
that is why it is so vital that there should be real dialogue with 
representatives of all sections of society including solidarity 
for reforms to succeed mrs thatcher said people have to be 
involved in decisions about the way forward 
when that happens she added when that great day comes 
you will find your friends ready not just to stand and cheer but 
to help in practical ways by supporting a program with the imf the 
international monetary fund by offering credits by rescheduling 
debts by encouraging investment and by establishing joint 
ventures 
a british official speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
prime ministers remarks could be seen as a reply to repeated 
requests for aid from britain in helping poland cope with its 
crushing 39 billion foreign debt 
jaruzelski responded that poland had suffered greatly through its 
history and western countries which suffered less should not be too 
quick to judge it 
our nation walked a thorny path hence it knows well the 
cost of security and stability of ones own state he said in 
remarks released in advance no one today looking from the 
elevation of affluence should forget that 
mrs thatcher and jaruzelski conferred together for three hours 
before the banquet which culminated the second day of mrs 
thatchers threeday state visit to poland 
the british official said jaruzelski gave the impression that 
he intended to embark on a radical set of reforms and acknowledged 
these were essential 
earlier thursday mrs thatcher met with prime minister 
mieczyslaw f rakowski for a second time and visited a market 
st stanislaw kostka church was the parish of popieluszko a 
charismatic roman catholic priest who was abducted beaten and 
drowned in 1984 by four secret policemen who later were imprisoned 
the crowd broke into a traditional hymn god watches over 
poland after mrs thatcher placed the red white and blue wreath 
of roses lilies and irises on the tombstone 
the churchyard was lined with solidarity banners and an honor 
guard of steelworkers stood by holding flags of the banned union 
shaking her head in apparent sadness mrs thatcher spoke with 
popieluszkos gaunt elderly parents marianna and wladyslaw 
we are extremely grateful that she found the time to come 
here said mrs popieluszko we know that deep in her heart she 
has been with our beloved son we know she supports people suffering 
in poland 
mrs thatcher who is popular in poland has said she doesnt 
want to interfere in polands internal affairs during her visit 
which began wednesday both the opposition and the government have 
been hoping to gain from her trip 
the government would like mrs thatchers endorsement of tough 
economic policies and her help with its debt crisis while the 
opposition hopes she will speak out for greater freedom 
the government said wednesday it was making a new approach to 
solidarity leader lech walesa about starting talks with the 
opposition walesa said thursday he would not reply to the approach 
until after mrs thatchers departure friday but he said he would 
continue to refuse to alter solidaritys delegation to the talks 
which has been the stumbling block 
she can give a push to the polish government to come to terms 
with reality and reality is the existence of solidarity the 
unions national spokesman janusz onyszkiewicz said in a british 
television interview 
in her talks with rakowski mrs thatcher stonewalled an appeal 
for western aid said a british official speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
rakowski said the 39 billion foreign debt was like a noose 
round our necks and appealed for western help the official 
said the prime minister did not respond he said

president reagan signed legislation thursday to 
give consumers more and faster information about the costs of credit 
cards 
the bill will require banks department stores and other credit 
card issuers to supply details to their customers about interest 
rates and other charges 
banking groups worked for passage of the measure because it would 
prevent states from imposing differing disclosure requirements on 
their interstate industry 
consumer groups also backed it strongly 
the measure calls for card issuers to disclose not only their 
interest rates but how the interest charges are calculated and how 
long a grace period is allowed before the charges begin to accrue 
backers of the legislation said it would enable consumers to shop 
around for the lowest interest rates

the sister of lebanon hostage terry anderson 
on thursday rejected president reagans allegation that her 
brothers recently released videotaped message was written by his 
captors 
i know my brother a lot better than ronald reagan said 
peggy say theres not a word in that message that isnt his 
she said 
mrs say speaking to a group of buffalo state college students 
said she knows her brothers writing style and it is much different 
from his captors 
i have seen communications from the captors and its not the 
same english as his she said 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press was kidnapped march 16 1985 in beirut by islamic jihad a 
shiite moslem extremist group backed by iran 
in a videotape released monday anderson said he believed the 
us government had blocked several attempts to free the nine 
american hostages now held in lebanon 
reagan denied that saying i dont think that was terry 
speaking i think he had a script that was given to him 
mrs say criticized reagan for not doing more to win the release 
of the hostages 
im getting a double message from the government she said 
administration responses suggest andersons life isnt worth 
negotiating for she contended despite past negotiations on behalf 
of american hostages 
mrs say said she agrees with the reagan administrations policy 
of not openly negotiating with terrorists however the government 
has in the past negotiated with terrorists such as during the 
irancontra affair she said 
im being told that terrys life isnt worth as much as former 
hostages 
although mrs say said anderson looks better than he has at any 
other time during his captivity she doesnt think his appearance 
means he is being treated any better by his captors 
terry anderson is still chained to a basement wall somewhere 
she said 
even so mrs say said she hopes her brothers improved look 
could mean the kidnappers are getting ready to release him 
id like to think they are preparing him for release she 
said but i know thats a remote chance

a former firefighter accused of setting a 
series of fires that terrorized a small town was indicted thursday 
on 14 counts of arson and two of attempted arson 
lance lalumiere 23 was arrested oct 12 on charges that he set 
one of more than 20 fires that plagued jefferson a town of 850 
people in northern new hampshire since may lalumiere had been 
working as a dishwasher in the town 
authorities found a handdrawn map of several arson sites in 
lalumieres trailer and a propane torch in a car he owned according 
to court documents released earlier this week 
a second jefferson man was charged oct 13 with setting one fire 
in dalton two towns from jefferson though police initially said 
firefighter lawrence coulter jr 19 was a suspect in other fires 
prosecutors said later they consider the dalton fire an isolated 
incident 
the first fire lalumiere was charged with setting was to his 
brother michaels cabin in jefferson in late august 
there have been no fires since the oct 3 fire in dalton that 
coulter has been charged with setting 
the attorney generals office said earlier that lalumiere had 
admitted to setting 16 fires 
since may 5 26 fires have been set in the jefferson area 
causing an estimated 1 million in property damage the fires began 
in brush and fields but progressed to occupied homes and other 
buildings no one was killed though there were close calls 
attorney general stephen merrill said prosecutors did not seek an 
indictment thursday against coulter from the coos county grand jury 
but would later 
asked if more arrests were expected he said only i can assure 
you we are not going to conclude this matter until we are sure its 
finally resolved

some soviet troops could withdraw within 
a year or two after new talks begin on conventional arms reduction 
in europe the soviet foreign minister was quoted as saying in a 
magazine published thursday 
the magazine hungary also quoted eduard a shevardnadze the 
foreign minister as saying only 11 political prisoners now are in 
soviet jails and 25 in psychiatric hospitals he accused western 
nations who say there are many more of blocking new human rights 
agreements 
a soviet proposal for a human rights conference in moscow in 1991 
and western demands for the release of soviet political prisoners 
have prevented agreement on a final document at a vienna conference 
to review compliance with the 1975 helsinki agreements on european 
security and cooperation 
creation of a new forum for eastwest talks on reducing 
conventional forces from the atlantic ocean to the ural mountains 
depends on a successful resolution of the vienna conference 
shevardnadze said the mandate for the new talks has been 
essentially coordinated and the possibility remains of talks 
beginning this year 
within a year or two we could achieve the first stage of the 
reductions relating to the removal of imbalances and asymmetries 
between nato and the warsaw pact the foreign minister said 
he said areas of possible reduction would include hungary where 
an estimated 65000 soviet troops are stationed 
hungarian defense officials have said the red army soldiers can 
be withdrawn only if the north atlantic treaty organization makes 
corresponding reductions indications have also surfaced that some 
soviet air defense forces might remain in hungary 
in the interview shevardnadze criticized western countries he 
did not name for blocking agreement in vienna on a 1991 moscow human 
rights conference 
this is an impermissible and unacceptable tactical approach 
he said some of the demands occasionally set by the west are 
unrelated to both the actual situation and the essence of the 
question concerned 
western nations notably the united states and britain say they 
will not go to moscow for a human rights conference while political 
prisoners are held in the soviet union 
chancellor helmut kohl of west germany said on a visit to moscow 
last week the soviets gave assurances that all political prisoners 
would be free by the end of this year but some western governments 
were skeptical 
soviet jurisidiction does not include a political prisoner 
bracket shevardnadze said according to the magazine what is 
meant by such in the west is the case of persons condemned under the 
code of penal law for activities termed political in the west 
he said legal bodies in the soviet union had reviewed the cases 
of several people sentenced under laws now being revised and some 
people were released 
at present there are only 11 persons serving such terms and the 
revision of cases is continuing he was quoted as saying 
another 25 people he said were called to account before the 
law but later declared as psychopaths and sent to psychiatric 
hospitals for treatment

despite steady traffic growth airline safety 
indicators showed a significant improvement during the first nine 
months of the year compared with the same period last year the 
transportation department said thursday 
the department said the number of nearcollision reports filed by 
pilots as well as air traffic controller errors and airline fatal 
accident rates all declined markedly during the period compared with 
1987 
transportation secretary jim burnley said the improved safety 
statistics came despite increased air traffic and coincide with 
improved ontime performance by the major airlines 
the department also made public thursday its latest monthly 
airline consumer scorecard which showed the 13 largest airlines have 
had ontime records of 80 percent or better during each of the last 
six months including an 856 percent ontime arrival mark in 
september 
the statistics indicate that our efforts to improve airline 
safety and service to consumers are reaping dividends said 
burnley 
the dot said the number of nearcollision reports from pilots 
during the januaryseptember period were 35 percent fewer 560 
reports than filed during the same nine months in l987 the 
announcement did not say and it could not be determined thursday 
night how many of the reports involved commercial airliners 
during ninemonth period there also was a 15 percent decline 
nationwide of air traffic controller errors in which aircraft were 
allowed to come closer than legally allowed while a nearcollision 
incident generally is reported only when planes come within 500 
feet a controller error can occur with aircraft as far as five 
miles apart 
the dot said there were 808 reports of operational errors by 
controllers during the januaryseptember period compared with 953 
during the first nine months of l987 
but officials acknowledged there were significant exceptions to 
the national trend particularly in the chicago area which has some 
of the nations busiest airspace 
the federal aviation administration recently reduced air traffic 
in and out of the chicago airports including ohare international 
because of a sharp jump in controller errors ohare controllers had 
30 flighthandling errors between january and late october compared 
with 12 in all of 1987 
meanwhile burnley said there were 0031 fatal accidents per 
100000 flying hours by regularly scheduled airlines during the 
januaryseptember period compared with 0041 per 100000 hours in 
the same nine months of l987 a decline of 24 percent

michael dukakis asserted thursday that voters by the millions are 
giving his underdog campaign a very strong second look in the 
waning days of the race for the white house george bush said 
democrats were grossly unfair to say his advertising is tinged 
with racism 
youre looking at a man who was out front for civil rights and 
i will be again the vice president said in a network television 
interview he defended running mate dan quayle on the same score and 
said any political wounds would heal quickly after the election 
dukakis combined an attack on the reaganbush administrations 
record on drugs with ritual declarations that the political tide was 
turning in his favor his administration has cut deals with 
foreign drug runners im going to cut aid to their nations said 
the democratic nominee 
most of the national attention was on the white house campaign 
but not all 
democrats were expressing confidence they would control both 
houses of the new congress although republicans said they had a 
chance of picking up a seat or two in the senate a dozen 
gubernatorial contests dotted ballots being printed for next 
tuesdays election day 
the public opinion polls in the white house campaign continued to 
provide encouragement for bush 
dukakis was trying desperately to reverse poll deficits in 
several large electoral college battlegrounds at once he ventured 
unexpectedly into new jersey crooning a la bruce springsteen i 
was born to run and born to win but bush reagan quayle and co 
were pouring it on in ohio where private polls continued to show a 
solid republican edge 
abc said its survey of north carolina once dukakis strongest 
hope for a southern success gave the vice president an 11point 
edge dukakis held a fourpoint margin in a new york survey 
bush and dukakis were spending millions on campaignclosing 
television and radio commercials and both the democratic and 
republican parties previewed a spate of advertisements designed to 
maximize party support 
dukakis had an ad featuring one of the most memorable television 
moments of the campaign with democratic vice presidential candidate 
lloyd bentsen turning to quayle during their debate and saying 
senator youre no jack kennedy 
republicans countered with the great communicator 
america is at peace and we are prosperous once more on 
tuesday i hope you will vote republican up and down the ticket 
to continue the change we began in 1981 said president reagan in 
a 30second gop television commercial 
one ad campaign has drawn the attention of the justice 
department which said thursday it will investigate democratic 
complaints that a republican ad in south texas is intimidating 
spanishspeaking voters the ad in spanish says voting officials 
will be watching closely and warns of penalties for noncitizens 
who try to vote 
in the seattle area the bush campaign pulled much of its 
television advertising a state campaign spokesman said the decision 
was made on the national level and represented a shift of spending 
to targeted products such as mailings 
newspapers were choosing up sides on their editorial pages and 
in one case in the comics as well 
bob bryan owner and publisher of the cullman times and athens 
news courier in alabama replaced the comic strip cathy with an 
advertisement for bush bryan had objected to the comic strip as 
being produkakis and he said he just took the panel out that 
would have been cathy and right where cathy has been put in big 
type vote for bush 
bush and dukakis both were on morning television programs while 
embarking on another dawntodusk dash through key battleground 
states 
in a live 30minute interview on nbcs today show and later 
at campaign appearances in illinois and elsewhere bush said any 
political wounds would heal in the weeks after the election i 
think the country will come together he said the vice president 
also renewed his nonewtaxes pledge 
bush heatedly denied that his attacks on dukakis over the 
massachusetts prison furlough program had racist overtones for 
citing the case of willie horton jr who is black horton a 
convicted murderer brutalized a maryland couple after escaping but 
bush said his commercial didnt have any reference to his race and 
no picture on it 
he said dukakis countered with an ad showing a picture of a 
hispanic prisoner who had escaped from a federal prison program and 
committed crimes 
youre looking at a man who is one of compassion of concern 
and yes i was out front for civil rights and i will be again 
bush said 
and i dont have one ounce of bigotry in my body nor does my 
running mate he said bush added he wanted to leave the tired 
baggage of bigotry behind us 
dukakis began his 55th birthday in the interview chair at cbs 
this morning saying that despite the public polls the race was 
beginning to break his way he said voters are unhappy with the 
republican campaign and added thats one of the reasons that 
theyre taking a very strong second look at me and mr bush and 
seeing some very important differences 
a fifth grader in philadelphia playing dukakis in a mock debate 
received some advice from the man himself smile frequently and 
speak slowly said dukakis not known for doing either in his 
campaign appearances 
in an appearance in fairless hills pa dukakis continued his 
emphasis on the war on drugs he outlined a proposal for a 400 
million federal contribution for a federal state and local alliance 
to assure drugfree schools across the country by the next decade 
including drug education programs beginning in kindergarten and 
community advisory councils to coordinate local efforts 
bentsen rode a bus caravan through heavily democratic east texas 
sparing no sarcasm in his description of the republicans he said 
bush was running his campaign as if on a luxury cruise on the 
caribbean with the people left behind as for quayle bentsen said 
the republicans have got him like a parrot in a gilded cage 
quayles day got off to a rocky start when problems with his 
chartered hoosier pride campaign jet delayed his departure from

the fbi has harassed and intimidated 
hispanic agents who successfully sued the bureau for discrimination 
according to documents filed thursday in federal court 
attorneys for the hispanic agents asked us district judge 
lucius bunton to issue an injunction prohibiting the fbi from the 
alleged retaliatory acts 
their 32page brief includes affidavits from the lead plaintiff 
in the case and two others all of whom contend they were retaliated 
against after bunton ruled sept 30 that the fbi had discriminated 
against hispanics in assignments and promotions 
the three agents testified in the twoweek nonjury trial in 
august the 311 agents who joined the class action successfully 
argued that the fbi assigned them lessdesirable jobs promoted them 
too slowly and didnt recognize them for their successes 
asked about the allegations of retaliation fbi spokesman gregory 
jones in washington said our response is basically any 
intimidation or retaliation would be illegal and intolerable and 
would result in an fbi inquiry 
the discrimination suit was filed in january 1987 by bernardo 
matt perez the no 2 agent in the el paso office in an 
affidavit filed thursday perez contends that since buntons verdict 
was announced i have been purposely divorced from many of the 
administrative operations of the office and from my daytoday 
management responsibilities 
perez contends that richard schwein the agent in charge of the 
el paso office called a meeting the monday after the verdict was 
announced and forbade all the bureau employees from talking about 
the discrimination case on or off duty perez also says that on the 
same day schwein called in a hispanic agent who had talked to 
reporters about the case and intimidated him by saying schwein could 
have taken administrative action against him 
schwein said thursday some of perezs allegations were untrue and 
some were the result of misunderstandings 
he perez carries out the daytoday operations in this 
office and everyone in this office reports to him except me 
schwein said 
schwein said that at the meeting he told agents this is what 
the judge found and this is what we have to deal with he said he 
told agents it would be inappropriate to comment publicly about the 
case because the second half of the trial concerning damages had not 
yet started 
schwein said he cautioned the agent who talked to reporters that 
he should have made it clear he was speaking as a citizen and not as 
a representative of the fbi 
he said he feels more hurt than anger at perezs allegations 
i resent having my integrity challenged i dont like 
falsehoods and i consider these falsehoods he said adding that 
he and perez will continue to work together 
perez declined to comment thursday 
fernando mata an agent in the miami office said in an affidavit 
that he believes the fbi is trying to fire him or force him to quit 
under the pretext of presenting him as a risk to national security 
mata who testified during the trial that he worked in the fbis 
foreign counterintelligence unit against an unidentified country 
said he has been forced to undergo long interrogations since the 
trial he said in the affidavit that he needs psychiatric help for 
the stress and mental anguish that i feel as a direct result of my 
participation in this litigation and the unfounded allegations that 
the fbi is making against me 
agent james garay in albuquerque said in his affidavit that his 
gun and car were taken away from him under the pretext that he had 
been injured in an onthejob car accident after garay told his 
superiors he intended to file an affidavit with the court his gun 
and driving privileges were restored according to the document 
the request for injunction said the agent in charge of the los 
angeles fbi office requested an administrative inquiry against two 
agents who were interviewed for a magazine article detailing 
problems in the los angeles office 
this action which is intended to chill that first amendment 
right of class members was accomplished at an all employees 
conference in los angeles to embarrass and intimidate hispanic 
agents who participated in the suit according to the brief

iraq which acknowledged using poison gas 
in its war with iran is one of 17 nations willing to help 
investigate allegations of chemical warfare in the world according 
to a un document released thursday 
a report by secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar on chemical 
and biological weapons summarizes un efforts to develop ways of 
detecting use of such weapons mainly by coordinating the efforts of 
experts in various nations 
the report to the general assembly includes the responses of 17 
nations that have offered the use of laboratories or experts in 
chemical warfare 
iraq offered the services of two doctors two chemists and a 
pharmacologist but said it is not possible for iraqi laboratories 
to be used in chemical and biological warfare investigations 
last summer iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz answered a 
question about alleged chemical warfare in the persian gulf war by 
responding that iraq used such weapons only after iran used them 
first 
iran says it has the ability to make chemical weapons but has 
never used them 
investigations by un experts confirmed that iraq used chemical 
weapons against iran throughout the war which began in september 
1980 
besides iraq other nations offering help were the united states 
the soviet union austria belgium brazil canada denmark 
finland france west germany the netherlands new zealand norway

attorney general dick thornburgh agreed 
thursday to investigate a republican advertising campaign in south 
texas that democrats claim is intimidating spanishspeaking voters 
with its big brother tone 
we certainly will look into this complaint and to the extent 
that there is any evidence that it might be valid there will be a 
harsh response from the federal government said justice 
department spokesman loye miller 
miller said the us attorney in charge of the lower rio grande 
valley would be contacted friday and asked to take a look at the 
whole situation 
democratic rep jack brooks accused texas republicans thursday of 
using spanishlanguage radio advertising to keep voters from going 
to the polls next tuesday in the heavily hispanic border area by 
injecting an element of fear 
brooks asked thornburgh to determine if republican party 
officials in hidalgo county are violating federal voting rights laws 
by running radio ads citing penalties for noncitizens who vote and 
that twice remind listeners that election officials will be 
watching 
republican officials defend the ads as proper and say they are 
not an attempt at intimidation 
i would hope that any law enforcement agency spending time in 
south texas concentrates on trying to stamp out the voter fraud we 
have seen in that region for the past 20 years voter fraud 
perpetrated by the democrats said mark sanders a spokesman for 
the texas campaign of republican presidential nominee george bush 
brooks who is in line to become chairman of the house judiciary 
committee told thornburgh in a letter it should be clear that 
this advertising campaign accompanied by the repeated big brother 
warning that election officials are watching was not motivated by 
the benign goal of discouraging illegal voting but rather is an 
obvious attempt to hold down overall voter turnout among 
spanishspeaking citizens by injecting an element of fear into the 
voting process 
the beaumont congressman said he believes the advertising could 
be a violation of federal voting rights laws which prohibit 
intimidation or coercion in the exercise of the right to vote 
sanders said the ad is running in in hidalgo county because we 
dont want to see graveyard votes alice in wonderland votes and 
votes from the precincts of outer mongolia 
the spanish language ad says voting officials will be watching 
closely it is illegal to vote in this election if you are not a 
us citizen if you have a green card you cannot vote if you do 
you can be subject to up to 10 years in prison fined up to 5000 
and lose your opportunity to become a us citizen if you accept 
money to vote you can get up to five years in jail remember 
election officials are watching paid for by the republican party of 
hidalgo county don winngate director

the general assembly overwhelmingly 
condemned israel thursday for killings woundings beatings 
deportations and other allegations of violating the human rights of 
palestinans in the occupied territories 
the vote was 1302 with 16 abstentions 
the united states and israel voted against britain and canada 
abstained 
the palestine liberation organization opened the debate thursday 
by accusing israel of murdering 411 palestinian civilians since an 
antiisraeli insurrection began in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip 11 months ago 
every year the assembly by a lopsided vote condemns israeli 
human rights practices in the occupied lands captured from arab 
foes in the 1967 mideast war 
us ambassador herbert s okun the deputy permanent 
representative criticized the divisive resolution and said it 
hinders the search for peace in the region 
it is an unbalanced document condemning one of the parties for 
its actions without taking into account acts of violence by the 
other side the harsh rhetoric in this resolution can only inflame 
an already embittered situation making it more difficult to proceed 
toward a negotiated settlement he said 
okun said us policy calls for a negotiated settlement which 
will require an exchange of territory for peace israels 
security must be assured at the same time the legitimate 
political rights of the palestinian people must be recognized 
the resolution said the assembly condemns israels persistent 
policies and practices violating the human rights of the palestinian 
people in the occupied territories including jerusalem 
it cited fatal shootings and woundings by the israeli army and 
settlers of defenseless palestinian civilians the beating and 
breaking of bones deportation imposition of restrictive economic 
measures demolition of houses collective punishment and 
detentions as well as denial of access to the media 
it demands that israel the occupying power abide immediately 
and scrupulously by the 1949 fourth geneva convention on 
protecting civilians in time of war and halt all violations of that 
convention 
israel told the assembly the united nations was being 
hijacked by some arab nations in a counterproductive debate on 
the territories which incites and encourages violence and blocks 
peace agreements israel said it would continue efforts to restore 
order and would exercise maximum restraint 
the israeli ambassador johanan bein condemned what he called 
palestinian inhumanity in burning familes alive by firebombs 
planting bombs in civilian buses and throwing grenades at sidewalk 
cafes and toy shops full of children 
m nasser alkidwa plo deputy un representative told the 
general assembly that 411 civilians including 60 women were killed 
and 4500 wounded from dec 8 1987 when the insurrection began to 
oct 30 
other estimates put the toll at more than 300 palestinians and 10 
israelis 
an additional 11400 palestinians from the 15 million 
palestinian population were detained without trial he charged 
kidwa said that besides shootings beatings use of plastic 
bullets and of tear gas and the like israeli soldiers tried to 
bury some palestinians alive he said some pregnant women lost their 
unborn babies as a result of beatings or inhaling tear gas 
the 143page un report by daya r perera ambassador of sri 
lanka said the report reflects the dramatic deterioration of the 
human rights situation in the occupied territories since the 
beginning of the uprising 
the report covered the period from sept 4 1987 to last aug 26 
the document said israels occupation of the territories itself 
is a violation of human rights 
the report said that while several thousands of civilians have 
been physically injured the entire palestinian population has 
suffered from the israeli policy of force power and blows and 
of the iron fist 
it said in the long run protection can only be ensured through 
negotiation of a comprehensive just and lasting settlement of the 
arabisraeli conflict

lloyd bentsen said thursday that if 
republican george bush is elected president his honeymoon with 
congress would be awfully short because of resentments stemming 
from bushs negative campaign tactics 
i dont see how a president has any kind of a mandate if he 
wins by the amount of negative advertising used by bush the 
democratic vice presidential candidate told reporters on a campaign 
bus tour of east texas 
the texas senator said he does not want a difficult relationship 
with any new republican administration but that the concentration 
on negative advertising that doesnt become a mandate to the 
american people 
that makes it more difficult bentsen said you dont have 
any socalled honeymoon it would be an awfully short one if you 
had that 
bentsen who is chairman of the senate finance committee said 
bush as president might have particular trouble persuading congress 
to accept his campaign promise of a reduction in the topbracket 
capital gains tax rate from 33 percent to 15 percent 
bentsen said the proposal would benefit mostly the wealthy and 
was regarded as a violation of the agreement behind the 1986 tax 
overhaul law 
bentsen was interviewed in the lounge of a luxury bus he used 
thursday to stump for middleclass votes in the rural area of texas 
near the louisiana and arkansas borders 
two other buses and a few cars and pickup trucks chased the 
candidates vehicle through longview daingerfield mount pleasant 
paris and sulphur springs east texas is rich in proreagan 
democrats that party nominee michael dukakis must win in his bid for 
the states 29 electoral votes in tuesdays balloting 
im fighting for middleincome america and im standing up for 
middleincome america bentsen told several hundred supporters in 
longview 
when im vice president of the united states and michael 
dukakis is president of the united states well meet with the press 
on a regular basis he said 
and theres something else well do well meet with the folks 
well meet with middleincome america he said 
thats the kind of accountability you want from your elected 
representatives he said stressing the democrats accessibility 
to voters and the media 
by contrast his gop counterpart dan quayle is kept under 
control like a parrot in a gilded cage bentsen said 
mike mccurry bentsens press secretary said the democratic 
campaign is releasing a new tv advertisement this weekend which 
features bentsens widely publicized youre no jack kennedy barb 
at quayle during their midoctober debate 
the spot ends with the words president quayle he said 
after his bus tour bentsen helicoptered into dallas for a live 
appearance on public televisions macneillehrer newshour where he 
said the main reason the repulicans were leading in the polls was 
their negative advertising 
theyve painted michael dukakis for something he isnt 
bentsen said citing the criticism on gun control and the furlough 
of massachusetts prisoner willie horton a convicted murderer who 
brutalized a maryland couple while on a weekend pass republican ads 
has contended that dukakis wanted to take away sportsmens guns and 
was soft on crime and that was not true bentsen said 
he also reaffirmed his belief that there was a racist element in 
the republican use of the horton case 
but bentsen said he felt the democratic message was getting 
through and there was still time to turn around the polls 
ive been more encouraged in the last four days than ive been 
in the last three months he said 
among bentsens frequent stops thursday was a visit to a 
daingerfield cafe for coffee and donuts 
his bus had a special window installed so he could wave to 
constituents the vehicle which belongs to a wealthy texan who uses 
it for family skiing trips was not equipped with windows that open 
helping bentsen draw crowds along the route were country music

the military is launching an offensive to 
wipe out colombias leftist guerrillas the countrys top general 
said thursday 
the subversives want a military response and we are going to 
give it to them defense minister gen rafael samudio molina said 
at a funeral for 11 soldiers killed in a guerrilla ambush tuesday

there are an estimated 10000 leftist guerrillas in colombia 
whose population of 30 million more than 75000 people have been 
killed in 15 years of insurrection 
colombias armed forces have held back from an allout war 
against the guerrillas during offandon peace talks between the 
government and the rebels over the last six years 
the army recently bought eight blackhawk army helicopter gunships 
from the united states for its antiguerrilla forces 
samudio apparently speaking with the support of president 
virgilio barco said there was no use trying to negotiate with the 
guerrillas

barco who offered pardons to all guerrillas who would surrender and 
said he would let rebel leaders address congress on changes that 
should be made in colombia 
barcos predecessor president belisario betancur launched peace 
talks with the guerrillas in 1982 the talks collapsed amid mutual 
accusations by the rebels and the military of ceasefire violations

a human rights organization challenging 
statements by soviet officials that they are holding fewer than a 
dozen political prisoners on thursday released a list of 156 
soviets it said were jailed for their religious beliefs 
although the soviet union has liberalized its human rights 
policies in recent years it remains officially an atheist state and 
some religious believers say they are persecuted because their faith 
is seen as a challenge to authority 
debi mulligan spokeswoman for the puebla institute a 
washingtonbased lay roman catholic organization said nearly 
every soviet religious group with the exception of the jewish 
religion can claim at least one prisoner for religious reasons 
prisoners include baptists ukrainian catholics moslems 
jehovahs witnesses russian orthodox pentecostals lithuanian 
catholics hare krishnas and seven day adventists she said 
reading a prepared statement 
their crimes range from processing or printing religious 
literature to worshiping in a church or with a congregation that is 
not stateapproved to manufacturing religious articles to 
protesting government interference in the church the statement 
said some people including a number of moslems have been jailed 
for giving religious instruction to children she said 
the official soviet news agency tass on monday quoted soviet 
justice minister boris kravtsov as saying there were eight political 
prisoners five imprisoned and two in internal exile under an 
antiagitation law and another incarcerated for antisoviet slander 
tass also quoted kravtsov as indicating although not specifying 
that the soviet government planned to drop criminal code article 
190 which bans antisoviet slander and has been used against 
dissidents 
kravtsov said another law used against dissidents article 70 
which bans antisoviet slander would be used only for 
concrete actions that would be manifested say in calls for 
overthrow of power of the government 
the comments by kravtsov and other soviet officials were 
challenged immediately by soviet and western human rights activists 
andrei d sakharov winner of the 1975 nobel peace prize told 
reporters that 25 people were being held in labor camps under the 
antislander article sakharov was banished to the city of gorky for 
seven years without any charges being brought against him before 
his release two years ago 
amnesty international the londonbased human rights 
organization has said it has information on 150 soviets 
imprisoned solely for the nonviolent exercise of their 
fundamental human rights 
the puebla spokeswoman said the puebla and amnesty lists 
overlapped she said that although no jewish religious prisoners 
were being held many jews had problems emigrating from the soviet 
union and five jews had been released this year after serving 
sentences on antislander or related charges 
west german chancellor helmut kohl said after talks with kremlin 
officials in moscow last week that he was told that all soviets that 
the west regards as political prisoners would be released by the end 
of the year 
in moscow on thursday foreign ministry spokesman gennady i 
gerasimov said soviet criminal law will be revised by the end of the 
year and then there will be no basis to speak about political 
prisoners 
he would not state clearly however if all laws used to 
prosecute people for their political beliefs would be repealed 
nor would he say whether all current political prisoners will be 
freed 
gerasimov said that as of thursday only 11 people still were 
being held under the four laws involved in western complaints there 
are another 25 insane people not condemned because they were sent 
for compulsory medical treatment 
of the 11 he said two people are incarcerated under article 227 
which bans criminal offenses under the pretext of practicing 
religion

sen dan quayle said thursday that george 
bush picked him for the second spot on the republican ticket at 
least in part to create a little excitement at the gop 
convention 
grounded temporarily at the owensboro airport while mechanics 
replaced an auxiiary power unit on his campaign plane quayle 
standing in the lobby of the hangar reflected on his campaign 
experience 
he said his reception by crowds at campaign rallies had given him 
a lot of exhilaration on the other hand he said i guess my 
biggest disappointment was what he called the totally unfair 
initial news media coverage of his candidacy 
im willing to let bygones be bygones he said but quayle 
added that when the campaign is over its going to be a very 
interesting discussion that you all are going to have about 
yourselves 
if he could change anything about the campaign quayle said he 
would have skipped the postnew orleans convention week in which he 
was hit with harsh personal attacks about what i did 20 years 
ago 
quayle was faced with questions about the circumstances under 
which he signed up for an indiana national guard unit in 1969 
during the vietnam war and about how he got admitted to the law 
school with what basically was a c transcript from high school 
he has denied repeatedly that any improper influence was used in 
either instance 
on thursday quayle acknowledged that he was mostly an unknown 
commodity when bush announced his selection on aug 16 the second 
day of the gop convention in new orleans and he said that the press 
had a duty to scrutinize him 
what he bush wanted to do was create a little excitement at 
the republican convention quayle said 
he grimaced when asked if that was the principal reason bush 
chose him saying no also for my qualifications experience and 
so forth 
quayle also referred to the close supervision and handling he got 
from representatives of the bush campaign in the weeks immediately 
following the new orleans convention 
i never like to monday morning quarterback he said i 
would have made the change of not having a a controlled environment 
earlier but that was a decision i had to make myself 
quayle who told reporters several weeks ago that he was 
declaring his independence from such tight control also said 
thursday however he recognized a need for special handling 
initially because i didnt know the ground rules of running a 
national campaign 
in a speech prepared later at a rally attended by more than 4000 
people on the campus of oklahoma state university quayle said that 
michael dukakis tough position on drugs rings hollow 
he said that mr dukakis is coming out with a lot of tough talk 
about a war on drugs then quayle quoted massachusetts attorney 
general james shannon a democrat as saying five months ago 
were losing the war on drugs in the commonwealth of 
massachusetts 
quayle aides said that mitchell had made the statement in a june 
10 article in the new york times 
if mr dukakis cant fight drugs effectively in his own 
backyard how can he make claims to do so for america the senator 
asked 
shannon issued a statement through the dukakis campaign saying 
the reason we have a drug problem in massachusetts and 49 other 
states is because george bush blew the one job ronald reagan gave 
him and that was to spearhead the administrations war on drugs 
while gov dukakis led the nation in bringing early drug 
education into the schools and spending more money on drug 
enforcement george bush was asleep at the wheel 
in kentucky quayle his aides secret service agents and the 
traveling press corps spent more than three hours at the terminal 
before boarding the boeing 727 for the flight to south carolina 
at one point the senator accompanied by a small group of 
reporters was driven to the town square mall in owensboro and to 
thornburys toy store to shop for his son benjamin who turns 12 
saturday 
quayle visited with employees while he shopped exclaimed this 
is reaganomics at work when he spotted a toy on sale and paid his 
5142 bill with a credit card

supporter of pinochet 
pinochet the army commanderinchief named maj gen jorge 
zincke as deputy the man who handles the daytoday business in the 
service while pinochet devotes most of his time to the presidency 
as commander of santiago garrison zincke was widely credited 
with mantaining order during the oct 5 referendum when voters 
rejected a proposal by the military that pinochet extend his 15 
years in power until 1997 zinckes performance that day drew praise

pinochets power since he led the military in a 1973 coup

close friend and santiago governor stay in the army despite 
reaching retirement age among those retired for institutional 
reasons was gen ernesto videla who has been a deputy foreign

his peers and among many civilian politicians

nurses went doortodoor in a small amish 
community in this western new york town in an effort to contain an 
outbreak of whooping cough 
the number of confirmed cases rose wednesday from six to 11 with 
at least 20 other children showing whooping cough symptoms said 
mary anne power supervising health nurse for cattaraugus county 
in 1982 a similar outbreak in the same community located about 
45 miles south of buffalo lasted three months and affected more 
than 200 children 
weve got to do something now or it is going to get out of 
hand said dr dana anderson 
the nurses are trying to promote immunizations encourage sick 
children to get treatment and urge parents of children with whooping 
cough to keep their children out of the amishrun schools for three 
weeks said county health commissioner dr james garvey 
the outbreak has attracted more attention since the death monday 
of 3monthold isaac shetler of conewango the first person to die 
of whooping cough in the united states since 1985 federal health 
officials said 
word of his death passed through the scattered amish farms 
tuesday which brought concerned amish mothers to the clinic on 
wednesday seeking medicine for their babies 
health officials fear the medicine may not be enough to prevent 
the further spread of the disease among the amish because of their 
reluctance to immunize their children 
whooping cough or pertussis is a respiratory disease that 
causes a chronic cough vomiting and the characteristic whooping 
noise when those afflicted gasp for air 
to adults its usually no more threatening than a common cold 
but to infants and small children it can be lifethreatening 
federal health officials said 
most american children receive a series of dpt immunizations 
that protect them from diphtheria pertussis and tetanus the 
immunization is required in new york for children attending public 
schools unless there are extenuating health or religious reasons 
the amish who shun modern customs and technology only 
halfheartedly are accepting treatment health officials said and 
would rather deal with this problem themselves 
one amish man with a long uneven red beard under a 
broadbrimmed black hat and wearing denim work clothes talked about 
the problem 
its like theyre looking down on us because our kidsve got 
the whooping cough like were the poor dirty amish who dont take 
care of our children like were being mean to our kids the man 
said 
well we have got the whooping cough but they have got drugs 
and people shooting each other in the street he said he did not 
give his name 
his brotherinlaw agrees 
only the good lord knows why a child dies if the good lord 
wants my child to die a natural death its better than dying of 
drug abuse our way works for us and its a free world isnt it

marylands urban black precincts are shaping up 
as the crucial battleground in the final days of a bitter referendum 
fight over the states pioneering handgun law 
the importance of the black areas was underscored thursday when 
jesse jackson gave a passionate endorsement of the law in a rally at 
predominately black morgan state university 
before the rally jackson told wbal radio i support people 
having guns on reservations to hunt game i support people having 
the right to guns in their houses but not to have guns to hunt 
other people i say lets stop the guns and stop the drugs and 
lets go another way 
the 6monthold law designed to outlaw cheap pistols known as 
saturday night specials creates a ninemember board with authority 
to outlaw the sale and manufacture of handguns it deems dont have 
legitimate uses for recreation or personal security 
the jackson appearance was an attempt to undercut the strategy 
progun forces hope will result in the laws repeal next tuesday 
win big in the states rural areas break even in the white suburbs 
and keep the margin down in black precincts 
according to a masondixon poll conducted oct 2930 blacks who 
are 22 percent of the maryland electorate support the law 55 
percent to 29 percent with 16 percent still undecided no margin of 
error was given for that part of the poll because the sampling was 
small 
overall marylanders favor the law approximately 48 percent to 44 
percent with 9 percent undecided according to the poll the polls 
overall margin of error was 35 percentage points 
advocates of repeal argue the law would open the door to 
banishment of all handguns that message is being given to black 
voters along with the argument the law discriminates against the 
poor because it would make inexpensive weapons unavailable 
the laws suporters counter by noting that guns are the leading 
cause of death among young black men in maryland and insisting it 
will make the streets of their communities safer 
the laws opponents acknowledge that their cause has been damaged 
by an inability to garner the support of highprofile black leaders 
a fact they blame on pressure from the white political establishment 
if we had had an even break in terms of power structure 
endorsements we would have been over the top already said george 
young a california political consultant who is directing the repeal 
effort 
there is a linkage between black politicians and white liberals 
having to do with political fund raising and to the extent 
black people are philosophically or economically committed to 
being friends with the liberal structure they just cant afford to 
take a stand against this structure young said 
that analysis infuriated james abraham who is leading the 
prolaw campaign in black areas 
thats racist really it infers we dont have any political 
integrity its nasty and i dont like it abraham said 
abraham in turn charged the progun forces with trying to buy 
the votes of blacks by hiring blacks to do doortodoor canvassing

crowd of 8000 people often interrupted by applause the prime 
minister pledged to improve social and environmental conditions 
i declare 1989 the year of housing and the environment said 
the prime minister 
ms charles vowed to continue her fight against government

force this nation of 100000 people has no army navy or air force

the island the largest and most northern of the windward islands 
with guadeloupe to the north and martinique to the south 
during a morning service at the roman catholic cathedral in 
roseau the capital bishop arnold bogheart said a theme for the day 
should be solidarity including some form of meaningful unitary 
status among the seven englishspeaking nations of the 
organization of eastern caribbean states 
the island states have been attempting to form a political union 
ever since the breakup of the west indies federation 30 years ago 
dominica which has had a stormy political past and is one of the 
least developed countries in the caribbean is undergoing a major 
economic reconstruction in a period of political stability 
the island gained independence from britain on nov 3 1978 and 
almost immediately plunged into disorder after the former dominica 
labor party government of prime minister patrick john was implicated 
in an unsuccessful invasion of barbados led by mercenaries 
john was ousted amid popular disturbances in may 1979 and oliver 
seraphine formed an interim government but seraphines government 
also was beset by scandals 
shortly after the election of ms charles and her dominica 
freedom party in july 1980 the country went through a period of 
kidnappings murders and three unsuccessful coup attempts one of 
which resulted in the arrest of us and canadian mercenaries 
allegedly tied to the ku klux klan 
in addition to political problems the young nation has been hit 
by a series of hurricanes including one in 1979 that destroyed 60 
percent of its crops and devastated transportation and 
communications 
the 69yearold ms charles a conservative who was elected to a 
second fiveyear term in july 1985 was a leading proponent of the 
usled invasion of grenada in october 1983 
most of dominicas inhabitants are descendants of african slaves 
imported by planters in the 18th century english is the official 
language but most dominicans speak a frenchbased creole 
reflecting the countrys french colonial heritage

portauprince haiti ap radio stations on thursday announced 
the contents of a draft decree proposed by haitis military rulers 
which says a governmentappointed electoral college will run 
elections and write an electoral law 
the draft decree said the electoral board made up of nine 
governmentappointed representatives one from each of haitis 
provinces will also control voter registration and arbitrate 
disputes between candidates radio haiti inter said 
the decree bears the names of haitian ruler lt gen prosper 
avril and all 12 cabinet ministers the station said 
the draft project is quite simply anticonstitutional a scheme 
to get around the constitution said dr louis roy coauthor of 
the constitution massively approved by haitians in a 1987 referendum 
the 1987 constitution considered the most liberal in haitis 
184year history provides for an independent electoral council 
appointed by institutions such as the roman catholic church human 
rights groups and journalists associations 
it is not possible to restore the constitution by 
anticonstitutional means in avrils version of the electoral 
institution the executive names the members and deprives it 
thereby of its independence roy said 
after he was appointed president by soldiers who ousted lt gen 
henri namphy on sept 17 avril promised to respect the 
constitution human rights and return haiti to democracy 
avril told opposition politicians that elections could not be 
held for at least another two years 
the government delivered copies of the draft decree to several 
radio stations political parties and professional groups in 
portauprince asking for comments and suggestions which may be 
incorporated into the decree before it is made into law by the 
military government radio haiti inter said 
namphy had suspended the constitution saying it was inspired by 
foreign ideas 
soldiers said they ousted namphy because they were sickened by 
unpunished acts of terrorism and statesponsored violence 
namphy abolished the independent electoral council on nov 29 
hours after thugs protected by soldiers shot and hacked to death at 
least 36 voters in what would have been haitis first truly free 
election 
an attempt by namphy to override the independent council and 
rewrite the electoral law in june 1987 touched off a wave of 
antigovernment protests and strikes which left over 30 dead and 
dozens wounded 
namphy replaced dictator jeanclaude duvalier who fled to france 
in february 1986

a man whose murder conviction in the slaying of a 
dallas police officer drew national attention because of questions 
raised in the documentary movie the thin blue line has a chance 
at a new trial 
state district judge larry baraka on wednesday agreed to hear 
arguments from attorneys that new evidence some of which was 
allegedly suppressed during his original trial proves randall dale 
adams did not kill the dallas officer 
i felt there was a sufficient amount of issues raised to cause 
the court concern enough to look into it baraka said 
after hearing evidence nov 30 baraka will tell the texas court 
of criminal appeals whether he believes adams deserves a new trial 
the appeals court is the only texas court that has the power to 
grant such a trial 
in 1977 adams was convicted of killing officer robert wood who 
was shot to death on a nearly deserted street nov 28 1976 
adams attorney randy schaffer contends that adams is innocent 
and that the real killer was david ray harris the states key 
witness against him in statements to newspapers and in the movie 
the thin blue line harris has said adams is innocent 
harris is on death row for a different killing 
dallas county district attorney john vance said his office would 
contest the motion and dismissed harris statements saying he is 
simply seeking publicity 
adams originally was sentenced to death but gov bill clements 
in 1979 commuted his term to life

us undercover agents have cracked an 
international smuggling ring that relied on south african soldiers 
to kill endangered rhinoceros in angola federal authorities said 
thursday 
three connecticut residents were arrested and the us government 
was seeking the arrest and extradition of three south africans 
including an army sergeant major in a parachute unit who smuggled a 
rhinoceros horn into the united states while attending a skydiving 
event 
officials said the six smuggled into the united states black and 
white rhinoceros horns seven ak47 machine guns cheetah skins and 
leopard skins including one allegedly owned by former rhodesia 
prime minister ian smith 
more arrests were possible said us attorney stanley a twardy 
jr 
twardy said at a news conference those charged in the scheme 
indicated to undercover agents they had enough rhino horns to earn 
hundreds of thousands of dollars 
a eugene hester the northeast regional director of the us 
fish amp wildlife service said the seizure and purchase of the rhino 
horns by undercover agents was the largest haul of its type in this 
country 
the importation of rhino horn is illegal in most countries 
including the united states because the animal is nearly extinct 
still an illicit trade reportedly worth 3 million a year 
flourishes in the middle east and eastern asia where dealers pay 
450 a pound wholesale 
rhino horn powder in the united states can sell for up to 450 an 
ounce twardy said 
in the far east rhino horn is ground into traditional medicines 
that are said to reduce fever and stop nosebleeeds it is also 
treasured in north yemen where the horns are carved into dagger 
handles that sell for up to 15000 each 
there were at one time 120 species of rhinoceros but only five 
species now remain including black and white rhinos 
arrested wednesday night were john c lukman jr 34 of 
newington mary ann mcallister 33 of west hartford and russell d 
beveridge jr 32 of newington twardy said 
each of the defendants was charged with conspriracy to commit an 
offense against the united states a crime that can be punished by 
up to five years in prison and a 250000 fine twardy said other 
charges would be filed 
lukman mcallister and beveridge appeared in us district court 
in hartford on thursday mcallister and beveridge each were released 
on 25000 nonsurety bonds but lukmans case was continued to 
friday because officials feared he might leave the country 
according to court documents the six defendants agreed to sell 
five to seven rhino horns to a fish amp wildlife service agent for 
40000 each in august lukman sold an undercover agent a 36 
kilogram white rhinceros horn for 40000 the documents state 
lukman also asked undercover agents to sell a leopard rug that 
his friend ian smith had given him he reportedly had visited 
smith in august in zimbabwe the court documents state 
we do know he does have a relationship with ian smith twardy 
said adding that smith was not a target of the investigation

police exchanged gunfire with students 
and the two largest universities suspended classes indefinitely 
thursday on the third day of student riots over the killing of 14 
fishermen by venezuelan troops 
police surrounded caracas central university and and firing 
broke out between police and students inside there were no 
immediate reports of injuries traffic was blocked around the 
university 
police spokesmen claimed the students possessed automatic 
weapons and witnesses confirmed gunfire was coming from inside the 
grounds 
students looted several vehicles including a candy truck from 
which they distributed candy among themselves the witnesses said 
in the first two days of rioting at least 15 students were 
wounded at the university said student spokesman bernardo ansidey 
ansidey said the students planned to continue their protests he 
did not say if students were using firearms against police 
central university with more than 50000 students and the 
university of the andes in merida 300 miles southwest of caracas 
with more than 30000 students suspended all activities 
in merida the state governor ordered troops on alert and had 
tanks standing by in case the riots did not die down students there 
inflicted almost 1 million worth of damage by sacking stores in the 
commercial district according to ramon diaz suarez a reporter for 
frontera a merida newspaper 
suarez said studentpolice battles at merida over the three days 
had left at least 20 students wounded bringing the national total 
to at least 35 students injured he said at least seven police were 
injured 
earlier thursday two survivors of the massacre of 14 people by 
venezuelan border guards said they still fear for their lives 
because of what they saw 
an opposition party deputy accompanying the men at a crowded news 
conference claimed informers told him that not all 14 men died on 
the spot and some were executed later 
showing sworn documents which said they were venezuelan 
fishermen jose augusto arias 35 and wilmer gregorio pinilla 27 
denied any connection with colombias national liberation army the 
leftist movement to which venezuelan military authorities suspect 
the fishermen belong 
they can kill us so that we dont say anything we are afraid 
they will kill us so we cannot act as witnesses said pinilla 
they maintained the group was fishing saturday on the arauca 
river near their town of el amparo 360 miles southwest of caracas 
when venezuelan troops suddenly opened fire 
a military commander later said the group carried weapons and 
leaflets issued by colombian guerrillas 
but the survivors contend they carried only a fishing net two 
knives and a machete they said the only political propaganda they 
had was a portrait of carlos andres perez the venezuelan government 
partys candidate for the dec 4 presidential election 
most fishermen belonged to the government accion democratica 
party they said 
we know nothing of guerrillas we had just turned off the motor 
of our canoe to get close to the river bank when the shots started 
they gave us no warning said pinilla he said he and arias swam 
to el amparo 
socialist deputy walter marquez who accompanied the two men 
said he was told that not all of the 14 died in the initial attack 
they were executed later there is no other way to explain how 
the venezuelan security police knew pinillas and arias names 
before the survivors appeared marquez said 
he said the cadavers were stripped of their clothes and dressed 
with others carrying colombian army bands to support military 
authorities insistence that the dead men were guerrillas 
marquez said he would call for congress to solicit autopsies

algerians on thursday massively approved 
a series of constitutional changes inspired by bloody riots a month 
ago to loosen the grip of the sole political party on national life 
and separate it from the government 
the interior ministry announced early friday that 9272 percent 
of those who voted said yes to the changes proposed by president 
chadli bendjedid 
the referendum is the first step in reforms that eventually may 
permit independent candidates to run for office and remove the 
staterun economy from central control 
the ruling national liberation front led the fight that won 
independence from france in 1962 and has controlled the north 
african countrys political economic social cultural and judicial 
affairs ever since 
a month after riots rocked algeria voters peacefully cast 
ballots at 36775 polling stations throughout the country turnout 
was put at 8308 percent of algerias 12 million voters 
bendjedid voted soon after polls opened at the ghazali school in 
the el mouradia section of algiers 
at the concorde school for boys in the bir mouradais 
neighborhood businessman joubi wacer placed his ballot in a brown 
voting box and said its the beginning of change after this 
things will be different at least i hope so 
crowds of young men and a few veiled elderly women walked to and 
from the school where a single blueuniformed guard stood by the 
gate there was no indication of special security in the capital and 
shoppers filled downtown streets in the late afternoon 
last month soldiers and police fired on mobs of young men 
killing 176 people by official count during the week of riots 
unofficial reports put the number of dead at 400 or more 
demonstrators in algiers and provincial cities were protesting 
food shortages unemployment and a decline in the standard of living 
blamed on the plummeting price of oil algerias chief export 
in a televised speech at the time bendjedid tried to ease the 
unrest by promising a greater voice to people outside the national 
liberation front 
kamel belkacem publisher of the proreform weekly newspaper 
algerie actualite said the proosals on thursdays ballot were 
designed to put an end to the partys power monopoly and they 
offer the challenge of democracy to the country its extraordinary 
a veritable revolution for algeria 
belkacem said in an interview that he expected the country to 
enter a period of democratic apprenticeship after the vote 
in presenting the referendum as a first step bendjedid said 
further changes would be considered by a party congress later this 
month and submitted to voters in another referendum next year 
the national liberation front will remain the sole legal party 
but belkacem said he believes the presidents ultimate goal is free 
and open elections 
several provisions in thursdays referendum make subtle but 
important changes that separate the government from the party for 
instance new wording in the constitution would say the president 
incarnates the unity of the nation rather than incarnates the 
unity of the party and the state 
some powers not specified would be shifted from the president 
to the premier who would answer to the parliament for his 
governments policies the premier now answers only to the 
president and in practice has only limited authority

former philippine president ferdinand marcos said 
thursday he will comply with a federal judges order that he and his 
wife imelda submit their fingerprints voice prints and handwriting 
samples to a grand jury 
ill take my destiny whatever that may be but im going to 
fight for my dignity and honor marcos told the associated press 
in an exclusive interview his first meeting with the press since 
being indicted two weeks ago on racketeering charges 
us district judge john walker ordered the former president and 
first lady of the philippines to appear wednesday at the fbis 
offices in honolulu to comply with the subpoenas 
if they dont said walker the marcoses both ferdinand and 
imelda must appear before me on nov 10 for imposition of 
sanctions 
marcos accused with his wife of plundering more than 100 
million from their homeland and spending it in the united states 
said he would meet his legal obligations and had been offered no 
promises by the federal government 
no i am not afraid of going to jail said marcos who sat in 
a wheelchair during the interview i would probably be dead by the 
time the trial is over im feeling in pain every day 
the marcoses and eight others were indicted after more than two 
years investigation other grand juries here and in west virginia 
are still investigating marcos but he said he was sure he would be 
vindicated 
i dont think they have any evidence said marcos citing 
past investigations in the united states the philippines and japan 
which he said cleared him of similar charges 
marcos did not say whether he would testify before a 
congressional subcommittee investigating allegations that he 
illegally funneled millions of dollars into president reagans 1980 
and 1984 campaign funds but denied the accusations 
we never contributed to any political activities in the united 
states and the federal elections commission reached that same 
conclusion he said 
marcos 71 said he held no hard feelings for president reagan 
who had hailed marcos as a staunch us ally and allowed the 
marcoses to settle here after their fall from power in february 1986 
its nothing personal we just feel that the worship of the 
statue of liberty may have been displaced marcos said we feel 
betrayed by an american system that we believed to be fair and just 
now it seems that is not true 
mrs marcos pleaded innocent in new york on monday but her 
husbands arraignment was postponed pending a report by a government 
physician who examined him the same day 
defense lawyers contend marcos is too frail for the 10hour 
flight to new york and the interview with the ap was cut short by 
aides who said marcos was late for a medical appointment 
during thursdays hearing at federal court in new york city 
which mrs marcos did not attend walker did not specify what 
sanctions he would impose but said he would hold in abeyance the 
issuance of a bench warrant for their arrests 
assistant us attorney linda imes in arguing that the material 
was still needed despite the couples indictment last month and mrs 
marcos fingerprinting this week revealed there is an ongoing 
investigation by the grand jury 
she would reveal no more in open court citing grand jury secrecy 
laws 
marcos lawyer sandor frankel said the couple sought a stay 
earlier in the day from us supreme court justice thurgood marshall 
after earlier losses in the legal wrangle before walker and the 
2nd us circuit court of appeals in new york the marcoses are 
seeking a hearing before the supreme court and asked marshall to 
stay any action against them until the high court decides on whether 
to hear their case said frankel 
barring a stay they will comply with walkers order 
frankel told reporters after the hearing 
the marcoses were indicted on racketeering charges by a federal 
grand jury in manhattan oct 21 for allegedlly diverting more than 
100 million from their nations treasury into swiss bank accounts 
manhattan real estate and fine art 
the same grand jury subpoenaed the couple earlier this year for 
fingerprints palm prints voice and handwriting samples and also 
for their authorization for foreign banks to turn over their 
financial records 
the marcoses balked claiming they still maintained 
headofstate immunity but walker dismissed that claim and 
found them in contempt of court in august 
a federal appeals court upheld walkers finding and reinstated 
the contempt finding as well as an arrest warrant for the marcoses 
its the governments position that its now time for 
compliance with these subpoenas ms imes told walker 
she requested that if the couple did not comply by monday they 
be arrested and jailed 
but frankel said president and mrs marcos will comply with 
their legal obligations adding theres no need for any warrant 
to compel their compliance 
mrs marcos was arraigned and pleaded innocent to the 
racketeering charges monday her exact whereabouts were unknown

us department of energy documents filed in 
court show evidence of previously undisclosed releases of 
radioactive materials into groundwater from the fernald uranium 
processing plant state officials say 
more radioactive radium was released into an aquifer under the 
plant than had been realized increasing the potential health threat 
to nearby residents state officials said the great miami aquifer 
provides water to some southwestern ohio communities and businesses 
near fernald 18 miles northwest of cincinnati 
ohio environmental protection agency officials said they learned 
of increased radium releases into the great miami river system and 
into waste pits at the plant from documents in a 300 million 
classaction lawsuit that neighbors of the plant filed against its 
former operator national lead of ohio inc 
its definitely new stuff were not aware of it ohio epa 
spokesman graham mitchell said wednesday he said the state epa did 
not know radium had ever been dumped into the waste pits at the feed 
materials production center plants 1050acre site 
the documents filed by the us department of energy are part 
of the defense the department has prepared for national lead of ohio 
inc the 37yearold plants operator prior to 1985 when 
westinghouse materials co took over 
the residents sued in us district court three years ago 
contending nlo allowed radioactive uranium dust to escape from the 
plant damaging their health and property the energy department 
says nlo was innocent because the company was ordered by energy 
department officials to violate environmental regulations in favor 
of increasing production 
energy department officials have refused to close the fernald 
plant saying its operations do not pose environmental dangers or 
put nearby residents at risk but the department has begun a 
10year 500 million cleanup and modernization effort 
news of the radium releases which the documents say occurred 
between 1966 and 1974 comes after politicians and environmentalists 
responded angrily to recent reports of greatly increased estimates 
of the amounts of uranium dust released by the plant into the 
atmosphere radium is a byproduct of decaying uranium 
day after day its another revelation one worse than the 
other us rep thomas luken dohio said its like the 
chinese water torture 
luken said he would ask the us epa to inspect the plant 
immediately 
the documents reviewed by ohio epa were reports and letters 
written by officials from the energy department and nlo inc they 
indicated that releases of radium into the great miami river had 
exceeded waterpollution standards in effect at the time ohio epa 
officials say 
plant managers also worried about the amount of radium they were 
dumping into a waste pit at the site the documents said 
steve wyatt a spokesman for the energy department said the 
amount of radium put into the pit was minuscule 
the plant is one of 16 nationally that produce nuclear weapons 
materials for the department of energy 
several other plants including savannah river in georgia and the 
rocky falts plant near denver are in various stages of shutdown 
while investigations are conducted into health and safety problems

with neither rebels nor army able to 
muster a knockout punch the civil war in southern sudan has become 
a stalemate with both sides using the areas 6 million civilians as 
pawns 
relief experts count as many as 260000 civilian deaths related 
to the war this year alone innumerable thousands more are suffering 
under siege warfare tactics being practiced by both sides 
government forces control most major towns but the rebel sudan 
peoples liberation army spla which seeks autonomy for the 
southern region is blockading many keeping supplies out and 
starving people in some relief officials like brian wannop of the 
united nations development program charge that the insurgents 
intentionally force others from their homes and into displaced 
persons camps to embarrass a government unable to care for them 
at the same time prime minister sadek elmahdis government in 
khartoum refuses to allow relief into rebelheld areas it has 
expelled several relief agencies on grounds they dealt with the 
rebels in providing help 
in late october it was disclosed that the united states had 
asked the spla for safe conduct to airlift food to 100000 people in 
the besieged southern town of aweil where an estimated 8000 
starved last summer and a similar fate still threatens thousands 
more 
the rebels withheld approval without a promise of an equal amount 
of aid going to a nearby town they control 
as deprivation leads inexorably toward manmade famine throughout 
an area as large as texas the war drags on with neither side 
indicating willingness to yield 
although the rebels have scored some recent battlefield 
successes engagements remain relatively small hampered by 
logistics problems on both sides 
tim niblock director of the middle east politics program at 
britains exeter university who has specialized in the study of 
sudan for 20 years sees little hope for change 
at present neither side has enough power to change the 
situation niblock said in a telephone interview from exeter 
unless there is a political breakthrough which seems very 
unlikely unless the government in the north changes i cannot 
imagine that either side can win with the present balance of power 
there will be a continuation of the present situation 
a string of peace initiatives and even pressure from western aid 
donors have failed to close the gap between government and rebel 
positions 
during five years of war a third of southern sudans civilian 
population has been put to flight in search of a haven in northern 
sudan and neighboring ethiopia the remaining 4 million people 
either are holed up with the army in major southern cities and towns 
or roam the countryside trying to avoid looting and attacks by 
rebels 
the government accuses the rebels main backer marxist ethiopia 
of being behind the insurgents refusal to negotiate a settlement 
many western experts believe the governments insistence on 
perpetuating islamic law in sudan is goading the rebels to continue 
the fight 
the roots of the conflict are complicated but it boils down 
basically to a war between the arabdescended moslem majority in the 
north and the ethnically african christian and animist minority in 
the south this cleavage has existed during much of sudans recent 
history which began with independence from britain and egypt on 
jan 1 1956 
traditionally the north has dominated the country it has kept 
from the south income from sales of southern mineral wealth and 
crops putting precious little back into the backward southern 
society 
a renegade army colonel john garang began his rebellion in the 
spring of 1983 demanding autonomy for the three southern provinces 
a larger share in the economy and administrative reforms 
thenpresident gaafar nimeiri imposed islamic law throughout 
sudan the following september fueling the insurrection after the 
army overthrew nimeiri 18 months later garang vowed to fight on 
until islamic law or sharia is abolished 
prime minister elmahdi refused saying that garang is trying to 
dictate how sudans 16 million moslems should live but unlike 
nimeiri the prime minister agrees to exempt nonmoslems from 
islamic law 
on the battlefield the government admits that the rebels have 
made gains in recent weeks it described the losses of six 
government garrisons as tactical withdrawals 
western military sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the rebels also are putting increased pressure on an important 
garrison at nasir in the upper nile province 
taking nasir they said could give garangs movement a strong 
foothold to increase its attacks on the central and western parts of 
upper nile additionally pressure on torit in the equatoria region 
could open the rebels way to the important southern capital juba 
the western sources said 
there is a deterioration of the situation in eastern equatoria 
and in upper nile around nasir elmahdi said in an interview 
but the security situation in the rest of the country is much 
better and no doubt these advances will be revoked as in the past 
the successive setbacks sent the government into action 
the defense minister abdelmaged hamed khalil and commander in 
chief fathi ahmed ali made hushedup visits to libya and iraq in 
early october and arranged military aid including ammunition and 
bombs western analysts speculated the army planned to use the new 
bombs to mount air raids on eastern equatoria and relieve pressure 
on government installations there 
diplomats said the rebels have held an upper hand in the fighting 
for 18 months even during last winters dry season when the 
government traditionally takes the offensive and recovers lost 
ground 
during rainy seasons ending in late october the rebels 
emphasize their bushfighting skills small lightly armed units 
move easily using tall grass as cover for hitandrun guerrilla 
tactics government forces become virtual sitting ducks in their 
garrisons 
western military experts in khartoum said many army troopers are 
demoralized by a lack of supplies food and medicines 
nevertheless said niblock the british expert the rebels have 
a disincentive to gain further territory in the south because 
they cant feed the people in areas they control that creates a 
certain balance 
he said that although the rebels claim control over 90 percent of 
the southern countryside large areas remain under neither side

midnight street theater cuban jazz 
flamenco dance roving street clowns and mimes its all part of the 
international cervantes festival a twoweek celebration staged each 
fall in this charming colonial city 
the 16th annual edition of mexicos cultural event features about 
150 dance theater and music repertory groups from 57 countries and 
mexico 
it also draws countless unofficial folk bands clowns and 
mimes to the twisting cobblestoned streets and hidden alleys of 
guanajuato a 16th century silver mining town about 225 miles 
northwest of mexico city 
the festival is an expression of friendship between peoples 
says lourdes gomez a spokeswoman for the cervantino as the event 
is known in spanish people forget about their troubles and 
culture overcomes crisis 
each year thousands of visitors from mexico and abroad enjoy 
nearcontinuous performances staged in streets theaters parks and 
openair stages throughout the city 
the sounds of andean flute music give way to brass reggae and 
rock n roll strollers always seem to be gathered on some street 
or plaza enjoying an impromptu mime act or a play sandwiched between 
the festivals headline events 
among them was the stirring performance last week by mario mayas 
flamenco dance company the andalusian gypsy theater the sharp 
clipped vibrations of the troupes exaggerated handclapping and 
footstepping were felt throughout the fourtiered juarez theater 
the choreographer born into a gypsy family that lived in a cave 
in granada spain says he began experimenting with forms of 
flamenco dance theater in the 1960s as a way to fight the 
marginalization of gypsy culture under the franco regime 
for me it was a necessity flamenco was a way of expression 
of spreading the culture through theater maya says describing 
his efforts as the folklorization of flamenco 
the troupes sharp dance score complemented by an encore of 
individual performances elicited bravos and a standing ovation in 
the theater 
the smell of roasted corn husks filled the air as jose maria 
vitiers ninepiece jazz band from cuba torched the openair stage 
at guanajuatos downtown granary the site of bloody fighting during 
mexicos fight for independence from spain 
with vitier hammering on a steinway and electric pianos and 
lazaro gonzalez on violin the ensemble sped through 12 numbers that 
included a percussiondriven rendition of keith jarretts my 
song 
those who werent at the granary were on the street in front of 
the juarez theater surrounding indian saxophonist kandri gopalnath 
as he knelt on a 7foot square persian rug and wailed on the 
instrument 
fusing the western sax with eastern musical strands gopalnaths 
freeform instrumental at times differed little from the sounds of 
sitar and provoked wondrous stares from some in the crowd and 
evident delight among others 
guatemalas fine arts marimba ensemble offered a melodious 
sampling of ancient mesoamerican songs inside the colonial temple 
of san diego church the group displayed the remarkable flexibility 
of the marimba in wrapping up its performance with mambo merengue 
and even polka numbers 
with guanajuatos streets under cover of darkness a woman in 
peasant dress emerged from an alleyway into the central plaza jardin 
pounding on a drum and heralding the beginning of a phantomlike 
spectacle by italys tascabile de bergamo theater troupe 
the silent drama albatross was performed by four actors on 
stilts draped in white and scarlet and carrying torches its story 
of lovers who are threatened by the seductress albatross coursed 
through guanajuatos narrow streets at midnight as the crowd of 
spectators eagerly followed 
the play reached its dramatic conclusion in the plaza jardin when 
other evil albatrosses appeared screaming on rooftops above 
their white robes in stark contrast against the night sky 
these were but a sampling of the cervantes festivals offerings 
to a delighted public the jamaican reggae band chalice britains 
eclectic bow gamelan ensemble the soviet unions vilnius opera 
ballet theater anna sokolows dance company and igors cowboy jazz 
band from the united states also staged appearances

with his political opposition in 
disarray prime minister rajiv gandhi has been traveling about the 
country meeting the people and cameras of the governmentrun 
television network have been close behind 
gandhi is not required to call an election until the end of 1989 
but speculation is mounting in the press that he will call what is 
known as a snap election as early as march to take advantage of 
the disorder in opposition ranks 
some indians see television as a factor that could help gandhi 
counter his fall in popularity in recent years an opinion poll in 
august indicated a united opposition could easily defeat gandhis 
longentrenched congress party and deny him another fiveyear term 
in recent days millions of people in cities and villages have 
watched on television sets as gandhi toured violencetorn punjab or 
trekked through mud and water to villages inundated by flash floods 
his italianborn wife sonia a step behind 
the scenes have become a regular part of the 20minute hindiand 
englishlanguage newscasts on the governmentrun television network 
doordarshan 
when gandhi came to power following the assassination of his 
mother prime minister indira gandhi four years ago televisions 
influence spanned less than 20 percent of the country but his 
closest aides immediately recognized its importance 
his mother used television mainly for political purposes 
important rallies and speeches and her trips aboard said ashis 
nanday a political analyst with the center for the study of 
developing societies 
her son has taken it one step farther using it to project 
himself not only as a leader but as a person to a large number of 
indians he is the first indian prime minister who is also a 
television personality 
today television is available in almost 75 percent of the 
country the entire country will be within reach of doordarshans 
transmitters by the end of next year when an election must be 
called 
gandhis travels before the camera come as a fractious and 
pugnacious opposition is trying to rally under the green flag of the 
janata dal peoples party 
janata dal a patchwork of three regional parties is pinning its 
hopes on viswanath pratap singh a former gandhi ally and now one of 
the prime ministers most vocal critics but the new coalition party 
has been beset by bickering internal power struggles and 
accusations of corruption and nepotism 
after the opinion poll suggested a united opposition could unseat 
gandhi in the upcoming elections the biweekly magazine india today 
wrote of janata dal while its leaders pontificate piously about 
the evils of the rajiv gandhi government they themselves are no 
angels and as they spit and bark and growl at each other in a 
public display of pettiness that passes off for unity talks they 
do themselves the voters and the nation a grave disservice 
the poll conducted for india today indicated gandhis 
popularity had plunged to an alltime low and that if the opposition 
could come together and remain united it would be within striking 
distance of ousting the congress party which has governed for all 
but 29 months of indias 42 years as an independent nation 
but the poll also indicated that nearly twothirds of the 13000 
voters questioned didnt know the 54yearold singh the 
oppositions leading candidate 
singh seemed unconcerned however 
i have patience he said let me exhaust my weapons before 
i show my trump card

two bright yellow buoys in the cobalt blue 
sea around this volcanic island protect an increasingly endangered 
italian treasure clear clean water and the rich marine life in it 
the buoys also mark one of the governments first efforts to save 
the seas that surround italy the ligurian tyrrhenian adriatic 
ionian and mediterranean 
from sea floor to surface from shore to three miles out the 
crystalline waters surrounding ustica an island about 35 miles 
north of sicily have been decreed a natural marine reserve 
along with a small corner of the adriatic near trieste to the 
north ustica was the first to enjoy special protection under a 
decree by the environmental and merchant marine ministries in 
november 1986 
the decree called for 18 more reserves among them sardinias 
sapphire seas and the thermal waters of the aeolian islands off 
sicilys northeast coast but so far ustica and trieste are the only 
ones to be created 
in usticas case the buoys mark a slice of the reserve in which 
just about every activity is forbidden fishing from boats or 
underwater boating and even swimming except for two small inlets 
where bathing is permitted local authorities can restrict fishing 
permits for the rest of the islands waters and undersea fishing is 
forbidden around half of the island 
usticas volcanic rocks and caves snare plankton carried by 
strong cold atlantic currents entering the mediterranean through 
gibraltar to the southeast and flow by the island plankton tiny 
forms of sea life are key links in the food chain for the islands 
exotic undersea greenhousemenagerie the results are 24hour 
undersea dining rooms as colorful as found in the tropics 
some samples from the sea swim in three fish tanks set up in an 
18thcentury stone guard tower on a bluff overlooking the reserve 
each tank represents a different depth of the sea there are 
crimson sea tomatoes which look like jelly apples spindly 
orange coral and sea roses creatures that seem like flowers 
spun out of delicate pink lace there are urchins too although 
fishing and disease have whittled down their numbers 
visitors can also see a slide show about fish too large for the 
tanks as well as strange denizens of the deep such as a sexchanging 
fish and sea spaghetti a plant that winds up in local salads 
for 30 years the island with its spectacularly clear waters 
has hosted gatherings of the worlds top divers and undersea 
specialists including the legendary jacques costeau 
usticas waters once abounded in large stone bass but no longer 
fishing with drag nets and indiscriminate catches by underwater 
fishermen have cut down the population of the species 
the world wildlife fund in italy which manages the trieste 
reserve estimates that the planned total of 20 reserves would 
protect barely 2 percent of italys coastal waters counting the two 
reserves and other small stretches of seashore watched over by 
environmental groups the wwf says only 40 miles of italys 5000 
miles of coastline now have some kind of protection 
we cant wait 10 years for the other 18 reserves says 
antonio canu of the wwfs rome office the sea will be ruined 
this summer was especially harsh for italian waters in july 
bathers had to abandon a fashionable tuscan beach for a week after 
an explosion at a pesticide plant spilled toxic chemicals over a 
stretch of italys northwest coast 
on the east coast gondoliers and their tourist clients in venice 
endured the stench of decaying algae which flourished on tons of 
untreated industrial and human garbage pouring into the lagoon 
for environmentalists ustica is an intelligent marriage of 
nature and tourism 
mayor nicola longo sees the reserve as a chance to control 
possible damage from tourism which is relatively new to ustica 
until the 1950s usticas guests were few and included suspected 
mafiosi sent into exile before that opponents of the mussolinis 
fascist regime were confined on the island they included antonio 
gramsci a founder of the italian communist party who recalled in 
letters from ustica that the islanders hadnt heard of radio when he 
arrived in 1926 
like the mayor who also makes the islands only wine for sale 
many of the 1200 islanders have two or more jobs or enterprises 
restaurant owners catch their customers fish parttime fishermen 
tend hillsides terraced with grapes or capers and fenced off by rows 
of prickly pear trees 
usticesi as the islanders are known leave the island to go to 
high school in palermo on sicily many of them never come back 
except for summers since work is scarce on the island

when james freedman took over as president 
of dartmouth college last year many on campus and among the alumni 
anticipated another in a line of reserved dontmakewaves leaders 
surprise 
unafraid to stir hornets nests freedman has made his mission 
clear ridding dartmouth of what some call its smart jock image 
and revealing the school as a haven for gifted students topnotch 
faculty and creative loners 
hes also taken on an offcampus student newspaper whose hardline 
conservative stands and activism have brought dartmouth publicity it 
doesnt want 
though most faculty members trustees and alumni seem pleased 
with freedman critics warn that the first president snce 1822 with 
no prior connection to this ivy league school is trying to create a 
north harvard a dartmouth alien to its own traditions and 
history 
freedman 52 a harvard graduate with a law degree from yale 
came to the college about 130 miles northwest of boston in july 
1987 a former president of the university of iowa and dean of the 
university of pennsylvanias law school he now presides over about 
4800 students who pay 13300 a year 
shortly after arriving he made clear his aggravation with the 
image of dartmouth students as extroverted gregarious 
partygoing athletically oriented overly prone to conformity 
wellrounded and intelligent but not intellectual 
that stereotype doesnt describe the dartmouth student body as 
a whole he said in an interview i see people who are writing 
novels i see people who are acting in plays i see people who are 
making films 
freedman wants to attract more top scholars women and 
minorities broaden exchange programs with foreign universities and 
enhance the life of the faculty by letting members expand their 
study and research 
he began the presidential scholars program flying in top 
high school scholars who were considering dartmouth and offering 
them vip treatment of 201 students targeted 63 chose dartmouth 
this year double the enrollment of top scholars last year 
the program also increased the number of women and minorities 
the current freshmen class is 45 percent women up from 38 percent 
about 25 percent of the freshmen are minority students up about 2 
percent 
but critics question freedmans programs 
why do you persist in turning dartmouth college into an 
elitist intellectual international university hobart van 
deusen a 1958 alumnus asked in a letter in the alumni magazine 
why do you not preserve dartmouth traditions 
jeffrey hart an english professor and faculty member since 1963 
said frnt know that dartmouth needs that 
a diverse 18member search committee unanimously chose freedman 
from 619 applicants and explained search chairman norman 
mccullough in james freedman the clear indication was that we 
were looking for an academician one who would lead the faculty in a 
collegial style and really one who could capitalize on an 
institution that was ripe for the next phase of growth 
i dont think theres any intention to change the basic 
character of dartmouth said george munroe who succeeded 
mccullough as chairman of the college trustees 
if we can upgrade its intellectual distinction which is 
already very high thats all to the good and to the extent that 
we can downgrade what some call the animal house image that 
certainly is all to the good 
freedman said his goals are traditional dartmouth aspirations 
but the college cannot be static for example he said its 
essential for dartmouth to have foreign students here if our 
students are going to be prepared for an international world 
in a march speech freedman showed his mettle and consolidated 
the opposition when he publicly chastised the offcampus dartmouth 
review the contentious weekly founded in 1980 with the support of 
such prominent conservatives as william f buckley and patrick 
buchanan 
the review has been central to many campus controversies 
including the 1986 smashing of symbolic antiapartheid shanties on 
the college green 
that incident inflamed an already polarized campus and provoked 
demonstrations arrests a rare suspenion of classes for a 
campuswide forum on racism student takeovers of campus buildings 
and a faculty vote of noconfidence in freedmans predecessor as 
president david mclaughlin 
early this year white review staffers and a black music 
professor clashed again prompting cries of racism 
after writing that professor william coles course was one of 
dartmouths most academically deficient the student reporters 
argued with cole in a classroom while seeking his reaction three 
were suspended for disrupting the class and harassing cole whom the 
review had earlier described as looking like a used brillo pad 
freedmans march speech to the faculty and news media denounced 
review reporters as ideological provocateurs posing as 
journalists who engage in malicious bullying tactics that 
threaten dartmouths commitment to diversity 
there was a real need for the kinds of words he spoke to be 
pronounced by somebody who had official leadership of the college 
said david sices a 1945 graduate who has taught french and italian 
for 31 years at dartmouth 
henry eberhardt director of the alumni fund for nine years 
agreed nobody had the guts to stand up and say that before him 
he said it was long overdue 
van deusen saw things differently 
hes appeasing the faculty just as simple as that he said 
he obviously wants to get one of the big constituencies of 
dartmouth on his side and he obviously did that 
hart said freedman turned an issue of academic quality and 
civility and manners into a racial cliche a wall street 
journal editorial said the incident illustrated discrimination 
against conservatives on campus 
the reviews lawyers have filed lawsuits alleging racial 
discrimination against whites and freespeech violations 
and conservative columnist james kilpatrick wrote that dartmouth 
has behaved shamefully only the most devoted friends of this 
small college could love it now 
as the disputes persist freedman acknowledges his outsiders 
view of dartmouth makes his job tougher 
but i do think it gives you a very great opportunity he 
said you just see the place through fresh eyes

for more than two decades bill lynch 
tried as an investigative reporter to ferret out corruption in a 
state where kickbacks and sweetheart deals were as much a part of 
the culture as mardi gras and cajun cooking 
shortly after gov buddy roemer took office in march lynch 
traded his notepad and job with the new orleans timespicayune for 
the newly created post of state inspector general 
his job may have changed but his mission hasnt 
weve never had an office before dedicated to the idea of 
running state government in an honest manner the way we can all be 
proud of lynch said 
his reputation as an investigative reporter was such that when 
the legislature passed a bill tacking on punitive damages to libel 
judgments in the late 1970s the statute became known as the lynch 
law the law was later repealed 
lynch 59 is the chief investigator for a governor who 
campaigned on the need to root out corruption in louisiana a 
legacy dating to the 1930s reign of huey p long 
starting with longs legendary deduct box containing money 
extorted from state employees for his political purposes political 
history here has been checkered the louisiana scandals of 1939 
resulted in the imprisonment of former gov dick leche in 1986 
former gov edwin edwards was acquitted of racketeering charges 
corruption in government has virtually been a way of life 
said lynch the thing we want to do is to turn that around both 
nationally and internationally louisiana has been looked upon with 
disdain contempt we want to change that perception 
but most importantly we want to change the substance we dont 
want people just to perceive that were honest people honest 
government thats what roemer asked me to do 
how does roemer rate lynchs performance so far excellent 
the governor said 
we inherited a mess and one person cant clean that up a 
governor cant do that alone roemer said we thought during the 
campaign and during the transition that the office of inspector 
general with enough teeth enough staff and enough independence to 
check every agency one by one would be in the taxpayers best 
interest 
i think bills done a terrific job a number of small 
suggestions and small savings and a number of bigpicture 
modifications 
for example 
lynchs investigation into the louisiana racing commission 
which regulates the states horse racing industry revealed payroll 
abuses and allegations that a commission telephone at louisiana 
downs the states major track was used to relay information to 
bookmakers roemer replaced the entire commission 
lynchs office recommended the dismissal of the executive 
director and the board of the governors special task force on 
education which handled federal grant programs for students at 
vocationaltechnical schools some students had to drop out because 
of delays in processing the grants according to an inspector 
generals report roemer is reviewing the report 
since a state official was investigated for using a government 
telephone for private longdistance calls the states monthly 
telephone bill has dropped by about 280000 a month the roemer 
administration says 
numerous violations of state travel regulations within agencies 
that generate their own funds through fees were uncovered lynchs 
office said members of the real estate commission traveled at state 
expense on a junket to hawaii 
lynchs job is limited to the executive branch of government 
twentytwo auditors work under him and he reports his findings 
directly to the governor 
the primary objective of this organization is to save money 
through the honest operation of government he said government 
was not just put here for the personal use of the individual 
though you couldnt tell it from the past several decades

among the poor european immigrants to americas 
urban centers earlier in this century were many with the same goals 
first a job then some savings and eventually a good place to live 
several other goals were high on the list but none was higher 
than getting the kids educated to be real americans at the 
other end were the dreams of success and even of owning a few 
shares of american telephone amp telegraph co 
their first homes usually were two or threefamily houses in 
poor areas singlefamily units were out of the question since they 
provided no rents and often cost just as much immigrants knew the 
value of rents 
they knew also how much they could afford and while they saw 
many houses they would have loved to own they settled for the 
rundown structure they could fix up with their own hands they made 
do with what they had 
the rundown house was their financial foothold in the new country 
many decades later it is still the immigrants now from other 
parts of the world as well who follow this practice some of the 
offspring of the earlier immigrants follow it too but many others 
scorn it as beneath their status 
the negative attitude toward rundown multiple units is a 
significant factor in one of the most publicized of housing 
problems the alleged inability of young firsttime buyers to 
afford a home of their own 
many of them can but many decline to seize the opportunity the 
same one that makes immigrant eyes bulge with amazement 
among arguments heard by real estate people is that such houses 
offer few amenities require too much timeconsuming labor and cause 
the landlords to live in areas not appropriate to their view of 
themselves 
a survey by era real estate a national chain found that 49 
percent of firsttime buyers would consider delaying a purchase if 
the home they could afford fell short of their ideal 
the irony of the attitude is that home prices seldom fall to 
accommodate the savings of wouldbe buyers whatever savings they 
are likely to accumulate are offset in the meantime by higher prices 
meanwhile the means to the home of their dreams is right before 
them if for the time being they can put up with something less that 
is the best way to the house of ones dreams is to settle for the 
house that is less than ideal 
firsttime homebuyers need to think about building equity with 
a home purchase now and then leveraging that later into the home of 
their dreams says ed gresham era president and chief executive 
officver 
it makes a lot of sense 
the less than desirable home may grow in value at a rate faster 
than the market in general thanks in part to the owners fixup 
efforts the mortgage provides automatic savings tax benefits 
reduce the owners federal income tax 
the first home might not have a swimming pool a patio a 
recreation room and a modern kitchen and baths but it has been 
shown over and over again to be a great way of obtaining all that in 
just a few years 
strangely the immigrant with little knowledge of american 
economic ways spots the opportunity almost immediately the 
countryborn can stand right before the answer and not see it

early in second citys 15th anniversary 
special a promising unknown character appears on the screen 
ive laid a bunch of trips on actors at the second city says 
this character identified as del close director he wears a 
hideous red shirt and waves a cigarette his mouth turned down in 
the relentless grimace of a society matron 
and some of these theyve been able to use and some they 
havent but im going to loop back to your previous question for a 
second because embedded in it is part of a question i didnt answer 
 
amazing whos doing this guy eugene levy joe flaherty martin 
short terrific makeup it could even be catherine ohara 
but the realization comes that this is del close director at 
second city in toronto and he really wants to talk about serious 
dramaturgical issues improvisation boon or bane 
yes second city is getting serious on this hourlong showtime 
special which appears saturday at 10 pm est repeat dates are 
nov 8 16 21 and 27 
del is all for improv a specialty of the second city troupe he 
loves improv not as a method of developing material but for itself 
like fireworks the most ephemeral of art forms once its 
gone finger snap its gone baby 
then comes bernard sahlins director who thinks del is if not 
all wet a bit moist for bernard improvisation is not a really 
presentational form 
so you thought second city did comedy huh 
fortunately most of the hour is devoted to laughs levy 
flaherty short and ohara are all present and so are andrea 
martin dave thomas and robin duke there are also two very funny 
guys who werent part of the sctv experience john hemphill who 
appears as the gunsel johnny prolongo and bald nervous don lake 
who plays a very bad lounge singer with a yen for peru 
theres no rust on these clowns yet however there is just a 
smidgen of selfcongratulation in this special as if the two emmys 
a dozen emmy nominations all the canadian awards and the critical 
adulation has been taken too seriously 
it shows in the montages of blackandwhite photos of times past 
reminding the viewer that dan aykroyd and gilda radner were in the 
original toronto cast and that john candy was later a star the same 
photos remind you that they arent in the special 
there is a feeling of dread that barbra streisand will begin 
crooning the way we were at any moment 
it never gets that far out of hand short notably can talk 
about technique without being pompous 
stallone and i had the same approach toward improvisation he 
says a few words just impact with physical fall down hit a 
wall hair like that go waaahaha 
there are four skits in the show each beginning with the stage 
version and then intercutting to a much more polished version with 
costumes makeup and scenery done for the cameras 
short appears twice as the old bore brian allen im brian 
allen and this is my wife mrs brian allen and as robespierre 
hes funny on stage but hilarious on camera his robespierre on 
stage isnt quite sure who he is but on film short adds a dazzling 
series of smiles simpers and eye flutters 
levy appearing as a snooty french waiter in the brian allen 
sketch shows yet again why he has the best spectacleandeyebrow 
act since groucho marx above the nose levy may be the funniest man 
alive 
catherine ohara is divine and andrea martin is wonderful and 
thomas is funny and isnt it awful that sctv still isnt on the 
air even at 1 am like it was when you had to sit through some of 
the worst of the saturday night live casts to catch the show on 
nbc 
but cant we just be happy that short flaherty and ohara are 
doing the completely mental misadventures of ed grimley every 
saturday and theyre doing movies and every once in a while 
someone drags out an sctv retrospective that gets lousy ratings and 
means sctv probably wont ever be back 
maybe del close has it right maybe sctv like fireworks was the 
most ephemeral of art forms and once its gone baby its gone

every year schools in southern missouri 
welcome hundreds of children who are as rootless as the tufts of 
cotton that drift with the autumn leaves through the streets of this 
bootheel town 
the southeast missouri migrant education center here part of a 
federal network that includes a southwest missouri branch in monett 
helps local schools bring some stability to the lives of the 
children of the migrants who pick apples and melons work in 
cotton gins and poultry plants moving with the seasons to make a 
living 
for tracy oldnette a slight 12yearold with a shy smile the 
program means a special relationship with mary k scott a migrant 
education teacher in the monett school system 
tracy has been enrolled in monett schools three different times 
each time he spent part of his school day with mrs scott who is 
both friend and tutor to the migrant children with whom she has 
worked for 17 years 
when we need help shes always there tracy said 
he estimates with a vague shrug that he has attended six or seven 
different schools as his family worked its way through missouri and 
arkansas 
as a migrant student his school and health records are stored in 
a central computer in little rock ark local centers can receive 
copies of records in a matter of days after migrant students enroll 
at a new school 
the local centers also provide teaching supplies to the tutors 
who work with migrant children staff nurses at the centers act as 
health educators and oversee the funds used to help the children buy 
glasses and meet other medical needs 
were the only program in the schools that can take care of 
health needs thats the strong point of our program said keith 
hill director of the malden center its hard to study and pay 
attention if youve got a toothache 
the missouri centers serving about 1000 with a combined budget 
of roughly 500000 are links in a national chain established by 
congress in 1966 to improve education for disadvantaged children 
theres lots of programs to help special children said tony 
woodrum director of the monett center this just happens to be 
the one that helps children whose families move a lot 
the program stresses early childhood education and tries to help 
migrants who have dropped out of school or who have taken longer 
than average to obtain a high school diploma 
to be eligible a student must have moved within the past year so 
that a parent or other family member could obtain seasonal work in 
agriculture or fishing a student can continue in the migrant 
program for up to five years after his or her family has stopped 
moving 
the monett center is installed in shopping center within sight of 
monett high school the malden center is housed in a converted 
skating rink 
migrant teachers some paid by the state or local school boards 
and others paid by the federal government under the migrant 
education program work with children in small groups they build 
skills that were lost in the shuffle of moves 
younger children may be behind in reading or math skills with 
older children teachers address more complicated problems 
through their movement i know theyre going to have a hard 
time learning the necessary things about applying for a job or 
maybe not meet with a counselor enough for him to work with him on 
selecting a career hill said 
hill and woodrum said that as children grow older and insist on 
staying with familiar friends and schools parents are more likely 
to abandon migrant work the educators acknowledge however that 
many older children simply drop out to work in the fields perhaps 
despairing of any chance to break the cycle 
you see it coming mrs scott said but what can you do to 
hold it off

michael dukakis carried a narrow lead

bush suffered from unpopular reagan administration farm policies 
and a democratic edge in voter registration but the republican 
rebounded and the last poll published by the des moines register in 
early october showed dukakis ahead 4938 with 13 percent undecided 
and a 31 percent margin of error

in on golden pond ernest thompson wrote 
about the differences among three generations in 1969 he deals 
with just two but deepens the gap 
1969 which the academy awardwinner wrote and directed 
takes place not surprisingly in 1969 and centers on the friendship 
of two college freshmen with the vietnam war and the draft looming 
in the background the students are caught up in many of the issues 
of the time sex drugs rock n roll politics 
i do get into the battle of generations and the 
misunderstandings but there were different dynamics in this movie 
and the generations are closer he said in an interview i think 
its an effort on my part to scrunch it together 
thompson a sophomore at american university in 1969 readily 
admits that the film is based on his own experiences it was a 
fulcrum time for me i didnt have any illusions that i was going to 
be saying something definitive about a whole era it was very 
personal 
its about a handful of characters trying to develop some 
emotional conscience even if its on a limited scale 
robert downey jr and kiefer sutherland star while downeys 
rebellion comes in the form of promiscuity and drugs he has an 
acid trip during the film sutherland is more intellectual 
concerned with the fate of the world 
thompson had to bridge a generation gap of his own while working 
with sutherland on a scene eventually cut from the film 
he was to wake up in the morning in the van and when we were 
about to shoot it i told kiefer well just have the doors open 
and well zoom the camera in on you 
and sutherland said i wont have the doors open i said 
yeah its easier to have the doors open he said i wouldnt 
sleep with the doors open in the city i said in 1969 you would it 
was an open door spirit there wasnt that fear there is now 
thompson no longer feels the sense of community that existed for 
him as a student i always had a feeling that id go back and the 
60s would still be there waiting for me but they werent there 
was a real feeling of fraternity just something as seemingly 
trivial as giving the peace sign and having someone give it back 
thompson was born in vermont but grew up in maryland which 
serves as the setting for 1969 he studied theater arts at 
american and catholic university and achieved minor recognition 
during the 1970s when he starred in the broadway revival of 
picnic 
in 1981 he won an academy award for the adaptation of his play 
on golden pond henry fonda starred as norman thayer an 
outspoken old man who fears his imminent death fonda who won his 
only oscar for the role died soon after 
with katharine hepburn who won her fourth oscar and jane fonda 
also starring as thayers wife and daughter on golden pond 
grossed over 120 million it was thompsons first experience 
working on the set of a feature film and understandably a 
memorable one 
it was a very warm and supportive environment thompson said 
adding that the atmosphere of the recent sweethearts dance for 
which he wrote the screenplay was far more difficult 
i think largely because costars don johnson and susan 
sarandon came from a school where you dont nurture and you dont 
respect the writer and the script it was a freeforall 
not so with fonda and hepburn 
i came in with two giants as artists but real ladies and 
gentlemen of the theater he said their background was the 
theater and they treated text and their fellow workers with 
tremendous generosity and affection with 1969 i tried to 
recreate that warm bath that on golden pond had 
thompson had little interest in cashing in on his overnight 
success and didnt start working on the screenplay of 1969 
until four years ago 
he had an uneasy relationship with his father much like the one 
the sutherland character has with his father played by bruce dern 
in 1969 
my father died almost 10 years ago when i was in my late 20s 
he said i was able to cross some of those bridges but we had a 
long way to go we would not have been confused as best friends we 
had a lot of divergent points of view 
yet thompsons happiest memory of 1969 was derns performance 
im proud that he was able to trust me he said i would 
tell him stories about my own father and he would take that and run 
with it 
so what will happen to the downey and sutherland characters 
where are they now 
i think that robert joined the national guard and didnt run 
for vice president thompson cracked hes probably a good old 
guy around town and has five children 
and sutherland 
thompson smiled i thought kiefer would grow up and become an 
academy award screenwriter

after three dubious comedies whoopi goldberg 
has returned to drama in a new film that is being hailed as 
recapturing the magic of her debut in the color purple 
in claras heart she again portrays a downtrodden figure a 
jamaican domestic with a tragic past who tries to help a troubled 
rich boy neglected by his parents 
the reviews have helped offset the notices for goldbergs interim 
movies jumpin jack flash burglar and fatal beauty 
not that she is ashamed of the comedies 
im not sure they were comedies she said laughing loudly 
i wasnt completely satisfied with them but i was not 
embarrassed i discovered on my concert tour that people 
responded to the films they liked jumpin jack flash i might 
have to go and watch it again because i was living in this 
microcosm of criticism it wasnt as good as you could do etc 
i gave my best to every film i did im not embarrassed by any 
of them even the ones i really didnt like i knew that my 
performance in them was as good as it could be how a studio or a 
producer or a director chose to edit it and how the marketing people 
said it was supposed to be sold thats a different story that has 
little to do with the script i performed 
no one said that i was bad they just said they werent pleased 
with my choices 
she reserved special scorn for fatal beauty in which she and 
sam elliott played bigcity crime busters it was a tough gritty 
script that would have had a great message about dope instead they 
turned it into a kind of rambette 
how does she manage to shift gears between comedy and drama 
i dont know she admitted i guess its what ive always 
been told actors are supposed to do thats the idea that youre 
supposed to be able to go in and out of these emotional bedrooms 
at a drop which i like 
im an actor who on occasion is funny sometimes sad i cannot 
now take on the responsibility of comedian because its too much 
you have to be too on top of it all the time i need places to take 
rest so i tell stories where i can find a little ledge to sit down 
with time to think about what im doing 
my stories will have those moments of humor moments of 
sadness moments of triumph lull moments which comics are not 
allowed to have you get a lull moment with a comic and its a 
killer a lull in my act and you get to go to the bathroom 
goldberg 32 started out early as an actress beginning as an 
8yearold in a manhattan housing project she joined a settlement 
house drama group and acted in neighborhood childrens productions 
after a period on drugs and a broken marriage that left her with a 
daughter she landed in san diego in 1974 in theater companies 
there and later in berkeley she began honing her comedic skills 
along the way she jokingly took a jewish surname and added whoopi as 
a given name to replace her own caryn johnson 
i had no idea truly that people thought i was funny except 
from doing all this bizarre street theater she said suddenly 
when i started putting together my own work people would laugh and 
id go wow then id try something else and theyd laugh 
intervals of laughter are wonderful 
with no immediate movies on tap she is headed for outer space 
she has signed on the uss enterprise for a series of appearances on 
star trek the next generation 
why not she reasoned first of all its a job i love to 
work ive been on the road for five months i dont think ive been 
home during the past five years for more than a month i want to be 
home i want to wait for a good film to come along but i also want 
to work 
so why not get on a show that has good actors and fun writing 
and a potential for anything future past present for instance 
you can change your being change the way you look why not 
besides goldberg is a longtime registered trekkie

thanksgiving is still a couple of weeks off 
but now is the time to start planning the meal especially if turkey 
will be on the menu 
the giant bird finds its way onto american tables most often 
during the holiday season and many cooks deal with these fowls only 
rarely 
that prompts the us department of agriculture to issue annual 
reminders about safe preparation and handling of turkey 
frozen turkeys can be bought now and stored in the freezer until 
a few days before needed then placed in the refrigerator to thaw 
if you dont want them taking up all that space order a fresh 
turkey ahead of time and pick it up the day before thanksgiving 
many stores are offering fresh prestuffed turkeys these may be 
time savers but the agriculture department doesnt recommend them 
the stuffing can create incubatorlike conditions for the growth 
of bacteria and it is nearly impossible for most refrigerators to 
keep the stuffing deep inside at 40 degrees fahreiheit or below 
the ultimate shortcut is a precooked turkey but these must also 
be handled carefully 
they are best is served immediately both from a safety and 
flavor standpoint if a precooked turkey must be stored remove the 
stuffing separate the meat from the carcass and store these items 
in small packages in the refrigerator 
one safe way to save cooking time is to use roasting bags the 
department says since they speed up the process cooking the turkey 
unstuffed also saves time 
microwaves can cook turkeys quickly but the department warns 
cooks not to try to microwave a stuffed turkey a stuffed bird is 
too dense for microwaving to assure thorough cooking 
often folks wind up with a frozen turkey bought too late to let 
it sit and defrost in the refrigerator for several days 
the department suggests as an alternative method immersing the 
bird in cold water which is changed every halfhour or so make sure 
the birds wrapping is secure or put it in a plastic bag before 
placing it in the water 
a microwave oven can also be used to thaw an unstuffed turkey if 
the oven is large enough follow the manufacturers instructions 
never defrost a turkey on the counter or table top in the hours 
it takes for it to thaw bacteria could muiltiply to dangerous levels 
and remember when preparing food use pleney of soap and hot 
water to wash hands utensils and cutting boards to prevent the 
spread of bacteria wash the sink counter faucet handles anything 
that comes in direct or indirect contact with raw turkey 
some recipes in recent years have suggested long slow cooking 
for turkeys but food safety experts frown on this because the bird 
may not get hot enough to kill bacteria cook it at 325 degrees 
fahreiheit they say the food experts also discourage the idea of 
partly cooking a bird one day and finishing it the next for the 
same reason 
once youve gotten over all these hurdles cooked the bird fed 
the family and cleaned up the department has suggestions for safe 
storage of leftovers too heres the drill 
remove the stuffing from the bird and the meat from the carcass 
store them in mealsize portions in shallow containers leftover 
turkey will keep in the refrigerator for three or four days 
stuffing and gravey should be used in a day or two bring leftover 
gravey to a rolling boil before serving

the folks of washington state are throwing 
a centennial birthday bash and only the immediate world is invited 
the celebration of the century kicks off friday the 
evergreen states 99th birthday and climaxes a year later 
it was at 527 pm nov 11 1889 when elisha p ferry got a 
telegram collect from president benjamin harrison declaring the 
territory to be americas 42nd state 
the centennial doings combine the homespun with hightech hoopla 
main streets are being spruced up and everybodys roots are being 
explored state centennial commission executive secretary putnam 
barber said 
the celebration will be a patchwork of hundreds of local events 
rather than a grand state production a plan that reflects the 
states populist distrust of anything centralized barber added with 
a chuckle 
its designed as a celebration of history and diversity 
creativity and a little bit of old west hellraising 
itll be hard not to notice 
imagine a relay race with 5000 runners retracing the 500mile 
idahotothesea lewis and clark trail in just eight days 
olympicstyle amateur athletic games are set for spokane and 
wenatchee with a total of 6000 particants 
wagon trains quilting bees parsons preaching in 1880s garb 
and city councils dressed in the style of the year of their towns 
incorporation all will add to the color 
folks in aberdeen are building tall ships and indians are 
carving dugout canoes for maritime festivals wings over 
washington will be a oneday flyover by hundreds of airplanes 
among many centennial construction projects and restorations is 
tacomas 20 million redo of union station 
ethnic minorities and their role in state history will be 
honored in dozens of ways including a major new exhibit on indian 
culture at the university of washington next april and seasons of 
life a touring museum exhibit focusing on pacific rim cultures 
artists performing at festivals through the year include such 
acts as the peking acrobats and pacific chautauqua a performing 
arts showcase with both washington and pacific rim artists 
seattles international film festival will be expanded 
washingtons history will be a yearlong focus in the schools 
and students will recreate the states constitutional convention 
newspapers are being asked to reprint their first edition and 
television and radio stations to replay their first broadcasts many 
historical books are in the works including new biographies and 
even a state song book 
first lady jean gardner cochair of the centennial commission 
calls the celebration a party with a purpose 
about 13 million centennial license plates have been sold so 
far and 1 from each sale goes to support centennial projects 
by june of next year the state will have spent 95 million on 
planning and support for the centennial 
asked how the centennial will compare with the nations 
bicentennial barber said it will be more focused and more immediate 
the us bicentennial was not about us and this is he said 
there was no way to make the events of philadelphia and boston 
immediate to folks out here now we can celebrate the history and 
character of our state 
we dont have to say all the real history happens someplace 
else

government reports showing a decline in home sales and factory

slowdown in the nations economy economists said 
wednesdays productivity report by the labor department indicated 
productivity rose by an annual rate of 13 percent from july through 
september reversing a secondquarter decline 
but analysts said the recent trend of paltry growth in 
productivity offered little hope for lifting americans standard of 
living or increasing us competitiveness 
revised figures indicated productivity dropped 24 percent in the 
second quarter much worse than the 14 percent decline estimated 
previously 
despite the strong growth of the economy over the past year 
theres still no significant change in a the weak trend in 
productivity that weve seen since 1973 said larry chimerine

fixedrate mortgages are at their lowest levels 
since the spring spelling good news for wouldbe homebuyers and 
builders but economists warn that the declining interest rates 
trend isnt expected to last much longer 
we see continuing problems with the dollar and some increase in 
inflation both of which tend to pressure interest rates upward 
frederick flick an economist for the national association of 
realtors said wednesday 
flick and other economists say theyre looking for rates to reach 
about 11 percent in early 1989 compared with the singledigit rates 
now available from some big lenders of conventional 30year loans 
a recently completed survey of 2000 lenders by hsh associates of 
butler nj found about 150 mortgage bankers and thrifts offering 
rates between 975 percent and 9875 percent last week the average 
rate was 1032 percent hsh said 
a similar survey by federal home loan mortgage corp better 
known as freddie mac put the average rate on a 30year mortgage at 
1022 percent the lowest since april earlier this week the 
veterans administration cut its maximum rate for federallybacked va 
loans to 10 percent from 105 percent 
all that should help the housing and construction industries 
which have been under pressure recently 
the commerce department reported wednesday that sales of new 
singlefamily homes fell 78 percent in september to 659000 units 
the biggest drop in 16 months the huge decline was accompanied by a 
rise in new home prices 
flick said that despite wednesdays report home sales are 
expected to remain relatively robust this year 
the associations latest forecast predicts sales of existing 
homes should total 348 million in 1988 near the decades high but 
lower than last years 352 million while new home sales should 
reach 661000 down from 671000 last year the sales forecast for 
1989 is 328 million existing homes and 601000 new homes 
flick said the current drop in interest rates should improve 
sales because it may make homebuying more affordable for some 
consumers 
david seiders chief economist for the national association of 
home builders attributed the current rate decline to improvement in 
the bond market a barometer of inflation and rate trends 
rates in the bond markets where corporate municipal and 
government debt securities are sold have been falling since august 
due to weakening inflationary pressures and signs of an economic 
slowdown 
but seiders says the bond market might have reacted prematurely 
about changes in the economy which in turn could mean higher 
interest rates in the near future 
we believe that inflation pressures are still building and that 
the fed federal reserve might not be willing to accept that he 
said oil prices of course are a real wildcard 
many economists are forecasting inflation of around 4 percent 
this year and about a percentage point higher in 1989 
another factor that might be keeping rates lower according to 
george a christie chief economist with the fw dodge division of 
mcgrawhill information systems co is that mortgage volume is down 
what i find significant from all this is that mortgage rates 
are about a half percentage point higher than the start of the 
year but home sales are still good he said

the latest wall street insider trading indictment 
suggests a gang of whitecollar thieves who not only stole sensitive 
information from clients to profit in the stock market but also 
purloined tips from each other 
the multiplecount indictment announced wednesday by the us 
attorneys office alleged that two small investment firms and three 
trading professionals including a researcher for troubled drexel 
burnham lambert inc schemed with others who have been previously 
charged 
it also alleged previously undisclosed links between drexel the 
socalled yuppie five insider trading ring exposed two years ago and 
ivan f boesky the imprisoned speculator who turned states 
evidence after paying the government a record 100 million fine for 
insider trading in november 1986 
one of the allegations asserted that an unidentified trader in 
boeskys nowdefunct firm who wasnt charged and apparently is a 
cooperating government witness stole tips from boesky and shared 
them with other coconspirators 
if so it suggests that while boesky was using stolen or bought 
tips to trade for himself others were stealing from him 
the indictment also cast a new cloud over drexel which is 
fighting other civil fraud charges by the securities and exchange 
commission stemming from its relationship with boesky and is the 
target of a federal grand jury probe 
the latest charges largely are an outgrowth of the yuppie five 
case in which four young investment professionals and an attorney 
confessed to charges of stealing secret information about takeovers 
from clients and using it to profit in the stock market those five 
already sentenced in the earlier charges have been cooperating with 
federal investigators 
accused in the wednesday indictment were marcus schloss amp co and 
victor teicher amp co small investment firms in manhattan also 
accused were d ronald yagoda 44 head of arbitrage trading at 
marcus schloss victor teicher 37 head of teicher and ross 
frankel 32 head of arbitrage research at drexel 
through their attorneys all the defendants denied any wrongdoing 
and vowed to fight the charges in court they are scheduled to 
formally enter their pleas nov 10 
the indictment accused the defendants of participating in an 
insider trading ring with the yuppie five and the unidentified 
trader for boesky using nonpublic information about union carbide 
corp american can corp allegheny inc avondale mills and 
american brands inc to trade profitably in the stocks of those 
companies 
the indictment also alleged that frankel improperly funneled to 
teicher the identities of four companies on drexels socalled 
confidential phantom list identifying potential targets of 
takeovers the firm might finance the indictment identified the 
companies as republic airlines inc westchester financial services 
corp western union corp and warnaco inc 
the defendants face varying counts of securities fraud mail 
fraud wire fraud perjury and obstruction of an sec investigation 
drexel moving quickly to distance itself from this new source of 
potential trouble said in a statement that frankel had taken a 
temporary leave of absence to devote his efforts to fighting the 
charges 
todays indictment of ross frankel is disturbing said drexel 
spokesman steven anreder it would be unfair to prejudge the case 
or comment at this time 
yagodas lawyer stanley s arkin suggested his client was 
indicted because of a plea agreement between federal prosecutors and 
andrew solomon a former schloss apprentice and a member of the 
yuppie five ring 
schloss stated that it believes itself innocent of any 
wrongdoing and will accordingly vigorously contest these charges in 
due course 
robert g morvillo teichers attorney said his client 
emphasized most strongly that he never violated those laws and is 
confident that his innocence will be established at trial 
yagoda was accused of 10 counts teicher 22 counts and frankel 
seven counts each faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison 
and a 250000 fine for each count 
schloss was accused of eight counts and teichers firm 22 counts 
both face a maximum fine of 500000 for each count

auto mechanic ben derosier and his wife 
doris sat in the lobby of the sharper images corporate office 
waiting to convince a product buyer their electric fingernail file 
is a retailers dream come true 
i work in an office where all the girls are into long 
nailsand after using this the nails are so smooth you can run 
them down your stockings without causing even the tiniest snag 
something id never do after the beauty parlor doris derosier 
said wednesday 
the couple were among the small crowd of inventors who every 
month gizmos in hand get their foot in the door of the hightech 
gadget purveyor in hopes of getting their product into the companys 
mailorder catalog 
in search of unique merchandise the sharper image for two years 
has held open house on the first wednesday of every month about 35 
inventors a month come from across the country to attend including 
some manufacturers offering exclusive rights to their products 
about one in 50 products are taken under consideration so far 
three open house items have made it into the companys 63 stores and 
into its 25 million monthly catalogs 
devices rejected include a vacuum cleaner attachment that cuts 
hair by sucking it into the hose and chopping it off at a preset 
length rotating sheets of wallpaper and the beauty pillow 
with a hole cut for the face in order to eliminate wrinkles 
but there have been successes coming later this fall is the 
bugvac the brainchild of larry volle of roseville a miniature 
vacuum cleaner that ends the messy task of cleaning up dead pests 
and a big hit has been the showertek a shaving mirror that 
doesnt fog up in the bathroom nearly 70000 have been sold since 
its inventor brought it in last year 
the showertek now one of the sharper images bestselling 
products was poohpoohed by company president richard thalheimer 
until he took it home and tried it himself hot water circulating 
from the shower head to behind the mirror keeps it fog free 
while many inventors struggle for years to get an audience with 
major manufacturers sharper image decided to cut through the 
bureaucracy 
this represents the good old american dream that if youve got 
something you really believe in you can come in and make your 
pitch said doris derosier 
the sharper image which had sales of 160 million last year is 
known for innovation in both marketing and the selection of gifts 
some of the more unusual ones include a 1600 programmable home 
robot talking bathroom scales suits of armor and even a 2000 
remotecontrolled toy helicopter 
the business was started in 1977 by thenattorney thalheimer who 
started out selling digital stopwatches through the mail with ads in 
running magazines 
the company went public in april 1987 but thalheimer 40 runs 
it much like a family firm reserving for himself the final say on 
all products 
among the new ideas hes got to decide on are batterypowered 
blinking earrings in the shapes of circles triangles and squares 
designed by david leblanc of atlantis productions of santa rosa 
as for the derosiers the sharper image told them it would 
consider carrying their electric fingernail file if they find a 
manufacturer

the us dollar was lower against most major 
currencies in european trading this morning but psychological 
support and an absence of economic news checked continued selling 
pressure 
gold prices continued to rise benefiting from a rally on 
platinum triggered by tight supplies 
foreign exchange dealers said early trading was thin and nervous 
they said the failure this week of several rounds of interventions 
by the bank of japan and the us federal reserve to push the dollar 
higher had created selling pressure 
but later in the morning the dollar was holding steady 
supported by psychological factors and an absence of major economic 
indicators they said 
market players generally expect the dollar to trade within a 
narrow range until after the us presidential elections next 
tuesday 
in london the dollar fell against the british pound it cost 
17802 to buy one pound more expensive for buyers than 17740

pillsbury cos board of directors was 
scheduled to meet today but officials at the food and restaurant 
company refused to say whether the board would announce a plan to 
defend against the 523 billion takeover bid from britains grand 
metropolitan plc 
pillsburys directors have already rejected the 60ashare offer 
and chairman philip smith said shareholders would be informed of an 
alternative before the tender offer expires on tuesday 
pillsbury spokesman larry haeg would not disclose the time and 
location of the regularly scheduled meeting he said pillsbury 
officials have not met with grand met to discuss the offer 
a group of dissident shareholders is suing pillsbury to force the 
company to negotiate the offer or come up with an alternative of 
equal or greater value 
hennepin county district court judge thomas carey on wednesday 
granted a request by the dissident group that all shareholders be 
represented as a class in the lawsuit 
the class of pillsbury shareholders in the lawsuit includes all 
those who owned the stock before oct 17 the date pillsburys 
directors rejected the tender offer over objections from pillsbury 
carey excluded grand met from the shareholders group although the 
company owned pillsbury stock as early as august 
had grand met been included in the class it would have been 
enjoined from taking legal action against pillsbury in other states 
steven rothschild a lawyer for pillsbury asked for grand met to 
be included in the class to prevent the british conglomerate from 
getting two bites at winning 
dont subject us to the multiple hits they are trying to 
inflict on us rothschild said in court 
but carey said grand met has interests that are different than 
the interests of shareholders 
carey also denied a request from pillsbury that the shareholders 
lawsuit be dismissed 
similar legal action is pending in delaware where pillsbury is 
incorporated 
in a suit separate from the shareholders action pillsbury has 
asked carey to block the tender offer on grounds the proposed 
takeover would violate state laws that forbid liquor distillers from 
selling alcohol at retail outlets 
grand met makes a variety of alcoholic beverages including jampb 
scotch pillsbury sells liquor at its steak amp ale and bennigans 
restaurants 
pillsbury stock closed wednesday at 6150 up 25 cents a share 
in new york stock exchange composite trading

british publisher robert maxwell has emerged the 
apparent victor in the takeover battle for macmillan inc after a 
delaware court invalidated kohlberg kravis roberts amp cos merger 
pact with the publishing and infomation services company 
in a ruling wednesday a threejudge panel of the delaware 
supreme court reversed a delaware chancery court judgment that last 
month affirmed the 25 billion agreement between macmillan and 
kohlberg kravis 
maxwell is offering 251 billion for macmillan 
the court also ordered the lower court to issue a preliminary 
injunction against a merger with kohlberg kravis the ruling came 
two weeks after mcamillan lost a separate court challenge to its 
poison pill antitakeover defense 
at issue wednesday was a socalled lockup provision in the 
kohlberg kravis deal that had given the powerful new york buyout 
firm the right to buy certain prize macmillan assets for 865 
million if the publishing and information company is acquired by 
another suitor 
the provision which was put in place in september was intended 
to discourage rival suitors such as maxwell who likely would be 
unwilling to buy macmillan without those choice properties 
maxwell had contended that the lockup which covered macmillans 
berlitz language centers the directory division the direct 
marketing division and a division that publishes state legal codes 
was unfair and would leave the company with a 250 million tax 
liability 
i am delighted by the courts decision which should clear the 
way for our acquisition of macmillan maxwell said in a statement 
after the ruling 
he also stated he had met with macmillan chairman edward p evans 
and other members of the management team on wednesday i am 
pleased by their willingness to cooperate with me in ensuring an 
orderly transition he said 
spokesmen for kohlberg kravis which also is making an 
unprecedented 203 billion bid for rjr nabisco inc were 
unavailable for comment after the ruling 
both maxwell and kohlberg kravis have outstanding tender offers 
that expire at 1201 am friday for macmillans 278 million 
outstanding shares 
experts say maxwell virtually is guaranteed to win a bidding 
contest because his allcash 9025 a share bid is higher than the 
9005 a share cashandsecurities offer from kohlberg kravis which 
has been endorsed by macmillan 
in trading on the new york stock exchange macmillan jumped 125 
to 8950 a share on wednesday 
the state supreme court decision came after a 2hour hearing in 
which attorneys for maxwell communication corp plc also argued that 
macmillan tainted the bidding process by revealing maxwells bid to 
kohlberg kravis while withholding information on the offer from its 
own board 
justice andrew gt moore ii described macmillan managements 
defense against charges of improper bidding as sounding like 
something i have read in lewis carroll author of alice in 
wonderland 
the process was tainted because information to the 
macmillan board was not accurate or complete it was misleading 
in lack of candor said moore 
earlier this month assistant chancellor jack b jacobs issued a 
injunction oct 17 prohibiting macmillans poisonpill defense in 
which macmillan would have diluted the value of its stock 
after that ruling maxwell appealed to the higher court to obtain 
a court order against macmillans other dealings with kohlberg 
kravis

south koreas trade surplus with the 
united states in the first nine months of this year declined 132 
percent from a year ago while its trade deficit with japan fell 30 
percent the korea foreign trade association reported thursday 
the association said however that koreas trade surplus with 
the european economic community increased 166 percent during the 
januaryseptember period 
the shifts in koreas trade patterns with the united states and 
japan were attributed partly to its policy of buying more american 
goods at the sacrifice of some of its imports from japan 
under the policy designed to ease trade friction with america 
seoul has eased its import restrictions on some american products 
and somewhat revalued the korean won currency against the dollar 
officials said koreas trade surplus with the united states in 
the nine months shrank 132 percent to 601 billion from 692 
billion a year earlier 
koreas global trade surplus was 513 billion on exports of 
4295 billion and imports of 3782 billion according to an 
earlier government report 
korean exports to the united states were listed at 1515 
billion up 143 percent from a year ago and imports from the 
united states were 914 billion up 443 percent 
korea ran a deficit of 295 billion with japan in the nine 
months down 30 percent from a year ago korean exports to japan 
jumped 486 percent to 854 billion and its imports from japan grew 
154 percent to 1149 billion

participated in the package 
he said the syndication which began in late june and ended

west pointpepperell incs board of 
directors has rejected as inadequate a 14 billion takeover bid by 
chicagobased farley inc saying pepperells value will jump when 
it consolidates operations with the recently acquired jp stevens amp 
co 
the company really really is not for sale and our 
overwhelmingly desire is to remain independent don keller 
president of the georgiabased textile giant said wednesday 
at a meeting in new york pepperells board voted unanimously to 
reject the 48 a share offer from farley a privatelyheld 
conglomerate that owns the company that makes fruit of the loom 
underwear 
the announcement came after the stock market closed in trading 
on the new york stock exchange pepperell slipped 25 cents a share 
to 4525 
william f farley the chairman of farley inc issued a 
statement saying he believed the 48 a share offer was fair and its 
acceptance by the board would be in the best interest of pepprells 
shareholders 
but keller said the pepperell board rejected it on the advice of 
its financial advisers plus other considerations 
the board believed pepperells stock price would rise 
dramatically once the company integrated its stevens assets and 
began to realize the operating efficiencies available to a combined 
operation keller said 
pepperell which manufactures arrow shirts and martex towels 
purchased stevens in may for 12 billion and then split up stevens 
assets with a rival suitor pepperell was left with most of stevens 
linen and towel operations giving the company about 25 percent of 
the nations home fashion textile market 
the stevens assets must be held separately until early december 
under an agreement with the federal trade commission he said 
pepperells board believes that the farley offer is an 
opportunistic attempt to capture the longterm value of the company 
at an inadequate price before the advantages of the stevens 
acquisition can be realized and appropriately reflected in the 
market price of the shares said joseph l lanier jr chairman 
and chief executive officer for pepperell 
the board authorized pepperells management to explore 
alternatives to the farley offer but lanier said in a statement 
there is no assurance that the exploration will result in any 
transaction being recommended to the board 
part of the reasoning behind rejection of farleys offer is that 
farley has indicated he would bust up the company if the 
takeover succeeds keller said 
we believe that west point which has been operating in these 
communities for years needs to stay there keller said referring 
to the companys textile mills and plants in mostly small rural 
communities in georgia and elsewhere in the south 
in material filed with the securities and exchange commission in 
washington farley said that if successful in its bid it plans to 
sell pepperells apparel fabrics and industrial fabrics businesses 
and keep the household fabrics business 
farley notified pepperell in may it was seeking up to 25 percent 
of pepperells 294 million outstanding shares and as of last week 
had spent 88 million for 98 percent of the stock 
pepperell immediately began taking steps to strengthen its 
ability to fight a takeover including adoption of a poison pill 
defense that would make a hostile takeover prohibitively expensive 
pepperell also has had in place for some time socalled golden 
parachutes for executives including a 139 million payout to 
lanier if he were to be fired by new owners farley has challenged 
those provisions in federal court

agriculture secretary richard e lyng said 
today he intends to stay on the job until the next administration 
takes over jan 20 
im going to be fairly busy up until the end of the year and 
then for 20 days in january lyng said adding that he had turned 
down a number of speaking invitations it would seem that in the 
last two or three weeks on the job i might be of some help to my 
successor 
lyng had already passed the word to senior staff people that he 
has some unfinished work to do concerning trade talks and that 
he and us trade representative clayton yeutter will be busy 
tidying up those affairs over the next few weeks regardless of how 
the presidential election turns out tuesday 
a special meeting of the 96 member countries of the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade at which agriculture will be a 
central focus is scheduled to begin in montreal on dec 5 for 
example 
lyng also said that he wants to take some vacation time to be 
with his family and then return to usda for more work and a round of 
farewells before bowing out 
but gossip has persisted that if george bush wins the election 
lyng may be prevailed upon to resign and head up a gop transition 
team at usda a job he did when ronald reagan won the white house 
eight years ago 
lyng 70 has said publicly for months that he plans to retire 
when reagan leaves office in january but had not spelled out what 
role he might play in the event bush wins the presidency 
in an interview today lyng discounted rumors of resigning early 
to head a bush transition team 
i dont think that would make much sense lyng said im 
here and if they want me to help i would 
the usda rumor mill was provided additional grist this week on 
tuesday it was announced that david c lyons lyngs executive 
assistant will resign effective in late november and will go to 
work in the private sector 
also a monthly calendar of coming events involving usda 
officials showed that lyng has several speaking engagements booked 
through november but none after that his last appearance before a 
usda group was shown as nov 29 at the departments annual outlook 
conference 
the calendar included the 70th annual meeting of the american 
farm bureau federation in san antonio texas on jan 812 but no 
usda participant was listed a federation spokesman john lewis 
said lyng is not on the program but would be welcome if he showed 
up 
lyng a longtime friend of reagans has been through the 
revolving job door at usda several times and is intimately 
acquainted with agency functions needs and the political byways of 
departmental bureaucracy 
in early 1969 when he was head of the california department of 
agriculture and reagan was governor lyng was named by president 
nixon as assistant secretary of agriculture for consumer and 
marketing services a job he held for four years 
from 1973 to 1979 lyng was president of the industry supported 
american meat institute and worked for reagans 1980 presidential 
campaign as head of the transition team lyng helped ease the way 
for john r block to take over as secretary of agriculture 
lyng became deputy secretary the no 2 job in the department he 
resigned in 1985 to establish his own consulting firm but returned 
to usda as secretary in march 1986 after blocks resignation 
it is unclear who would succeed lyng if bush were elected 
yeutter has been mentioned frequently as the leading candidate and 
has expressed interest in the usda job however some feel that bush 
might want yeutter to stay on as us trade representative at least 
for a while 
former iowa congressman cooper evans an early supporter of bush 
is rated highly by some as a likely secretary of agriculture 
another on the gop list of possibles is robert delano warsaw 
va a former president of the american farm bureau federation who 
also has been active in the bushquayle farm campaign 
secretaries of agriculture from the south have been rare 
according to usda historian doug bowers john a knebel from 
virginia who succeeded earl l butz for a brief period at the end 
of 1976 and into january 1977 was the most recent and only 
southerner if border state missouri isnt counted 
four missourians were secretaries of agriculture the most recent 
being arthur hyde in 192933 a former missouri governor 
still another potential gop choice is the departments current 
no 2 official deputy secretary peter myers and he is also from 
missouri

baker hughes inc has taken its bjtitan services 
and bj services international divisions off the market citing 
disappointingly low bids for the two pressure pumping businesses 
baker hughes had announced in june it would sell the two houston 
divisions which analysts had valued at about 200 million as part 
of its strategy to focus on core businesses in which it is a market 
leader 
company president jim woods said in early october that baker 
hughes had received three or four serious bids and was negotiating 
with one of the bidders but he declined to identify the firm or the 
price 
bjtitan and bj services international provide acidizing 
cementing and fracturing services used to complete and start 
production from oil and natural gas wells the divisions employ 
about 2600 people worldwide 
woods said in a statement wednesday that with the deterioration 
and uncertainty in international oil prices the proposed purchase 
prices of the divisions were below the companys expectations 
the company said it would continue to operate the two businesses 
as usual and has no current plans to seek other bids

soybean futures were modestly higher on 
followthrough buying from wednesdays strong rally while grain

trade

wednesday on rumors of substantial soviet purchases of us

after wednesdays close the agriculture department confirmed 
that the soviets had bought 250000 metric tons of us soybeans

level 
the markets pretty evenly divided said cathy leow a grain 
markets analyst with thomson mckinnon securities inc in new york 
some people are very bullish based on the soviet buying but 
others think the soybean runup is a seasonal postharvest rally

lack of confirmation of rumored russian buying of those commodities

the contract for delivery in december at 417 a bushel corn was 
cent to 1 cents lower with december at 284 a bushel oats were 1

saudi arabia reported that locusts 
were still invading its west coast thursday and that weather 
conditions would drive more across the red sea 
but a major combat operation in motion since the first attack 
oct 13 prevented the cropdevouring insects from penetrating the 
interior of the kingdom said a press statement from the ministry of 
agriculture 
the situation is reassuring at present and the ministry is 
taking all effective measures to bar the locusts from moving toward 
the arab states said the statement 
in recent days locust swarms were reported in iraq iran 
northern kuwait and in the central gulf around bahrain and qatar 
these countries have been on the alert with their own combat squads 
and pesticides all have reported the situation is under control 
in bahrain a hotline has been established to report sightings 
said hassan abdulkarim director of farmer services at the 
bahraini ministry of agriculture the situation is all under 
control there is nothing now and the country is almost clean our 
people have been surveying and theres nothing so far 
instructions circulated in bahrain and the other countries have 
not failed to remind residents not to pick the locusts for eating 
since they are considered a delicacy once sprayed the locusts 
become poisonous said the instructions circulated through the media 
the locust invasion which blew across the red sea from the east 
african coast is believed the worst in 25 years 
the saudi statement said rainfall along an 875mile stretch of 
its red sea coast had helped the infestation while weather 
conditions over turkey produced north and northeasterly winds 
which might lead to continuation of the swarms reaching the 
kingdom till november 
it said hundreds of ground squads equipped with sprayers and 
insecticides and assisted by aerial squadrons arrested the locust 
penetration into the interior and yet more swarms of the desert 
locusts are still reaching the kingdom 
more swarms were also expected in light of the reports by the 
world food and agriculture organization which said that the locusts 
were widespread in the sudan and that the situation was critical and 
deteriorating in sudan mauritania mali senegal niger and gambia

federal regulators are expected to order 
mcorp to inject about 400 million into its troubled bank 
subsidiaries a move that will likely push the holding company into 
bankruptcy court reports published thursday said 
the fort worth startelegram and the wall street journal said the 
comptroller of the currency notified most of mcorps 25 banks last 
week that it intends to demand they raise more capital 
the federal reserve board also ordered mcorp to draft a plan to 
boost its banks capital the reports said 
the 400 million amount was mentioned by both federal agencies 
along with the federal deposit insurance corp which insures bank 
deposits they said 
mcorp had no comment on the reports spokesman george mccane said 
thursday however sources told the newspapers mcorp will file for 
protection under chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws if it 
receives a permanent order for a cash transfer 
if there is a direct order or if certain events or actions by 
regulators show that their intention is to order mcorp to move the 
money that would be interpreted as a reason for the company to seek 
the protection of an independent referee the startelegrams 
source said 
mcorp the secondlargest bank holding company in texas posted a 
record 517 million loss for the third quarter 
mcorp has asked for federal help in a managementled 
reorganization that would include 400 million from the holding 
company 400 million raised from private investors and shareholders 
and an undetermined amount from the federal deposit insurance corp

new york city filed suit today on behalf of 
several big cities and minority groups to force the census bureau to 
make adjustments to avoid largescale undercounting in the 1990 
census 
some people are in effect being disenfranchised by an 
undercount said peter zimroth the citys lawyer congressional 
seats and some federal state and city funds are allocated on the 
basis of population 
zimroth said new york city was undercounted by about 500000 in 
1980 and he predicted the 1990 census as now planned would be even 
less accurate 
undercounting often affects minorities and illegal aliens 
because many do not respond to the mailed census forms he said 
the suit was filed in us district court in brooklyn which has 
a large black population and could be vastly undercounted zimroth 
said 
joining in the action were los angeles and chicago dade county 
fla which includes miami the state of california the us 
conference of mayors the national league of cities the league of 
united latin american citizens and the national association for the 
advancement of colored people 
new york won a suit for an undercount adjustment after the 1980 
census but the victory was overturned by a federal appeals court 
after the government argued it was not possible to make an accurate 
sampling because of technicalities 
zimroth said the bureau had since worked out the technical 
difficulties

the worlds largest producer of seed corn 
said thursday it would raise its prices an average 118 percent for 
next springs sales to farmers reflecting the increased cost of 
replacing its droughtdamaged us crop 
this should be good news to those whove heard rumors that 
pioneer seed corn would be selling for well over 100 a bag 
charles s johnson senior vice president for pioneer hibred 
international incs north american operations said in a prepared 
statement announcing the price increases 
pioneer said it would increase the price of an average bag of 
seed corn 739 which would bring the cost to about 70 but 
because of the wide variety of seed pioneer sells some farmers 
still will pay less and some will pay more 
based on the average increase announced a farmer would spend 
about 220 more next spring than last for each 100 acres planted if 
he used a pioneer variety that is designed to seed 34 acres per bag 
pioneer seed corn is sold in packages ranging from 60000 kernels 
a bag to 110000 kernels and the company said most increases will 
range from 5 to 10 a bag 
the reason for the increase is very heavily related to the 
drought pioneer spokesman dave knau said in an interview 
the blistering summer of 1988 shriveled pioneers harvest of corn 
grown for farm seed to little more than half of what it had planned 
to grow knau said as a result the company had to plan winter 
production half of it spread through the states of arizona 
california florida and texas and half in the south american 
countries of argentina and chile 
winter production is very expensive knau said 
but he said pioneer believes the increase will be kept from 
growing larger because the outlook for the winter harvest looks good 
and because it was able to carry over unsold seed corn from previous 
harvests equivalent to 57 percent of last springs sales 
in addition pioneer and others are forecasting stepped up sales 
for 1989 plantings because the government in response to drought 
damage suffered by farmers will not require corngrowers to leave as 
much land idle as they did this year to qualify for federal 
subsidies 
knau said the prices for 1989 seed were announced a few weeks 
later than usual because company officials had to factor in winter 
production he also said the company may slightly reduce 1989 
spending on advertising or on premium giveaways to promote sales 
but he said the company will continue to offer discounts of 1 
percent to 14 percent based on the dollar volume of sales and 
discounts ranging from 2 percent to 7 percent for orders paid for in 
advance 
johnson said the company is projecting that nearly onefourth of 
its supply for next spring will be in five new hybrids that 
demonstrated a strong performance advantage over the competition 
this past growing season even with the drought those hybrids are 
designated 3751 3585 3379 3343 and 3140

tyson foods inc defended its 52ashare 
buyout offer of holly farms corp thursday hours after officers of 
holly farms urged the companys stockholders to reject the roughly 
940 million bid 
jim blair a spokesman for the springdalebased poultry 
processor said that holly farms probably wont find a better offer 
we think that our offer is more than anyone else will pay 
blair said they now recognize that holly farms is for sale the 
question is to whom for how much 
but the board of the memphis tenn company disagreed 
the offer is inadequate and not in the best interest of the 
company and its stockholders holly farms board of directors said 
in a statement released thursday 
the board has authorized management together with the companys 
financial and legal advisors to continue to explore alternatives to 
tyson foods offer in order to maximize value of the companys 
stockholders holly farms said 
last month holly farms rejected a tyson offer of 45 plus a 
quarter share of tyson stock for each of holly farms 18 million 
shares of class a common stock 
speculation over holly farms decision caused the firms stock to 
climb above tysons offer the stock closed at 5325 on tuesday and 
5288 on wednesday 
obviously the market right now is telling us that it believes 
that a higher bid will come to the table than tysons current 52 
bid said napoleon overton an analyst with morgan keegan amp co 
in memphis overton downplayed wednesdays stock decline 
stocks in play tend to be quite volatile within a reasonable 
narrow range around the bids that are on the table he said 
john mcmillin an analyst with prudentialbache securities in new 
york said he thinks holly farms is looking for a white knight and 
again if they cant find a white knight theyll come out with their 
own recapitalization program and sell it to don tyson as a last 
resort 
tyson had stepped up its efforts to acquire holly farms by 
sending to shareholders tender offers made through the holly 
acquisition corp a whollyowned subsidiary of tyson 
tyson is the nations largest poultry producer churning out 14 
million pounds of chicken meat a week holly farms is a diversified 
food company and the nations third largest chicken company 
tysons offer is good until nov 18

an investment firm and its founder were indicted 
today on stock manipulation and other securities fraud charges in 
connection with the sale of firemans fund corp shares by american 
express co more than two years ago 
the multiplecount indictment by the federal grand jury against 
salim b lewis and sb lewis amp co was an indirect outgrowth of the 
ivan boesky insider trading scandal and federal prosecutors said 
others might be charged 
us attorney rudolph w giuliani told reporters the indictment 
alleges that lewis and other unidentified coconspirators attempted 
to manipulate upward the price of firemans fund stock on may 8 
1986 the day american express was to price an offering of firemans 
fund securities it wished to sell 
one of the objects of the conspiracy was to make sure that 
american express maximized the proceeds that it received from that 
offering giuliani said 
lewis 49 is said to have a close relationship with american 
express one of the biggest financial services companies and parent 
of shearson lehman hutton inc a leading wall street firm 
federal prosecutors would not elaborate on whether anybody inside 
american express played a role in the alleged conspiracy

provided by boyd l jefferies a los angeles investment professional 
who settled government charges of securities fraud in 1987 in 
exchange for his cooperation in other investigations 
jefferies was exposed by boesky the most famous insider trader 
in us history now imprisoned boesky also is cooperating with the 
government

the management of rjr nabisco inc today raised 
the price tag on the largest corporate buyout in us history 
announcing a nearly 21 billion cash and stock bid that tops an 
earlier offer by kohlberg kravis roberts amp co for the food and 
tobacco giant 
r ross johnson president and chief executive officer of rjr 
nabisco said in a twoparagraph statement that the management group 
and its financial partners shearson lehman hutton inc and salomon 
inc would offer stockholders 84 in cash and 8 worth of 
securities for each nabisco share outstanding 
this is a full and fair price for stockholders johnson said 
our offer will be good for the company its employees and the 
communities we serve because our management group would bring the 
continuity and knowhow needed to ensure the continued longterm 
success of the business 
the management group put rjr nabisco into play when it 
announced two weeks ago that it was considering a 75ashare or 
17 billion offer to take the company private 
kohlberg kravis the nations leading leveraged buyout firm 
quickly followed with a tender offer to shareholders of 90 a share 
worth an estimated 203 billion 
in a joint statement released shortly after nabiscos bid was 
announced johnson and kohlberg kravis said talks about a possible 
joint bid had been terminated although they left the door open to 
further discussions 
the two camps have talked off and on over the past two weeks 
without success 
speculation that rjr nabiscos management would unveil a higher 
bid today had pushed up nabisco stock 112 a share before 
johnsons announcement and it rose 37 cents more to 88 after the 
statement was released 
the wall street journal had reported in todays editions that the 
management group was close to topping the kohlberg kravis bid 
the journal said the group had talked with other food companies 
and other investors including texas financier robert bass about 
joining in the bid 
in addition the journal and the atlanta constitution also 
reported that another leveraged buyout firm forstman little amp co 
was considering entering the battle 
the journal gave no attribution for forstmann littles interest 
in bidding for rjr nabisco but said it was understood that the 
investment concern had signed a confidential agreement with rjr 
nabiscos board allowing it to analyze some confidential financial 
information 
rjr nabiscos board issued a statement wednesday inviting other 
interested parties to bid for the nations 19thlargest industrial 
concern maker of such wellknown brands as winston cigarettes and 
oreo cookies 
charles hugel who is chairman of the committee of outside 
directors appointed to review takeover proposals said the panel 
believed this will serve the best interest of all shareholders 
the financial world had been stunned when rjr nabiscos 
management announced it was considering the leveraged buyout the 
biggest corporate transaction of its kind in us history 
in a leveraged buyout most of the purchase price is borrowed 
money that is repaid with the acquired companys cash flow or asset 
sales 
the leaders of kohlberg kravis reportedly have fought the rjr 
nabisco battle because they are intent on retaining the firms 
preeminence in leveraged buyouts 
but speculation has arisen that the firm might be under pressure 
to withdraw from the bidding several institutional investors in the 
firms leveraged buyout fund which would provide a small part of 
the financing are balking on the grounds that they believe the 
firms approach is hostile even though it made its offer contingent 
on getting support from rjr nabiscos board

the prices of most grain and soybean futures 
drifted lower thursday on the chicago board of trade as traders 
disappointed by the fitful pace of grain sales for export took 
profits off the latest speculative rally 
the agriculture departments confirmation late wednesday of a 
250000ton soybean sale to the soviet union provided some 
consolation but the corn market registered frustration at the lack 
of official word about a rumored sale of us corn to the soviets 
analysts said 
the commercials who were buyers yesterday turned sellers and we 
just saw some long liquidation in the market said cathy leow a 
grain markets analyst with thomson mckinnon securities inc in new 
york 
the markets weakening tone also reflected expectations that the 
usda will revise upward its 1988 us grain and soybean production 
estimates she said that usda crop report is due out next wednesday 
at the close wheat was 1 cents lower to cent higher with the 
contract for delivery in december at 417 a bushel corn was 4 
cents lower to 1 cents higher with december at 282 a bushel 
oats were 6 cents to 8 cents lower with december at 222 a bushel 
soybeans were 2 cents lower to 3 cents higher with november at

oxygenstarved bacteria working in sediment 
beneath the hudson river are transforming toxic pcb compounds into 
less dangerous forms raising hopes of a significant easing of a 
major pcb cleanup problem nationwide researchers said thursday 
the resulting types of pcbs do not accumulate in living tissue a 
government scientist said 
the researchers from michigan state university said their results 
with anaerobic or oxygenfree bacteria could mean that not every 
contaminated sediment would have to be cleaned up and cleanups that 
do proceed might be much less risky than people have assumed 
if it is true it could have enormous significance said 
richard d morgenstern head of the office of policy analysis in the 
environmental protection agency 
sally valdez cogliani an epa ecologist and sediment specialist 
said the discovery showed promise but she was more restrained than 
morgenstern probably most situations are not anaerobic id 
wonder about its general applicability she said 
pcbs are a common toxic waste problem in some of the 
betterknown cases they have contaminated harbor sediments at new 
bedford mass and waukegan ill 
millions of pounds of pcbs were used from 1929 to 1977 the 
nations utilities are faced with the massive task of draining them 
from their transformers by the early 1990s and pcb spills all over 
the landscape are a frequent problem 
the michigan state findings appear to substantiate a theory put 
forward by general electric corp source of most hudson river pcbs 
in a dispute with new york state over cleanup plans for the river 
the new york state department of environmental conservation said 
it wanted to dredge up and place in a landfill 360000 cubic yards 
of pcb hot spots in the hudson river above albany resulting from 
legal ge waste discharges from 1951 to 1973 
rw groneman spokesman for the department said of the new 
findings its a good theory but what does it mean in the real 
world 
until epa banned manufacture in 1977 some mixtures of the 209 
possible pcb compounds polychlorinated biphenyls were widely used 
as coolants and insulators in electrical equipment such as 
transformers and capacitors the fluids do not transmit electricity 
and are extremely difficult to burn 
congress required epa to act because of findings that pcbs 
appeared to cause cancer skin and reproductive disorders in 
laboratory animals 
pcbs accumulate in fatty tissue and findings of high levels in 
fish led new york authorities to ban the taking of striped bass from 
the hudson or ocean waters inshore 
the michigan state researchers inoculated a common heavily 
chlorinated commercial pcb with pcbfree bacteria from one of the 
hudson sites sixteen weeks later they found that 53 percent of all 
the chlorine had been removed and molecules with only one or two 
chlorine atoms had increased from 9 percent to 88 percent of the 
sample 
the oxygenfree bacteria do not attack singleand doublechlorine 
pcbs the researchers acknowledged but frederick kutz a biologist 
in epas office of research and development said the lowchlorine 
pcbs dont accumulate in the bodies of fish 
writing in the issue of science magazine appearing friday the 
researchers john f quensen iii james m tiedje and stephen a 
boyd said it appeared that the bacteria had evolved specifically 
to attack pcbs similar bacteria from nonpcb hudson sediments had 
no effect 
the pcb changes paralleled ge findings on sediment pcbs reported 
last year ge speculated that bacteria were attacking the pcbs but 
new york state scientists argued that other mechanisms could be at 
work such as greater removal by the river of highchlorine forms 
ge contributed financially to the michigan state research boyd 
said that doesnt mean they hired us to state something they 
wanted said 
in proceedings before an administrative law judge ge argued for 
leaving the sediments undisturbed judge daniel e louis rejecting 
the proposal saying it appeared that biodegradation was taking 
place but the no action alternative would leave pcbs in place 
and consequently available for the dynamics of river influence at 
the whim of nature 
we feel pretty good about the michigan state confirmation 
said steve hamilton organic chemist at ges labs in schenectady 
ny 
the exciting thing is to think about some process to speed this 
up and to extend it to other pcb sites hamilton said wed 
need to understand the process more thoroughly we know of no limits 
at this point

cashing in on the fax boom mci communications 
corp on thursday announced the first network just for the 
transmission of facsimile messages 
mci the no 2 longdistance company behind american telephone amp 
telegraph co said the mci fax network would allow companies to 
monitor their fax use better get consolidated fax bills and use 
the storing and forwarding capabilities of mcis computercontrolled 
phone network 
fax users in the united states will spend 3 billion this year on 
transmitting facsimile messages most of it on longdistance calls 
and the market is expected to grow to more than 9 billion by 1991 
mci said 
all fax messages are currently sent over regular phone networks 
including mcis mci said it hoped to grab a large chunk of the 
transmission business because its costs will be about the same as 
normal phone service 
no other companies are in a position to match the mci offering 
quickly said william mcgowan the chairman and chief executive for 
example atampt is not set up to bill customers separately for their 
fax use 
mcgowan declined to predict how much revenue or market share mci 
would gain with its new service but he said in an interview it 
could have a dramatic impact on mci it tells us we were right to 
make the investment we have over the last four or five years in a 
computercontrolled network 
using mci fax someone could broadcast a fax message to hundreds 
of machines around the country and abroad simply by sending the fax 
to mci along with its list of recipients as it is now a machine 
that broadcasts a fax message is tied up as it sends it to one 
recipient after another 
mcis computers will allow someone to send a message by telex 
electronic mail or personal computer and have it converted into a 
fax message also mci can store fax messages and deliver them on 
command some of these services are already available on advanced 
fax machines 
the service is both national and international and mci said it 
was accepting orders immediately for service to begin by the end of 
november 
the creation of a facsimile network does not require laying any 
new cables instead mci uses computers to carve out the network 
from its existing computercontrolled network

gradually through most of the session the widely watched indicator

copper futures prices fell steeply thursday on new yorks 
commodity exchange as traders took profits after five straight days 
of gains that had pushed the spot price to a record 1538 a pound 
despite the drop analysts said the bullish trend in copper 
likely would continue 
on other markets precious metals also declined livestock and 
meat futures were sharply lower grains and soybeans retreated 
energy futures rose and stockindex futures fell 
after surging more than 13 percent in just five days the copper 
market turned jittery thursday and sold off 
the most active contract for delivery in december fell 31 
cents to 1432 spot copper settled at 150 a pound 35 cents 
below wednesdays settlement 
the heights reached during the past week were simply too much for 
nervous traders to bear said george anagnos metals analyst with 
thomson mckinnon securities inc in new york 
i think the market is generally skeptical of december copper 
above the 145 level and any indication of weakness tends to be 
exaggerated he said 
nevertheless analysts said copper supplies remained extremely 
tight demand for the metal appeared to be increasing and the 
2weekold copper miners strike in peru the worlds 
seventhlargest copper producer was being felt beyond the borders 
of that country 
on thursday the southern peru copper corp declared a partial 
force majeure on certain shipments to europe and the united 
states meaning the company would be unable to fulfill all of its 
delivery commitments 
anagnos predicted december copper futures would trade in a range 
from 138 to 146 before making another upward move he called the 
lower end of that range an eminently good buying opportunity 
metals economist fred demler of drexel burnham lambert inc said 
it was prime time to take some profits after the recent rally 
but he added the trend is still up still bullish the market 
just got a little ahead of itself 
precious metals futures prices also retreated on the comex on 
profittaking but analysts said the gold and silver markets were 
displaying resistance to substantial declines 
gold settled 30 cents to 60 cents lower with december at 42370

645 a troy ounce 
on the new york mercantile exchange platinum settled 90 cents to 
280 lower with january at 57770 a troy ounce 
livestock and meat futures posted steep losses on the chicago 
mercantile exchange on a combination of weak fundamental and 
technical factors analysts said 
in the cattle market the cash market softened the carcass 
market was weak movement of boxed beef was light and at lower 
money said michael murphy livestock and meat analyst with dean 
witter reynolds inc in chicago 
a heavy selloff in pork futures was almost entirely due to 
profittaking following recent gains analysts said 
live cattle were 25 cent to 87 cent lower with december at 
7275 cents a pound feeder cattle were 25 cent to 58 cent lower 
with november at 8120 cents a pound hogs were 10 cent to 75 cent 
lower with december at 41 cents a pound frozen pork bellies were 1 
cent to 170 cents lower with february at 4565 cents a pound 
the prices of most grain and soybean futures drifted lower on the 
chicago board of trade as traders disappointed by the fitful pace of 
grain sales for export took profits off the latest speculative rally 
but after the close the usda announced sales of 535000 metric 
tons of soymeal to the soviet union and another 540000 metric tons 
of soybeans and meal to unknown destinations which was expected to 
give the soybean complex a boost on friday

417 a bushel corn was 4 cents lower to 1 cents higher with

the deposit insurance system was never intended 
to cover the catastrophic losses now being generated by the nations 
savings and loan institutions the top federal sampl regulator said 
thursday 
m danny wall chairman of the federal home loan bank board said 
that when congress set up deposit insurance in the wake of the 
depression it intended to cover only a normal level of losses 
however current losses aggravated by a severe recession in the 
oildependent southwest are anything but normal wall noted in a 
speech at the closing session of the us league of savings 
institutions annual convention 
the industry pays for deposit insurance through premium fees now 
that the federal savings and loan insurance corp or fslic faces a 
45 billion to 50 billion problem congress has been preparing to 
debate a taxpayer bailout 
wall said congress never intended for insurance premiums paid by 
sampls to cover catastrophic losses if it had he said it would have 
followed the advice of a 1935 actuarial study and charged an 
insurance premium nearly four times greater than it did 
asked if he was implying that congress should relieve sampls of the 
burden wall said im not saying what the solution is at this 
point 
meanwhile the new chairman of the league br beeksma promised 
he would vigorously pursue tighter regulation when congress begins 
considering how to restructure the business next year 
but beeksma chairman of interwest savings bank in oak harbor 
wash also vowed to fight efforts to restructure the business out 
of existence 
there are those waiting with knives in their hands to carve up 
our distinct and separate regulatory structure he told 2300 
convention delegates 
beeksma complained that healthy sampls have taken a bum rap for 
a relative handful of our institutions who invested in exotic 
and risky ventures such as windmill farms and racehorses 
he said it was time for congress and the executive branch to 
fess up to the fact that they were wrong that they made grievous 
errors when they deregulated our business 
beeksma said healthy sampls cant bear the cost of bailing out the 
fslic without falling into insolvency themselves 
but as part of what he called our neveragain agenda he 
said sampls would accept a clampdown on the kinds of lax oversight 
that contributed to the red ink 
i can promise you that the us league will be vigorous in its 
pursuit of tighter regulation and supervision beeksma said 
however wall said theres plenty of blame to go around and 
the industry was involved along with congress the reagan 
administration and state and federal regulators 
the point isnt whose responsibility is it wall said the 
point is this is all history and its now time for us all to go 
forward 
beeksma replaces theo h pitt jr a north carolina thrift 
executive who served as league chairman for the past year 
the trade group also is getting a new president frederick l 
webber who was an assistant treasury secretary in the ford 
administration and a white house aide under richard nixon he most 
recently was president of the national soft drink association 
webber replaces william b oconnell who has held the leagues 
top staff position since 1979 
oconnell in his outgoing address warned the sampl executives 
that the very existence of our business will be at risk next 
year 
he said a division seems to be developing over the resolution 
of the problems of the fslic and told the delegates they have 
succeeded in the past because they have stuck together no matter 
what 
oconnell said after the speech he was referring to tension 
between healthy and struggling sampls some healthier sampls are trying 
to leave the fslic and join the commercial bank insurance fund the 
federal deposit insurance corp which charges lower premiums 
struggling institutions who cant qualify for fdic membership resent 
that

a colorado man was sentenced thursday to six years 
in prison on charges he masterminded a scheme to defraud the chicago 
board of trade out of 320000 by using a disguised trader with a 
false mustache and forged documents 
in sentencing thompson b sanders and three other men us 
district judge marvin aspen said the case shows the board of trade 
is ripe for corruption and manipulation and that the trading 
pits can be turned into cesspools 
but scott early general counsel for the cbot said the judge 
has obviously seen a very limited part of the board of trade one 
member 
early said board officials began the probe of the 1986 scheme and 
cooperated fully with the us attorneys office in the prosecution 
of the case 
the judge also fined sanders 300000 
you went for the big kill and you almost got away with it 
aspen told sanders 45 
after a threeweek trial sanders a former grain trader who 
operates a restaurant in vail colo was convicted in september of 
conspiracy wire fraud and interstate transporation of stolen 
property 
sanders lawyer former us attorney dan k webb said he would 
appeal 
the other defendants had pleaded guilty and testified against 
sanders 
daniel dewey 39 the man who wore disguises to a restricted 
trading pit at the cbot was given five years in prison and fined 
100000 david pelleu 45 was sentenced to six months of work 
release and fined 11000 and daniel kolton 24 was given five 
years probation 500 hours of community service and fined 2500 
pelleu had helped make phony cbot badges while kolton went on 
the trading floor to act as deweys associate assistant us 
attorney thomas durkin said 
aspen praised pelleu for going to the fbi in january 1987 when 
authorities complained their investigation had hit a dead end and 
explaining the whole scheme 
prosecutors said the disguised dewey traded us treasury bond 
futures at the cbot on four days in the summer of 1986 dewey of 
ashville nc processed his winnings through sanders account at a 
brokerage firm but if dewey had lost money the trades wouldnt 
have been processed and dewey couldnt have been traced because of 
his false identification durkin said 
but webb said sanders set up the plan to shield income from his 
wifes divorce lawyer the defense attorney also maintained that the 
scheme never defrauded any other brokers
