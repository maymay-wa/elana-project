president roh taewoo said monday he is 
postponing a national referendum on his performance because 
violent leftist forces are trying to use it to overthrow the 
government 
in an address on national television roh said it would not be 
of help to the country to hold a national referendum for my 
performance in office at this juncture 
roh said the referendum which had been widely expected sometime 
next month will be held sometime in the future but he gave no date 
the president had been expected this week to announce the date to 
keep a promise he made during 1987 presidential elections 
it was not clear if roh was backing away from the referendum 
because of concern about potential unrest or because he feared the 
government could not win the vote and might be forced into new 
elections 
some opposition and dissident groups had been demanding roh stake 
his presidency on the referendum and step down if defeated it is 
not clear if roh a former general could win a referendum 
the government had said earlier that roh would not step down if 
he were defeated but some senior administration officials have 
conceded a defeat would put pressure on him to call new elections 
roh said antigovernment forces were attempting to use the vote 
to organize violent protests and topple the government dissidents 
and radical students have organized violent demonstrations in recent 
weeks but they have little popular support 
the people are worried roh said leftist forces are trying 
to use the referendum as a foothold to overthrow the free democratic 
system 
south koreas divided opposition parties were split over rohs 
decision 
the party of peace and democracy of kim daejung welcomed the 
decision while the reunification democratic party of kim youngsam 
said it would accept a temporary delay 
kim youngsam had been pushing for a referendum after predicting 
roh would lose kim daejung opposed a referendum apparently 
because kim youngsams party had overtaken his party in opinion 
polls and could win presidential elections 
the two kims are bitter rivals who split the opposition vote in 
december 1987 presidential elections allowing roh to win with 36 
percent of the vote roh promised during the election campaign to 
hold a referendum after his first year in office to give voters a 
chance to evaluate his performance 
roh also said national opinion was split on whether to hold 
the referendum 
one opposition party said the referendum should be on the 
question of policy matters while another party said it should be on 
a vote of noconfidence he said 
in view of these developments the proposed referendum 
originally intended to stabilize the political situation and 
solidify democratization has lost its meaning roh said

a gunman who neighbors said was harassed 
regularly by teenagers shot three young children at an apartment 
building saturday and then wounded a police officer before being 
killed in a gun battle authorities said 
one of the children ivory smith 9 died at 950 pm saturday 
in the trauma center of university hospital in newark she had 
gunshot wounds to the head said bob arnold associate administrator 
of the hospital 
of the two other children boys aged 8 and 12 one remained 
critical and the third was in stable condition at the hospital 
arnold said the administrator declined to identify the children 
citing the wishes of family members 
we dont have a motive yet police chief edward palardy told 
reporters at the scene of the shootings it looks like some sort 
of disaster in there a man appears to have gone berserk and started 
shooting 
the gunman identified as george proctor in his 40s died at 
410 pm of gunshot wounds said margaret francois assistant 
director of nursing at east orange general hospital 
the person that was involved for whatever reason became very 
antagonistic when he returned home this afternoon said west 
orange mayor sam spina who visited the scene 
two witnesses peter anderson and eric green said they saw 
teenage boys tossing stones at proctors cadillac earlier saturday 
while he was driving in orange which borders west orange anderson 
and green said proctor left his car to confront the youths and one 
of the teenagers punched him in the face and threatened him 
the three children who were shot apparently had no connection to 
the earlier incident the witnesses said police said they had heard 
reports of that incident but would not say whether it was a motive 
in the shooting 
one neighbor a 15year resident who said he went fishing 
regularly with the gunman said proctor had been physically and 
verbally harassed recently by teenage boys in an increasingly 
druginfested neighborhood 
his mind probably just snapped said the neighbor who added 
that he would not give his name for fear of an attack on his family 
by neighborhood youths hes a nice guy its a shame this had 
to happen to him 
one witness robert gress who lives across an intersection from 
the apartment building in this new york suburb said he was playing 
solitaire in his home shortly before 3 pm when he heard gunfire 
that sounded like firecrackers 
gress said when he looked outside he saw a young boy by a parked 
car across the street screaming the guys a maniac 
gress said he then saw a police car pull up to the corner and 
the gunman started shooting at the cruiser 
he went to telephone police and when he returned to the window 
the gunman was lying on the ground and the police officer also lay 
wounded on the ground 
the police officer who works for the orange police department 
was not seriously injured spina said he was admitted in stable 
condition at orange memorial hospital said spokeswoman gail proctor 
the officer was on a routine patrol of the neighborhood which 
lies on the border of west orange and the city of orange when he 
heard the gunshots and went to the scene spina said 
palardy said the identity of the officer was not immediately 
available 
proctor first started shooting at a woman in a first floor 
apartment and police believe the gun misfired allowing the woman 
time to run into the bathroom 
the gunman then shot a child in the apartment and went outside 
where he shot two more children spina saidthe police officer hit 
the gunman with four rounds officials said 
residents of the neighborhood said crime there has worsened 
recently with older people forced to live in fear of drugrelated 
violence 
the young teenagers are jumping people all the time said 
deidra biggest a 25yearold resident who has lived in the area for 
eight months houses are getting robbed and cars are getting 
stolen 
its getting worse all the time said michael gorham 26 who 
has lived in the area for six months its crazy out there

thousands of supporters of maverick communist boris 
n yeltsin marched through downtown moscow sunday and vowed to hold 
a general strike if he does not win election next week to the new 
national parliament 
yeltsin who was ousted as moscow party boss after criticizing 
the pace of president mikhail s gorbachevs reforms claims the 
moscow party machine is working to defeat him for many soviets 
yeltsin epitomizes the quest for more democracy and an end to 
special privilege for the government and party elite 
chanting yeltsin yeltsin at least 3000 muscovites set off 
from gorky park after they were refused permission to hold a 
proyeltsin election rally there they marched to moscow city hall 
after scores of uniformed police sealed off kalinin prospekt leading 
to the kremlin 
at city hall the protesters demanded a meeting with lev n 
zaikov the official who replaced yeltsin as the soviet capitals 
communist party boss in november 1987 and who is in charge of the 
moscow party machine they claim is trying to engineer yeltsins 
defeat 
a city official armed with a bullhorn clambered on top of a bus 
to demand that the crowd disperse but it remained in front of the 
municipal building for more than two hours 
one proyeltsin speaker perched beside the city hall door called 
on the crowd to approve a general strike if yeltsin does not win the 
right to represent moscow in the march 26 elections for the congerss 
of peoples deputies and the protesters raised their hands in 
agreement it was not immediately clear when the strike would take 
place 
earlier this month the communist party released a transcript of 
yeltsins remarks at a private central committee meeting in 1987 
that cost him his job as moscow party boss 
the transcript said yeltsin told the gathering that gorbachev had 
become the object of intolerable glorification yeltsin was 
named moscow party chief in december 1985 and a nonvoting politburo 
member two months later he lost both posts as a result of his 
remarks at the oct 21 1987 meeting 
the party said it was publishing a transcript of the meeting in 
its new monthly journal news of the communist party central 
committee because of requests by workers and party members 
but a us specialist said the release of 40 pages of scathing 
attacks on yeltsin by gorbachev and other leaders appeared designed 
to hurt the 58year old yeltsin in his bid for political office 
the transcript showed yeltsin criticized not only gorbachev who 
brought him into the kremlin leadership but yegor k ligachev a 
conservative force on the ruling politburo

george bush still talks about wanting to build 
a kindergentler nation but many of the groups keeping an eye 
on the new president are taking a waitandsee attitude on whether 
he translates words into results 
the president has made several strides to demonstrate his 
commitment to a government that is more compassionate to those in 
need and more attuned to such issues as the environment minority 
concerns and women 
he often describes that aspect of his administration by reviving 
a phrase he used in the campaign when he pledged to make a 
kindergentler nation 
in that vein bush last week submitted to capitol hill his 
legislative proposal for child care a plan that would give a tax 
credit or refund of up to 1000 per child to lowincome people 
he also proposed a 29 percent increase in spending for the 
homeless to 645 million next year he recently spoke about how he 
was disturbed by the sight of homeless people huddled on the grounds 
near the white house 
and bush tempered his opposition to federal gun control and 
bucked the displeasure of his fellow national rifle association 
members by halting the imports of semiautomatic assault guns until 
their usage can be reviewed 
these and other actions give bush a boost simply by comparison 
with his predecessor ronald reagan whose record was considered 
distinctly not kinder or gentler by such groups as women minorities 
and environmentalists 
but these groups are reserving judgment some are waiting for 
more dramatic leadership and others including the 
environmentalists are waiting to see the fine print that goes with 
his positive sounding rhetoric on such issues as acid rain 
he deserves an a for a new tone said the rev jesse jackson 
the twotime democratic presidential candidate who has developed a 
friendly relationship with bush and who has visited with the 
president at the white house 
he said the access bush has given to people who felt locked out 
of the reagan white house has been very positive 
bush has set the right tone but not enough boldness in a right 
direction jackson contended now the question comes to a test 
of leadership it must be bold it must take a direction that will 
remedy fundamental problems 
heather booth president of the liberal lobbying organization 
citizen action said bushs rhetoric is wonderful and that some 
of his actions have been what she called a welcome break from the 
reagan years 
i am giving him credit for understanding theres a new 
progressive opening in the country she said but added i 
havent seen a substantive set of proposals that are convincing in 
being able to rise to the challenges 
some complain that bush or those around him often as not have 
undermined some of the very kindergentler signals he has sent 
some examples 
bush cheered environmentalists when he indefinitely postponed 
offshore oil leasing key environmental tracts off california and 
florida but environmentalists were dismayed that he failed one of 
their highest priority litmus tests when his interior secretary 
manuel lujan announced the administration will allow oil exploration 
in the alaska national wildlife refuge 
bush called for banning of ozonedepleting chloroflourocarbons 
by the end of this century but that was a position that was already 
advocated by many other nations and the united states was seen as 
playing catchup said tom stoel senior attorney for the natural 
resources defense council 
it wasnt so much that bush was antienvironmental as that he 
didnt have his act together he said he indicated he was going 
to be an environmental leader and so far theres been very little 
environmental leadership shown 
bush proposed an increase in the minimum wage to 425 but 
coupled it with a lower socalled training wage for firsttime 
workers and he angered labor activists by refusing to intervene in 
the eastern airlines strike 
bush cast a wellpublicized and wide net to draw more women into 
his administration he named two women to his cabinet labor 
secretary elizabeth dole and us trade representative carla hills 
but he has disappointed feminists by lunching at a private allmale 
club and joining in the merriment at the annual menonly alfalfa 
club dinner 
bush made a strong pitch throughout the preinaugural period and 
in the first two weeks of his presidency for the highest ethical 
standards in the people he appointed to his administration that 
message was somewhat diluted when secretary of state james baker iii 
and white house counsel c boyden gray both voluntarily disentangled 
themselves from financial affairs that became the subject of news 
stories neither was engaged in illegality but said they did not 
want to permit any appearance of impropriety 
administration spokesman insist the kindergentler concept is not 
on the back burner even though it often is overshadowed by 
daytoday events 
we look for opportunities for getting out any of the messages 
hes trying to get across said white house communications 
director david demarest well see more kindergentler well see 
more of the entirety of the program 
for her part first lady barbara bush has had no trouble making a 
kindergentler image a big part of her white house life 
her first public event outside the white house was a visit to a 
daycare center for homeless children in addition to her longtime 
promotion of literacy efforts she has visited soup kitchens 
nursing homes and a schoolchildrens celebration of black history 
month 
mrs bush also has set up a foundation to raise money for 
literacy programs

the long dreary wait for the end of winter is 
nearing its end as nature gradually edges into change human 
patience also nearing its limits with winter can draw 
encouragement from the spring equinox monday 
while the change of seasons is a gradual often fitful thing 
calendars usually list the solstices and equinoxes as unofficial 
markers of these transitions 
the first day of spring is one thing and the first spring day 
is another observed the late henry van dyke aware that march 
weather can be fickle and also that the change of seasons can occur 
at markedly different dates in different parts of the nation 
even so millions will welcome spring at 1028 am est the 
moment of the vernal equinox when the sun crosses the equator on 
its apparent journey northward according to astronomers at the us 
naval observatory in washington 
this and the autumnal equinox in september are the only two 
dates on which the sun rises directly in the east and sets precisely 
in the west the observatory reports 
these directions were used to align the great pyramids in egypt 
with an error equivalent to the thickness of a piece of string seen 
at a distance of six feet said observatory spokeswoman gail cleere 
ancient graves in ireland and temples in guatemala are also aligned 
to the equinoxes she said 
for the human mind too the change may be a point of alignment 
spring is a transition season when things change very 
rapidly observed the late helmut landsberg professor emeritus of 
meteorology at the university of maryland 
one major thing is apparently the change in light the most 
rapid increase in light intensity occurs between february and 
april landsberg explained and this seems to affect human glands 
and internal reactions 
other fluctuations causing humans to react include rapid 
temperature changes in many places sometimes highly irregular 
changing from low to high to high to low again said landsberg 
who researched the biological effects of weather 
poets and philosophers have lauded spring over the centuries with 
a curious mixture of cheer and woe reflecting the differing 
reactions of humans to the stress of changing weather 
as mark twain observed of new englands weather it gets 
through more business in spring than in any other season i have 
counted 136 different kinds of weather inside of 24 hours 
this places stress on the body and scientists are beginning to 
believe the mind also 
human responses vary malaise romance and even depression are 
among the reactions to these seasonal changes although socalled 
spring fever has been most widely identified with that vague feeling 
of disinterest mindwandering and restlessness 
nature writer hal borland reflected on the seasonal change in the 
book twelve moons of the year 
there is something in a mild march day that can touch a man to 
the very quick of his being just what it is cannot readily be 
stated but it must be compounded of sunlight and air and warmth and 
an immeasurable mystery that is partly summed up by the word 
promise 
when the first warm days of spring come we all feel a desire 
to escape to run away it becomes difficult to concentrate on 
serious matters and we experience indefinable vague yearnings that 
disturb our psychic balance and have a bad influence on our 
professional activities wrote dr michel gauquelin a french 
psychologist in his book how atmospheric conditions affect your 
health 
spring is a period when new romances start when fresh plans 
are made but it is also a season when people experience frequent 
changes of mood and have bitter arguments with one another 
gauquelin wrote 
his volume attributes peoples response to spring hormonal 
crisis when the endocrine glands are more active and sexual 
interest heightened 
whether the changes are the result of hormones sunlight or other 
factors nearly everyone observes and reacts to them 
german studies in the 1960s found that most illegitimate 
conceptions tended to occur in may which the researchers suggested 
seems to indicate that spring may well be the season for all forms 
of impulsive behavior 
on the darker side french sociologist emile durkheim noted a 
halfcentury ago that suicides increase in the spring 
the us centers for disease control studied the nations suicide

soviet leaders warned last year that their 
definition of democracy might be a bit different from the western 
one 
so far theyre right 
as the soviet union lurches toward its first multicandidate 
elections it is clear that president mikhail s gorbachevs reforms 
have brought amazing latitude in public debate to a country that 
punished unorthodox ideas with harsh prison terms just a few years 
ago 
now even the evils of democracy are taking seed in this changing 
landscape 
political neophytes are battling entrenched communist party 
officials using classic tactics of election rigging they pack 
caucus halls with handpicked voters bar electors from holding 
nomination meetings by denying them a hall or simply toss 
candidates off the ballot 
traditional authoritarianism is entangled with the new freedoms 
two weeks ago ukrainian activists were detained for distributing 
dangerous literature which turned out to be copies of the election 
law 
at meetings during the campaign for the new congress of peoples 
deputies passions run wild across the country tens of thousands 
of people are seizing microphones and the opportunity to speak out 
on everything from human rights to snow removal 
on sunday at least 3000 people marched in moscow to back boris 
yeltsin an independent candidate one recent caucus debate ran 13 
hours yet only 13 of 888 people had left by 3 am said moscow 
election official igor orlov 
despite the publicity over the multicandidate elections one in 
four districts has only one name on the ballot many of the 
unopposed candidates are local communist party chiefs 
its just the same as 10 years ago in the brezhnev era one 
candidate for each district and each one a power in the party 
complains andrei deravyankin an independent democratic union member 
from the volga river town of saratov 
still new ideas are holding sway newspapers have exposed 
hundreds of cases of nondemocratic behavior citizens have 
flooded the national commission overseeing the elections with more 
than 77000 complaints and reformers are discovering political 
tricks of their own 
there are dozens of violations of the letter of the law 
acknowledged election commission deputy dmitri b golovko at a 
recent news conference the law itself will be revised he promised 
at this point it seems possible that the same men who run the 
country on the 12member communist party politburo could wind up 
controlling the key legislative committees in the new parliament 
but it also seems possible the congress will be full of new faces 
determined to make the soviet government responsive to the public 
the candidates include former political prisoners stalin 
historian and party outcast roy medvedev reform economist oleg 
bogomolov who disclosed the soviet unions huge deficit estonian 
popular front leader marju lauristen environmental activists and 
the patriarch of the russian orthodox church according to a western 
diplomat tracking the election 
yeltsin the pugnacious former moscow communist chief who was 
demoted in november 1987 after stepping on toes with an 
anticorruption campaign is running for the moscow seat against 
organized party opposition 
as always though the communist party dominates moscow news 
found 82 percent of the candidates are party members 
the law itself is partly to blame for the manipulation some 
people complain 
since a third of the deputies are being elected by certain public 
organizations a communist party member who also belongs to the 
union of writers and the soviet peace committee can participate in 
all three of those elections and vote in his residential district as 
well 
election caucuses can legally slash the number of candidates and 
they have often rejected reformers nuclear physicist and human 
rights activist andrei d sakharov for example was nominated by 60 
research institutes but the soviet academy of sciences presidium 
rejected him in favor of a slate of old guard managers 
in many of the public organizations there is even less choice 
because leaders bar rankandfile members from voting 
the communist party itself set the tone when it took 31000 names 
and boiled them down to 100 candidates for 100 seats 
moreover even if reformers manage to win a place in the 
2250seat congress of peoples deputies in march 26 voting they 
still may not wield much power 
no official date has been announced for the bodys first session 
but the law calls for it to meet just one day a year to elect the 
real working parliament with fewer than 500 members 
a communist party majority in the congress could easily elect 
only its own members to the real positions of legislative power

congress is making one of its slowest starts in 
recent memory as it heads toward april with little accomplished but 
a series of bruising internal battles 
the senate will be on a twoweek easter break starting monday 
but before leaving friday it confirmed rep dick cheney as defense 
secretary 
the noncontroversial ratification was a breeze after the bitter 
struggle over president bushs first choice for the job former sen 
john tower the rejection of tower by a 5347 vote largely along 
party lines handed bush a major defeat and absorbed the senate for 
nearly two months 
the house which doesnt start its easter break until friday 
faces floor votes this week on raising the minimum wage and 
legislation protecting whistleblowers government workers who 
report corruption within their own agencies 
house members also may this week get a report from the ethics 
committee on speaker jim wright the 12member committee which 
undertook the inquiry into the texas democrats financial dealings 
nine months ago began deliberating last week on whether wright 
broke house rules 
their investigation coupled with the illfated fight to raise 
congressional pay and now a search among republican members for a 
minority whip have sidetracked house action on any major 
legislation so far this session 
house republicans are expected to choose wednesday between two 
candidates vying for the number two leadership post reps edward 
madigan of illinois and newt gingrich of georgia are competing to 
succeed cheney of wyoming who resigned last week after being 
confirmed as defense secretary 
gingrich is the leader of an activist conservative wing of the 
party while madigan currently the deputy whip is regarded as a 
pragmatist who would probably be more willing to work with the 
democrats to win support for bushs programs 
the house is scheduled to vote tuesday on a bill to expand the 
rights of federal employees who blow the whistle on fraud 
the measure sailed through the senate last thursday 970 and 
bush has promised to sign it after the house completes its work 
similar legislation was the subject of one of president reagans 
most controversial vetoes 
the legislation would lower the burden of proof for 
whistleblowers who claim they have been punished by their employers 
for disclosing misdeeds within their agencies and increase the 
burden of proof for the federal agencies defending their decisions 
house floor debate over the minimum wage is expected to begin 
wednesday with democrats seeking an increase from 335 to 465 by 
1992 republicans are supporting the bush proposal that minimum 
wages raise only to 425 by 1992 with a provision that employers 
be allowed to pay new workers 335 for the first six months 
the minimum wage has not increased since 1981 
budget negotiators from both the house and senate are to exchange 
offers this week with democrats expected to push for military cuts 
equal to domestic spending cuts in the fiscal 1990 budget 
rep leon panetta dcalif chairman of the house budget 
committee said he and senate budget committee chairman jim sasser 
dtenn planned to work together in drafting a democratic budget 
proposal in addition to the balance between domestic and military 
spending cuts panetta said he wants new revenues to equal the 
overall spending cuts 
also this week the house banking subcommittee will hold the last 
of more than three dozen congressional hearings on the savings and 
loan crisis listening a final time to white house budget director 
richard darman and federal reserve chairman alan greenspan before 
writing a 100 billion bailout plan 
banking committees in both houses using bushs proposal as the 
foundation but possibly altering many of its key provisions plan to 
put the actual bailout package together the first week congress is 
back in session after easter

a major government advisory conference convened 
sunday with speakers urging unity in solving chinas growing 
economic problems setting the tone for a legislative session that 
opens monday 
the brief and businesslike opening session of the 2081member 
chinese peoples political consulative conference emphasized working 
together under the leadership of the ruling communist party 
the somber theme was in sharp contrast to the conferences last 
full meeting in april 1988 which saw unprecedented lively debate 
and calls for democracy 
since then however overheated economic growth has produced 
chronic shortages widespread corruption and annual inflation of 36 
percent causing a slowdown in both economic and political reforms 
conference chairman li xiannian urged the delegates to share the 
governments concerns offer their suggestions and dedicate 
themselves to finding solutions 
vice chairman qian weichang who delivered a 13page work report 
called on the delegates to be ceaselessly diligent in pushing 
forward the governments economic policies 
the speeches were greeted with only perfunctory applause by the 
delegates who attended the 80minute session in the great hall of 
the people in central beijing 
the conference draws delegates from among scientists scholars 
writers and official organizations 
its annual plenary session scheduled to last 10 days is always 
timed to coincide with the annual meeting of the national peoples 
congress chinas legislature the congress begins its 16day 
session monday 
officials reportedly have attempted to discourage unwelcome 
debate and criticism of government policies at both meetings this 
year because of concern that the economic problems could trigger 
social instability 
conference official cheng siyuan reported that delegates have 
made more than 2000 suggestions to the government since their last 
full meeting and that more than a quarter of these have been 
adopted but he gave no details about the nature of the suggestions 
he said delegates have been briefed from time to time by 
officials on government policy and helped carry it out especially 
by joining in efforts to police prices and cut back on wasteful 
construction projects 
the speakers clear message was that chinas increasingly restive 
intellectuals can best serve the country by using their talents to 
implement party decisions rather than questioning or criticizing 
them 
the opening session was attended by senior party and government 
leaders including general secretary zhao ziyang premier li peng

the political wounds of a 10yearold 
sexual assault allegation have been reopened for mayor dana rinehart 
with a city council probe and filing of a lawsuit that could mean 
the end of his hopes of running for governor 
rinehart was franklin county treasurer a rising star in the 
local republican party in 1978 when his childrens 13yearold baby 
sitter accused him of sexually assaulting her while she slept on a 
couch in rineharts home he has denied the allegation and a grand 
jury failed to indict him 
but a newspaper story last fall resulted in the council 
investigation and one by the police department into whether a police 
officer spied on the girls family in 1983 in an attempt to 
discredit her and gain a police endorsement for rinehart who was 
running for mayor 
rinehart didnt get the endorsement but he won the election he 
is now serving his second fouryear term as mayor of ohios capital 
city 
rinehart 43 said he does not know how the resurrection of what 
has become known locally as the baby sitter incident will affect 
his political future which he at one time had hoped would be spent 
in the governors office 
onceplentiful rumors that rinehart planned to run for governor 
in 1990 have died down since the investigations despite an ohio 
state university poll in january that showed he had a 78 percent 
approval rating in the city of approximately 600000 it was his 
highest rating ever 
part of me would love to be governor but part of me says no 
ive had a taste of politics that has not been good the jury is 
still out in my heart and in my head he said 
the former baby sitter vicki rae pardue now 23 said she hopes 
rineharts political future is indeed wounded 
i dont think rinehart has any business being anywhere in 
politics which includes governor she said at a news conference 
on wednesday 
on thursday two weeks after the council hearings ms pardues 
stepmother linda pardue filed suit in us district court against 
rinehart and the police officer accused of spying contending they 
engaged in a political conspiracy against the family 
in 1978 ms pardue told police that she was asleep on rineharts 
couch when she awoke to find him performing oral sex on her she 
contended he then kissed her on the mouth said he would be back 
later and walked out of the room 
ms pardue later passed a policeadministered polygraph test 
rinehart who was advised by his lawyer not to submit to a police 
test said he passed a privately administered polygraph test 
for 10 years questions have surrounded the propriety of a 
franklin county grand jury hearing into ms pardues allegations 
rinehart was allowed to testify before the grand jury an 
opportunity that is only rarely afforded the accused in ohio 
also permitted to testify on rineharts behalf was a psychiatric 
expert who told the jury that although he had not interviewed ms 
pardue she may have dreamed the incident and believed it had 
actually happened 
the grand jury declined to indict rinehart 
the baby sitter incident resurfaced last october when the 
plain dealer in cleveland reported that police officer john morgan 
a devoted rinehart supporter had conducted secret politically 
motivated surveillance on the pardue family for two months in 1983 
after rinehart was elected morgan was promoted from the police 
force to deputy city safety director and then deputy city 
development director he was fired after he refused to cooperate in 
a police investigation a few days after the plain dealer story 
rinehart says he knew nothing about morgans investigation or the 
officers 13page report of his findings until the newspaper queried 
morgan about it oct 7 he plays down the controversy surrounding 
morgans activities 
weve had city employees who unfortunately have done things 
that are out of line weve had worse stuff than this we had a 
police officer who robbed banks rinehart said 
the internal police investigation of morgan which ended in 
november found no criminal activity although police said their 
investigation was hampered by the fact that morgan refused to be 
interviewed 
the findings of a council investigation which concluded march 2 
after three days of testimony from rinehart morgan and others 
will be known next month 
testimony at the hearings raised questions about whether rinehart 
knew of the report and who in the police department and his campaign 
may have authorized the surveillance 
morgan who testified under a grant of immunity said he 
conducted the surveillance with neither the knowledge nor permission 
of his superiors rinehart or any member of the rinehart campaign 
i didnt feel they had a need to know morgan said 
he testified that he researched the pardue familys geneological 
history recorded license numbers of mourners at the funeral of miss 
pardues father in 1983 and obtained information on the familys 
banking records without obtaining a subpoena an order required 
under federal bank righttoprivacy laws morgan said he conducted 
the investigation on city time and used city equipment 
rineharts testimony that he didnt know about morgans report 
until last fall was contradicted by testimony from two local 
reporters who told the city council they had confronted rinehart 
with a copy of it in 1983 a third said hed seen a copy of the 
report in 1983 
the pardue lawsuit seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive 
damages as well as preliminary and permanent injunctions ordering 
the defendants to halt any further investigation of the family no 
hearing date was set

a stalled aerial ride left about 150 
persons dangling in the sky over disneyland up to five hours while 
workers struggled to rescue them 
the skyway cable stopped saturday apparently after someone in 
one of the fourperson gondolas began rocking their car vigorously 
said disneyland spokesman bob mctyre 
about 150 people were aboard the ride at the time no injuries 
were reported during the shutdown and ensuing fivehour rescue 
effort mctyre said 
all the attractions in fantasyland and several in tomorrowland 
were closed because fire trucks had to maneuver underneath each car 
during the prolonged rescue effort firefighters used hydraulic lift 
equipment to rescue passengers one by one from gondolas suspended 
about 40 feet overhead 
the gondola ride shut down automatically saturday evening the 
spokesman said riders had to be lowered to the amusement park floor 
by firefighters using extension equipment 
eyewitnesses reported one guest car being swung by a guest 
severely back and forth mctyre said were speculating thats 
what triggered the skyway safety system to shut down like it did 
firefighters from the anaheim orange county and garden grove 
fire department assisted in the rescue effort he said 
the guests have all been calm and no one was injured mctyre 
said its just been a big inconvenience both for people stuck up 
in the air and those on the ground 
no legal action was planned against the riders blamed for setting 
off the rides emergency shutdown system the spokesman said

as business and labor argue over raising the 
minimum wage the potential impact on the federal budget and major 
jobs programs has been virtually lost in the debate 
that changes this week when the bitterly partisan debate reaches 
the house floor 
some say raising the minimum wage from its current 335 an hour 
to 465 as proposed would have virtually no impact on the federal 
budget others argue it would cost the budget and taxpayers as 
much as 5 billion 
although most democrats have downplayed any budget impact an 
analysis prepared last week by the congressional budget office for 
the democratic sponsors of the legislation conceded that raising the 
minimum wage could cost the government money and possibly force cuts 
in at least four jobs programs 
the nonpartisan cbo said it could not estimate the potential cost 
because of insufficient data 
but a house republican analysis estimates that if the democrats 
bill becomes law it would cost 570 million a year by 1992 to 
maintain current staffing levels in just those four programs 
college work study head start community service for older 
americans and the federal governments summer youth employment 
program 
without that money those programs will be forced to cut more 
than 435000 jobs with work study the campus jobs often awarded as 
part of a students financial aid package accounting for half the 
total according to the republicans 
somebody must speak out on behalf of the victims of this 
legislation rep dick armey rtexas said in an interview the 
democrats like to talk about these programs but compassion without 
understanding can be cruel and wasteful 
armey tried unsuccessfully to amend the democratic bill in 
committee last week to exempt the four programs from having to pay 
their workers any increase in the minimum wage only four fellow 
republicans sided with armey as the amendment was trounced 
he promised to try again during floor debate 
jay butler an aide to rep augustus hawkins dcalif sponsor 
of the house legislation said hawkins would support increased 
spending on the programs to save the jobs but opposes paying their 
workers less than the minimum wage 
the prospects of getting more money for the programs to offset 
the added payroll costs are between zero and none countered 
armey also a member of the house budget committee 
republicans are supporting president bushs proposal for a more 
modest increase to 425 an hour by 1992 provided employers are 
allowed to pay new workers 335 an hour for six months 
that would alleviate some of the cost to the government the 
republicans say their analysis did not include data on the bush 
plan 
white house estimates of the impact the democratic minimumwage 
bill would have on the budget range up to 5 billion 
that figure came from bushs council of economic advisers which 
in a report to the labor department said a higher minimum wage would 
cause an inflationary spiral in all wages and a subsequent hike in 
interest rates it estimated those higher rates would result in the 
government having to pay from 2 billion to 5 billion in higher 
interest for the money it borrows 
two other topics have dominated the debate over the minimum wage 
whether a training wage should be included in the legislation 
and to what degree raising the minimum wage results in job losses 
bush insists his support hinges on raising the minimum no higher 
than 425 an hour with the accompanying provision allowing 
employers to pay the subminimum for six months 
democrats apparently convinced they cannot override a bush veto 
have shown increased willingness to support some form of training 
wage and plan to tag such a provision onto the house bill this week 
but it will require specific training unlike bushs proposal and 
have a far shorter life span than the six months espoused by the 
president 
butler said hawkins was reviewing a handful of training wage 
proposals and although he has been a staunch critic of the idea 
will select one to add to his bill he knows president bush will 
be there for four years and would accept a bonafide training wage 
butler said 
as for potential job losses the bush administration maintains 
the democratic bill would cost 650000 jobs by 1992 while the 
presidents more modest proposal would cost about 200000 
the democrats have assailed those figures saying past increases 
in the minimum wage have not caused significant job losses but the 
congressional budget office in a report sent to hawkins on friday 
estimated that raising the minimum to 465 would cause a loss of 
from 125000 to 250000 jobs

china condemned as interference separate 
resolutions by the us senate and european parliament accusing 
beijing of human rights violations in tibet official reports said 
sunday 
we express strong indignation and deep regret the peoples 
daily said quoting a harshlyworded statement from the foreign 
affairs committee of the national peoples congress 
the legislative committee also lodged a strong protest sunday 
against the us resolution the xinhua news agency said similar 
resolutions in the past have become major points of friction between 
the two countries 
the us resolution blatantly supports a handful of separatists 
in tibet xinhua quoted the statement as saying 
the committee saturday condemned the european parliament 
resolution which urged beijing to lift martial law and called on 
european nations to help mediae the tibetan problem 
the tibetan people are a member of the big family of the 
chinese nation any attempt to internationalize the tibetan question 
on the excuse of human rights is firmly opposed by the chinese 
government and will never succeed the statement said 
its strong language is in keeping with chinas policy of harshly 
rejecting outside criticism of its actions in tibet which it claims 
has been part of chinas territory since the 13th century 
many tibetans say they enjoyed de facto independence before 
chinese communist troops entered in 1950 they accuse the chinese of 
human rights violations and of trying to destroy tibets 
buddhistbased culture 
the european parliament passed its resolution thursday about the 
martial law china imposed march 8 after three days of antichinese 
violence in the tibetan capital lhasa at least 12 people were 
killed in the fourth bloody tibetanchinese confrontation in the 
past 18 months 
the parliament also appealed to foreign ministers of the 
12member european community to offer their mediation 
we are firmly opposed to and will by no means accept such 
mediation the chinese statement said no foreign government 
organization or individual is allowed to meddle in the question of 
negotiations between the chinese central government and the dalai 
lama the dalai lama is a selfexile many tibetans consider their 
temporal and spiritual leader 
the us senate which also acted thursday has approved 
nonbinding resolutions in the past urging the state department to 
pressure china to end alleged human rights violations in tibet 
two days after china imposed martial law on tibet the us state 
department issued a statement of concern which china dismissed as 
interference 
the chinese government is entirely justified and above reproach 
in taking the necessary measures to uphold law and maintain order 
the chinese legislative committee said 
it reiterated chinas willingness to hold talks with the dalai 
lama but ruled out independence or autonomy for the remote region 
we strongly demand that the european parliament immediately 
stop its interference in chinas internal affairs so as to prevent 
doing any harm to our bilateral relations it said 
it similarly warned the us senate to act in the interests of 
safeguarding chineseus relations

an overwhelming majority of americans say they 
would buy organically grown food if it cost the same as fruits and 
vegetables treated with pesticides or synthetic fertilizers and 
nearly half would pay more according to a survey released sunday 
the strong preference for chemicalfree fruits and vegetables 
showed up in a survey conducted even before the recent scare over 
poisoned grapes and apples treated with alar 
the louis harris poll conducted for organic gardening magazine 
found that 842 percent of those surveyed would choose organically 
grown food if given the choice 116 percent would not and 42 
percent were not sure 
perhaps more surprisingly 49 percent said they would pay more 
for organic food the poll showed 
people with college degrees and those earning a household income 
of more than 35000 are more likely to have eaten organic produce 
than those with less education or a lower income the poll showed 
men under 50 who live in the west and have managerial or 
professional jobs are the most likely to have eaten organic food 
according to the survey people in the south are the least likely 
the reason almost 60 percent of those surveyed gave for choosing 
organic was longterm health effects 
the majority of those who have eaten organically grown fruits and 
vegetables said they taste better have more nutritional value and 
are better for health 
but while consumers may want to switch to organics the problem 
is finding organically grown food 
on the west coast and a few places on the east coast there are 
some supermarkets that have organic sections within their stores 
said stevie o daniels executive editor of organic gardening 
magazine but usually you have to go to speciality stores 
she said her magazines research shows the organic farmers share 
of the 36 billion fruit and vegetable market is about 5 billion 
three states washington minnesota and texas have organic 
certification programs through which consumers are assured the 
grower does not use synthetic fertilizers or pesticides daniels 
said 
organic food usually costs 5 percent to 15 percent more and 
sometimes doesnt look as picture perfect as other fruits and 
vegetables she said 
from my point of view it is a more realistic looking product 
she said nature is not perfect 
organic produce got a bad reputation because the people growing 
it tried to do the marketing and they didnt know how to market it 
but now growers work with marketing professionals she said 
the nationwide survey was based on 1250 telephone interviews 
with randomly selected adults throughout the continental united 
states between nov 9 and nov 23 1988 the sampling error is plus 
or minus 3 percentage points 
the poll was taken well before last weeks temporary ban of 
chilean fruit because two grapes had been injected with the poison 
cyanide 
it also came before the most recent flap over use on apples of 
alar a chemical that aides ripening and helps preserve crispness 
that resulted in some schools banning apples from their menus 
there has been a highprofile campaign against alar including an 
appeal last week by actress meryl streep in a wellpublicized 
appearance before a congressional committee 
however surgeon general c everett koop joined other federal 
officials over the weekend in attempting to assure the public it is 
safe to eat apples 
i wish to send a message to mothers across the country its 
mom apples are good for your kids said koop 
he noted that only 5 percent of the us apple crop was treated 
with alar in 1988 food and drug commissioner frank young has said 
that even in those apples sprayed with alar the level is no more 
than 10 percent the level found acceptable under environmental 
protection agency regulations

recognized the republic renewing a campaign for him and his son to 
be allowed to return from a 43year exile despite a constitutional 
ban media reports said sunday 
in a letter to italian president francisco cossiga published in 
italian newspapers victor emmanuel wrote from exile in switzerland 
that he is not however renouncing his claim to the former throne 
of the house of savoy 
victor emmanuel 51 wrote the letter saturday the sixth 
anniversary of the death of his father king umberto ii 
i want to do today what my father was not in a position to do 
and that is to recognize this incontrovertible reality that is the 
italian republic he wrote 
he said he was appealing especially on behalf of his 17yearold 
son emmanuel filiberto whom he hoped would be allowed to attend an 
italian military academy and university

relinquishing his claim to the throne but he quickly denied that 
was the case 
i want to return to italy as soon as possible he told 
milans corriere della sera newspaper i say simply that i 
recognize the republic because its there i will never never 
renounce my royal prerogatives i am totally monarchist 
victor emmanuel has appealed in the past for the government to 
allow his family to return italys 1947 constitution however bans 
the entry of victor emmanuel and his heirs from the country and

altered 
umberto ii reigned for 26 days before being forced into exile in 
1946 when italians voted by a slim margin to abolish the monarchy 
umberto ii died in geneva in 1983 at the age of 78

entry of his widow the exqueen maria jose she has since returned 
to italy on a few occasions but continues to live in switzerland

the pilot laughed when asked why he is willing to 
risk his job in the showdown between eastern airlines and its unions 
for five years every time the little guy with the rifle walked 
by he made me bow down said jerry gerndt i came out of 
vietnam with my head held up and im not going to spend the rest of 
my life looking down when i pass other pilots 
he is among the 3400 eastern pilots who stunned management by 
joining the march 4 walkout by the machinists union hes also a 
former prisoner of war 
air force 1st lt gerald l gerndt piloting an f4 phantom 
fighter on a bombing mission to hanoi was shot down aug 23 1967 
five years and five months later gerndt was flown out of hanoi on a 
us transport plane 
he carried with him the wounds of years of torture and 
mistreatment that led to broken ribs damaged joints hepatitis and 
repeated bouts with dysentery he also carried out a changed 
philosophy of life 
little things in life dont bother you so much said gerndt 
46 you want to stand up and be counted if someone is trying to 
take advantage of people and trying to force his ideas and views on 
them 
eastern which had hoped to keep at least 25 percent of its 
prestrike schedule of 1040 daily flights during the strike is 
struggling to maintain 10 percent with the walkout well into its 
third week 
the executives put in place three years ago by texas air corp 
chairman frank lorenzo admitted they badly overestimated the number 
of pilots who would keep flying only about 200 eastern pilots have 
crossed the picket lines 
pilots often have ignored the picket lines of other airline 
unions but the eastern pilots say they learned from continental 
pilots who lost their union along with the machinsts in 1983 even 
though the pilots didnt honor picket lines 
the pilots also say they believe that lorenzo whose texas air 
also owns continental is bent on stripping eastern of its assets 
while chipping away at employees pay and work conditions 
pilots union spokesman jb stokes said another key to 
understanding the eastern pilots resolve is that 75 percent or more 
are military veterans many with vietnam experience 
one of the problems is this management has been trying to use 
intimidation and coercion said stokes a b52 pilot who flew 
vietnam combat missions in 1969 it speaks to the frank lorenzo 
philosophy and shows how badly he misunderstands these pilots 
these people know what it really is to be afraid theyve put 
their lives on the line in a hostile environment stokes said 
if i survived vietnam i damn sure am not going to be concerned 
about a guy putting memos on a bulletin board 
gerndt said as much as he loves flying and the lifestyle of a 
pilot for a major carrier the jobs not worth giving in to 
demeaning management 
he recounted his vietnam experience last week talking by 
telephone from his milwaukee financial consulting office where he 
works when not walking picket lines 
he was in one of the first bombing missions into north vietnam 
when he was shot down gerndt and his copilot ejected about 20 
miles north of hanoi and he could hear bullets pinging the 
parachutes canopy as he fell 
they were captured when they landed stripped of their clothes 
and marched to hanoi most of his imprisonment was in the infamous 
hanoi hilton 
it started as soon as i got there it was just like everything 
you ever heard about beatings rope tricks where they tie you up 
and put stress on different joints like a variation of the rack 
at times you wonder if you will die there but you have to have 
hope thats all you have left gerndt said 
he was freed in january 1973 as us involvement in vietnam was 
winding down and by that august he was flying for eastern shortly 
afterward he was laid off because of cutbacks because of the energy 
crisis and he got an mba from stanford university 
gerndt said his eastern salary is below the 70000 to 75000 
average the air line pilots association estimates eastern pilots 
earn annually he said given the education and skills the pilots 
have they resent lorenzo and other managers efforts to put them 
near the bottom of the barrel in the industry 
basically i look at it that hes trying to destroy 
employees way of living gerndt said why would i want to 
work for a man like that

thousands of soviets took to the streets sunday to 
accuse the communist party of sabotaging boris n yeltsins election 
campaign and to threaten a general strike if the maverick reformer 
fails to win office 
the march through downtown moscow by 3000 soviets chanting 
hands off yeltsin was an extraordinary outburst of passions 
aroused by sundays election for a new national parliament the 
congress of peoples deputies 
security forces did not halt the march even though it violated a 
regulation requiring that authorities receive prior notice 
yeltsin 58 is running to represent the soviet capital where he 
headed the local party apparatus for almost two years before 
president mikhail s gorbachev fired him 
at preelection meetings and in a televised debate with his 
opponent automobile factory manager yevgeny brakov the stocky 
whitehaired yeltsin has charged the party machine he once led of 
conspiring against his candidacy and restricting voters access to 
his campaign appearances 
thousands of yeltsin supporters planned to rally after noon 
sunday at southwestern moscows gorky park where a russian folklore 
festival was under way when they were told permission for the 
meeting had been refused they set off for the citys downtown 
their anger was also kindled by a recent decision of the partys 
policymaking central committee announced thursday to form a 
special commission to investigate charges that yeltsin who is still 
a central committee member opposes some party policies 
the highlevel campaign against yeltsin appeared to enter another 
phase sunday when the daily newspaper of moscows party and 
government printed an account about yeltsins character and 
politics the newspaper moskovskaya pravda said it was a myth 
he was more faithful to principles than others 
yeltsin won the hearts and support of many muscovites with a 
campaign against corruption and spirited attacks on the privileges 
from special food stores to chauffeured limousines available to the 
government and party elite 
hes against the party mafia and thats why the party mafia is 
against him declared one marcher on sunday taras osipov 65 a 
retired engineer yeltsin is with the people and for the people 
the demonstrators who carried a handpainted banner reading 
yes to yeltsin no to the bureaucratic system glued proyeltsin 
posters to the walls of buildings along their route including the 
foreign ministry press center and called on passersby to join them 
on kalinin prospekt scores of grayuniformed police officers 
backed up by kgb agents in plainclothes barred the way to the 
kremlin the seat of soviet power the marchers including 
teenagers and people in their 60s then marched past the 
headquarters of the soviet news agency tass and arrived at gorky 
street moscows major shopping thoroughfare 
police and kgb agents along the route channeled the marchers but 
made no attempt to halt them even though their protest violated 
moscow city regulations that require seven days notice of any 
demonstration 
the street resounded with the chant of hands off yeltsin as 
the marchers approached the fivestory redandwhite columned 
building that serves as moscows city hall 
there another cordon of police and yellow buses parked across 
the avenue barred their way 
in unison the protesters brandished their fists and chanted 
their demand to meet with lev n zaikov a member of the ruling 
party politburo who succeeded yeltsin as moscow party boss in 
november 1987 and who leads the party machine yeltsin claims is 
working for his defeat 
when a city official clambered on top of a bus and told the crowd 
through a bullhorn to break up the protest there were whistles of 
derision and chants of shame shame from the crowd 
one bearded proyeltsin speaker near the buildings doorway 
shouted shame on our soviet democracy shame on our leaders 
when the elderly man called for a oneday work stoppage across 
moscow if yeltsin is defeated the crowd roared and raised its hands 
in approval 
last week the central committee in its monthly bulletin 
published yeltsins october 1987 speech to the party body that got 
him sacked as moscow party chief jerry hough a us political 
scientist who specializes in soviet studies said the timing of the 
publication was aimed at discrediting yeltsin as he tries to win 
election 
yeltsin told the central committee on oct 21 1987 that faith in 
gorbachevs reforms was waning and that the president was becoming 
the subject of intolerable glorification yeltsin who had been 
named moscow party boss in december 1985 and a nonvoting member of 
the politburo two months later lost both posts as a result of his 
remarks 
he was later named to a ministerialrank job in the state 
construction committee which oversees building in the soviet union

demands for an independent inquiry into britains 
handling of warnings received before the bombing of pan am flight 
103 will grow until the government explains its actions an 
opposition party leader said sunday 
we cannot afford bag it and bin it policies of british 
official secrecy on matters of security which affect every air 
traveler across the world said paddy ashdown leader of the 
centrist social and liberal democratic party 
transport secretary paul channon must come clean on all the 
circumstances surrounding the advance warning ashdown said in a 
statement 
unless he comes to the house of commons at the earliest 
opportunity next week and is competely candid in every detail the 
demand for an official inquiry on both sides of the atlantic will 
become irresistible he said 
those demanding an independent inquiry include the opposition 
labor party and relatives of those killed when flight 103 exploded 
over lockerbie scotland dec 21 on a flight to new york 
investigators say the disaster in which 259 died aboard the plane 
and 11 on the ground was caused by a bomb concealed in a 
radiocassette player packed in luggage in the planes hold 
channon said sunday he told parliament as much as it is in my 
power to tell government ministers should not go around 
revealing things that might be against the national interest he 
told the british broadcasting corp 
channon said he welcomed us transportation secretary samuel 
skinners decision to send top aides to london and frankfurt west 
germany to assess aviation security skinner said he wants his 
officials to determine among other things when and how warnings 
were made against pan am flights last year 
the investigators have been working extremely closely with the 
americans at all stages and i think if they come over here and the 
investigators have further talks with them that can only be a very 
good thing channon said 
there is keen public concern in the united states and in this 
country about the progress of this investigation and its not 
surprising that people should wish to come over and have further 
talks 
the transport department confirmed last week it prepared a 
warning dated dec 19 that included photographs of a bomb hidden in 
a radiocassette player but did not mail it until after christmas 
channon has said the letter was of little importance because 
similar information had been sent out a month earlier by the us 
federal aviation administration and by west germany flight 103 
originated in west germany and changed planes at londons heathrow 
airport before setting out for new york 
two london newspapers the observer and the sunday telegraph 
reported sunday that the dec 19 warning carried several important 
details that would have helped security people spot a rigged 
radiocassette player

citing william lucas lack of experience civil 
rights groups are expressing concern that he might be the wrong 
choice to head the justice departments civil rights division 
civil rights leaders have not taken a formal position on william 
lucas who attorney general dick thornburgh has designated as his 
choice to head the departments civil rights division 
but these leaders say they are continuing to study lucas record 
to determine what position they will ultimately take if president 
bush nominates the black republican from michigan as assistant 
attorney general for civil rights 
so far we are still quite concerned about the nomination 
because the position is extremely important for the civil rights 
community said julius chambers director of the naacp legal 
defense and education fund inc 
lucas 61 is a person who hasnt really been involved in civil 
rights litigation for more than 20 years and a person who has taken 
some positions for whatever reason in civil rights that show no 
sensitivity for the problems said chambers 
chambers notes lucas opposition to affirmative action saying 
positions he has taken on school desegregation were quite 
bothersome 
besides lucas lack of experience washington attorney william 
taylor said he is concerned about lucas record as sheriff in the 
detroit area 
the record includes a court finding that he was legally 
responsible for injuries suffered by a prisoner who was beaten while 
in the custody of wayne county sheriffs deputies 
the 1976 beating of salvatore marchese by an unidentified person 
who was admitted to his locked holding cell at a suburban detroit 
station was the subject of a stronglyworded 1985 ruling by the 6th 
us circuit court of appeals 
the court cited lucas failure to provide a trained and 
disciplined county law enforcement agency or to investigate the 
beating incident 
lucas had testified that he did not know about the incident and 
therefore would not have been able to investigate it 
but the appellate court said he was still legally liable because 
in his official capacity he had a duty to both know and act 
the sheriffs subsequent failure to order and direct an 
investigation which disclosed exactly who were the perpetrators of 
these brutal violations of the us constitution and to administer 
censure and punishment served to confirm the existence of an 
unstated policy of toleration of illegal brutality toward any 
county prisoner who had threatened the life of a sheriffs deputy 
the court said 
i was sheriff an awful long time lucas said there were 
many cases that required investigation this is one case that is 
one too many of course but this was a very turbulent time 
lucas was sheriff from 1969 to 1982 when he was elected county 
executive after switching to the republican party lucas made an 
unsuccessful run for michigan governor in 1986 
he now wants to head a justice department division that both 
civil and criminal civil rights laws including statutes barring 
police from violating constitutional rights of criminal suspects 
the division has brought many prosecutions for systematic police 
brutality against blacks 
during his tenure as sheriff lucas said we had a reputation 
for taking strong actions against anyone who violated department 
rules and particularly civil rights 
asked if he had ever fired deputies for brutality lucas said 
i am certain that we did deputies were fired for all sorts of 
violations 
i have never been accused of being insensitive of the rights of 
anyone said lucas a former policeman and fbi agent who worked as 
justice department civil rights investigator in the 1960s 
deborah gordon the lawyer who represented marchese in the civil 
case said she never challenged lucas statements that he didnt 
know about the marchese beating 
although she doesnt personally hold lucas responsible for the 
beating she said could the department have been run better 
probably what it indicated to me was a complete lack of concern of 
any kind on the part of the department about this

moslem gunners volleyed rockets into 
lebanons christian heartland sunday and the christians reportedly 
built up forces facing syrian army positions threatening to 
escalate fighting 
police said at least 20 rockets fired from syrianpoliced moslem 
west beirut exploded on beaches north of the capital near lebanons 
main power plant and jounieh port the christians main sea outlet 
there were no reports of damage or casualties on the 12th day of 
the latest fighting between christians and moslems in lebanons 
14yearold civil war at least 49 people have been killed and 164 
wounded since clashes erupted march 8 
sniper fire crackled all day across the ruins of beiruts old 
commercial district straddling the governmentcontrolled port and 
around the hilltop garrison town of souk elgharb 15 miles 
southeast of the city police said 
christians marked palm sunday in church rituals bereft of 
traditional festivities most moslems stayed indoors 
both sides fear a repetition of tuesdays bloodbath in which 39 
people were killed and 96 wounded in a daylong shelling duel across 
beiruts dividing green line 
that was the peak of fighting between army commander gen michel 
aouns mainly christian units and syrianbacked militiamen of druse 
warlord walid jumblatt 
a shaky 48hour truce called midnight thursday to allow 
mediators to negotiate expired with no sign of a breakthrough 
aoun who heads the christian military cabinet of lebanons dual 
government reiterated that he will deal only with syria to 
negotiate a meaningful ceasefire his spokesmen said 
he doesnt want to waste time talking to surrogates 
jumblatt and his allies are merely doing syrias bidding the 
spokesman said on condition of anonymity 
syria which supports the rival moslem cabinet of acting prime 
minister salim hoss has rejected aouns overtures 
in an allout confrontation syria could call on about 53500 
troops more than twice the number at aouns command 
if aoun really believes the syrians might come around and 
recognize him he must be daydreaming a jumblatt aide said on 
condition of anonymity theres no room for peace 
he said aoun has been moving tanks and artillery to face syrian 
army positions on the eastern and northeastern flanks of the 
christian hinterland aouns spokesman refused to comment on that 
but he charged the syrians have set up 16 heavy artillery batteries 
in mountains overlooking the christian enclave 
reliable witnesses said the syrians also have set mortars and 
multibarrelled rocket launchers atop highrise apartment buildings 
in outlying districts of west beirut and its southern slums 
lebanons 800000strong christian minority appeared penned up 
with its back to the mediterranean ringed on three sides by 
prosyrian forces 
aoun on sunday called for the formation of a military committee 
of lebanese and syrian army officers to draw up a timetable for a 
syrian withdrawal 
syria the main power broker in lebanon has not responded to 
aouns demands damascus maintains its troops here under a 1976 arab 
league peacekeeping mandate

district of columbia officials say outsiders 
are to blame for much of the citys homeless problem but homeless 
rights advocates reject the notion that people move here from nearby 
suburbs to receive free shelter 
the debate has been raging since before voters passed initiative 
17 the right to overnight shelter act in november 1984 requiring 
the city to provide shelter to all persons in the district of 
columbia 
mayor marion s barry jr had lobbied against the referendum 
saying it would attract outsiders to the district to take advantage 
of free services more than four years later he says that has 
happened 
washington is 22 percent of the regions population barry 
said during a news conference late last year yet we have 78 
percent of the regions homeless in every area of dependency 
we have a disproportionate share not because people here are poor 
but because maryland and virginia are not carrying their fair 
share 
barry spokesman john white said there were no hard stats to 
back up the mayors assertion but that when the mayor toured a 
newly opened shelter in january half the people to whom he spoke 
said they were from out of town 
its a myth to think that homeless people are mobile and have 
the means to travel from around the country in order to get 
services said maria foscarinis an attorney with the national 
coalition for the homeless 
homeless people are generally destitute they lack 
transportation money its hard enough to get from one side of the 
town to another let alone from one part of the country to another 
dc officials estimate there are less than 10000 homeless in 
the nations capital but homeless advocates say the number is 
closer to 15000 
ray spicer homeless coordinator for neighboring arlington 
county va acknowledged that his county is short on shelter space 
arlington provided shelter for more than 1200 people during all of 
1988 turning away 2100 he said but those who couldnt find a 
place went elsewhere in northern virginia not into washington said 
spicer 
christine felker assistant director of the prince georges 
county md department of social services said i believe that 
people are crossing the lines both ways 
ms felker said the county which focuses on helping homeless 
people and families get back on their feet sheltered more than 
4500 people last year but turned away 5100 
homeless rights advocates said barrys assertion reflects the 
common practice of political leaders to blame the problem on 
outsiders 
every single mayor in the country is saying exactly the same 
thing said ms foscarinis its a typical response no longer 
novel by mayors who want to avoid their responsibility to aid the 
homeless 
initiative 17 isnt drawing homeless persons here homeless 
advocates insist 
people dont bounce around for a bed and shelter said mitch 
snyder whose community for creative nonviolence runs a 1400bed 
shelter near the us capitol people have as much a sense of 
place whether they have a roof over their head or not as people 
who live indoors people only move for jobs 
other shelter operators reported similar experiences 
the vast majority of our women are dc residents said ellen 
rocks director of the house of ruth which shelters homeless and 
battered women and children the sense of people transitioning 
into dc because the services are so good strikes me as absurd 
pam hollar who directs the luther place emergency shelter for 
women said from being on the inside im not sure that dcs 
such an attractive place 
information about those who stay in cityrun shelters is not 
available although a computer system is being implemented to better 
track shelter residents said dc homeless coordinator sue marshall 
council member nadine winter proposed a bill in february designed 
to ensure that residents get priority for longterm homeless 
services such as job training and drug counseling she did not 
specify how homeless people could prove residency

israeli soldiers killed four palestinians and 
wounded at least 18 in the most intense clashes in months in the 
occupied territories arab reports said the army confirmed two dead 
and nine wounded in the clashes 
the renewed violence took the palestinian death toll to at least 
403 since the arab uprising against israels occupation of the west 
bank and gaza strip began in december 1987 
protests erupted in the occupied gaza strip after three arabs 
were killed by israeli gunfire and at least 20 others were wounded 
on saturday 
early sunday a 26yearold palestinian was shot to death after 
stabbing three israeli border police in gaza city the army said 
israel radio said the border guards were wounded as they broke 
into a house in pursuit of the masked palestinian who fled after 
hurling rocks at troops two of the soldiers were reported in 
moderate condition and the third was lightly wounded 
the dead man was identified by hospital officials as talal selim 
alaraj from the citys daraj neighborhood the officials said he 
was shot in the head and chest 
in the afternoon a 15yearold arab boy was fatally shot in the 
city after hurling a bottle at soldiers the army said the soldier 
who opened fire thought the bottle was a firebomb soldiers have 
orders allowing them to shoot if attacked with firebombs 
the name of the boy was not released 
israel radio and arab reports said two other palestinians 
including a 12yearold were shot to death as troops opened fire on 
stonethrowing youths in silet harthieh a village near the west 
bank town of jenin 
an army spokesman said soldiers opened fire in the jenin but 
added military investigators were still trying to confirm the deaths 
and checking reports of other casualties throughout the occupied 
territories 
the victims in jenin were identified by arab reporters as samer 
mohammed arouri 12 and neman jaradat 18 who both were reported 
shot in the head 
most of the injuries were reported in the gaza strip where 
palestinians staged a general strike to protest three shooting 
deaths the day before 
palestinian teenagers blocked entrances to gaza city with 
trucks rocks and burning tires 
in an effort to quell the violence the army confined more than 
165000 people to their homes in five refugee camps and several 
neighborhoods of gaza city an arab reporter said 
bursts of automatic weapons fire could be heard throughout gaza 
city as soldiers tried to put down rioting he said 
in one neighborhood of the city about 100 youths marched through 
the streets waving the koran islams holy book and shouting god 
is great down with the occupiers 
arab journalists compared the intensity of rioting in gaza to the 
early days of the uprising and an army official said uprising 
leaders were testing border police newly assigned to the occupied 
territories 
its primarily a test of the border police who have a 
reputation for keeping order deputy army spokesman col raanan 
gissin said they are trying to keep the border police from 
getting more control of the streets than the army reserve units 
had 
the army has tried to reduce bloodshed in the occupied 
territories by replacing untrained reserve troops with border police 
units who are experienced in riot control and are permanently 
assigned to the disputed areas 
among those wounded in sundays clashes were 12 palestinians shot 
in the gaza strip including a 13yearold boy in serious condition 
with a head wound arab reports said in the west bank six 
palestinians were reportedly wounded when soldiers opened fire on 
stonethrowing protesters

the discovery space shuttle 
astronauts back from a fiveday mission in which they deployed a 
vital communications satellite spent sunday with their families but 
were to return to work the next day to discuss their nearly flawless 
flight 
the crews 19 millionmile journey ended saturday morning with a 
picture perfect landing at edwards air force base calif that was 
watched by a nearrecord 460000 spectators 
discoverys flight lasted 4 days 23 hours and 39 minutes it was 
the 28th shuttle mission overall and the third since challenger 
exploded claiming the lives of seven astronauts and halting manned 
spaceflights for nearly three years 
the next flight is the planned april 28 launch of atlantis which 
will deploy a planetary probe that will map the surface of venus 
nasa hopes to complete seven flights this year and 12 a year by 1992 
space agency officials saturday praised the five discovery 
astronauts and the orbiter as well as the efforts of employees who 
have worked to get the shuttle program back on track 
i think the country realizes were back rear adm richard h 
truly nasas associate administrator for space flight said at a 
postflight news conference saturday at edwards 
truly also said the shuttle is just as clean as it can be 
although nasa television closeups showed numerous white marks on 
the black thermal tiles that protect the shuttles underside during 
the fiery reentry through the atmosphere truly described them as 
a few minor chips 
a little more than seven hours after touchdown the astronauts 
and their wives arrived home in houston where they were greeted by 
their children and about 500 friends fellow workers and space fans 
discovery commander michael l coats who guided the 97ton

a case echoing themes from last years 
presidential campaign and the political turmoil engendered by the 
vietnam war will be argued tuesday before the supreme court when it 
studies a texas law barring desecration of the flag 
the justices are being urged by prosecutors to reinstate a 
oneyear jail sentence and 2000 fine against a man accused of 
burning an american flag at a demonstration in dallas during the 
1984 republican national convention 
the high court is being asked to limit what forms of political 
protest are protected by the constitutions guarantee of free 
expression a decision is expected by july 
civil libertarians and artists say laws like the one in texas 
would permit police and prosecutors to suppress a broad range of 
dissent 
law enforcement officials with support from conservative groups 
say their target is flagrant offensive conduct that may threaten 
national unity 
at the center of the controversy is gregory joey johnson 32 
of new york city a member of the revolutionary communist youth 
brigade 
i believe we live in a sick and dying empire that is 
desperately clutching at its symbols and attempting to enforce 
patriotic allegiance and obedience from the people and suppress 
antipatriotic opposition he said recently 
johnson was arrested in dallas in 1984 following a protest that 
ended in front of city hall with demonstrators pouring lighter fluid 
on and igniting an american flag authorities said was taken from a 
pole outside a bank building there was trial testimony that the 
protesters chanted america the red white and blue we spit on 
you 
police said the demonstrators also overturned potted plants and 
spraypainted buildings during a destructive march through the city 
but the only criminal charge was against johnson for violating a 
state law that forbids the desecration of a venerated object if 
that is likely to cause serious offense 
police officers who arrested johnson said they were seriously 
offended by the flag burning 
johnson said he did not actually douse or ignite the flag 
although he approved the action and gave speeches during the rally 
he said he was singled out for prosecution because the dallas 
police knew he was a member of the revolutionary communist youth 
brigade 
johnsons jury conviction was overturned by the texas court of 
criminal appeals which said the act for which he was convicted 
was clearly speech contemplated by the first amendment 
the appeals court did not overturn the law itself leaving open 
the possibility that flag burning in some situations would not 
represent symbolic speech and could be prosecuted 
the supreme courts announcement last fall that it would hear an 
appeal by the dallas county district attorney to reinstate johnsons 
conviction seemed particularly timely 
george bush campaigning for the presidency then was stressing 
patriotic values and attacking democratic opponent gov michael 
dukakis of massachusetts for vetoing legislation to require that 
public school teachers lead their classes in the pledge of 
allegiance 
the johnson case also calls to mind the days of draft card 
burning and intense opposition to the war in vietnam led in part by 
radical leftwing groups 
but the argument over patriotism and dissent has a longer 
history and laws against flag burning predate this century 
the supreme court in 1943 ruled that the government may not 
compel citizens to salute the flag the justices in 1974 threw out 
the conviction of a college student who taped a peace symbol onto a 
flag but they never have decided whether laws against destruction 
of the flag are constitutional 
while many states and the federal government have such statutes 
their enforcement apparently is spotty 
rallying to johnsons support while not necessarily agreeing 
with his political views have been numerous famous artists 
they have submitted a friendofthecourt legal brief in the 
case that said laws like the one in texas permit prosecutors at 
their own whim to decide what is permissible dissent 
the texas statute could even be applied to the work of a movie 
actor burning a flag in a movie about the student antiwar protests 
of the 1960s they said 
the brief includes 22 examples some famous of depictions of the 
flag that may offend some people 
groups that support the texas law say their goal is to prohibit 
destructive conduct that threatens the flag as a symbol of national 
unity 
it cannot be disputed that the flag is a symbol of national 
unity whose physical integrity can be protected by the state said 
a coalition headed by the conservative washington legal foundation 
here and including veterans of foreign wars to most people an 
assault on the flag constitutes an assault on them as well 
but the texas civil liberties union noted that an inscription 
outside the texas state capitol in austin refers to the civil war as 
an attempt by the south animated by the spirit of 1776 to 
preserve its rights 
not everyone in texas or in the united states takes quite that 
romantic a view of the civil war the civil liberties union said 
but the first amendment protects the rights of texas to express 
this idea of national disunity

the assassination of a congressman 
shows the cult of political violence still haunts the philippines 
despite president corazon aquinos vow to end rule by the bullet 
rep moises espinosa 55 a member of a proaquino party was 
shot to death friday with two other people after arriving in the 
airport in his home province masbate after a flight from manila 
240 miles away 
no arrests have been reported but manila newspapers quoted 
relatives as speculating that espinosa from an influential 
political family was slain by business or political rivals 
he was the first congressman slain since mrs aquino came to 
power in 1986 after a civilianmilitary uprising toppled president 
ferdinand marcos he was vice chairman of the public order and 
security committee in the house of representatives 
this is something we in public life have to expect in our job 
especially in the kind of politics we still have said house 
speaker ramon mitra after the espinosa killing 
mitra was critically injured 16 years ago during a bombing at a 
political rally in manila 
during a speech in japan in november 1986 mrs aquino boasted 
that her people power administration had replaced rule by the 
bullet with rule by the ballot 
however espinosa is the latest in a lengthening list of 
politicians journalists human rights lawyers municipal officials 
and labor leaders slain in unsolved political killings during the 
aquino administration 
the victims include local governments secretary jaime ferrer who 
was gunned down near his home in august 1987 ferrer became the 
first philippine cabinet member slain while in office 
others are labor leader rolando olalia kidnapped and murdered in 
november 1986 leftist leader lean alejandro slain in september 
1987 and vicente gerochi a senior official of the commission on 
elections who was ambushed near his home last month 
more than 90 people including about 40 candidates were killed 
in political violence during the campaign for january 1988 regional 
elections 
about 50 people died in campaign violence before may 1987 
congressional balloting 
the military says such violence was worse during the marcos 
years and it often blames killings on communist rebels indeed the 
rebels have claimed responsibility for killing hundreds of police 
soldiers and lowlevel officials in the last three years 
but many filipinos believe most killings of politicians have been 
the work of political rivals 
if there is an outstanding truism about filipino political 
life it is this politically motivated murder is not meant to be 
punished said the independent philippine daily globe in fact 
what exists are the trappings of government without its essence we 
have laws that are all too frequently and with total impunity 
violated 
killings of political figures which grab headlines also seem to 
go handinhand with a general lawlessness that the government has 
been unable to contain last year about 3700 killings were 
reported in greater manila which has a population of about 8 
million 
the committee to protect journalists reported in washington last 
week that of 26 journalists killed last year in the line of duty 
five were in the philippines 
most of the filipino journalists slain last year had reported on 
illegal gambling and other corruption in the provinces 
by comparison warravaged afghanistan registered four killings 
of journalists in 1988

lawrence duet is one of a dying breed 
the spanish moss entrepreneur he makes a living by cleaning and 
baling the archetypal southern moss for sale but there just isnt 
as much call for it as there once was 
this used to be a big business duet said but there are so 
many substitutes for moss today that the demand is no longer as 
great as it once was 
spanish moss the long stringy stuff that hangs from trees in 
the south used to be a common stuffing for mattresses sofas and 
other furniture now its used mainly in flower beds fish 
hatcheries for making floor mats and in some kinds of furniture 
duet said 
i do not believe there will ever be a shortage of moss but i 
am not so sure about buyers duet said its hard to say what 
substitute will come out next 
its a lowtech business in an increasingly hightech world 
the harvesters he buys from use almost as little fancy gadgetry 
as they used during the great depression when their survival often 
hinged on their ability to gather and market moss 
raymond hebert who began gathering it half a century ago with 
his father remembers that the moss used to hang so low in the trees 
that a man could stand up in a skiff and pluck it from the branches 
today you have to reach for it hebert said

terrorism warnings issued by the federal 
aviation administration before the bombing of pan american flight 
103 over scotland were largely ineffective and sometimes 
dangerously inaccurate the head of a house subcommittee said 
sunday 
rep cardiss collins dill chairwoman of the house government 
operations subcommittee on government activities and transportation 
voiced the criticism in releasing an analysis of 33 faa security 
bulletins issued between jan 1 1988 and feb 16 of this year 
the panel found that at least six of the security bulletins 
contained information that may be linked to the dec 21 1988 
bombing of the pan am plane which killed 270 people investigators 
have concluded that the jet was blown up by plastic explosive hidden 
inside a radiocasette player 
regrettably these and other faa bulletins were sometimes 
untimely sometimes dangerously inaccurate and almost completely 
devoid of effective and specific instructions for countering 
possible threats rep collins said some bulletins recommended 
actions that were pointless or even absurd 
she added taken as a group the faa bulletins failed to 
provide meaningful guidance to airlines faced with the risk of 
terrorist attack 
the subcommittee focused particular attention on a warning 
written on nov 17 following the arrest in west germany three weeks 
earlier of members of the popular front for the liberation of 
palestinegeneral command 
the bulletin described a bomb found in the raids plastic 
explosive secreted inside a radiocassette player with a 
barometricpressure detonator designed to explode the device at a 
preset altitude 
according to the subcommittee that bulletin mistakenly advised 
that the pflpgc has not been known to undertake terrorist attacks 
in europe 
a recent defense department study said the palestinian group had 
machinegunned an airliner in zurich hijacked two other airliners 
bound for european cities and warned in 1986 that there will be no 
safety for any traveler on a us airliner 
the faa bulletin said its information about the bomb was based on 
preliminary analyses by west german authorities 
it is difficult to understand why explosive experts needed more 
than three weeks to complete an urgently needed analysis of this 
device the subcommittee said either the west germans lacked 
the required technical skills which is unlikely or west germanfaa 
communications had serious flaws 
pan ams response to this and two other security bulletins 
prompted by the west german arrests was limited to examining and 
xraying selected passengers carryon baggage containing electronic 
devices 
but the subcommittee noted that the bomb that destroyed flight 
103 reportedly was carried as checked baggage and if it resembled 
the pflpgc version was specifically designed to thwart normal 
xray inspection 
another faa security bulletin dated dec 7 reported that an 
unidentified caller phoning the us embassy in helsinki finland 
had said there would be a bombing attempt against a pan am airliner 
flying from frankfurt west germany to the united states 
flight 103 had originated in frankfurt going from there to 
london where it changed planes before heading to the united states 
the subcommittee report noted that at least three faa security 
bulletins contained disquieting information involving west 
germany 
yet despite the helsinki warning of a frankfurt bombing the 
discovery of a radiocasette player bomb and two attempts to test 
frankfurt airport security the faa failed to order us airlines to 
take any security measures beyond those already in place it said

of the nations sixthlargest city as officials try to find them 
shelter their challenge providing it without jeopardizing 
detroits economic rebirth 
the relationship between advocates for the homeless and mayor 
coleman a young frequently has been stormy both sides disagree on 
the numbers of the citys shelterless 
advocates insist there are 10000 to 60000 others like white a 
statistic disputed by robert berg youngs press secretary 
thats absurd he said if you go out and check the 
shelters youll see that most of them are half empty theres not a 
single case this winter of somebody not having a place to spend the 
night 
the ordinance that went into effect march 10 requiring young to 
designate a vacant public building or rent a private one as a 
warming center is a scaleddown version of a measure that would 
have opened 39 downtown buildings to the homeless 
young vetoed the more expansive plan saying it would cost 2 
million and threaten detroits convention business the city 
council which proposed the ordinance fell short in an attempt to 
override the veto 
the warming center opened last week in a recreation building on 
the citys east side no homeless showed up because word hadnt yet 
spread on the streets the shelters operators said 
meanwhile community leaders speculated about the impact of 
youngs veto on his widely expected run this fall for a fifth 
fouryear term 
theresa smith spokeswoman for the detroitwayne county union of 
the homeless said her group is urging the homeless it aids to 
register to vote 
smith knows the anguish of homelessness a year ago her landlord 
evicted her and her five children after the family couldnt afford 
to pay its gas bill 
i went from shelter to shelter she said my family called 
me the shelter queen when the mayor says the original ordinance 
would have cost 2 million hes admitting theres a terrible 
desperate need 
last week while the city council debated the merits of its 
housing plan c patrick babcock who heads the states welfare 
agency urged officials to set aside part of the 500 million spent 
annually on temporary housing in michigan and invest it in a more 
permanent solution 
paul hubbard director of new detroit a coalition aimed at 
improving the quality of life in the city agrees 
putting the homeless in public buildings doesnt solve the 
problem he said ten years ago homeless were derelicts with 
army jackets and wine bottles hanging out of their pockets now 
theyre women and children 
you need permanent public housing otherwise as soon as its 
warm theyre back on the streets again 
youngs veto of the original homeless plan probably wont 
backfire on him politically because it was replaced by the modified 
measure hubbard said the mayor sees the need and hes done 
something about it he said

when jonathan blasczak was 12 years old he read 
about an 18thcentury french ship that sank in boston harbor twenty 
years later he has received permission to search for the wreck and 
its reputed riches 
after researching the journals of french soldiers and other 
documents blasczak 32 a construction worker from hopkinton 
believes the ship contains between 50 million and 500 million in 
gold coins and other cargo 
its like reliving a childhood dream said blasczak who read 
about the magnifique in an edward rowe snow book shipwrecks around 
new england back then it might not have been that easy to do 
but with the technology we have now its possible 
last fall the state board of underwater archaelogical resources 
approved blasczaks request to search for the magnifique a french 
vessel that ran aground near the end of the revolutionary war 
blasczak plans to begin initial work on the site within a few 
days 
the 218foot ship may have been carrying up to 500 soldiers when 
it sank in august 1782 said blasczak the wooden vessel was 
weakened by a tour of the caribbean where a parasite called the 
teredo had eaten away at its hull 
blasczak said his research could not uncover whether men died 
when the ship sank in less than an hour or if they were ferried to 
safety 
the french were very secretive about their navy back then he 
said 
blasczak said records culled form the marine museum in paris and 
the journals of french soldiers allude to a cargo that may have 
included 300000 pistoles french gold coins that were also called 
louis dors 
last year blasczak and his team dove with a magnetometer which 
detects magnetic metals and a sonar system which uses sound waves 
to detect objects and found a large mass they believe to be the 
wreck 
they believe the ship is under 20 feet of water and buried under 
5 feet of sand and mud blasczak said the currents have changed over 
the years and the mud is now washing off the magnifique exposing it 
victor mastone associate director of the state board of 
underwater archaelogical resources said blasczaks plan is the 
second one involving a search in boston harbor the nations 
filthiest harbor 
barry clifford who found the wreck of the whydah off the 
massachusetts coast several years ago with artifacts estimated at 
40 million has received initial permission to search for the 
crates of tea thrown into the harbor during the boston tea party 
before the revolutionary war 
its like people are just finding out theres a lot out 
there said mastone 
blasczak is working with a crew of seven including three divers 
robert cembrola executive director of the marine museum of fall 
river is in charge of cataloging any items retrieved from the wreck 
i called my best friend from 20 years ago and told him about 
it said blasczak he couldnt believe i was actually doing what 
we talked about so long ago

a family has sued a cemetery for 1 
million claiming that a damaged casket allowed mourners to see the 
deceaseds foot and a cemetery employee interrupted the funeral to 
demand that the rabbi move his car 
all of this happened at the funeral of pauline rosenthal last 
year family members said in a lawsuit filed in broward county 
circuit court last week 
her husband arthur rosenthal and her two daughters and their 
families are seeking the damages from menorah gardens and funeral 
chapels for putting them through an emotional wringer at the funeral 
in january 1988 
menorah gardens funeral director mark weissman said through a 
spokesperson that he knew nothing about the lawsuit 
it was a terible terrible thing said mrs rosenthals 
daughter linda zimmerman of northbrook ill we are looking 
forward to our day in court 
mrs zimmerman and other relatives declined to discuss details of 
the case on the advice of their attorney 
the lawsuit said the grave site was prepared in a sloppy and 
unkempt manner and chairs were filthy and rusty and the 
scaffolding was uneven and covered with artificial carpet 
this caused mourners to trip and stumble the lawsuit said 
pallbearers were supposed to carry the casket from a hearse to 
the grave site instead slovenly attired and unclean cemetery 
workers did so until family members insisted on completing the task 
themselves 
during the service a cemetery worker demanded that the rabbi 
move his car from a designated parking area the lawsuit said 
when the rabbi continued with the service the employee wrapped a 
chain around the bumper of the rabbis car and a backhoe or other 
piece of heavy equipment backed within close range of the 
automobile 
as the casket was being lowered it slipped as it was being 
placed in a vault two lids popped open exposing the deceased 
womans foot with a white tag attached to it the lawsuit said 
the casket would not fit in the vault and the straps supporting 
the casket could not be removed without more jarring of the casket 
and prying it with iron bars it said 
in june arthur rosenthal ordered a tombstone and specified that 
for religious reasons it should not be placed atop his wifes grave 
until nov 18 he and one of his daughters asked to see mrs 
rosenthals grave but were told that the original marker had been 
chewed up by a lawn mower according to the lawsuit 
in september rosenthal visited his wifes grave and found that 
her headstone was on it contrary to his wishes

president francois mitterands governing socialists 
emerged the big winners sunday in the second round of municipal 
elections winning control of several large cities from the 
conservative and centerright parties 
early results showed such conservative bastions as strasbourg 
mulhouse brest dunkirk orleans blois avignon and quimper 
falling into socialist hands 
frequently city elections have been used to criticize the 
national government but this year results seemed to confirm the 
leftist trend that reelected mitterrand last spring and gave him a 
leftist majority in the national assembly 
it is the first time that we have seen a government receive a 
powerful popular encouragement during the municipal elections 
said interior minister pierre joxe a socialist 
the second round was required in 832 towns and cities larger than 
3500 where no candidates won more than 50 percent of the vote in 
last sundays first round 
turnout in the ninth election in less than a year was estimated 
at between 72 and 735 percent 
a national projection by the tf1 television network showed the 
socialist party and its allies winning 78 cities with populations 
above 30000 compared to 66 in 1983 municipal elections 
the communist party won mayoral seats in 48 cities compared to 
53 six years ago the conservative rally for the republic won 45 big 
cities compared to 47 in 1983 and the centerright union for french 
democracy won 39 cities as opposed to 41 six years ago 
the right was losing few municipalities of more than 30000 but 
they were behind in important cities and taking only smaller less 
important ones from the left 
there was some good news on the right however michel noir a 
conservative deputy in the national assembly defeated a 
centerright incumbent in lyon frances thirdlargest city 
former president valery giscard destaing now head of the 
centerright union for french democracy said the municipal 
elections were less ideological than in the past 
the socialists registered a certain progress he said in 
all france is still divided in two between right and left

president mikhail s gorbachev and other members of 
the ruling politburo failed to win unanimous support as communist 
party deputies in a new soviet legislature pravda reported sunday 
providing unusual insight into divisions in the policymaking 
central committee the communist party newspaper said of 641 central 
committee members and alternates who voted thursday 12 were opposed 
to gorbachev 
yegor k ligachev reputedly a conservative force on the 
politburo got the most no votes of any politburo member 78 
according to pravda 
the communist party and some other public organizations are 
entitled to directly choose 750 of the 2250 members of the new 
congress of peoples deputies the other 1500 representing 
territorial districts will be chosen march 26 in nationwide 
elections 
some soviets have objected to the provision of the reforms 
championed by gorbachev they give the party direct representation 
in the new assembly which will chose legislators and elect the 
soviet president 
the vote by central committee members and alternates showed there 
is considerable opposition not only to ligachev but also to 
politburo members closely linked to gorbachev customarily such 
votes are unanimous but the secret balloting used to chose deputies 
may have encouraged some to frankly express opposition to senior 
kremlin figures 
alexander n yakovlev said to be gorbachevs closest adviser 
got 59 no votes while the candidacy of moscow party boss lev n 
zaikov was rejected by 25 of those voting gorbachev installed 
zaikov as party boss following the november 1987 sacking of boris n 
yeltsin 
twentytwo people also voted against vadim a medvedev a 
gorbachev ally named to the politburo in september 1988 to assume 
the ideology portfolio stripped from ligachev 
politburo member viktor p nikonov who serves as deputy to 
ligachev in the latters role as chief of the partys commission on 
agriculture received 26 no votes 
along with gorbachev the politburo members who received the 
widest support were nikolai n slyunkov chief of the partys 
commission on social and economic policy with 19 votes opposed and 
former kgb chief viktor m chebrikov with 13 opposed 
prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov whose popularity soared among 
soviets when he was named to head a special politburo commission 
directing relief efforts for armenias earthquake received a 
broader mandate than gorbachev with only 10 votes opposed to his 
candidacy 
of the remaining members of the 12man politburo ukrainian party 
boss vladimir v shcherbitsky and russian federation president 
vitaly i vorotnikov are running unopposed in electoral districts 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadzes ministerial post bars him 
from being a candidate 
although communist party members proposed 31000 candidates to 
represent the party in the new legislature the central committee 
chose to nominate all 100 people suggested by the politburo for the 
100 seats and then elected all those they had nominated

brighteyed innocentlooking babies peer out of 
nearly 5500 photos seized in a fraud investigation but these kids 
are no criminals their mugs come from two bankrupt photo companies 
that collected money for the pictures and didnt deliver 
staff members of the cook county states attorneys office are 
trying to track down parents to deliver the goods the photos come 
from the sheridanpeter pan studios and american color portraits 
both of chicago and the companies photo subcontractors 
three years ago the photo companies declared bankruptcy after 
collecting money for the photographs but before delivering them to 
waiting parents 
most customers were from the chicago area but some came from 
indiana michigan and wisconsin officials said 
it was more than a normal business failure said allen 
reiffman supervisor of the prosecutors consumer fraud unit they 
knew they were going out of business they still signed people and 
took their money and their memories 
the consumer fraud unit took possession of the photographs last 
year after suing the companies accusing them of fraud 
now the only problem is that many parents have moved said 
neomi hernandez a states attorney paralegal we have no way of 
tracking them 
it took ms hernandez 100 telephone calls to locate three parents 
who were still at their present addresses 
one successful call linked adam manring 4 of elgin with his 
photo when he was 2 
i knew something was wrong when six months passed without our 
getting the photos said his mother vicki manring then the 
studios phone was disconnected 
gloria saffold mccall had another story she had planned as a 
gift for her aging mother a family portrait of ms mccalls 12 
brothers and sisters and her mothers 50 grandchildren and 
greatgrandchildren 
it took months to get everyone together 
peter pan shot the picture in my house said ms mccall we 
had to reshoot it again it was still all wrong 
finally she said she had 13 separate family portraits taken for 
1500 but she never got the pictures 
last thursday she received one sisters portrait the rest are

a new hightech army attack helicopter has 
broken down so many times that one commander complained the craft is 
less fit for battle than a 1960s vintage chopper according to a 
report published sunday 
in a recent exercise all 12 of the ah64 apache helicopters 
involved were incapacitated at least once within five days 
according to internal army memos obtained by the los angeles times 
the problems have prompted rep john d dingell whose staff 
obtained the memo to call for an investigation by the general 
accounting office the investigative arm of congress 
it is unbelievable that we are fielding overly sophisticated 
and outrageously expensive weapons systems for our fighting men 
which simply dont work dingell said in a letter demanding the 
probe 
the army has received 450 of the ah64s manufactured by 
mcdonnell douglas helicopter co in mesa ariz for 134 million 
each and plans to buy total of 975 spending 136 billion for the 
deal 
army and mcdonnell douglas officials dispute allegations the 
helicopter is a hopeless case and defend its reliability 
but in the army memo col r dennis kerr commander of the 82nd 
aviation brigade at ft bragg nc was highly critical of the 
ah64 saying that for now at least hed prefer to fly the ah1 an 
updated version of bell helicopters 1960svintage cobra which flew 
in vietnam 
i have been a fan of the ah64 for over a year but the 
aircraft has let me down kerr wrote to maj gen richard 
stephenson commander of the army aviation systems command in st 
louis whose office was responsible for buying the ah64 
if we went to war tomorrow id have to recommend taking all of 
our ah1s before we outload one ah64 kerr wrote we need 
helicopters to work for at least the first 72 hours the apache has 
long way to go to make it to the battlefield please help 
the ah64 designed to attack soviet tanks and other armored 
vehicles experienced dozens of problems in an exercise including 
numerous instances of jamming on its 30millimeter machine guns 
according to the memo 
army records show that the entire fleet of ah64s has been 
grounded at least three times since the craft entered service in 
early 1984 five apaches have been lost and flight and two more have 
burned on the ground 
but army officials said that the observations in kerrs memo are 
not representative of other army units 
the apache is a fine airplane said col curtis herrick the 
ah64 program manager in st louis we are finding that it has 
more capability than the designers foresaw 
herrick acknowledged that the craft has experienced problems with 
its rotor blades bearings and compressors but said solutions have 
been found to all the problems 
mcdonnell douglas officials also played down the problems 
there are problems with any new weapon and you dont find out 
about some of the problems until you field the system said 
company spokesman rob mack we have heard both good and bad but 
we have hear a lot of good

high winds and heavy seas forced workers 
to suspend their search sunday for containers of insecticide and 
other chemicals lost in the english channel from an indonesian ship 
authorities said 
officials at the marine prefecture in this port city said winds 
of up to 30 knots made the search impossible 
in london scientist paul johnston said a huge area of the 
channel would be polluted and fish wiped out if one of the 
containers holding six tons of lindane insecticide leaked into the 
water it would be an environmental disaster said johnston a 
research fellow of the greenpeace environmental organization at 
london universitys queen mary college 
police at st peter port chief town of guernsey in the channel 
islands said the british ministry of agriculture alerted police in 
the region to watch out for the containers

the national park service should look 
beyond park borders and adopt a regional approach to maintaining the 
nations environmental legacy according to a study commissioned by 
a nonprofit conservation group 
the study done for the national parks and conservation 
association also urged that funds for the park service be increased 
as much as 10 percent and that park managers cooperate with state 
and local groups to preserve the 80 million acres in national parks 
we have to give up the notion that park management stops at 
park boundaries said john c gordon dean of yale university 
school of forestry and environmental studies who headed the panel 
of experts who made the recommendations 
if you have a grizzly bear range that stretches across two 
national parks six national forests a state forest and 43 ranches 
you must coordinate your efforts he said we cant solve all 
problems simply by buying land the group presented the study 
sunday to interior secretary manuel lujan jr and national park 
service director william p mott jr park service spokesman george 
berklacy said it will be given close scrutiny 
we generally agree with the commissions conclusions but it is 
a time of very tight budgets thus the commissions recommendations 
will be weighed against those realities he said 
berklacy emphasized that the report was prepared by an 
independent panel of experts we are not bound by their findings 
but we certainly will be guided by them he said 
the 17member panel examined policies at 49 national parks in 
addition to national monuments historic sites battlefields 
seashores recreation areas the statue of liberty and the alaska 
wilderness area 
the national parks are a uniquely american gift to the nation 
and the world said gordon an authority on forest biology and 
forest management 
we now need a renewed commitment to the parks and a quantum 
leap forward in the level of research and management to safeguard 
this irreplaceable heritage he said 
gordon said it is essential for the park service to educate the 
public about conservation in addition he said the parks should be 
used to educate the public about toxic waste deforestation the 
greenhouse effect and the extinction of plant and animal species 
he cited the national park services handling of last years 
fires at yellowstone national park as an example of mismanagement 
within the agency the fires affected nearly half of yellowstones 
22 million acres 
the park service has had a policy of allowing fires to burn 
naturally so long as they dont threaten areas of human habitation 
but gordon said the agency should adopt ecosystem management in 
which each area is considered individually 
for instance he said some park ecosystems should be allowed to 
burn naturally but others should not natural predators should be 
permitted to control animal populations in some places but not in 
others 
but what this nation should avoid is having all its eggs in one 
basket by treating all ecosystems inside and outside the parks 
alike he said 
gordons panel pointed to the 1988 agreement involving the great 
smoky mountains national park as a model for others to follow the 
great smoky agreement calls for national state and local agencies 
to share data and cooperate in the management of natural and 
cultural resources throughout the southern appalachian region 
gordons group also examined the socalled leopold report named 
after a 1963 committee chaired by a starker leopold that report 
put forth the idea of letting nature take its own course unimpeded 
by humans 
but gordon said that as national parks face increasing pressures 
it is important for the experts to intervene sometimes 
one of the big problems that still exists in the park service 
is that there is a desire to believe that by letting things alone 
you keep them from changing why people think that happens with 
natural systems when they know it doesnt happen with thir own home 
i dont know he said

president chaim herzog on sunday told hundreds 
of jewish leaders from 30 countries that he prayed their conference 
of solidarity with israel would help advance peace in the middle 
east 
you have answered the call to show solidarity with israel at a 
time of stress and hope in which people of israel face many fateful 
decisions herzog told participants in a forum organized by prime 
minister yitzhak shamir 
lets pray that this conference will represent a genuine 
advance towards peace and political adjustment in this area 
herzog said in a speech at the presidents residence in jerusalem 
some people in the united states and israel have criticized the 
conference as a gimmick to boost shamirs hardline policies before 
he makes a crucial trip to washington next month 
but some of the 1100 people who arrived for the threeday forum 
said they came to strenghten israel as it faces the palestinian 
uprising in the occupied lands and international pressure to devise 
a middle east peace initiative 
the prime ministers conference of jewish solidarity begins 
monday 
i dont think its our responsibility or our business to tell 
the israeli government and people how and what to do we have been 
asked to come here not to give direction to policy but to put a 
line to all those out there who say we no longer support israel 
said abraham h foxman national director of the new yorkbased 
antidefamation league of bnai brith 
to show that we do stand behind the people and the state and 
the government but not specific policies i think today is more 
important than ever before foxman said in an interview 
when shamir the 73yearold leader of the rightwing likud bloc 
visits washington in april his hardline views are expected to come 
under increasing pressure from us officials shamir has repeatedly 
criticized washingtons dialogue with the palestine liberation 
organization insisting it is a terrorist organization 
he also opposes the american land for peace formula 
shamir on friday said peace plans he would take to the united 
states do not include a territorial compromise on the west bank and 
gaza strip territories occupied by israel since 1967 
three leftwing opposition parties which support talks with the 
plo and giving away at least some occupied land were quick to

of israeli opinion 
the real multifaceted piercing dramatic dialogue taking place

legitimate that the government seeks support but then you

a lawyer in the upcoming trial of 
members of the ecclesia athletic association charged in the death of 
the group leaders daughter says he will attempt to prove that 
beating did not cause the childs death 
a pathologist will testify that in his opinion some other 
things happened that night that may have caused the death of dayna 
broussard defense attorney ron thom said sunday it was not a 
result of any violent act 
after five weeks of grilling potential jurors attorneys are 
close to raising the curtain on the trial of four group members 
charged with manslaughter in the death of the 8yearold the 
groups stated aim was to rescue ghetto youngsters through 
discipline but critics say the children were often mistreated 
sometimes even beaten hundreds of times 
meanwhile 51 children taken from the group after the girl died 
five months ago remain in foster homes two others are living with 
relatives the children were taken from a farmhouse the group was 
renting near sandy in the foothills of mount hood east of portland 
there has been no public word from eldridge broussard jr the 
groups founder and selfproclaimed savior of ghetto youth from los 
angeles since he ended a 40day personal retreat march 12 
since feb 13 four courtappointed lawyers have been questioning 
potential jurors four days a week in a mostly deserted courtroom at 
the clackamas county courthouse 
the defendants willie k chambers brian j brinson frederick 
p doolittle and constance z jackson sit quietly in the second 
row of the gallery occasionally passing notes to their lawyers 
thom said the lawyers were likely to settle on 12 jurors and two 
to four alternates in the coming week and opening arguments could 
begin march 27 
more than 80 jurors have been examined over the last five weeks 
with nearly three of four excused because they had read about the 
case or seen television reports on it 
in the weeks after dayna lorea broussards death local airwaves 
were flooded with state allegations that ecclesia children were 
routinely beaten up to 800 times with a paddle or electric cord 
the 36yearold broussard made emotional appearances on local 
radio and television talk shows he wept before a national audience 
on the oprah winfrey show and pleaded with winfrey to help him 
broussard first accused the media of murder in the first 
degree in his daughters death later broussard simply denied 
that his daughter was beaten to death 
he dropped out of sight as jury selection began and said he 
planned to reflect on the groups problems and sort out his own 
feelings 
broussard formed ecclesia at the watts christian center in los 
angeles in 1975 saying he wanted to steer children away from drugs 
and crime and to motivate them through tough discipline and athletic 
training 
at one time he said he wanted to prepare the children to compete 
in the olympics 
thom said the defense team had not seen broussard since he 
returned from his retreat however broussard will be called to 
testify and is expected to appear thom said 
although he denied exercising undue influence over members of the 
group broussard led parents in confrontations with state officials 
after their children were placed in protective custody 
the courtappointed defense attorneys threatened to step aside 
when their clients became uncooperative in the weeks after the 
killing but agreed to stay on after broussard talked to the 
defendants 
the ecclesia children still in foster homes come from 16 
families their parents saying they wanted to protest violation of 
their constitutional rights stopped visiting the children a month 
ago and bart wilson of the state childrens services division said 
the decision was a serious impediment to efforts to reunite the 
families 
once they ceased visits that was it wilson said 
the children range in age from 9 months to 16 years many are in 
school some for the first time said alice galloway of the state 
childrens agency 
the trial will be one of the first in oregon to be televised 
acting under new rules lowe issued a set of strict guidelines 
giving television stations limited access to the courtroom 
newspaper photographers also may be allowed access to the trial

the christian democrat and 
revolutionary febrerista parties nominated presidential candidates 
sunday refusing to join other opposition parties in a coalition for 
the may 1 elections 
their actions also ended speculation they might boycott the 
elections because the provisional government of gen andres 
rodriquez rejected proposals to postpone the elections and make 
major changes in the electoral laws 
at separate weekend conventions the christian democrats nominated 
secundino nunez a former roman catholic priest and the febreristas 
named retired economist fernando nunez to run for the presidency 
the elections were called by the government of provisional 
president rodriguez who led the feb 3 military coup that ousted 
president alfredo stroessner an army general who ruled paraguay for 
nearly 35 years 
rodriguez 65 is the candidate of the governing colorado party 
and is virtually certain of winning the election against the 
splintered opposition 
the colorados in power since 1947 also are expected to retain 
control of the national legislature in the balloting 
the christian democrats febreristas and authentic radical 
liberal party formed the national accord alliance to oppose the 
colorado party 
the authentic radical liberal party is to told its convention 
march 2526 and if it decides to participate in the balloting it is 
expected to nominate former exile and longtime opposition leader 
domingo laino for president 
laino addressed party rallies over the weekend and spoke of 
irregularities in voter registration he also said there was the 
threat of a great fraud by the colorados 
the national accord had asked the provisional government to 
postpone the elections for at least two months to extend voter 
registration to allow coalitions and not just individual parties to 
back a single candidate and to revoke the law that gives twothirds 
of the legislative seats to the party that wins the most votes 
rodriguez government rejected the appeals to postpone elections 
or extend the voter registration period and ignored the other 
requests 
it did remove restrictions that barred the christian democrats 
and authentic radicals from participating and gave all legal parties 
access to the staterun media the communist party remained banned 
sedundino nunez 68 told his christian democrats god has 
given us the circumstances and the people are urging us to act we 
have to take advantage of the political opening right now 
he is a professor of theology and anthropology at catholic 
university and compared his partys participation in the elections 
to a long walk through a swamp after someone has rescued you from 
a deep well 
but must we wait for an angel to come down and clear the way 
for the christian democrats to begin to move forward he asked the 
party delegates no they shouted back 
febrerista candidate fernando nunez is 65

discovery returned from its 
fiveday mission in what appeared to be the best condition of any 
space shuttle with only minor damage to its protective tiles nasa 
officials said sunday 
a preliminary examination indicated only 10 thermal protection 
tiles will need to be replaced in contrast to the last shuttle 
flight in december when nearly 200 tiles were severely damaged in 
addition the tires brakes and engines that troubled some previous 
missions performed well 
we need to go back and look at mission records but i doubt if 
we could even find one that looks this good said discovery flow 
director tip talone who coordinates processing of the orbiter for 
each flight 
a day after landing discovery underwent processing at the 
national aeronautics and space administrations facility as 28 mph 
winds with gusts over 43 mph churned dust clouds across rogers dry 
lake slightly hampering work on the shuttle 
talone however expected discovery to leave on time for its 
ferry flight to florida friday morning 
technicians counted only 82 hits on discoverys tiles and 
only 15 were bigger than one inch said jay honeycutt director of 
shuttle management and operations at kennedy space center the 
previous shuttle mission ended with 707 debris hits on the orbiter 
this is one of the best yet said cindy lodge a director for 
the shuttle tile system that shields orbiters from the fiery 
reentry 
weve had no major damages theres a few dings around the 
nose cap nothing severe at all 
five tiles were damaged when wires connected to a tire pressure 
monitor snapped as the right main landing gear dropped ms lodge 
said only one of those five tiles will need to be replaced she 
said 
the two 10inch wires and printed circuit board from the pressure 
monitor were found on the runway 
talone said the wires which run down the landing gear strut 
apparently got tangled and yanked the circuit board out when the 
gear came down 
discovery landed at 636 am saturday on a paved runway rather 
than the hardpan of rogers dry lake for a test of moderate 
pressure on the brakes 
discoverys brakes were removed shortly after landing and sent to 
the manufacturer for inspection engineers said the brakes looked 
the best ever no signs of any heat there was no damage 
whatsoever talone said 
the crafts wheels to kennedy space center for recycling 
shuttle brakes were problematic through most of the program until 
shuttles were redesigned to steer with the nose wheel rather than 
alternate pressure on the main gear 
its obvious were starting to turn the corner on the brake 
problems talone said all the tires looked good and although one 
showed wear it was not a safety concern talone said 
he added that it looks like discoverys engines came through in 
flying colors again 
discovery blasted off monday from kennedy space center in florida 
and in six hours accomplished its major goal deploying a 100 
million tracking and data relay satellite 
on tuesday the crew had to shut down nonessential lighting and 
computers because of erratic flow from a hydrogen tank feeding a 
system supplying electricity to the shuttle officials considered 
shortening the mission by one day but by wednesday ground 
controllers had solved the problem 
talone said the hydrogen tank system would be inspected when the 
orbiter returned to florida 
arnold aldrich the space agencys national space transportation 
system director indicated at a postlanding news conference on 
saturday that the hydrogen tank may not have had a problem 
in the end i think weve concluded that was not a serious 
problem and perhaps no malfunction at all but simply behavior 
inherent in a system delivering supercold material aldrich said 
when nasa is confident the braking and steering system work under 
a variety of conditions shuttles might resume landings at cape 
canaveral since 1985 when discovery blew a tire and damaged 
another on the 16th shuttle mission all landings have been made on 
the wideopen lakebed at edwards 
richard truly nasa administrator for space flight indicated at 
the press conference that nasa will not soon forego edwards 
its a great place to bring the orbiter back to and i think 
well continue to plan on coming out here for a considerable period 
of time truly said 
discoverys flight was the 28th shuttle mission and third since 
flights resumed after the explosion of challenger which killed its 
seven crew members and brought a long suspension of the shuttle 
program 
discoverys crew commander michael l coats pilot john e 
blaha and mission specialists robert c springer james f buchli 
and james p bagian returned to johnson space center in houston 
shortly after touchdown 
during the mission they also worked on a variety of experiments 
including growing plants and crystals in microgravity and 
monitoring experiments of the effect of microgravity on development 
of chicken embryos and the healing of intentionally injured bones in 
four rats 
the crew also filmed the earth for a documentary on the effects 
of pollution and other environmental damage

only minutes before the 
fighting began a megaphone broke the predawn sunday silence 
warning a rightist member of the local election board the rebels 
were coming after him 
then guerrillas of the leftist farabundo marti national 
liberation front attacked bombing power poles and exchanging fire 
with national guard troops on the rocky edges of this little town of 
3600 
the fighting went on for nearly five hours residents said 
ending only two hours before the polls opened at 7 am 
the guerrillas had promised not to attack polling places or 
people who wished to vote but even so the early turnout was light 
poll officials said many blamed it on fear 
there is no question that the intimidation of the fmln is 
working us observer william doherty said the people are 
frightened 
one of the worst cases of nerves belonged by his own admission 
to luis flores 33 
i am afraid said flores a supporter of the rightist 
republican nationalist alliance or arena and an alternate member 
of the local election board 
the guerrillas have denied that they threatened poll workers with 
death but flores and others said he was singled out 
they said luis flores we know your turf expect us we are 
coming for you he recalled tensely as mortars thudded in the 
distance 
a few blocks away on the hilly edge of town repairs were under 
way on modest homes pocked by bullets or damaged by bombed utility 
poles a favorite rebel target 
a man patching bullet holes in his front door was asked if he was 
going to the polls 
if i have time after this he said grimly gesturing at his 
plane and saw 
worshippers leaving palm sunday mass streamed past polling places 
in the own square few stopped to vote 
san sebastian which lies in san vicente province was only one 
of the theaters of battle on el salvadors election day 
the pattern was similiar elsewhere with bombs and bullets 
setting nerves on edge in the hours before the voting began 
san sebastian 30 miles east of the capital reported no 
casualties in ilobasco in cabanas province about 35 miles 
northeast of san salvador there was death but people still 
streamed to the polls 
the bodies of two recently killed guerrillas a teenage girl and 
a young man lay on concrete slabs in the small open pavillion at 
the town cemetery that serves as the morgue 
people crowded around for a glimpse of the flyspecked bodies 
the two were killed in combat townspeople said a few blocks away 
they lined up at 71 polling tables in a central plaza 
despite fighting that raged from about 1 am until about 4 am 
the city of 70000 was not intimidated mayor juan antonio rodriguez 
torres said 
we are not afraid to vote he said we are all here 
rodriguez an arena supporter said no election workers had 
resigned despite threats broadcast on rebel radio and flyers 
scattered in the streets earlier in the week 
he said none of the officials were singled out by name as flores 
had been in smaller more vulnerable san sebastian 
flores said none of the san sebastian workers had resigned but 
he was badly shaken that the guerrilla had taken the unusual step of 
singling him out 
i am afraid they are going to kill me he said do you know 
how one would get to the united states

a man from yemen has been charged 
with illegally exporting 70 tons of elephant ivory worth 98 
million a newspaper said sunday 
a court also charged mohamed sulaiman alfan saturday with 
unlawfully possessing 853 hippopotamus teeth valued at 224 
according to the sunday news police said alfan shipped the tusks on 
march 7 to dubai in the united arab emirates according to the news 
report 
if convicted alfan faces a possible 14 years in prison under 
tanzanias economic and organized crime control act 
the report did not specify whether alfan came from north or south 
yemen both on the southern tip of the arabian peninsula 
according to east african conservationists the united arab 
emirates has become the major distributing center for illegal 
elephant ivory 
high international prices for ivory continue to fuel widespread 
poaching that already has cut africas elephant population in half 
since the late 1970s according to a 1987 un environmental study 
in january the government intercepted 184 elephant tusks being 
smuggled out of the country by former indonesian ambassador hussein 
joesoef no legal action was taken against the diplomat but the 
government asked him immediately to leave the country

authorities who unearthed 
bones and an apparent clothing fragment at a site identified by 
serial killer ted bundy hope to determine this week whether they 
belonged to one of his victims 
it is not yet clear whether the bones are those of a human being 
wayne county sheriff kerry ekker said 
ekker said the state medical examiners office will receive the 
bones on monday or tuesday and try to determine whether they were 
those of 17yearold nancy wilcox who disappeared from her salt 
lake city neighborhood on oct 2 1974 
forensic testing should be finished by thursday or friday he 
said 
bundy was executed jan 24 in floridas electric chair for years 
he had claimed he was innocent of all wrongdoing but in the days 
before he died he confessed to killing at least 23 women in several 
western states 
in utah he said he had killed eight girls and women he 
identified only three among them wilcox who he said was buried 
near capitol reef national park 200 miles south of salt lake city 
the sheriff also acknowledged that he was conferring with an 
unidentified california psychic who claims to be able to pinpoint 
the wilcox burial site 
im going to take a long shot im desperate at this point 
ekker said he added that if the medical examiner determines the 
bones are not human no further searches will be conducted 
the bones including what ekker said appeared to be a shoulder 
blade were found by searchers friday at one of three sites a mile 
east of the park also found with the shoulder bladelike bone was a 
fragment of what appeared to be a tan blouse 
bones at the first two sites were believed to be those of animals 
the blouse was deteriorated to the point that it could have 
been 14 years ago when it was buried ekker added 
wilcox was wearing a blouse of unknown color when she 
disappeared salt lake county sheriffs detective jerry thompson 
said 
the other two women bundy identified among his utah victims were 
debi kent 17 who was last seen alive nov 8 1974 at bountifuls 
viewmont high school and susan curtis 15 who disappeared from the 
brigham young university campus in provo on june 27 1975 
bundy also gave general directions to the graves of kent and 
curtis before he was executed 
the search for curtis remains is under way and law enforcement 
officers say they soon will look for kents body

with bells heralding their 
arrival the swallows made their official return to mission san juan 
capistrano on sunday even though some of the birds were spotted at 
least a month earlier 
thousands of tourists gathered at the site to get a glimpse of 
the birds on their traditional st josephs day return which falls 
this year on palm sunday 
the swallows were sparse though when 94yearold paul arbiso 
began his annual rite of tolling the mission courtyard bells at 757 
am 
for the air fare that i paid from new york i wanted swarms 
said colleen dunnholzworth 21 of new york city a rutgers student 
who came to southern california for spring break 
on saturday the 31st annual swallows parade attracted an 
estimated 2000 spectators said sheriffs deputy dennis duncan 
first accounts of the swallows coming to san juan capistrano on 
their spring migration northward date back to 1776 that was the 
year father junipero serra founded the picturesque mission as part 
of spains effort to spread the roman catholic faith and the 
influence of spain in the new world 
legend has it that the swallows have failed to arrive in 
capistrano once in 1935 when they were held up by a storm 
the official arrival of the swallows wasnt southern californias 
power landing this weekend that distinction belonged to the space 
shuttle discovery 
but john and minerva esquivel who moved to bakersfield recently 
from san antonio texas went out of their way for the event even 
bypassing a hometown turnoff on highway 58 that would have taken 
them right to the shuttles landing site at edwards air force base 
were kind of discovering california we figured it was either 
the space shuttle or the swallows john esquivel said 
despite the high expectations however on sunday television 
camera crews had to resort to throwing pebbles at the mission walls 
to get the birds to take flight for the proper dramatic effect 
george chauncey of las vegas craned a home video camera around 
and around looking for at least one good swallow flight to record 
im not disappointed why be disappointed ive got my health 
its nice weather and i might get some good pictures chauncey 
said 
at least one birdwatcher said the swallows actually got a 
onemonth head start on the tourists 
the first of the birds reached southern california in february 
from their winter homes in argentina and other south american 
countries said sandy wohlgemuth a birder with the audubon society 
los angeles 
the birds numbers at the mission have dwindled in recent years 
and urban sprawl has covered much of the area but they still find 
places to flock magalousis said 
swallows day is one of those popular things that most bird 
watchers dont pay much attention to said wohlgemuth but you 
cant knock it or try to debunk it after all how many times does a 
bird get in the news

the governing partys candidate won a third term as 
provincial governor by a sharply reduced margin sunday in one of two 
elections considered a test of the scandalembroiled liberal 
democrats 
in miyagi prefecture in northeast japan socialist party 
candidate shuntaro honma easily won election as governor sunday 
liberal democratic candidate kazuo aichi had withdrawn after

the prefecture traditionally a conservative stronghold elected 
numata in 1985 with 781000 votes to 271000 for his opponent also 
a communist 
numatas sharply narrower margin of victory in the election could 
indicate trouble for the ruling party in voting scheduled this 
summer for half of parliaments upper house where it holds 143 of 
251 seats 
large losses in those elections would endanger takeshitas 
chances in october to win another twoyear term as party president 
and prime minister opposition parties are already calling on 
takeshita to resign 
in the miyagi race a final tally showed that honma 49 received 
502372 votes compared to 140979 for seiki suzuki a conservative

the dollar mark for the second time this month an industry analyst 
said sunday 
on march 17 the national average price of gasoline for the past 
two weeks was 10037 cents a gallon including all grades types of 
service and taxes said the analyst trilby lundberg 
the jump reflects a monthlong trend in increases at the pump and 
the result of rising wholesale prices according to the recent 
nationwide survey the retail price of gasoline was up 105 cents a 
gallon since march 3 ms lundberg said 
a rise in both crude oil and refined products caused wholesalers 
to raise prices which in turn caused retailers to pass the increase 
on to customers she added

regular unleaded 10624 for premium unleaded and 8772 for regular 
leaded

gun manufacturers should follow the example of 
colt industries inc and stop nonmilitary sales of semiautomatic 
assault rifles the head of the federal drug enforcement 
administration said sunday 
i thought that was a very courageous action on the part of 
colt guns are dangerous law enforcement is suffering because of 
these guns dea administrator john lawn said on the cbstv 
program face the nation 
i am asking them to take this action on behalf of the 
officers who are in danger every single day because a police 
officer dies every 57 hours in this country said lawn 
but attorney general dick thornburgh and the new drug czar 
william bennett said they did not think the government should call 
for private manufacturers to stop retail sales of semiautomatic 
weapons 
colt announced that it was suspending sales of its ar15 
semiautomatic rifle starting last thursday the day after president 
bush decided to ban temporarily the import of foreignmade assault 
rifles 
bennett and thornburgh called for debate on whether the federal 
government should ban all nonmilitary sales of semiautomatic weapons 
or urge private companies to voluntarily suspend sales 
as an official of the federal government i dont want to speak 
in such ways that suggest that im pushing them in any direction or 
another bennett said on the nbctv program meet the press 
but he added i think we can make the case that we dont need a 
whole lot more assault rifles on our streets right now 
bennett and thornburgh said a comprehensive solution was needed 
if we think that the only way to deal with the drug problem is 
to ban a particular type of weapon were dead wrong thornburgh 
said on the abctv program this week with david brinkley 
wayne lapierre a spokesman for the national rifle association 
said he opposed any ban on assault weapons and advocated stiff 
mandatory jail sentences for anyone convicted of using a weapon in 
the commission of a crime 
addressing the issue of drug use in nations capital bennett 
said he had not yet decided whether to declare the federal district 
a high intensity drug trafficking area enabling him to assemble 
a government strike force to fight drug dealing in washington 
as of sunday 118 murders had been reported in washington so far 
this year a record rate and police say that nearly all are 
drugrelated 
the washington post quoting unidentified bennett aides reported 
in its sunday editions that the strike force would target repeat 
drug offenders try to shut down the citys 90 openair drug 
markets and use abandoned military facilities as temporary prisons 
for drug offenders 
we did not declare washington a highintensity drugtrafficking 
area said bennett we are looking at whether we should do that 
or not 
bennett said several mayors wrote to us and said we too 
want to be highintensity drug trafficking areas 
people need to be careful before they seek that designation 
said bennett this is not a good thing to be maybe some 
additional federal assistance will be available once this 
designation occurs but in many ways its an admission that the 
city has failed to conduct its business in a way that can keep its 
streets safe for the citizenry 
bennett asked whether he was bothered by allegations that 
washington mayor marion barry was involved with cocaine replied 
well sure it troubles me i think it troubles everybody 
if youve got all these allegations going around it hurts the 
credibility of washington but i dont think we have to be so dainty 
as to say well if we have disagreements or problems with the 
mayor were going to ignore the city 
barry was asked on abc whether he used drugs 
absolutely not he said but he brushed aside persistent 
questions about whether he would resign saying the issue is not 
marion barry 
thornburgh declined to discuss allegations against barry saying 
those are all matters that are under investigation by the united 
states attorneys office in washington and obviously im not going 
to comment on them 
barry urged federal authorities to use force against latin 
american nations that produce illegal drugs 
the national government needs to go to these five or six 
countries in south and central america send the army the navy the 
air force the coast guard burn up those fields eradicate those 
coco leaves blow up those labs stop it at the source barry 
said 
after the broadcast barry told reporters that if a federal 
strike force is sent to washington i wonder what they are going 
to do 
if he bennett thinks these murders are going to be curbed by 
more federal police then more power to him barry said

communist party leader wojciech jaruzelski 
told a regional party meeting that poland has a historic chance to 
evolve its system by introducing a socialist parliamentary 
democracy in a speech televised sunday 
but jaruzelski speaking to party activists in the southern city 
of katowice on saturday said the party must be prepared to face 
challenges for political power from the opposition 
in the speech published by the state news service pap and shown 
in part on state television jaruzelski argued that such competition 
could be healthy but that the party would show vigilance against 
those who seek to undermine the political system public order 
state institutions and the economy 
a week ago jaruzelski made a similar speech to warsaw party 
activists the speeches seemed directed toward averting any revolt 
among lower and middlelevel party activists some of whom are 
extremely wary of jaruzelskis proposed pact with the opposition 
jaruzelski first secretary of the polish united workers 
communist party spoke to a conference of the 240000member party 
organization of the heavily industrialized silesia region 
it is the largest regional party organization in the country and 
considered a bastion of hardline opposition to reform within the 
party 
silesias partycontrolled mining and steel industries are 
criticized by economic reformers as being unprofitable and for 
consuming a disproportionate share of polands resources 
jaruzelski defended his own moves toward economic and political 
reform and the decision to negotiate with the opposition at 
broadbased roundtable talks which began feb 6 and are to end 
april 3 
authorities hope the talks will guarantee social stability so 
that planned economic reforms can work so far they have yielded 
general accord on several key points legalizing the banned 
solidarity trade union federation allowing a 35 percent opposition 
bloc in parliament and having fully free elections for a new senate 
jaruzelski told the katowice audience the party is trying to 
create a correct model of socialist parliamentary democracy and 
political and trade union pluralism 
the future of what we as the first ones have decided to 
introduce depends on proving that the presence of the opposition in 
political and social life does not give rise to confrontation but 
yields sound competition he said 
jaruzelski said it was logical that the opposition would strive 
for power but he added we will show the necessary vigilance and 
firmness toward those who struggle against the political system or 
try to undermine state institutions

friday morning while being escorted by two guards to a medical 
office where he had an appointment to get a replacement glass eye 
johnson wearing a halloween mask met hill at the office and the 
two men disarmed the guards tied them up and fled police said 
they then went to the townhouse of lois platt the childrens 
mother who had corresponded with hill in prison her sisterinlaw 
peggy platt said lois platt broke off the relationship more than 18 
months ago when she discovered hill had been convicted of strangling 
his girlfriend 
peggy platt said she didnt believe the two had ever met face to 
face before friday 
hill 49 was sentenced to 27 years in prison for seconddegree 
murder in 1982 and had prior convictions for two counts of rape as 
well as robbery criminal sexual assault burglary and illegal 
handgun possession according to tom dowdle associate warden at the 
stillwater prison

progressively worse officials said 
police identified johnson his accomplice as a former stillwater 
inmate who served a fiveyear sentence for aggravated assault he 
was returned to prison for violating parole but was released in 
january 
police negotiated with the men throughout the day saturday as 
more than 100 swat officers ringed the building apple valley police 
were joined by officers from surrounding communities state and 
county agencies and the fbi 
basically they said they had to be allowed to leave if they 
didnt they were going to throw a dead child out cook said

the two men to start a car in what authorities described as an 
escape attempt cook said she struggled with officers when they 
refused to allow her to return to her children

building when one of the children came out to pick up soft drinks 
that authorities had sent to the townhouse cook said 
police threw at least two stun grenades into the house and a 
special weapons and tactics team went in 
we basically had a hard decision to make as to when the best 
opportunity would present itself and we had to be ready to go when 
it did cook said as you know we were dealing with some very 
desperate men it was unacceptable to allow the men to leave with 
the children

the dissident palestinian fatahuprising 
guerrilla group threatened sunday to assassinate palestinians who 
make direct contact with israeli leaders 
in a statement sent to the associated press fatahuprising 
particularly mentioned people considered by the enemy close to the 
palestine liberation organization it gave no names in the threat 
which apparently was designed to jeopardize plo chief yasser 
arafats peace initiative 
fatahuprising a syrianbacked group led by col saeed mousa 
broke away from arafats mainstream fatah movement in 1983 
its statement said that as the 15monthold palestinian uprising 
in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip continues some 
palestinian personalities are conducting contacts and meetings with 
the enemy which may lead to disastrous results 
we consider these meetings an attempt to liquidate the 
uprising therefore we stress that the guns of the palestinian 
revolution will put an end to the life of anybody who may be tempted 
to abuse the destiny of the palestinian people and its sacred 
cause said the statement signed by mousas deputy khaled 
alomlah 
on friday arafat spokesman bassam abu sharif said several 
palestinians have been meeting with the israelis 
in an interview with the parisbased arabic radio monte carlo he 
named gaza lawyer fayez abu rahme elias freij mayor of bethlehem 
hanna siniora editor of a palesinian newspaper and faisal 
husseini recently released after months of detention by israel abu 
sharif said the four were not plo members but were in contact 
arafats movement 
guerrillas of fatahuprising infiltrated israel from southern 
jordan on friday in another bid to torpedo arafats peace efforts 
jordan said its security forces later arrested the guerrillas 
arafat in december renounced terrorism and recognized israel in 
an attempt to open negotiations with the jewish state but israeli 
leaders so far have rejected his overtures 
arafat told the italian newspaper la repubblica last week that he 
is willing to go to jerusalem to pursue peace talks provided he gets 
full consent from arab countries 
the announcement drew sharp criticism from fatahuprising and the 
damascusbased popular front for the liberation of palestinegeneral 
command which described arafat as a traitor and an imperialist 
agent 
another guerrilla group the democratic front for the liberation 
of palestine called on arab countries sunday to exert extreme 
pressure on the united states to accept the establishment of a 
palestinian state 
in a statement sent to the associated press in nicosia cyprus 
it said its politburo member hisham abughosh made the call at a 
rally in tripoli libya the rally marked the 20th anniversary of 
the marxist group a member of the plo 
the statement referred to the expected resumption of talks 
between us representatives and the plo and said the dialogue 
between the plo and the us administration is not an end in itself 
the americans have to stop prevaricating in israels favor and 
accept convening an international peace conference as a viable 
framework for settlement it said

federal agents said william troy landreth could 
once crack into the computer networks used by the department of 
defense and nasa but now awash in waves of emotional depression 
he lives in the streets 
the 24year old computer whiz with a genius iq who as a 
teenager was the target of a highly publicized fbi crackdown on 
computer hackers now spends his days on park benches and his nights 
in shelters and concrete doorways 
known at the height of his fame by his code name the hacker 
landreth has all but dropped out of society saying moodaltering 
drugs and antidepressants couldnt ward off the depression that has 
dogged him 
but landreth said in an interview with the los angeles times that 
he remains confident in his ability to control computers and could 
make lots of money using his talents but he said he must live by 
his own rules 
i could set up a data base system for a company and walk away 
with a few thousand dollars for five or six hours work and theyd 
never regret it he said the five or six thousand for five or 
six hours of work would interest me but i havent fallen for it 
i didnt inherit a great deal of money thats been accumulating 
for several eons so i wouldnt know how to look at money he said 
landreth gained notoriety in 1983 when the fbi cracked down on 
him and other hackers 
with an iq measured at 186 well into the genius category 
landreth was accused of breaking into the virginiabased gte 
telemail electronic mail network to take a look at computer 
correspondence from the defense department and national aeronautics 
and space administration 
landreth eventually pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud 
was fined 87 for using computer time he didnt pay for and was 
placed on three years probation 
during his legal problems landreth appeared to be in control of 
his life giving lectures to business executives doing freelance 
computer work and promoting a book about his experiences out of 
the inner circle which has sold about 68000 copies 
but in september 1986 landreth disappeared leaving behind a 
rambling eightpage essay touching on such subjects as mans 
evolution and immortality communism and capitalism nuclear war and 
greed and suicide 
i was bored in school bored traveling around the country 
bored getting raided by the fbi bored in prison bored writing 
books bored being bored read the last page i will probably be 
bored dead but this is my risk to take 
landreth drifted for almost a year turning up in the oregon town 
of minnville near portland where he was arrested for violating his 
probation 
he was sent back to san diego where he found that he had about 
9000 waiting for him in book royalties from foreign sales he 
rented an apartment but it burned down he eventually landed on the 
streets 
the way i see it i could be retired in five or 10 years if i 
did things in a constructive way he said but i havent decided 
to do that 
he prefers for now to live by his own definition of freedom 
even though he knows some of his friends and family think hes 
wasting his life 
i dont know what freedom is good for any more than anyone 
else knows what its good for he said so its really in how 
you look at it

demands for an independent inquiry into britains 
handling of warnings received before the bombing of pan am flight 
103 will grow until the government explains its actions an 
opposition party leader said sunday 
also sunday the government acknowledged that a december warning 
about possible bombs on airliners was not mailed until after jan 1 
at least 11 days after the pan am jet blew up and crashed killing 
270 people 
we cannot afford bag it and bin it policies of british 
official secrecy on matters of security which affect every air 
traveler across the world said paddy ashdown leader of the 
centrist social and liberal democratic party 
transport secretary paul channon must come clean on all the 
circumstances surrounding the advance warning ashdown said in a 
statement 
unless he comes to the house of commons at the earliest 
opportunity next week and is competely candid in every detail the 
demand for an official inquiry on both sides of the atlantic will 
become irresistible he said 
those demanding an independent inquiry include the opposition 
labor party and relatives of those killed when flight 103 exploded 
over lockerbie scotland dec 21 on a flight to new york 
investigators say the disaster was caused by a bomb concealed in a 
radiocassette player packed in luggage in the planes hold 
channon said sunday he told parliament as much as it is in my 
power to tell government ministers should not go around 
revealing things that might be against the national interest he 
told the british broadcasting corp 
channon said he welcomed us transportation secretary samuel 
skinners decision to send top aides to london and frankfurt west 
germany to assess aviation security skinner said he wants his 
officials to determine among other things when and how warnings 
were made against pan am flights last year 
the investigators have been working extremely closely with the 
americans at all stages and i think if they come over here and the 
investigators have further talks with them that can only be a very 
good thing channon said 
there is keen public concern in the united states and in this 
country about the progress of this investigation and its not 
surprising that people should wish to come over and have further 
talks 
the transport department confirmed last week it prepared a 
warning dated dec 19 that included photographs of a bomb hidden in 
a radiocassette player but did not mail it until after christmas 
but on sunday a department spokesman said the warning was not 
sent until the new year because the accompanying photos had to be 
prepared the spokesman who demanded anonymity did not give the 
exact date of the mailing 
channon has said the letter was of little importance because 
similar information had been sent out a month earlier by the us 
federal aviation administration and by west germany flight 103 
originated in west germany and changed planes at londons heathrow 
airport before setting out for new york 
two london newspapers the observer and the sunday telegraph 
reported sunday that the dec 19 warning carried several important 
details that would have helped security people spot a rigged 
radiocassette player 
another london newspaper the weekly sunday express reported 
that the man who made the bomb is a libyan known to international 
security officials as the professor because of his knowledge of 
explosives 
the sunday express attributed its information to unidentified 
detectives it did not identify the man by name 
the express also said a lebanese student 21yearold khalid 
jaafar of dearborn mich unwittingly carried the bomb onto the 
flight in a radiocassette player given to him as a gift it did not 
say who gave it to him 
the fbi has questioned jaafars father nazir who has denied 
earlier reports in us and british newspapers that his son may have 
brought the bomb on the plane without knowing it 
also sunday abc news reported that the bombing of flight 103 was 
surrounded by serious mistakes in security at heathrow airport the 
network said it obtained a memo from the british transport 
department dated dec 29 which conceded that baggage coming from 
frankfurt was transferred directly to the jet headed for new york 
without being screened 
the memo also said a passenger arriving late at the departure 
gate was not allowed to fly to new york but his baggage stayed on 
a violation of security rules the memo did not say who the 
passenger was or give other details abc said

eastern airlines went shopping sunday for the new 
pilots it needs to survive a crippling strike now in its third week 
weve waited patiently for the pilots union to come to its 
senses eastern spokesman robin matell said as an advertisment was 
run in sundays miami herald appealing for pilots to be part of 
the new eastern 
the ads will begin running tuesday in other major newspapers 
across the country matell said 
the ads promise an outstanding opportunity for the very best 
and try to put the best light on the strike telling pilots to 
also understand that this is an unprecedented opportunity for 
growth and success 
matell said eastern is not lowering its requirements for 
experience and is offering the same wages and benefits that pilots 
have been getting under easterns contract with the air line pilots 
association 
only about 200 of 3600 eastern pilots are flying in the 
machinists union strike that began march 4 and eastern acknowledged 
earlier it will live or die on its number of pilots eastern is 
operating under 10 percent of its prestrike schedule of 1040 daily 
flights 
it takes at least six weeks to train a pilot who is new to an 
airline and eastern whose daily losses are in the millions may 
run out of cash within a few months on march 9 the airline filed 
for protection from creditors under chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy 
law and insists it will keep flying with a smaller costeffective 
operation 
pilots union spokesman jb stokes said the advertisements are 
aimed as much at picketing pilots as at new hires 
its twofold stokes said they want to test the 
marketplace and they also want to try to frighten our pilots into 
thinking theyre being replaced they should have learned by now 
that intimidation isnt going to work 
theyre going to be disappointed stokes predicted there 
isnt a pool of pilots out there stokes said other major carriers 
are hiring pilots and offer better working conditions and longterm 
stability 
matell said stokes was engaging in alpa propaganda he said 
eastern had received more than 100 unsolicited resumes from 
qualified pilots before the ads began running 
in new york alpa lawyer james linsey said the union probably 
would challenge any hirings before us bankruptcy judge burton 
lifland who must approve most of easterns expenditures 
all transactions outside the normal course of business need his 
approval linsey said hiring a new work force is certainly not 
in the normal course of business well certainly litigate that at 
the appropriate time 
eastern reported light loads on its northeast shuttle flights 
saturday and sunday fares were back to the normal 69 weekend rate 
after the previous weekends promotional 12 fare helped eastern 
pack about 62 flights daily between new york boston and washington 
some passengers got stranded at airports last weekend because return 
flights were sold out 
matell said eastern was encouraged by last weeks weekday shuttle 
service offered at a discount 49 a ride because it attracted 
many of the business people who most frequently use the shuttle the 
weekday rates return to their normal 99 this week 
mattell added that easterns latin american routes are seeing 
steadily increasing loads 
he declined to comment on a threat saturday by teamsters union 
leader william f genoese to organize a sympathy walkout at pan 
american world airways concentrating on the pan am northeast shuttle 
pan am spokeswoman pamela hanlon said the company which has 
boosted its northeast shuttle service during the strike doesnt 
expect a teamsters walkout we believe our employees arent 
inclined to take any kind of job action she said 
genoese met in miami over the weekend with eastern machinists 
leader charles e bryan to discuss strategy including a joint 
employee buyout effort to combine eastern with pan am they said 
that eastern and pan am routes would complement each other and that 
joining the carriers would be a way to save both 
both have been beset by labor problems and have lost a total of 
2 billion in the 1980s 
besides the advertisement for pilots eastern took out fullpage 
ads in leading east coast newspapers calling itself a fighting 
underdog determined to come back 
were going to build a better eastern for you the ads 
promise 
in another strikerelated development columbia college announced 
that it was canceling a dinner to honor easterns embattled boss 
frank lorenzo the new york city school said the emotional 
climate of the labor dispute makes it impossible to guarantee an 
atmosphere appropriate to such a celebratory event

relatives of victims of the bombing of pan 
am flight 103 said sunday they are outraged by recent disclosures 
about terrorism warnings made by federal officials before the 
tragedy 
its absolutely ridiculous that theyre three months too 
late said jan coyle of wallingford whose 20yearold daughter 
patricia was among the 270 people who died in the dec 21 crash 
to comprehend that this could have been avoided is unforgivable 
coyle clutching photographs of her daughter a junior at boston 
college was among about 100 people who attended a meeting of the 
victims of flight 103 at the marriott 
the meeting was organized in the wake of disclosures that at 
least six federal aviation administration security bulletins issued 
between oct 26 and dec 19 warned of the type of attack that 
eventually caused flight 103 to crash the jet blew up over 
lockerbie scotland and investigators have traced the bombing to 
plastic explosives hidden inside a radiocassette player 
many of the relatives wore white buttons emblazoned with blue 
lettering saying pan am 103 the truth must be known yet the 
facts surrounding the bombing which are slowly being released have 
provided little relief to those whose loved ones died on the plane 
the more i hear the less i want to hear said richard g 
monetti of cherry hill nj who wore a button bearing a picture of 
his smiling son richard monetti a 20yearold junior at syracuse 
university when he died 
frankly i had hoped the plane had a structural defect and fell 
apart and my son died because it was an unfortunate accident wed 
be devastated but wed pick up the pieces and wed go on the more 
i hear the more it sounds like that if anything had gone right it 
would have been avoided 
many at the meeting questioned why some people avoided the 
bombing by canceling their reservations marina delarracoechea a 
native of bilbao spain whose 39yearold sister nieves was a 
stewardess aboard the flight said there were 169 empty seats on the 
plane and discount tickets for the flight had been sold 
all the parties and all the people that are responsible for 
this lack of action should be brought to justice because on all 
their heads are the lives of 270 people ms delarracoechea said 
in recent weeks relatives have urged the senate subcommitte on 
transportation to beef up security at airports return property of 
victims of flight 103 and reveal the status of security before the 
bombing 
if we do not change this terrorist policy we will see these 
terrorist acts over and over again because the terrorists will not 
go away said paul hudson of new york whose 16yearold daughter 
melina died in the crash

a large tour operator closely linked with 
crippled eastern airlines has been forced to file for bankruptcy 
protection and a travel industry executive said rumors of other 
such failures abound 
tour operators are suffering as a result of fallout from the 
eastern crisis that also has hit some commuter airlines precision 
airlines of manchester nh one of the commuter carriers that 
feeds into eastern flights recently suspended all operations and 
furloughed 350 workers citing a 70 percent drop in passenger 
traffic 
the machinists unions strike against miamibased eastern 
supported by most of its pilots and flight attendants is now in its 
third week eastern filed for protection from creditors under 
chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law on march 9 and went 
shopping sunday for the new pilots it needs to survive the draining 
strike 
last week flyfaire inc one of the biggest us tour operators 
specializing in caribbean vacation packages sought protection under 
chapter 11 itself in a reflex action 
rumors have been flying of other tour operators also seeking 
refuge in bankruptcy protection said sue shapiro president of the 
greater independent association of national travel agents in new 
york theres an obvious concern about anyone tied in with 
eastern 
tour operators sell packages to travel agents they function as 
wholesalers between airlines and hotels on one side and travel 
agents and consumers on the other 
flyfaire based in hawthorne ny used eastern flights as the 
basis for around 70 percent of its tour packages the tour operator 
which says it is owed about 15 million by eastern was squeezed by 
the airlines bankruptcy action 
it became a nightmare flyfaire president joseph garzilli 
said in a telephone interview likening his companys plight to 
being on an eastern airlines plane that crashed 
flyfaires financial losses are compounded by the fact that it 
cannot operate normally without eastern flying a full schedule he 
said 
the tour operator cut its staff from 230 to 50 after it filed for 
bankruptcy in a new jersey court garzilli said the 16yearold 
company with offices in new jersey florida los angeles 
philadelphia pittsburgh detroit and other locations had been 
pulling in about 110 million a year in sales 
now garzillis company must queue up with easterns other 
unsecured creditors including banks ticket holders travel agents 
and eastern employees demanding paychecks whose financial exposure 
is not backed by collateral as the airlines bankruptcy proceedings 
drag on it could be weeks or months before they are paid 
it was not immediately known how many other tour operators are 
closely linked with eastern the way flyfaire is flyfaires leading 
competitor in caribbean tours liberty travel mainly uses other 
carriers 
ms shapiro said her group didnt know how many tiedin operators 
could be affected by the eastern bankruptcy spokesmen for the 
united states tour operators association and the american society of 
travel agents were unavailable for comment sunday

union nothing unusual about that except that theyll be reporting 
for soviet television 
the trip is part of a unusual jobswapping deal in which a soviet 
reporter will later spend six weeks at atlanta station wxiatv 
wxia reporter simeon smith who is fluent in russian and 
cameraman richard crabbe leave tuesday for tbilisi atlantas sister 
city in the soviet republic of georgia 
there they will work for gostelradio the government organization 
that runs soviet television 
a lot of what we will be doing is comparative stuff between 
life in atlanta and life in tbilisi smith said 
when they return theyll be accompanied by nugzar ruhadze an 
englishspeaking soviet reporter who will work at wxia for six 
weeks reporting to atlanta viewers 
ellen mickiewicz an emory university professor and one of the 
countrys leading experts on soviet television said she believes 
its the first such exchange of reporters 
smith said he has been stockpiling features on life in atlanta 
with stories ranging from stone mountains new megastore to aids 
victims the atlanta hawks pro basketball team the homeless and an 
affluent teenage girl who has a closet thats as big as most 
russian apartments 
he said most of his work in tbilisi will be relatively 
apolitical but if they have a hot story like an earthquake im 
part of the team 
we told them if you want to censor simeon go for it said 
wxia general manager harvey mars who made two trips to the soviet 
union to set up the exchange but just remember when he comes 
back he tells all 
in the soviet union each of the 15 republics has its own 
newscast which usually is broadcast twice once in russian and once 
in the language of the republic which in the case of tbilisi in the 
republic of georgia is georgian there also is a national newscast 
most of smiths work will be for the georgia newscast but some 
may be used nationally he will report in russian which will be 
translated into georgian

it would be hard to tell from the amount of media 
coverage that the vehicle under government investigation for 
rollovers is the ford bronco ii and not the suzuki samurai 
it would also be hard to tell from the sales totals although the 
government has never had a harsh word about the samurai its sales 
are a tenth what they were before consumer reports magazine charged 
last year that the boxy little fourwheeldrive vehicle tips over 
too easily 
the fate of the samurai illustrates the power of the news media 
to influence carbuying decisions particularly the power of the 
repeatedly televised videotapes showing the samurai going up on two 
wheels in highspeed maneuvers 
now ford motor co is waiting to see what will happen to sales of 
its bronco ii following the announcement last week that it will be 
investigated for rollovers by the national highway traffic safety 
administration 
most auto analysts predict the governments probe strictly 
speaking an engineering analysis will have little effect on 
bronco ii sales for two reasons 
engineering analyses are routine fiftyfive were under way as 
of the end of february the agency says of those only some go on 
to the next stage the case level and only some of those result 
in determinations of safety defects 
the bronco ii has not received as much negative publicity as the 
samurai got partly because the government did not release any 
gripping videotapes of the bronco ii going up on two wheels 
the power of the press really hit home in the samurai 
controversy so far the bronco is pretty far from that type of 
situation said scott merlis an auto analyst at morgan stanley amp 
co 
the jeeplike samurai was rolling along at sales of about 6000 a 
month when consumer reports magazine called a news conference on 
june 2 to say it was giving the vehicle a notacceptable rating it 
said the japanesebuilt samurai literally trips over its own 
feet because of a narrow tread width short wheelbase light 
weight and high center of gravity 
sales plunged to 2199 in june suzuki responded with dealer 
incentives that resulted in sharp price cuts and sales rebounded to 
6327 in july and a record 12208 in august 
the automaker appeared to have come back from the brink it got a 
boost on sept 1 when the national highway traffic safety 
administration denied a recall petition by the center for auto 
safety a washingtonbased consumer group 
the respite was shortlived though as sales plummeted to 560 in 
september 787 in october and 483 in november they jumped to 2483 
in december before retreating to 263 in january and 472 in february 
sales of the bigger heavier and more expensive bronco ii run 
about 9000 to 11000 a month 
officials of brea califbased american suzuki say samurai sales 
have been hampered by several unrelated factors including the 
difficulties of introducing three other suzuki models in the past 
several months the sidekick the swift gti and the swift glx 
but they admit that last summers publicity hurt sales of all 
four suzuki vehicles combined totaled less than 3000 last month 
we have seen a longerterm impact on the sales than we would 
have hoped im not sure there is one reporter who can write a story 
about suzuki without mentioning this issue said lynne m doll a 
spokeswoman with the companys public relations agency rogers amp 
associates 
the government safety board said it chose to investigate the 
bronco ii because statistics unearthed last year showed it had a far 
higher rate of fatal rollovers than the samurai 
clarence ditlow head of the center for auto safety said he 
thinks the government missed some fatal rollovers involving the 
samurai while slightly overstating the bronco iis he says the 
vehicles are equally bad they both deserve to be investigated 
he said in an interview last week 
in fact the government probe may not make much difference 
unless the agency discovers serious rollover problems with the 
bronco ii its sales are likely to remain healthy for the samurai 
meanwhile the damage is already done

a top wall street executive has begun a campaign 
for a measure he says would stimulate savings without aggravating 
the governments budget problems 
william schreyer the chairman of merrill lynch amp co contends 
that his idea would put some renewed sex appeal into individual 
retirement accounts 
at the same time he says it would help to pay in advance for 
the future costs of health care and the wellbeing of the rapidly 
growing numbers of older americans 
schreyers idea put forward in speeches he has been giving this 
month is not to restore the tax breaks for ira contributions that 
were curtailed by the tax reform act of 1986 not right away at 
least 
rather he is proposing that ira savers be given the right to 
withdraw money from their accounts in the future for certain 
purposes medical educational and home ownership without having 
to pay tax on the proceeds 
schreyers argument starts from the premise that the nation needs 
to increase its chronically low savings rate if it is going to be 
able to bear the costs of supporting an aging population in the 
decades ahead 
but he also acknowledges a more immediate need to settle current 
accounts that are out of whack 
the deficit crisis is real he says weve got to find ways 
to encourage increased savings that take little or nothing out of 
the treasurys hide now 
of course schreyer is hardly a disinterested party in the debate 
over tax policy when iras were opened up to all working americans 
in 1982 they became lucrative products for firms like merrill lynch 
in 1987 when deductions for contributions ended for married 
couples making 50000 or more a year and individuals with incomes 
of 35000 and up the flow of money into these accounts slowed 
significantly 
but does his idea have merit at first glance at least it looks 
like a tax break that would benefit upperincome people the most 
hence it wouldnt seem to have much chance of attracting support in 
congress 
however supporters of the idea point out the situation isnt 
quite that simple all ira withdrawals except for the amount of 
nondeductible contributions made by the welltodo are now subject 
to tax 
so under schreyers proposal all american workers would have a 
greater incentive to put as much money as possible in iras the 
interest dividends and capital gains that now build up taxfree 
inside iras would remain taxfree when they were taken out 
whats more the accounts could be used to plan not just for 
retirement but for other goals schreyer describes as socially 
desirable including education and to help shoulder the burden of 
the mounting cost of health care 
but the idea raises several tough questions first of all what 
would it mean for future government budgets 
if taxpayers were able to build up large new amounts of money 
that the government could lay no claim to might tax rates on other 
income have to be raised and new types of taxes be created 
furthermore would ira contributors totally buy the idea that 
their money could actually never be taxed 
recent tax changes have tainted principles that once were thought 
to be sacrosanct for example no taxes on taxes well state 
sales taxes no longer are deductible and the deduction for state 
income taxes barely survived the last debate about changing the 
rules 
schreyers case is that the nation should be thinking longterm 
in handling its finances as legions of financial advisers have 
pointed out in recent years that is hard to do in a climate where 
the tax rules are subject to frequent and seemingly limitless change

students at two california high schools gahr and 
nearby cerritos took a current events quiz last week and the 
results could help decide whether commercial television gets a place 
in the classroom 
the quizzes were part of a research effort designed to see if a 
daily tv news show that includes paid advertising is helping 
students learn 
the nearly 2000 students at gahr high school in cerritos 
calif have been able to watch the news show called channel one for 
the past two weeks on 91 new television sets given to the school and 
installed in every classroom 
the youngsters at cerritos high school whose enrollment numbers 
and characteristics resemble those of its suburban los angeles 
neighbor havent had a chance to see the news show but agreed to 
take the quiz anyway 
whittle communications lp the knoxville tennbased media 
concern that developed channel one plans to tally the results from 
these schools along with those from tests at the five other schools 
in the channel one project and their sister schools and see if the 
show is helping educate students 
backers of the program are betting that the research will show a 
significant difference in the results from the schools that have 
been exposed to the show and those that have not 
that could be a critical element in whittles efforts to persuade 
other schools to sign up for the channel one project whittle hopes 
to expand the service to as many as 8000 schools nationwide in the 
fall of 1990 
we expect to see real differences and if we do it will be a 
real plus for the program whittle chairman christopher whittle 
said friday in a telelphone interview 
the main obstacle to the project appears to be the intense 
opposition from childrens advocates and some education groups who 
say companies should not be allowed to pitch their products to an 
essentially captive audience in school 
groups such as the national association of secondary school 
principals and the national parentteacher association have opposed 
it 
peggy charren head of action for childrens television a 
massachusettsbased childrens advocacy group said she thinks the 
channel one test has been orchestrated to gloss over the bad 
precedent she says is being set of allowing commercials in 
classrooms 
the problem is we are selling children to advertisers they 
think they are going to get enough kids buying enough products to 
make the investment worthwhile mrs charren said 
the test of channel one began march 6 at gahr and five others 
schools mumford high school in detroit withrow high school in 
cincinnati eisenhower middle school in kansas city kan billerica 
memorial high school near boston and central high school in 
knoxville 
each school was given about 50000 in televisions video 
recorders and a satellite dish to recieve a daily 12minute news 
show with up to two minutes of paid ads the sponsors include levis 
jeans snickers candy bars and clearasil acne cream 
in return the schools are asked to play the show once each 
school day 
the test is to include five weeks of programs over a sevenweek 
period channel one has just begun a twoweek hiatus for spring 
break during which the producers hope to finetune the program 
a typical news show relates the days top stories and contains 
features on subjects like the environment and the lifetsyles of 
soviet teenagers 
last week channel one also carried a live 15minute special 
without commercials on the launch of the space shuttle discovery 
to test if the show is effective whittle plans to give quizzes 
at all six schools and their sister schools in each district for 
comparison 
students at gahr and cerritos got 29 multiple choice questions 
most of which came from information in the past weeks shows 
whittle said his company is also conducting two other types of 
studies to measure the effectiveness of the project 
he said one involves group interviews with teachers or students 
from the schools the other involves telephone interviews with 
students who have gotten their parents permission to talk about the 
commercials on the program 
whittle said the comparative quiz results the group discussions 
and the telephone polling will all figure in whether his company 
invests more than 100 million in hardware alone that he said will 
be required to go national 
five weeks isnt a very long time but we ought to be able to 
show some movement he said

what started as a european economic community ban 
on us beef with growthenhancing hormones is turning into an 
international scrap over the market for untreated meat 
twentyeight countries have agreed to eec requirements for 
certifying that beef sent to the 12nation trading group is 
hormonefree said jacques vonthron the eecs agricultural attache 
in washington the largest exporters include argentina australia 
brazil and new zealand 
which of those beefproducing countries will fill the 100 
million us share of the european market has yet to be determined 
retailers are now completing sales of their last us shipments 
since the hormonetreated beef ban started vonthron said 
texas beef producers who raise approximately onefifth of us 
beef cattle are concerned about whom european retailers might turn 
to while american suppliers are out of the market said john vlcek 
spokesman for the texas department of agriculture 
the texans might be willing to accept the european standards to 
preserve their share of exports to the eec vlcek said some texas 
beef industry officials have already explored the idea 
in addition news about the useec dispute has incited a small 
but growing demand for hormonefree beef by healthconscious 
americans cattle producers and consumer groups said 
at issue is the january ban by the eec on us beef treated with 
three natural and two artificial growth hormones the timereleased 
musclebuilding substances are injected via pellet under the ear 
skin of a young cow or steer 
europeans contend that the hormones are a health hazard for 
humans the united states says the health issue is a pretext for a 
trade barrier 
european cattle herds are too large for demand according to jon 
brandt codirector of the food and agriculture policy research 
institute at the university of missouri us suppliers have a 
similar problem americans are eating 23 percent less beef today 
than in 1976 he said 
concern over the purity of food and environment is a growing 
trend around the world in developed countries said c ford runge 
who was special assistant to the us ambassador at the geneva 
meeting of the general agreement of tariffs and trade which 
unsuccessfully sought to thwart the beef ban 
health and environmental concerns can be legitimate reasons to 
request trade restrictions runge said but these fears also allow 
protectionists to hide 
the eec has vowed to bar us beef products for human consumption 
and the united states is retaliating with 100 percent tariffs on 
100 million in european foods ranging from canned tomatoes to 
instant coffee 
both sides agreed in february to establish a task force to study 
the issue 
youve got a lobby in germany thats very concerned about 
hormones accumulating in the beef organs imported from the united 
states said runge the european community has created a market 
niche that a number of exporters are trying to fill 
one peculiarity of european beef imported from the united states 
is that 75 percent consists of organ meat livers kidneys tongues 
and tripe used in everything from pate to steak and kidney pies 
eec beef imports amount to only about 2 percent of us 
production according to alisa harrison of the national cattlemens 
association in washington 
brandt pointed out that this 2 percent accounts for much of the 
organ meat produced in the united states and cattlemen dont want 
to change production methods for the several pounds of organ meat 
derived from each animal 
we dont feel its right for a foreign government to dictate to 
the united states how we should produce our cattle ms harrison 
said noting that the us department of agriculture accepts hormone 
conditioning 
the eec is asking for certification of hormonefree beef which 
would boost the production cost of us meat and make it less 
competitive she said 
the reason why were so adament about opposing the the eec is 
because they havent been able to produce the scientific evidence to 
support their hormone ban she said 
the beefhormone commotion also has piqued the curiosity of 
american consumers 
people are worrying about food additives and it is growing 
daily said mel coleman marketing director of coleman natural 
beef in denver colorado which slaughters 20000 cattle a year 
after certifying them additivefree 
it is one of about six hormonefree beef producers that supply 
1200 us supermarkets catering to healthconscious buyers said 
dan howell director of the americans for safe food project a 
consumer advocacy group 
beef free of both hormones and antibiotics both used to enhance 
growth sells for about 25 percent more than other us beef 
industry experts said 
howell said a 1988 study by the food marketing institute an 
independent washingtonbased trade association of 17500 retail 
food stores showed 61 percent of shoppers considered hormone and 
antibiotics in meat and poultry to be a serious health concern

leaders of the futures industry returned home from 
their annual convention in florida with sunburns and a stinging 
admonition from some concerned congressmen to clean up their 
business 
about two dozen federal lawmakers spoke during last weeks 
fourday meeting of the futures industry association and their 
message to the approximately 1000 brokers and exchange officials 
was clear put your house in order because congress is coming 
through 
it is incumbent upon you to open your eyes to wrongdoing where 
it exists and be assertive and effective in rooting it out even at 
the expense of making some internal fundamental changes to try to 
do it yourself rather than waiting for someone else to do it to 
you said rep dan glickman dkan during a panel discussion on 
saturday 
the futures industry is due for an official review as part of the 
congressional process for reauthorizing the commodity futures 
trading commission the federal agency that regulates futures 
trading the cftcs current 3year authorization expires on sept 30 
the recent disclosure of a sweeping justice department 
investigation of suspected trading fraud at chicagos two 
worldleading futures exchanges has heightened public interest in 
the industry and brought demands for intense scrutiny and reform of 
these onceobscure markets 
out there in the country our constituents dont know a lot 
about futures trading none of them have ever heard of the cftc it 
is important as we look at this industry that they know the 
importance of it said rep robin tallon dsc who sits on a 
house agriculture subcommittee that is conducting one of several 
congressional reviews of the industry 
a future is a binding contract to buy or sell a bundle of 
commodities or financial instruments at a specified price at a 
future date 
agricultural commodity futures have been traded at the chicago 
board of trade the worlds largest futures exchange for more than 
140 years but most of the action now is in financial futures which 
were invented in the 1970s and are heavily used by institutional 
investors around the world to reduce their risks in the 
international stock bond and currency markets 
the justice departments probe of suspected cheating by traders 
at the chicago board of trade and the chicago mercantile exchange 
has yielded no charges since it was revealed on jan 19 
nevertheless some key lawmakers who attended last weeks 
industry meeting in boca raton fla indicated support for 
beefing up cftcs tradesurveillance and ruleenforcement 
operations 
tightening up recordkeeping by futures exchanges and brokerage 
firms 
cracking down on certain trading practices that some believe 
provide opportunities to cheat 
if the futures industry cannot satisfactorily police itself 
several lawmakers implied it will lose its cherished freedom to set 
and enforce most of its own rules 
our committee is not going to resolve in favor of 
selfregulation unless there is a perception that it seems to be 
working universally said sen richard lugar of indiana the 
ranking republican member of the senate agriculture committee which 
also oversees futures regulation 
over and over during the florida meeting exchange officials 
vowed to improve their auditing of trades and to root out and punish 
wrongdoers 
certainly we can do better than we have done leo melamed 
chairman of the chicago mercs executive committee told lugar on 
saturday i give you the entire promise of my whole being that we 
will respond in every possible way that we can to your message 
rep david nagle diowa suggested that futures leaders view the 
various investigations of their industry as an opportunity to 
recapture the one commodity you can never afford to lose the 
universal recognition of the integrity of your markets

bostonarea tenants pay a bigger chunk of their 
income in rent than tenants in any other major city in the country 
while houston residents pay the smallest a new study says 
a california research firm sound advice calculated that 
bostons median rent is 586 a month that is about the same as san 
francisco but the study found median incomes were lower in boston 
so that while san franciscans pay 195 percent of their income on 
rent bostonians pay 213 percent 
renters in new york pay a median of 444 per month though the 
rent is lower than san franciscos it amounts to about the same 
percentage of income as renters in san francisco pay again because 
new york incomes are lower the study found 
the figures are lower than actual marketrate rents because they 
include subsidized apartments excluding subsidized apartments the 
boston redevelopment authority figures the average rent in boston 
last year was 800 a month 
houston was ranked as the most economical of the 25 cities 
surveyed in terms of percentage of income with a monthly rent of 
346 about 13 percent of the median household income it was 
followed by cincinnati where the median rent is 322 or 135 
percent of household income 
next to boston the least economical city was los angeles where 
median rents were 521 or 207 percent of income 
the average of all 25 cities was 425 185 percent of monthly 
income 
median rents for other cities along with the percentage that it 
comprised of median income included cleveland 380 and 138 
percent chicago 441 and 151 percent seattle 419 and 153 
percent and washington 601 and 183 percent 
the study touched a nerve in boston where rents have increased 
64 percent since 1982 that includes a 61 percent rise last year 
that was the biggest of any major metropolitan area except 
washington according to the bureau of labor statistics 
rents are skyrocketing in a city that already has one of the 
highest median house prices in the nation estimated as high as 
195000 
the simple fact is that people cant afford to buy homes 
said lewis finfer director of the massachusetts affordable housing 
alliance so the average bluecollar lowermiddleclass person is 
staying in rentals longer making more competition for rental units 
theres not enough production of affordable housing 
weve looked at some of the rent indexes and the northeast in 
general and boston in particular have had aboveaverage rent 
increases over the past six to eight years said william apgar 
acting director of the joint center for housing studies at harvard 
university 
economists say the middle class is caught in a dilemma of not 
being able to save for a down payment because of high rents but 
making too much money to qualify for subsidized rentals 
wouldbe homebuyers charlene and stephen tobey have been saving 
for a down payment for more than three years and expect it will take 
at least two more 
house prices have risen so fast that its terribly hard for 
firsttime home buyers mrs robey told the sunday boston globe 
edward e zuker president of the rental housing association of 
the greater boston real estate board said there is virtually no 
construction of rental apartments in the range just below bostons 
median level 
he said city leaders must try to work with community leaders in 
encouraging construction of affordable housing 
everyones for affordable housing as long as its not in their 
back yard he said theres a lot of lip service but not a lot 
of action

we are pleased with the courts decision said guy osborne 
president and chief executive officer of the milwaukeebased 
supplier of food and food ingredients 
us district judge joseph stadtmueller issued his ruling 
saturday denying a motion by a high voltage that sought to 
invalidate wisconsins antitakeover law 
the judge also denied a motion for a preliminary injunction 
against universals poison pill defense against takeovers that 
defense would allow universal shareholders to buy additional shares 
of the company at half price if high voltage were to pursue its bid 
high voltage said it had no immediate comment on the ruling 
stadtmueller rejected an argument that universals directors 
violated their duty to shareholders by opposing the takeover and 
threatening use of the poison pill 
i find no evidence in the record which convinces me that the 
board failed to review this offer in a dispassionate and neutral 
manner the judge wrote 
high voltage has offered 35 a share for universal stock which 
closed friday at 33 in new york stock exchange composite trading 
universal executives contend a takeover would damage the 
companys longterm growth including its ability to invest in
