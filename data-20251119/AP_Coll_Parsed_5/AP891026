south africa has testfired an 
intermediaterange ballistic missile that couldcarry nuclear 
warheads and was built with help from israel a us official said 
thursday 
israel and south africa are also cooperating in the development 
of a longrange missile that could be used to launch reconnaissance 
satellites into space said the official who spoke on the 
condition of anonymity 
responding to reports about the nuclear cooperation the state 
department urged israel to sign the international nuclear 
nonproliferation treaty which it has refused to do for fear of 
opening its facilities to international inspection 
we have repeatedly urged israel and other nonsignatories to 
join in the pact said a statement issued late thursday we 
reiterate that call 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir denied thursday that his 
government had provided south africa with the technology for a 
nuclearcapable missile south africas foreign minister pik 
botha said i bear no knowledge whatsoever of such cooperation 
israels defense ministry spokesman eitan haber said his 
country is adhering to a 1987 decision that no new defense 
contracts between israel and south africa be signed but israel 
also has said existing contracts would be honored 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said we dont 
have any direct knowledge that we can comment on at this time 
we are looking into it 
the state department and the pentagon refused to discuss the 
matter we do not comment on intelligence matters the us 
policy of opposition to the proliferation of missiles and nuclear 
weapons is well known said state department spokeswoman margaret 
tutwiler 
our ambassador in israel has discussed similar reports in the 
overall question of proliferation on a number of occasions with 
israels ministry of defense she said 
the us official said intelligence reports said south africa 
last summer tested a modified version of the israelimade jericho 
ii mediumrange missile at armaston on the indian ocean coast near 
capetown 
the washington post citing unidentified informed official 
said in friday editions the us ambassador was stiffed and 
told it was none of our business when he raised the missile 
issue in january 
nbctv citing unidentified intelligence sources and a cia 
document reported wednesday that south africa was providing 
israel in return with enriched uranium for its own nuclear 
warheads neither country has admitted to having nuclear weapons 
the south african missile testfired over the indian ocean 
flew 900 miles its maximum range said the official 
israel testfired its own jericho ii missile about 500 miles 
over the mediterranean last year he said 
a longrange version of the jericho known as the shavit 
hebrew for comet was used to launch an israeli 
photoreconnaissance satellite earlier this year from a site in the 
negev desert the official said press reports at the time 
described the rocket as a multistage missile having a 2000mile 
range 
nbc identified south africas longrange test site as overberg 
saying israeli experts would be given a chance to monitor testing 
at that site

a bomb thursday destroyed a bus full of 
police officers in medellin killing at least five policemen and 
injuring 15 authorities said 
the radio station rcn without identifying its sources said 66 
pounds of dynamite exploded beneath the bus as it crossed a street 
in the bello horizonte suburb of medellin hub for the major drug 
cartel in colombia the report said the bus which struck a taxi 
after the bomb went off was reduced to rubble 
police said the bus was carrying police officers to various 
sites of the city to help in the governments war against drug 
traffickers police and official sources said five were killed 
instantly and that most of the injured were in serious condition at 
local clinics 
the mayor of medellin juan gomez martinez said earlier 
thursday that he opposed a government dialogue with drug 
traffickers which some hope will restore peace to the country 
since midaugust there have been 225 bombings and bomb attempts 
leaving 31 dead and 218 injured 
the latest injury was late thursday when a bomb tossed from a 
passing car went off at the central telephone exchange in southern 
bogota injuring one person police said 
earlier thursday unidentified assailants in a taxi opened fire 
and killed two police officers assigned to guard the ecuadoran 
consulate in medellin authorities said 
there was no immediate claim of responsibility for either 
incident but a series of bombings and assassinations that have 
swept this country since the government declared war on traffickers 
nearly 10 weeks ago have been blamed on hitmen hired by the drug 
barons 
the attacks came a day after the country suffered its worst 
rebel violence in two years with guerrillas storming two 
northeastern towns and slaying at least six people according to 
army reports 
the army blamed wednesdays attacks on the national liberation 
army a shadowy procuban organization 
there were no known links between the attacks wednesday and 
thursday and the governments war with drug traffickers however 
the army has claimed for years without producing proof that some 
leftist guerrillas and drug traffickers work in tandem 
in the attack on the guards in medellin assailants traveling in 
a taxi opened fire on the police in front of the consulate 
downtown a medellin police spokesman told the associated press by 
telephone 
one guard was immediately killed while the other died later at a 
nearby clinic the spokesman said 
the spokesman said authorities were investigating whether the 
killings were carried out by terrorists 
the national radio network caracol quoted witnesses as saying 
the two guards were attacked when they went to the aid of another 
policeman attempting to make an arrest 
medellin a city of 2 million residents is the most wellknown 
city of those making up colombias cartels others include cartels 
in cali on the north coast of colombia and in bogota 
the government pressed ahead with the drug war wednesday 
notifying an purported member of the medellin cocaine cartel he was 
being extradited to the united states 
according to tv hoy the government told jose rafael abello 
silva 34 that he would be extradited 
police have said abello is the fourth most important figure in 
the cartel in charge of its activities on colombias atlantic 
coast 
abello also known by his nickname the monkey was arrested 
oct 10 in bogota and faces a charge by an oklahoma federal court 
of conspiracy to distribute cocaine 
under president virgilio barcos extradition decree abello has 
five days to appeal the extradition 
the government has extradited four suspected drug traffickers to 
the united states since it launched its crackdown on aug 19 after 
the assassination of opposition presidential candidate sen luis 
carlos galan 
suspected traffickers have responded to the crackdown with a 
series of bombings and assassinations 
in wednesdays rebel raids about 100 guerrillas invaded cachira 
and la vega towns in the state of norte de santander the armys 
2nd division reported 
the heaviest attack by about 60 men and women was in cachira 
a town of 15000 people about 250 miles northeast of bogota the 
guerrillas destroyed a police station with mortar shells and fired 
on police officers with automatic weapons 
two policemen were killed and seven injured during five hours of 
fighting an army communique said 
an hour after that assault began 40 rebels invaded la vega 15 
miles away and tried to overrun the police station there two 
policemen were wounded in the sevenhour battle the reports said 
one guerrilla died as the attackers fled the town of 5000 
people into the mountains the army communique said 
guerrillas also ambushed police sent in as reinforcements three 
officers died in an attack along a dirt road outside town 
the rebel attacks were the bloodiest since 1987 when more than 
50 people were killed during one month of fighting 
caracol said two other leftist groups the revolutionary armed 
forces of colombia and the peoples liberation army also 
participated in wednesdays attacks the army could not confirm the 
report

aftershocks usually happen within months 
after a main earthquake and on the same section of fault but they 
can occur a century later and on nearby faults an expert said 
wednesday 
earthquakes cluster into sequences by definition we call the 
biggest one the main shock any that happen before the biggest one 
are foreshocks and any that come after the biggest one are 
aftershocks said seismologist lucile jones of the us 
geological survey in pasadena 
by wednesday morning more than 4000 aftershocks rattled the 
same 30milelong section of the san andreas fault that caused the 
magnitude71 major earthquake that rocked the san francisco bay 
area on oct 17 according to the usgs in menlo park 
aftershocks generally become less powerful and less frequent 
over time the agency said 
based on statistical studies of past california quakes by jones 
and paul reasenberg the usgs on tuesday said that within two 
months there is about a 10 percent chance of a strong aftershock 
measuring 6 or larger on the richter scale 
during the same period there is a 45 percent chance of an 
aftershock of magnitude 50 or larger the agency said 
when a fault breaks to cause an earthquake there is a change in 
underground stress patterns resulting in aftershocks that tend to 
occur along the same segment of fault jones said but the stress 
changes mean aftershocks also can occur on the fault slightly 
beyond the segment that first broke or on other nearby faults 
she added 
aftershocks from a major quake like the oct 17 jolt could be 
over in a year or it could take 10 years she said 
and a great quake estimated at magnitude 8 rocked japan in 
1890 and we are still having aftershocks from that earthquake 
almost 100 years later jones said 
the quakes are considered aftershocks because there are still 
more earthquakes there than before that mainshock happened its 
still more than the background rate she explained 
aside from aftershocks quakes sometimes can trigger other 
quakes on adjacent segments of the same fault like zipper action 
up a fault she said 
in its tuesday statement the usgs said there is a very small 
but not zero chance that the oct 17 quake could be followed by 
an even larger jolt on the segment of the san andreas just north of 
the segment that already broke

be it ever so humble or earthquakerumpled 
theres no place like home for lucille penn and hundreds of other 
displaced senior citizens 
ms penn 70 slept two nights in her car and three nights in a 
red cross shelter before one of the citys swankiest hotels gave 
her a free home this week but her heart is still at her home 
i dont want to be a guest somewhere your home is your 
identity said ms penn when youre up in years anything else 
looks like too much effort at this point in the game what else do 
you care about 
ms penn who lives alone is staying in one of 25 rooms donated 
to the red cross by the stanford court hotel which threw in 
complimentary breakfast and dinner and free local phone calls for 
their shaken guests rooms normally cost 180 to 300 
ms penn is unsure how long repairs will take to her apartment 
in the hardhit marina district which overlooks san francisco bay 
you take it one day at a time no you take it one hour at a 
time said ms penn who for five days wore a tshirt that said 
crap happens and so do miracles 
providing for the special needs of the elderly is one of the 
citys most demanding tasks in the recovery from a killer 
earthquake last week 
about 1300 residents of the marina are senior citizens and 
some have adamantly refused to budge even if their homes are 
unsafe or without gas and electricity 
offduty firefighters and other volunteers in vans have handed 
out bottled water hot meals and cold sandwiches they also deliver 
mail and presciption medicine or ferry residents to locations 
where they can take a shower 
theyll survive this they just dont want to survive it 
outside their homes its a lifetime of memories said kevin 
shelley who is coordinating city programs for the elderly from a 
shelter 
retired school teacher myrna croce 80 elected to stick it out 
at home with her sister their home wasnt damaged but they had no 
utilities for days and are still without electricity 
theyd have to drag us out of here maybe were nuts maybe 
were peculiar mrs croce said were just two old ladies with 
dirty feet dirty hair dirty teeth 
where are we going to go ive been in my house 39 years our 
lives are here said neighbor barbara osario 60 
across the street frederick giorgone 74 said he stayed 
because he was afraid of looters with no power to cook he lived 
on bottled water fruit and cold coffee 
its my home if it falls down with another earthquake im 
going with it ill go down with the ship giorgone said we 
fought tooth and nail to stay here they would have to take me out 
in handcuffs 
a few of the elderly hid in their homes without knowing if the 
buildings were safe an 89yearold woman who was found huddled 
behind her door was one of several people removed by inspectors 
checking buildings for stability 
the firemen heard a creak and kicked down the door and found 
her shelley said

yves saint laurent threw caution to the wind and 
brought out the sexiest clothes in paris in his readytowear for 
summer show 
thus ended a week of revealing curvy feminine clothes 
saint laurent on wednesday left fashionwatchers panting in the 
steamy tent with the hot cuts and colors 
the king of chic looked more at ease than in many a season he 
took a bow after the show surrounded by his models wearing draped 
thighsplit skirts bodices revealing bosoms and flirtatious 
carmen miranda dresses that left no doubt that sex is in and even 
chic 
after a tentative beginning of laced khaki poplin safari 
miniskirts and bush jackets worn with thigh boots and towering 
turban wraps saint laurent took off in a show that combined 
elegance and daring 
it was both subtle and versatile for those with a figure 
problem he brought out some loose smock dresses in hotweather 
cottons most original with flowered appliques on the huge puff 
sleeves and yokes 
those who looked beyond the sexy clothes could find old favorite 
classics good sailors blousons a superb tomato red jersey shift 
swingy ochre short coats or trenches with dark lean skirts and 
belted tunics 
but the comehither message was clear even trouser suits had 
daringly lowcut jackets the bosom more evident than the shapely 
shoulders jacket lapels often cut way down in this softly sexy 
collection to make way for the prominent female curves 
a flowered fitted white pique jacket with a sweetheart neckline 
topping cropped wide pants was as gay as a spring morning 
for extra flower power he plastered big red poppies diagonally 
on bodices and skirts of fitted short suits 
the dark silk and linen suits with motherofpearl pastille 
buttons up sleeves and jackets were cut curvily with tulipshaped 
long jackets and beautifully draped skirts were often 
asymmetrically wrapped to give an even more titillating leg show 
saint laurent went to town with the polkadotted flounced carmen 
miranda minis and flamenco dresses short in front dipped in back 
theres no doubt that when saint laurent goes overboard he does 
it with class the gaucho girls in leather outfits overloaded with 
multicolored cabochonglass decor and sequins on boleros had a 
certain cachet though the costumes would be hard to wear anywhere 
except to a psychedelic dallas barbecue 
for torso emphasis saint laurent would wrap the body in tight 
taffeta draping with a tiny shocking pink leather bolero on top a 
lean violet shiny leather skirt below 
temperatures went down somewhat as saint laurent relaxed to show 
some modest draped crepe dinner dresses and just one classic 
satinlapelled black dinner suit 
but the dinner suit turned into a black crepe and satin harem 
tuxedo the midriff bare to below the navel the skirt and tiny 
bodice cut to show every curve it was quite pretty with an organza 
coat flung over it like a transparent cloud

when the first rains fell in april 
debre medhiro woldemariam planted sorghum on his patch of sandy 
land and hoped for plentiful rain and a repeat of last years good 
harvest 
he got neither 
all debre 76 had in october were dry stalks not even suitable 
to feed his bullock 
and he wasnt alone eritrea ethiopias northernmost province 
is dotted with patches of scorched crops and relief workers say 
the crop failure could threaten nearly 17 million people with 
famine next year 
in severity the situation is as bad as it was in 198485 
says david morton operations director at the un world food 
program the 198485 drought and famine killed as many as 1 million 
people most of them in northern ethiopia despite one of africas 
largestever relief operation 
to stave off famine deaths the agency has appealed to 
international donors for 241000 tons of emergency food to feed an 
estimated 15 million eritreans and 200000 refugees from its 
southern neighbor tigre 
those figures however do not take into account foodless 
peasants living in areas now under rebel control 
tigre and eritrea are home to insurgencies that have waged 15 
and 28 years of war respectively against ethiopias government the 
eritrean rebels are talking with president mengistu haile mariams 
marxist government and have remained quiescent behind battle lines 
forged last year 
however the tigrean rebels have intensfied their fight having 
won control of their homeland they are engaged in a successful 
campaign that has brought them into the heart of tigres southern 
neighbor wollo province 
on oct 15 the eritrean rebels appealed for 270000 tons of 
emergency food it said would be needed for 14 million people in 
areas it controlled it urged nations to send the food into the 
guerrillaheld areas from across the border in sudan a route used 
successfully in the past to feed eritreas hungry 
taken together the rebel and and un figures would indicate 
nearly the whole of eritreas population of some 32 million is 
threatened with famine 
in eritreas capital asmara 15 miles north of adieradom 
officials say the traditional drought indicators are beginning to 
appear child malnutrition is on the rise water is being rationed 
and peasants are beginning to sell at very low prices livestock 
they cant feed 
isaak tsegay the provinces deputy administrator said peasants 
already were seeking relief food when they should be harvesting 
relief officials say they have little food to distribute with 
only 10000 tons of emergency food in stock and that is tabbed for 
161477 people displaced by the civil war and currently in need 
the only additional supplies expected are 27000 tons of wheat 
promised by the united states britain and the 12member european 
economic community which is due before the end of the year 
if we dont get more supplies by march we will be in serious 
trouble morton said 
farming is risky in eritrea a 48000squaremile pile of sand 
and stones adjoining the red sea centuries of wind downpours and 
peasants chopping down trees for firewood have eroded the land 
leaving craggy mountains and sandy valleys 
when the rains are adequate an average of 80 inches annually 
peasants survive growing sorghum wheat barley corn and other 
crops in the valleys and on terraces 
the rains were adequate last year the first time in a decade 
isaak says ironically thats the reason eritrea is threatened 
with famine next year 
morton says no emergency food was needed this year because of 
last years harvest the result is the lowest food stocks since 
1985 added to that only about 40 inches of rain fell this year 
relief officials hope the world community will respond quickly 
with donations 
they have in the past said afwork behane asmaras mayor 
but in the longrun the people will have to be selfsufficient 
in food production 
that goes for the whole of ethiopia 
drought strikes the horn of africa nation with a tragic monotony 
and ethiopia regularly has to hold out the begging bowl ethiopia 
is one of the worlds poorest nations 
western donors say that due to unproductive agricultural 
policies shifting weather and a population growth of 29 percent 
that outstrips food production ethiopia will suffer a yearly food 
deficit of about 3 million tons for the foreseeable future 
to try to reduce effects of droughtinduced famine the 
government is expected to announce soon a disaster preparedness 
program to stockpile food improve distribution and upgrade the 
countrys system of forecasting crop failures 
other aims are establishing seed banks and cattle camps with 
fodder and water to enable peasants to plant again and to build up 
herds after a drought 
in the meantime smallholders like debre will continue to rely 
on the good will of others during drought 
i am hoping some kind person it doesnt matter who will 
provide some food said the withered peasant standing in the 
middle of his worthless crop

robert middleton stood by a pavement 
crack left by the earthquake along the wharf on the port of 
oaklands seventh street public container terminal and took a line 
from a watch commercial 
the port of oakland middleton a port spokesman said 
wednesday it takes a licking but keeps on ticking 
officials are still toting up the damage from last weeks 
earthquake but it appears the port the nations fourthlargest 
and the biggest in the bay area suffered about 70 million worth 
of damage said james j obrien executive director of 
transportation services for the port 
most of that can be accounted for at the seventh street 
terminal which also accounted for about 7 percent of the 147 
million revenue tons of cargo that moved through the port last year 
the terminals three huge container cranes cant run up and down 
the wharf because their tracks were knocked off level by the quake 
there is no good idea when they will be ready to go again 
however nine other terminals remain in operation and port 
officials have been berthing ships normally handled at seventh 
street at other terminals so they wont have to be turned away 
at the moment we have the capacity to accommodate all our 
present customers with a lot of cooperation obrien said we 
are not out to bring in any new users at this point until we get 
the seventh street facility back on line 
with news of the earthquake flashed around the world the port 
is working to maintain the confidence of its shippers through 
representatives in rotterdam hong kong taipai tokyo and seoul 
reports of heavy congestion around los angeles during the 1984 
olympics caused some shippers to divert cargo to oakland and now 
oakland hopes to escape having the tables turned middleton said 
the port of oakland serves about 1500 ships a year and 88 
percent of the cargoes come in containers oakland handles 90 
percent of the container cargo moving through the golden gate 
cargos headed out tend to be raw materials agricultural goods 
and partially finished goods cargoes coming in tend to be consumer 
goods about 90 percent of the shipping is on the pacific rim 
though some comes from europe and south america 
the same seismic forces that swayed the bay bridge so much that 
a section of the upper deck fell also hit the 2decadeold seventh 
street terminal heaving up a big crack where the wharf supported 
by concrete pilings driven down the bedrock meets the yard which 
rests on fill 
the jolt shook the wharf sheering off the row of batter piles 
at the top he said the batter piles are a set of two diagonal 
concrete pilings that come together like an aframe forming a row 
farthest from the water side of the wharf they were designed to 
protect the wharf from the sideways shake of an earthquake 
when they failed the wharf tilted lowering the crane tracks on 
the water side several inches enough to put the cranes out of 
commission 
the wharf will likely have to be replaced and there is no 
telling how long that will take said steve kappler civil engineer 
for the port 
but it offers a lesson to engineers on how to build a wharf to 
withstand an earthquake 
the wharf stood up at the howard terminal which was built in 
1980 with the benefit of more advanced understanding of earthquake 
engineering though a container crane was knocked off its tracks

there are still prophets of the hippie 
culture sprinkled in the santa cruz mountains and the 
quartercenturyold values of that communal counterculture have 
emerged from quake rubble 
this fertile region 60 miles south of san francisco was next to 
the epicenter of the oct 17 quake that rocked northern california 
killing dozens injuring thousands and causing damage that will 
exceed 71 billion 
many of the mountains around the city are inaccessible because 
of land and rockslides triggered by the quake but in the city 
limits there are signs of a revitalization of the dropout 
philosophy of the 1960s 
the prequake homeless population estimated at 1000 was 
joined oct 17 by hundreds displaced by the disaster 
on wednesday donations of food and clothing were being 
distributed to all comers and many quake refugees were still in 
shelters 
there is an awareness of self an intelligencia its not a me 
generation its a we generation said chris watkins who sells 
handmade leather goods 
people in santa cruz have always pulled together they are 
really in tune with each other it is the land time forgot 
watkins added 
like the counterculture of old there is a sizeable segment here 
who resent war racism poverty materialism and automation for 
the most part though malcontents have mellowed 
but the wacky image persists and not entirely without 
foundation meditative vegetarians resting on futon furniture 
soaking in hot tubs and tending organic herb gardens do exist 
health food stores proponents of new age religions 
merchandisers of healing crystals and even fivestar psychic 
susie stevens jarvis have a foothold here longhairs still drive 
tattered volkswagen buses through the streets 
there wasthe commune movement and the counterculture movement 
in the 60s and santa cruz was in the vanguard of this said 
local historian page smith who was a founding provost at the 
university of california santa cruz it is interesting to note the 
ucsc nickname is the banana slugs 
the counterculture was very evident when i came here from los 
angeles in 1964 the mountains were already sprinkled with 
prophets of the counterculture there certainly are more arts and 
crafts people per capita here than anywhere else in the country 
smith said 
the image of santa cruz as a flaky drugusing place was not 
too far off the mark smith said 
university regional historian randall jarrell said the communal 
life in the mountains of santa cruz has evolved considerably but 
adds there are certainly a few relics and remnants of the 
hippies a lot have matured and i would not say we are a hippie 
community as such 
i would say we are progressiveminded there is certainly an 
arts and crafts population but there arent that many candlemakers 
anymore 
ms jarrell said santa cruz has a history of communal living 
dating to the early 1900s when italians pooled money and resources 
in their wharf fishing endeavors 
this kind of communal coming together is deep in the culture 
here she said there is a basic feeling of tolerance here 
longtime resident joan ward said the hippie community in santa 
cruz has always represented only a small faction of the population 
the old rag for 25 years has always been old hippies strumming 
guitars and that sort of thing that is totally wrong we are 
wonderfully diverse ms ward said 
the diversity is obvious after all the seaside city of 45000 
recently held a ninth annual brussels sprout festival on its famous 
boardwalk there was sprouttossing sproutcutting and 
sproutcooking the annual cold water surf classic is next on the 
social agenda

the peace accord worked out by in taif 
saudi arabia is the most serious arab attempt to end lebanons 14 
years of sectarian civil war but making it work is another matter 
lebanese legislators and arab league mediators who met in the 
saudi resort for three weeks achieved what was unthinkable a few 
weeks ago in a country that has had rival christian and moslem 
governments since september 1988 
the plan is the first to provide a framework for political 
reforms designed to share power equally between the traditionally 
dominant christians and moslems now an estimated 55 percent of 
lebanons 4 million people 
it is a fragile structure however because it does not resolve 
the political frustrations of militia leaders on both sides who 
were not represented at taif the accord also lacks a concrete plan 
for withdrawal of syrias 40000 soldiers stationed in lebanon 
which christians demand 
vagueness about withdrawal clearly leaves syria with a role in 
lebanon where it is the main power broker the agreement notes 
somewhat disingenuously given syrian control of 70 percent of the 
country that syria will not permit any act that threatens 
lebanons security independence or sovereignty 
arab and foreign pressure may force militia leaders to accept 
the accord which lebanons warweary people hope will end a war 
that taken more than 150000 lives and displaced onefourth of the 
population but there are many pitfalls 
deeply embedded distrust on both sides and rivalries of syria 
israel iraq iran and libya played out in lebanon could wreck the 
plan as they did peace efforts in 1983 1984 and 1985 
reaching agreement in taif is likely to be childs play in 
comparison to putting that agreement into effect in lebanon 
analyst charles snow wrote in the respected middle east economic 
survey 
the taif accord reduces the dominant role of maronite catholics 
the main christian sect in the government and parliament and gives 
moslems more power than they have had since independence from 
france in 1943 
it envisages a government of national reconcilitiation that will 
restore central authority and election of a president acceptable to 
all sides 
nabih berri leader of the shiite moslem militia amal says the 
agreement does not give the 12 million shiites the largest sect 
in lebanon a share of power commensurate with their numbers 
walid jumblatt the druse moslem chieftain voiced grudging 
acceptance to support his syrian allies but clearly is far from 
happy with it the druse a mystical offshoot of islam long hostile 
to the christians form only 6 percent of the population and fear 
for their survival 
for maronites led the army commander gen michel aoun the 
major flaw in the agreement is its failure to be specific about 
syrian withdrawal 
aoun considers syria an occupying power ironically the syrians 
moved into lebanon in april 1976 to help save the christians from 
being overwhelmed by an alliance of leftists moslems and 
palestinians 
syria feared the leftists and palestinians would control a 
radical state on its vulnerable western flank and precipitate an 
israeli invasion which came to pass in 1982 
later in 1976 the arab league conferred some legality on the 
syrian action by giving it a peacekeeping mandate 
in the kaledeiscope of changing alliances in lebanon the 
syrians soon found themselves fighting the christians aoun says 
syria has violated the arab league mandate by openly siding with 
the moslems 
in march he began a war of liberation against the syrians 
that involved some of the most ferocious artillery battles of the 
war more than 900 people were killed and nearly 3000 wounded 
nearly all of them civilians 
outgunned and outnumbered he gambled that outside powers would 
compel syria to withdraw but western powers were wary of the 
lebanese quagmire and stayed aloof aoun was left isolated with 
little choice but to accept an arab league ceasefire on sept 22 
george saadeh leader of the rightwing phalange party and 
other maronite legislators defied aouns demand that they refuse 
concessions at taif until they had guarantees of syrian withdrawal 
aoun sees himself as a national savior a man with a 
mission a lebanese analyst said privately that makes him 
dangerous hes taking on everyone in sight but he cant stand 
alone against the whole arab world and the international 
community 
samir geagea leader of the main christian militia and maronite 
patriarch nasrallah sfeir have endorsed the taif agreement causing 
speculation about aouns continued control of the christian 
government and army 
syria as in the past has linked its departure to israeli 
withdrawal from the security zone it maintains just inside 
south lebanon israel cites the presence of guerrillas in the area 
as a security threat and shows no signs of leaving

for the next two weeks william shakespeare 
devotees will be able to visit the site archaeologists believe once 
held the bards legendary globe theater 
owner hanson plc said wednesday it has arranged for a 
scaffolding viewing platform over the site near southwark bridge 
less than a mile east of the national theater on the south bank of 
the thames 
it will be open daily until nov 8 
it isnt terribly exciting for anyone who doesnt know what 
they are looking at notes will be handed out explaining what can 
be seen a hanson spokesman said on condition of anonymity 
three chalkandbrick foundation walls that archaeologists say 
were part of the back of the 17th century theater are visible in 
the excavation 
the first performances of shakespeares great tragedies 
hamlet othello king lear and macbeth were staged 
at the globe theater built in 1599 and rebuilt after a fire 14 
years later 
most of the site later was covered by brewery buildings the 
spot believed to be that of the theater is a former brewery parking 
lot 
hanson a british conglomerate acquired the site three years 
ago as part of its takeover of the imperial group which included 
the former courage brewery company 
hanson has asked environment secretary christopher patten to 
declare the site an ancient monument 
harvey sheldon head of the museum of londons archaeological 
unit for the capital said he believed the remains are part of the 
globe because they are in the o shape described by shakespeare 
and because of the discovery of large quantities of hazelnut 
shells which were the elizabethan equivalent of popcorn

in an attempt to prove that anything can become a 
pop hit two englishmen have released a dance version of baa baa 
black sheep sung or rather bleated by betsy the sheep 
five hundred copies of the single by mark richards and ian 
fletcher have been on sale since monday for about 2 in central 
england record stores 
aileen cameron the secretary at image television where richards 
and fletcher work described the office as chaotic with requests 
for records photos of betsy and interviews 
richards who works as a scriptwriter when not acting as betsys 
manager said three radio stations have added the song to their 
playlists he said he and fletcher would also welcome bids to 
produce a music video 
the sounds of the new baa baa black sheep song filled the oasis 
record store in derby 135 miles north of london which has been 
playing it regularly sales clerk tricia nicholls said wednesday a 
few party disc jockeys had expressed interest but so far only one 
of six copies has been sold 
the producers said they were surprised by the amount of interest 
in their song which started out as a joke to poke fun at the music 
industrys increasing use of electronic mixing 
the betsy boogie starts out on hands and knees and then you 
chew some grass like a sheep would do richards explained in an 
interview 
fletcher told sky television its got certain influences of

an energy department laboratory in tennessee 
lost a significant amount of radioactive tritium in a test shipment 
between lab buildings raising the possibility of foul play 
government records show 
ironically the secret test was done as part of an internal 
investigation into troubling discrepancies in the amount of tritium 
shipped from the oak ridge national laboratory at oak ridge tenn 
to commercial buyers in recent years 
tritium supplies are classified by the government the material 
is produced in energy department reactors in south carolina for use 
in nuclear warheads although small amounts are sold to domestic 
and foreign companies commercial uses include the manufacture of 
luminous lights and biological and energy research 
no acceptable explanation could be found for the tritium lost in 
the test shipment last year according to an oak ridge report 
released wednesday by the energy department in response to a 
freedom of information act request by the associated press 
the report dated july 20 raised the possibility of theft but 
said this could not be substantiated 
jim alexander an oak ridge spokesman said wednesday he did not 
know whether the tritium in the test shipment has been recovered 
he said efforts to resolve the discrepancies in commercial 
shipments dating back to 1985 were continuing 
based on information in the oak ridge investigation report it 
appeared about 2 grams of tritium were lost in the shipment between 
lab buildings that is about half the amount used in a single 
nuclear warhead according to private analysts 
the lab is operated by martin marietta energy systems inc under 
an energy department contract 
commercial shipments from oak ridge were suspended in july while 
a joint team of experts from the energy department and the nuclear 
regulatory commission conducted an investigation this group 
reported on july 28 that it could not explain the discrepancies in 
the commercial shipments which amounted to about 5 grams 
in august the department said it was resuming most shipments and 
that it was reasonably sure the missing tritium had not been 
diverted to making illicit nuclear weapons 
the 2 grams of tritium lost in the test shipments was in 
addition to the 5 grams missing from commercial sales 
an internal martin marietta memorandum dated jan 16 1989 
indicated that efforts to find the lost 2 grams of tritium were 
delayed because one of the buildings involved in the test shipment 
was shut down due to an unusual occurrence report 
the memo was released as an attachment to the oak ridge study 
it did not elaborate on the unusual occurrence but said 
corrective actions were under way 
the tritium mystery began aug 11 1988 when as part of oak 
ridges attempt to find explanations for a series of commercial 
shipment discrepancies the lab loaded 28615 curies of tritium a 
little over 25 grams into a shipping container at one building 
and sent it to another the idea was to prove tritium could be 
loaded and removed in a pure form 
a curie is a standard measure of radioactivity 
some of the tritium was unloaded at the second building to take 
samples as planned it was then reloaded and the entire container 
sent back to the first building this was done over a threemonth 
period when the container was unloaded at its final destination 
nov 14 1988 only 6364 curies of tritium were left the report 
said 
this meant that about threequarters of the original shipment 
or 2 grams of tritium was gone 
the investigators said they could not find a solid explanation 
for the disappearance they found no evidence that the tritium was 
released into a ventilation stack at either of the buildings nor 
that an incorrect amount of tritium was loaded into the container 
they also dismissed the possibility that the container leaked 
another possible explanation was that another container loaded 
with a smaller amount was inadvertently switched with the test 
container investigators said this was unlikely but that the 
possibility would be checked further

former top officials and military 
officers known for their refusal to work with the sovietbacked 
government have formed what they call a third force to promote 
peace in afghanistan 
the 15 men many of whom were educated in the west seek to 
bridge the gap between the moscowstyle government and the 
usbacked mujahedeen guerrillas who have been at war for a decade 
calling themselves the national salvation society they issued a 
manifesto this month calling for an end to both soviet and american 
interference in afghanistan 
the societys members most of whom served former king zahir 
shah say they want to unite afghanistan and start repairing the 
damage 
according to their estimates which are slightly higher than 
information available to the united nations 2 million afghans have 
been killed and 7 million have fled the country since the 1978 
marxist revolution of the 15 million afghans inside and outside 
the country 95 percent are illiterate and 70 percent of the arable 
land has been abandoned they say 
we are the group who stayed in afghanistan during the last 10 
years said mohammad asghar the societys chairman and a former 
justice minister the destruction has got to such a point that we 
felt we would be committing a grave sin if we didnt work for 
peace 
other members of the group include former agriculture and 
finance ministers a former national police chief and an 
exgovernor of the central bank 
foreign diplomats say the group has great popular support 
speaking on condition of anonymity diplomats and an afghan 
observer said the group could develop into a potent political force 
if it can stay independent of both the government and the 
mujahedeen whose name means islamic holy warriors 
but their risks are tremendous one diplomat added 
history has never been kind to moderates 
the societys manifesto was carried by the governmentrun press 
and radio station on oct 7 but the group insists it is 
independent of government control 
we are a third force said asghar who studied philosophy 
and education at columbia university in new york alien powers 
have changed our free country into an exercise board of their 
politics as well as a theater of international confrontation 
giving fatal arms and boundless financial support to the warring 
sides they add at every moment fuel to the flames of war 
the groups manifesto was significant in that it did not 
distinguish between the united states and the soviet union it also 
pointedly criticized the kabul governments centralized economic 
policies and urged the establishment of a free market economy 
abdul qudoos majid the societys secretary and former deputy 
minister of mines and industries said it took 16 days to get the 
government to agree to publish the manifesto 
where else could we have gone to get our message across 
asked majid a graduate of the colorado school of mines we also 
went to them because we wanted to test the governments sincerity 
president najib has repeatedly asserted that he wants a policy 
of national reconciliation he has escalated his call since the 
soviet union withdrew its combat troops in february and ended a 
decade of direct military intervention in afghanistan 
all 15 members of the society served in top government posts 
during the reign of zahir shah whose four decades on the throne 
ended in 1973 when he was overthrown by his cousin mohammad daoud 
daoud was assassinated in 1978 when the peoples democratic party 
of afghanistan seized power 
majid at 60 is the youngest member of the society whose 
average age is 66 
several have been jailed including the deputy chairman former 
gen abdul hakim katawazi whose fingernails were pulled out during 
torture sessions by daouds regime 
a government source speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the government recently asked katawazi to become minister of 
defense but he refused 
afghan observers said the government apparently does not oppose 
the group because it might help lure the 74yearold zahir shah 
home from exile in italy the king is still a popular figure in 
afghanistan and his return might lend najib the air of legitimacy 
he seeks at home and abroad 
the mujahedeen refuse to negotiate with najibs government 
denouncing it as a soviet puppet 
the kings return might also fatally fracture the squabbling 
mujahedeen alliance a government source noted the leaders of the 
seven pakistanbased mujahedeen groups range from bitter 
antimonarchists to former palace advisers who have said they would 
not oppose the kings return 
however asghar denied the national salvation society was set up 
simply to encourage the kings return 
my main problem with the government has always been 
ideological the 73yearold scholar and avowed antimarxist 
said this whole fight started with the imposition of an alien 
system on afghanistan which was rejected by our people we want a 
system that is based on our own culture 
we also want one that is based on freedom

more than 800000 has been awarded to the 
widows of two men slain in the bloody police assault on attica 
state prison but their lawyer says vindication is the sweetest 
product of the 18yearold case 
judge donald corbett on wednesday awarded 13 million in 
damages to seven former attica inmates or their survivors saying 
the men neither participated in the uprising nor resisted in the 
retaking of the prison by state police 
the police assault on the prison on sept 13 1971 was 
described by an investigating commission as the bloodiest 
encounter between americans since the civil war 
brenda west of buffalo and sara gray of rochester whose 
husbands were shot to death in the assault were awarded 475000 
and 385000 respectively 
they have felt for many years that their husbands had to be 
vindicated in some way said their attorney james hagerty the 
money is very nice of course but they feel very good about the 
vindication 
hagerty said he would seek interest accruing over 18 years that 
would bring the awards for both women to more than 1 million 
mrs west declined to be interviewed on wednesday and mrs gray 
couldnt be reached for comment 
more than 1200 inmates took control of the maximumsecurity 
prison near buffalo for four days holding guards and civilians 
hostage the police assault left 39 inmates and employees dead and 
80 injured four people had died earlier during the prison takeover 
three of the seven inmates covered in the lawsuit were killed in 
the 10 minutes of police gunfire on inmates two others have since 
died of unrelated causes and two are still alive 
corbett said the state was liable for damages for injuries 
resulting from the intentional use of excessive force 
the state will appeal said james flateau spokesman for the 
state criminal justice director 
the awards ranged from 35000 to 475000 depending on the 
inmates pain and suffering their families loss of money based on 
their future employment prospects and disfigurement corbett said 
in talks with state authorities during and after the uprising 
inmates objected to what they called degrading conditions at 
attica they said theyd been locked in their cells 13 hours a day 
were allowed only one shower a week and never knew how their mail 
would be censored or if it would be withheld entirely

arts is looking for a successor to chairman ralph p davidson who 
plans to quit in early 1991 over unspecified differences with the 
centers board of trustees 
davidsons announcement wednesday followed recurring reports 
that a majority of the 45member kennedy center board was 
dissatisfied with the former time inc executives management style 
and personality clashes 
at a meeting wednesday the board accepted davidsons advance 
notice that he will resign when his threeyear contract expires in 
february 1991 the trustees issued a statement praising his 
dedication to the center and his many management and programming 
initiatives 
trustee james evans will lead a search committee to find a 
successor to davidson 62 who has been the 125000ayear 
chairman and chief executive of the national arts center since 
february 1988 davidson succeeded broadway producer roger l 
stevens the centers founding chairman 
another trustee former defense secretary melvin laird will 
chair a transition committee davidson said he hoped a successor 
could be named by mid1990 
i arrived at my decision after several discussions with the 
board and the realization that we had different priorities and 
different expectations of each other davidson said in a separate 
statement 
these differences happen in institutions of all kinds and as 
regrettable as they may be i fully understand the need for a 
change for the sake of the institution said davidson who did 
not elaborate 
reports of growing tensions between davidson and the trustees 
surfaced after the boards last meeting in july 
the trustees were reported to have criticized davidson privately 
for his aloof management style arbitrary treatment of the kennedy 
center staff and failure to attend important social functions 
concerns also were raised privately about financing the national 
symphony orchestras planned tour of the soviet union next 
february and about a breakdown in negotiations for bringing 
british producer duncan weldons staging of shakespeares richard 
ii and richard iii to the kennedy center 
there were some complaints that davidson had failed to meet 
fundraising expectations but the boards statement wednesday 
praised davidsons efforts to create a satisfactory endowment for 
the center and its affiliate the national symphony orchestra 
the kennedy center receives no federal support except for 
housekeeping services by the national park service and occasional 
programming grants from the national endowment for the arts most 
of the centers 57 million annual budget is financed by ticket 
sales and private contributions 
davidson receives 125000 annually as chief administrator of 
the kennedy center the white marble cultural center alongside the 
potomac river which opened in september 1971 as the only official 
memorial to president kennedy

abortion rights advocates in congress say 
theyre not giving up their bid to allow medicaid abortions for 
rape and incest victims despite falling far short of overriding 
president bushs veto 
the house sustained bushs veto wednesday in a 231191 vote 51 
fewer than the twothirds majority needed to overturn a veto 
rep chris smith rnj called the vote a decisive victory 
for the prolife movement and evidence the political ground has 
not shifted on the abortion issue as abortion rights advocates say 
but democrats and republicans who back the more liberal 
restrictions argued that public sentiment is on their side and that 
the vote will yield farreaching political damage for bush among 
younger voters 
i am amazed said rep les aucoin dore to see the 
republican white house hand over to the democratic party a 
political generation thats out there and awakening to this issue 
president bush may well have stumbled on the one issue that 
could cost him reelection said a republican rep bill green of 
new york 
the vote followed bushs veto on saturday of the provision 
which is but a paragraph in a 1567 billion appropriations bill 
for health education and labor programs for the 1990 fiscal year 
that began oct 1 
the provision would loosen an eightyear ban on federal 
financing of abortions for poor women except in cases where the 
womans life is endangered by her pregnancy it would have 
permitted medicaid abortions for poor women who are victims of rape 
or incest and who reported promptly to authorities 
although it was designed to cover a relatively narrow group of 
women the issue took on symbolic importance in the growing 
political struggle over abortion its approval by the house two 
weeks ago on a 216206 vote marked the first time that body had 
voted the more liberal abortion language although the senate has 
repeatedly backed it 
with the agencies continuing to operate under a stopgap spending 
measure the spending bill and vetoed abortion language were sent 
back to the house appropriations committee for revision 
rep barbara boxer dcalif and other abortion rights leaders 
vowed to offer similar language on other bills and repeatedly put 
bush and antiabortion house members on the spot 
we will keep on coming back boxer said 
house democratic whip bill gray dpa said he did not think 
democrats would attempt to add similar abortion language to the 
same appropriations bill boxer and her allies however held out 
that possibility 
bush meanwhile has threatened to veto an appropriations bill 
for the district of columbia because it would allow washington dc 
to spend local tax money on medicaid abortions for victims of rape 
and incest 
smith and other abortion opponents said wednesdays vote 
demonstrated they can overcome future efforts to weaken the 
prohibition on most medicaid abortions 
they made the mistake of thinking this was a oneround 
fight said rep vin weber rminn some members who were 
panicked by proabortion propaganda in the last few weeks are going 
to be surprised were now beginning to see some victories on 
our side of the issue 
smith did not rule out the chance a compromise could be reached 
if it was very very tight 
fiftynine democrats and 132 republicans voted to sustain the 
veto 42 republicans joined 189 democrats in voting to override 
abortionrights supporters picked up a net 15 votes on the 
override vote from their vote two weeks ago but some of those who 
switched positions said they did so for other reasons 
smith the antiabortion leader attributed most of the switches 
to other issues but said there were a few marginal members who 
have capitulated 
eleven members did not vote including rep james courter a 
republican running for governor of new jersey who has been accused 
of waffling on the abortion issue his opponent democratic rep 
james florio voted to override and said courter chose to say 
this was not an issue of enough importance to adjust his schedule 
to be here

the canton trade fair once chinas only 
export showcase has a renewed importance this fall as chinese 
officials use the event to lure back overseas traders after the 
bloody crackdown on dissent 
but foreign traders say attendance is down from previous years 
in addition a hong kong textile trader claims some chinese 
exporters from staterun enterprises are protesting the crackdown 
by dragging their feet on soliciting new business 
they are angry about the government but they cannot criticize 
it so they hold back the goods he said 
the autumn edition of the biannual fair running oct 1531 
is the first one to be held after the suppression of the 
counterrevolutionary rebellion says wang pingqing vice minister 
at the ministry of foreign economic relations and trade 
it is a window showing chinas determination to carry on its 
opendoor policy he says counterrevolutionary rebellion is 
what the communist government calls last springs prodemocracy 
demonstrations 
hundreds perhaps thousands of people were killed when the 
chinese military crushed the beijing protests in early june the 
crackdown prompted many foreign businessmen to flee the country 
the significance of this autumns fair may thus be more 
political than economic 
china just wants to show that it is safe to do business 
here said the hong kong textile trader who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
the 156000squareyard glass exhibition complex for the fair is 
now under tight security with armed military police guarding the 
grounds in this southern city on the pearl river about 90 miles 
northwest of hong kong 
inside the fivestory building products ranging from clothing 
to ak47 machine guns are on display 
at a medical equipment center a few people crowded around a 
portable hospital that takes readings on heartbeat and 
breathing in the toy section business negotiations took place in 
rooms lined with dolls and puppets 
the fairs propaganda office claimed 21000 guests visited 
during the first five days a 10 percent drop from the spring 
exhibition chinas official xinhua news agency reported tuesday 
that the number of foreign businessmen was greater than the 
previous fair without providing statistics 
however foreign businessmen who attended previous fairs say 
crowds are thinner 
in the past it was hard to move around this year there are 
fewer people especially foreigners the hong kong textile trader 
said 
also the number of chinese exporters appears to have dropped as 
some companies that traditionally exhibit have stayed away as part 
of the countrys economic austerity program that began last year 
fair officials claim that transactions in the first five days 
were 800 million up 146 percent from the same period of the 
spring gathering however it is not clear whether all of those 
were negotiated after the june crackdown 
a hong kong garment merchant claimed that the entire fair is 
just a show deals are negotiated beforehand they traders just 
go there to sign the contract so that the chinese side can have a 
figure to give to the government 
the canton trade fair began in 1957 when communist china had 
frosty relations with the western world it was the only event 
organized by china for western businessmen to shop for chinese 
goods 
in the past decade china has opened its doors to the west under 
leader deng xiaopings modernization program western businessmen 
have been allowed to negotiate directly with chinese enterprises 
and to set up offices in china diminishing the importance of the 
fair 
some of the foreign merchants at the fair said business must go 
on despite the crackdown on dissent 
trade is trade the government can do anything it is not my 
business said japanese businessman zigumi onodera who has 
traded with china for 13 years 
although his sales of chemical materials to china have declined 
30 percent compared to a year ago because of the countrys foreign 
exchange shortage onodera said he planned to attend the fair every 
day 
china is the worlds biggest market he said

thousands of illegal aliens who fled civil 
strife in el salvador nicaragua and china could be given haven in 
the united states for three years under an immigration package 
approved by the house 
the measure designed to protect as many as 750000 exiles from 
deportation was approved 258162 on wednesday and goes to the 
senate 
these are people who need our help and we are in a position to 
help them rep joe moakley dmass said in urging support 
the bill would suspend for three years deportation of illegal 
aliens who fled el salvador nicaragua and china if they were in 
the united states when the measure went into effect and if they 
registered within nine months 
it also would establish a system for extending temporary status 
to citizens of additional countries beset by armed conflict and 
natural disaster 
approval came despite warnings from opponents that it would 
encourage jobhungry central americans to come north in the guise 
of political exiles 
it isnt right to say to american workers that we are going to 
take your job away from you and give it to people who came here to 
take your job away from you in the first place said rep bob 
walker rpa 
moakley noted that the measure has support from the aflcio and 
a number of large labor unions 
proponents said 70000 salvadorans and 30000 nicaraguan 
civilians have been killed by civil war over the last decade and 
that 10000 democracy demonstrators have been jailed in china 
i think its in our interest to have nicaraguans and 
salvadorans living in the open rather than maintaining an 
underground existence rep hamilton fish rny told the house 
however rep helen bentley rmd cited estimates that the 
price of operating the program could reach 260 million over two 
years 
i can tell you that my constituents will not abide by it

people in france the classic home of fine 
wines are developing a taste for american vintages the department 
of agriculture says 
this country shipped 72400 gallons of wine to france last year 
five times as much as in 1985 one reason for the increase is the 
fall in the price of the dollar which makes american wines cheaper 
in france than they used to be 
there are other reasons too according to holly s higgins who 
recently finished an assignment as us agricultural attache in 
paris 
press articles and tastings featuring us wines are 
popular she wrote in the october issue of the departments 
monthly agexporter 
the food and drink press has focused on quality the high 
level of technology used in producing us wines and the fact that 
the united states has an excellent selection of regional wine such 
as california washington new york virginia and texas 
despite the enthusiasm of french consumers the french 
government still worries about us wineries using such traditional 
french names as chablis champagne and burgundy she said the 
french consider that these geographical names belong to them 
the us government has agreed not to export wines with such 
labels to france or the other 11 countries in the european economic 
community but the ban does not extend to american shipments to 
other markets such as latin america or the far east 
steve burns international marketing manager for the wine 
institute said he saw no difficulty about the ban 
wed rather label our wines by the variety of grape 
chardonnay or cabernet or pinot noir he said in an interview 
its easier for people in a hurry they dont have to worry 
about whether the burgundy theyre looking at is the right year to 
go with the kind of meal theyre having theres enough mystery in 
wine already were trying to make it more of an everyday affair 
he said sales in france from california where most american 
wine is produced were up 185 percent last year 
according to ms higgins figures the french favor american 
reds and what the french call rose or pink wines now sometimes 
called blush wines in this country there was a drop last year 
in sales to france of american white wines which many americans 
favor over reds 
the total value of us wine sales to france is still small 
12 million last year france bought 182 million worth from italy 
and 95 million worth from portugal much of it to mix with french 
wines under french labels but in 1985 the total value of us wine 
sales to france was only 155000 
prospects for greater us sales in the french market are 
bright ms higgins wrote us exporters can expect the french 
market to expand in the future as us wines gain acceptance and 
find their niche in the marketplace

most federal inspectors who check airline 
pilots arent qualified to fly and many who monitor airliner safety 
are undertrained a congressional study found 
airlines may be fined or denied certificates to fly if their 
pilots fail to update their training but the federal aviation 
administration often waives the training requirements for its own 
inspectors the general accounting office report said 
the study released wednesday by the congressional investigative 
agency said only 291 of 786 or 37 percent of faa inspectors who 
made pilot flight checks in the last half of 1988 had uptodate 
flying credentials 
federal rules require that both pilots and flight inspectors 
undergo semiannual flight training to operate airliners 
the report requested by the house committee on public works and 
transportations aviation subcommittee said faa airworthiness 
inspectors took only about half the training classes for which they 
were scheduled in fiscal 1988 because so many were canceled 
inspectors accompany pilots on flights to determine their 
ability to operate assigned aircraft while airworthiness 
inspectors check airliners to see if they are fit to fly 
faa inspectors are not receiving the training that faas 
managers say they need to effectively perform their assigned 
jobs the report said although faa has several initiatives 
under way further improvements are needed in the aviation safety 
inspector training program 
the study praised a program in the faas southwest region to 
reassign flight inspectors so that training needs were reduced and 
said it should be adopted agencywide 
many inspectors are trained for planes they rarely see while 
others are assigned to planes they arent qualified to fly the 
report said recommending the faa order a reevaluation of the 
roles and responsibilities of flight inspectors 
the report said faa officials contacted for the study generally 
agreed with its findings and recommendations 
the study said that although student enrollment at the 
governments academy for airworthiness inspectors had increased 
from 2968 in 1984 to 4322 in 1988 the number of instructors had 
fallen from 82 to 77 
that has resulted in several classes being canceled and the 
inability to develop classes to detail new aviation technology it 
said

two members of congress want to visit lebanon 
to win support for a proposal to end the countrys 14year civil 
war but the state department is worried about their safety 
reps mary rose oakar dohio and nick rahall dwva want to 
meet with gen michel aoun the leader of lebanons predominantly 
christian army who has rejected the peace plan according to 
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
however the state department has banned most travel by 
americans to lebanon because the situation is so dangerous that 
no us citizen can be considered safe from terrorist acts 
eight americans are being held hostage by proiranian radicals 
rahalls office said it could neither confirm nor deny it for 
security reasons a spokesman for ms oakar jim belles said he 
could not obtain information about her plans 
ms oakar who like rahall is of lebanese descent tried to 
visit lebanon in august but sources said the state department 
advised her to cancel the trip 
us passports are invalid for travel to lebanon unless special 
permission is obtained violation of the ban can be punishable by 
imprisonment or a fine 
the us embassy was evacuated last month after aoun made veiled 
threats to take american hostages to draw attention to his fight 
for expulsion of 40000 syrian troops 
we dont oppose their talking to him aoun but we cant 
offer any support or help if they get in trouble said one 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
meanwhile the white house ruled out pressuring aoun to accept 
the plan 
thats an internal matter for lebanon and the various 
factions there to deal with said presidential spokesman marlin 
fitzwater 
the plan adopted by christian and moslem legislators in 
closeddoor meetings in saudi arabia would shift political control 
from the christian minority to the moslem majority 
aoun called on lebanese lawmakers to reject the plan when it 
comes up for a vote next month

the house ethics committee is being asked once 
more to investigate allegations against republican whip newt 
gingrich 
rep bill alexander dark filed additional ethics charges 
wednesday alleging the georgia congressman violated campaign 
finance and financial disclosure statutes 
alexander said his new charges with 670 pages of supporting 
documents should motivate the panel to open an official 
preliminary investigation 
an independent law firm hired by the committee to look into 
earlier charges against gingrich reported last week that it had 
found no reason to proceed with such an inquiry suggesting that 
the panel might be ready to drop the ethics case 
the committee is tentatively scheduled to meet tuesday 
but some on the committee formally called the committee on 
standards of official conduct say they are bothered by that 
recommendation and believe an easier standard is being applied to 
gingrich than was applied to house speaker jim wright dtexas 
wright resigned may 31 after a long ethics probe that began when 
gingrich filed a complaint 
rich galen a gingrich spokesman called the new charges part of 
a personal vendetta by alexander 
among alexanders new charges 
gingrich funneled 12000 worth of advertising and 20000 in 
contributions to the 1986 reelection campaign of sen mack 
mattingly rga but failed to report the gifts as required by 
federal election law 
a commercial travel agency in florida marathon travel used 
letters from gingrich on official congressional letterhead to 
solicit business use of a lawmakers official position to promote 
commercial ventures is against house rules 
gingrich sought to influence federal agencies to help a georgia 
businessman who was a member of a partnership formed in 1977 to 
underwrite a gingrich bookwriting effort the businessman chester 
roush jr reportedly received 12 million in federal subsidies 
since gingrich was elected in 1978 
gingrich failed to report the purchase of a house with his 
daughter as required on annual financial disclosure forms the 
house was bought from a longtime political supporter of gingrich 
alexander said 
a political action committee gingrich chairs conservatives for 
hope and opportunity raised more than 217000 to support 
conservative candidates but donated only 900 to campaigns the 
rest was spent on gingrichs travel and expenses the complaint 
charged making the solicitation for money a prohibited scheme 
under the law

if the vote had been left only to its women 
members the house would have had the twothirds majority to 
override president bushs veto of expanded medicaid abortion 
coverage to cases of rape and incest 
eighteen of the 27 women members voted to override eight voted 
to sustain and one didnt vote 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo a prochoice advocate said 
she thinks women better understand the problem 
this is a crime that only impacts on women she said after 
the 231191 vote that failed to achieve the twothirds majority 
needed to override the veto 
bush said he vetoed the massive bill that sets the budget for 
the departments of labor education and health and human services 
because he opposes spending federal funds on abortions for women 
who have been raped or are the victims of incest 
they dont get it for the men its all hypothetical 
schroeder said although she conceded that many men are sympathetic 
to the problem 
rep george miller dcalif implored members to override the 
veto in an impassioned speech describing the affects of rape and 
incest on women and girls 
the issue has clearly been drawn that this is about the rights 
of women miller said 
tamar raphael of the feminist majority noted the bipartisan 
nature of the womens vote in favor of overriding 
the first thing this says to us is that we need more women 
casting votes said raphael whose organization is devoted to 
increasing the number of women in politics and all aspects of 
professional life women make up 6 percent of the house membership 
eight of the 12 republican women members or 666 percent voted 
against bushs veto as did 10 of the 14 democratic women present 
or 71 percent 
rep marcy kaptur dohio didnt vote because she was attending 
an outoftown funeral 
raphael said abortion would not be an issue if congress were 50 
percent women 
the reason we were so successful in florida was because women 
were chairing the committees raphael said 
the florida legislature recently refused to accept greater 
restrictions on abortion as proposed by the governor the proposals 
were blocked in committee and never reached the floor 
raphael said the pennsylvania legislature which tightened 
abortion restrictions this week has fewer women members than all 
but five other states

farmers who planted crops to replace those 
damaged or destroyed by drought this year would get increased 
federal disaster aid under legislation approved by the senate 
the bill represents a boon to farmers who say agriculture 
department restrictions are too stringent and fail to take into 
account the expense involved in producing replacement crops this 
year 
it goes to the house after winning senate approval on a voice 
vote wednesday 
the agriculture department imposed the restrictions with an eye 
to preventing farmers from collecting disaster payments for crop 
damage and then keeping the entire amount while producing a new 
crop on the same acreage in the same growing season 
the idea is that the disaster payments are designed to offset 
losses and should not go to farmers whose losses were reduced or 
even erased through production of a second crop 
but the senate has been more sympathetic to growers who say the 
departments restrictions were unrealistically tightfisted 
this should more accurately reflect the expenses and income of 
the farmer sen lloyd bentsen dtexas said in a statement 
in addition it will protect the many farmers who are making 
little if any profit on that second crop from losing the disaster 
payments which they were expecting on the first crop 
the bill earlier was one of many provisions for special 
interests included in a major deficitreduction measure but it 
became a casualty when lawmakers removed all such features from the 
deficit reduction plan 
the agriculture department has been planning to deduct 75 
percent of the gross value of any replacement crop from such a 
farmers disaster aid check 
the bill would modify the system considerably 
in figuring the value of the replacement crop the department 
would first deduct 50 percent of the county average yield for the 
second crop 
the initial plan would require even farmers who had replanted 
only a few acres to wait until harvesting their second crop before 
obtaining disaster benefits for damage to the first crop 
that would be canceled under the legislation 
meanwhile the senate also approved on a voice vote and sent to 
the house a bill that would allow the agriculture department to 
allow oat producers to plant their entire base acreage and still 
remain in the farm program 
the department requires them as a condition of being in the 
program to refrain from planting on a portion of the historical 
acreage base they use for oats 
the provision was contained in a bill with features designed to 
aid an array of farm interests 
the measure also would earmark 14 million this fiscal year 
93 million next year and 46 million the year after to boost 
us beef exports the payments would be in cash or commodities 
under the export enhancement program a major sources of subsidies 
to stimulate overseas shipments over the last five years 
the measure also contained technical changes in programs 
operated by the department for egg producers peanut growers and 
research into new commercial products derived from plant materials

debbie newhalls address has not changed 
but the location of her mountain home has and the killer 
earthquake to blame may have even more fury to unleash 
landslides that already have consumed 100 homes and damaged more 
than 300 now threaten hundreds more in the santa cruz mountains 
just a few miles from the epicenter of the oct 17 quake 
im afraid this whole area is going to go said mrs 
newhall whose damaged home sits on the edge of a hill the house 
moved a couple of inches during the quake cracking its foundation 
posts separating floors from walls and destroying the fireplace 
i sit here at night and listen to rain pouring down you hear 
things falling from the trees a big stick will come down and hit 
the roof youre wondering if thatll be the straw that pushes the 
house down the hill she said 
the aftershocks more than 4000 carry a different kind of 
worry we sleep with one kid under one arm and one under another 
so we can jump up and run out the door she said 
geologists worry that heavy winter rains falling into huge gaps 
in the earth created by the quake could cause landslides 
the big concern is if its going to rain how much and how 
fast said gary griggs a university of california santa cruz 
geologist 
if we have a wet winter theres a potential for a lot of 
slides wilson scaling chief of the federal soil conservation 
service said wednesday after touring the area by helicopter 
i feel very sorry for these folks theyre kind of sitting on 
a powder keg the potential is there for something else but 
hopefully that wont occur 
but earthquakes and the threat of landslides wont drive some 
people away from the forests of redwood oak and pine that rest 
high above the scenic coastal section 
if you want the beauty of california you have to suffer 
earthquakes said kieran reid as he replaced damaged beams under 
his house people in the flatland they got the shock too 
others have surrendered i want to get to lower ground said 
renter carol mccabe 
mrs mccabe said shes still jittery from the quake i cant 
spend 15 minutes in the house its a wonderful place to be but i 
just cant go back 
seventeenyear resident beverly bires the victim of a house 
fire a year ago said shes packing up and leaving for oregon 
what part of me the fire didnt scare off the earthquake did 
you stay and stay and stay after tuesday i said its over

larger home loans backed by the federal 
housing administration would be available in many of the nations 
most expensive housing markets under legislation passed by the 
house 
by voice vote wednesday lawmakers agreed to raise the 101250 
limit on the size of mortgages the fha can insure to 124875 
supporters said the higher ceiling would help people buy 
costlier homes while opponents argued it would expose the 
government to steeper losses if the borrowers default 
the median price of homes already exceeds 101250 in 18 states 
and washington dc the national association of home builders 
says 
jane demarines spokeswoman for the mortgage bankers 
association estimated 100000 new home loans could be made in 76 
cities under the bill 
the 67 billion housing development veterans and space program 
bill containing the loan cap returns to the senate which approved 
the fha language last month and is expected to do so again 
the legislation also contains money to finance a new jersey arts 
center a michigan library and 39 other pet projects that lawmakers 
voted to retain despite opponents arguments that the distribution 
of the money smacks of favoritism 
opponents complained that the projects worth 284 million 
were largely spread among the congressional districts of members of 
the house appropriations committee which produced the legislation 
they said that none had been approved by the department of 
housing and urban development from whose coffers the money would 
come but opponents lost an attempt to strip the projects from a 
housing and development bill on a 250170 vote 
the money for the 41 pet projects would come from a fund the 
secretary of housing uses to distribute money at his discretion for 
community development programs included in the legislation was 
12 million for a newark nj performing arts center 180000 
for a bridge in leake county miss and 390000 for a library and 
recreation center in mackinac island mich 
opponents compared the method of the projects selection to 
former hud officials accused of awarding funds to proposals backed 
by political cronies 
the only thing the projects have in common is they either have 
someone on the committee or someone to ask for it said rep 
steve bartlett rtexas who led the effort to strip the funds 
supporters said congress had as much right as administration 
officials to decide how funds are spent accusing opponents of sour 
grapes 
i guess what this proves is if a project is in your district 
its a vitally needed project said rep william green rny 
if its in a neighbors district its pork 
the overall bill a compromise between previous house and senate 
versions was approved 36353 tuesday in the first day of debate on 
the measure under special rules disputed provisions were 
considered after the rest of the legislation was approved 
the bill provides 124 billion for nasa including 18 billion 
for the planned space station it also makes available 56 billion 
for the environmental protection agency 114 billion for 
veterans medical care and 151 billion for housing programs

transportation officials at home and abroad 
are watching plans for a 15mile stretch of road in congested 
northern virginia that the builder says will be the first private 
us toll road in 30 years 
i love a traffic jam said ralph l stanley former chief of 
the federal urban mass transportation administration and president 
of the toll road corp of virginia theyre all customers to me 
the 155 million road would extend the existing dulles toll 
road adding a third eastwest route from the leesburg area to the 
nations capital stanley said 
this idea needs a tirekicking example said stanley 
virginia to me is a case study of what is happening in a lot of 
other states its happening all over the world its just a matter 
of time 
as proposed the toll would be 8 to 10 cents a mile or about 
150 for commuters who travel the entire route it would be 
eliminated once they had paid for the road he said thats the 
advantage to it he said the toll would be temporary 
the state corporation commission must approve the plan stanley 
said he hoped to hear by nov 30 
stanley said the road could be finished by the end of 1991 15 
months sooner than the state has said it could complete the route 
thats because as a private company toll road corp would not have 
to hold bond referendums or open work to competitive bidding 
another advantage to construction handled by a private company 
as opposed to the state is ease in acquiring land stanley said 
most of the land needed is being donated by property owners who see 
the need for such a road he said 
supporters say allowing a private company to build the road also 
would mean the state could spend its money on other needed projects 
people dont care who builds it stanley said the 
virginia department of transportation doesnt build roads they 
hire the same guys were hiring to build roads 
state transportation officials acknowledged that the company 
could build the road faster and at a lower initial cost but said 
the road would cost more in the long run because the company must 
pay higher interest rates than the state 
ray pethtel the departments commissioner said overwhelming 
public support for the private road outweighed such concerns 
the virginia general assembly passed legislation in 1988 
allowing private companies to finance and build roads 
great britain and mexico have passed similar laws as has 
california which is now faced with rebuilding roads damaged from 
last weeks earthquake a bill also has passed in the illinois 
senate louisiana and florida also are considering such bills 
stanley said 
we just dont have the transportation dollars to meet the 
transportation needs in the state said tracey weatherby 
spokeswoman for the california department of transportation 
transportation planners arent the only ones keeping an eye on 
the proposal 
we needed it yesterday said brian carroll who commutes 42 
miles from leesburg to washington every day 
even though carroll is in a van pool it takes him 90 minutes 
during rush hour 
its pretty much a nightmare he said it takes a long 
time for that many miles the roads have not kept up with the 
growth in that area 
stanley said he has been approached by officials in other states 
to build private roads but for now he is looking for more projects 
in virginia such as repairing some of the 2500 bridges identified 
by the department of transportation as structurally deficient 
you can postpone a new road he said you cant postpone a 
defective bridge 
stanley anticipates no problems with tolls i personally 
believe people will pay tolls if its a direct user fee said 
stanley

president bushs unwillingness to take a 
strong lead in developing a us highdefinition television 
industry is hurting americas ability to compete overseas hdtv 
proponents say 
more than 100 business leaders members of congress and 
technical experts wrote to bush on wednesday to say they were 
deeply disturbed that the united states is failing to match 
japanese and european efforts on hdtv according to the 
congressional hdtv caucus 
the caucus said that among those signing the letter were john 
mitchell chairman of motorola corp robert noyce head of the 
sematech computerchip consortium jerry pearlman chief executive 
officer of zenith corp which has proposed a us hdtv 
transmission system and mitchell kertzman chairman of the 
american electronics association which has urged the government to 
commit 135 billion in matching funds over five years to spur hdtv 
development 
more than 25 members of congress signed the letter the caucus 
said 
hdtv proponents say the new technology which promises motion 
picturesharp images and compact discquality sound could be the 
technology driver that could revitalize the us electronics 
industry and have important applications in medicine defense and 
other industries 
but a congressional budget office report in august said hdtv 
claims were very optimistic and that even under the rosiest of 
scenarios hdtv sales will be small relative to other electronic 
equipment markets 
the house has appropriated 50 million development money for 
next year and the defense advanced projects agency is providing 
30 million in seed money for defenserelated hdtv equipment 
but the bush administration otherwise has shown little 
inclination to push hdtv development 
rep mel levine dcalif cochair of the caucus said 
wednesday that the bush administrations unwillingness to take a 
strong lead on hdtv seriously handicaps this nations ability to 
compete internationally 
while the japanese and europeans outpace our technology 
efforts daily the administration sits on the sidelines waiting for 
an economic miracle to revitalize our industrial base he said 
we need an hdtv initiative today not promises of a broader 
technology program tomorrow 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher told congress earlier this 
year that developing a policy on hdtv was among the 
administrations highest priorities although the government didnt 
plan to play uncle sugar to american industry 
but commerce officials last month said that outlook had changed 
and the administration now was looking at hdtv only as part of a 
broadbased effort to boost us technological competitiveness 
congressional sources said then that mosbacher was slapped down 
by the white house for making statements that smacked of the 
industrial policy that had been advocated by bushs democratic 
opponent michael dukakis in the 1988 presidential campaign

in an effort to regain public acceptance 
the government is disbanding units of the widely despised secret 
police reducing eavesdropping and focusing police resources on 
fighting crime commanders say 
many of the opposition activists the secret police had long made 
a practice of watching and harassing under oneparty communist rule 
became lawmakers and cabinet ministers this year 
six undercover departments are being disbanded there will be 
less bugging and units that inspected foreign mail and monitored 
foreign radio broadcasts will be dissolved police officials told a 
news conference 
the interior ministry is going to strive for public acceptance 
and prestige said wojciech garstka spokesman for the interior 
ministry which is in charge of the police 
garstka was joined by the deputy chiefs of the regular and 
secret police for the unusual news conference wednesday 
he characterized the changes being made in the countrys police 
as perhaps the deepest in postwar history 
despite solidaritys leading role in the new government the 
interior ministry is still run by the gen czeslaw kiszczak a 
longtime communist and confidant of president wojciech jaruzelski 
jerzy karpacz deputy chief of the secret police said the 
officers not only fully accept these changes but are aware that 
the changes are irreversible if any are found with a different 
view they will have to leave the force 
the secret police long symbolized communist control by fear 
they are bitterly remembered as the executors of stalinist purges 
as infiltrators of opposition groups and as thugs who roughed up 
activists 
three rogue officers and their commander from the socalled 
fourth department which spied on the church were convicted of 
the 1984 kidnapping and murder of rev jerzy popieluszko a 
charismatic solidarity priest 
the fourth department and five other units including those 
responsible for surveillance of citizens loyalty and protection of 
the agricultural manufacturing and arms industries have been 
liquidated garstka announced 
despite the changes three new secret police units will be 
formed he said one will guard against political extremists and 
terrorists who do not want to become legal under new freedoms 
another will safeguard the economy against espionage and 
disruption and a third will analyze security information and 
develop new methods especially for crime prevention he said 
also counterintelligence efforts will be strengthened he said 
more emphasis will be put on protecting public safety and 
property garstka said and some secret police officers will be 
transferred to help combat what he said was an alarming rise in 
thefts and burglaries 
there are now about 1250 crimes per 100000 people annually 
which garstka said is relatively low by western standards but more 
car breakins and other crimes are being reported as the economic 
situation worsens and the gap between rich and poor widens 
there are many vacancies in the police because of low pay and 
low prestige said zbigniew nowicki deputy commander of the 
regular police force he said that in some warsaw precincts 59 
percent of the positions are vacant 
the 12500strong zomo riot police disbanded in a highly 
symbolic move sept 29 will be replaced by prevention squads 
of 5177 officers in 22 of the 49 provinces garstka said they 
will be supplemented by 13000 men serving in the police as an 
alternative to mandatory military duty 
karpacz denied there was a special police unit to monitor 
foreign journalists but he would not answer directly whether 
western reporters offices and homes were bugged 
garstka said the interior ministry is prepared to provide all 
materials requested by a special parliament commission 
investigating accusations that security forces are responsible for 
more than 90 deaths 
however he said an internal investigation did not find any 
role of the security service in these deaths

theyre everywhere in california 
ominous signs warning consumers of some dangerous chemical that 
could spread the plagues of cancer or birth defects 
warning detectable amounts of chemicals known to the state to 
cause cancer birth defects or other reproductive harm may be found 
in and around this facility 
these ubiquitous warnings were required by proposition 65 the 
environmentalistbacked ballot initiative approved three years ago 
industry groups say because the signs are so widespread they 
become meaningless or can create ignorant chemophobia 
but environmentalists counter that people have the right to know 
what is in the products they buy around their neighborhoods and on 
their job site 
consumers randomly approached while shopping generally say 
that although they dont always pay attention to the signs theyre 
glad the information is there 
i think its a good idea said charles perry shopping 
recently in a downtown fresno drugstore a lot of people buy 
things just because people tell them its good without reading 
whats in it its best you read for yourself and see whats in a 
product 
proposition 65 required the governor to issue a list of 
chemicals that cause cancer or reproductive harm one year after a 
chemical goes on the list businesses must give anyone exposed to 
the chemical clear and reasonable warning 
the list now has 307 chemicals and compounds the state is 
required to add chemicals to the list as new information arises 
gov george deukmejian created an advisory panel to review 
chemicals and recommend them for the list at least annually 
because the initiative did not specify how companies should warn 
people the state health and welfare agency issued regulations in 
february 1988 that said warnings could consist of labels on 
products signs in stores or menus of restaurants it also called 
for a system of signs public advertising identifying the system 
and tollfree information services 
the regulations exempt food drug cosmetic and medicaldevice 
products regulated under state and federal safety laws 
consequently consumers have not found warning labels on the 
thousands of individual products in grocery stores hardward stores 
and other businesses instead most stores have a general warning 
near the door covering their entire products 
grocery manufacturers association spokesman jeffrey nedelman 
said the warnings have little if any effect on consumers he said 
warnings on alcohol have not stopped people from drinking 
his organization released a report a year ago by the hudson 
institute a policy research firm in indianapolis that concluded 
the proposition 65 warnings will not provide consumers with 
relevant or usable information about carcinogens and reproductive 
toxins 
the report said if food products are labeled individually 
consumers confusion may well undermine confidence in the federal 
regulatory process and create havoc in the marketplace 
scientists for the toxics awareness project of the california 
business roundtable say proposition 65 had contributed to emotional 
talk about toxics that isnt always scientifically based 
people are scared frightened mainly because they do not 
understand what makes chemicals harmful said alice ottoboni a 
retired toxicologist for the state and a member of the project 
most people think if a chemical is toxic in a small amount it is 
toxic in every amount 
labeling without informed labeling i dont think informs the 
public says allen verstuyft of chevron research co just to 
tell somebody a chemical is there without education is 
meaningless 
paul van dyke of campaign california one of the environmental 
groups backing proposition 65 said some people wont read 
anything no matter how its presented but others are information 
seekers he said 
these are people who need information and have a right to 
it he said weve never seen a proliferation of warnings as 
being particularly dangerous we would rather see that left to the 
individual and not have regulators censor information 
pedro mayor of los angeles shopping recently at a supermarket 
in glendale said his buying habits have changed since proposition 
65 if i buy grapes or apples now i make sure they are clean 
that they dont have pesticides he said 
mayor said he has also noticed benefits from proposition 65 at 
hughes aircraft where he works they have a lot of warnings 
they post them all over we use a lot of chemical coatings in 
aerospace he said

most american homes have smoke detectors but 
as many as half of them are useless because the batteries are old 
missing or have been ripped out by residents who cant stand the 
noise fire officials say 
the number of homes in the united states that have detectors has 
increased during the last decade from 22 percent to 80 percent 
the problem is we also estimate that probably as much as 
50 percent of those detectors dont work said jim estepp 
president of the international association of fire chiefs 
sometimes it gets very discouraging we have the worst fire 
loss record of any country in the industrialized world 
the organization is pushing a national fire safety awareness 
campaign called change your clock change your battery asking 
people to make a habit of changing smoke detector batteries when 
they change clocks from daylightsaving time each year 
daylightsaving time ends at 2 am sunday 
the simple act of changing the batteries in smoke detectors is 
the single most easy and accessible way of making a difference in 
the number of deaths and injuries caused by fire said estepp 
who is also chief of the prince georges county md fire 
department 
about 1500 departments across the country will join in the 
batterychanging campaign this weekend 
according to figures compiled by the organization more than 
500000 residential fires occur in the united states each year 
killing nearly 6000 people and causing serious injuries for 
130000 
estepp said the number of firerelated deaths went down as smoke 
detectors took hold in the united states in the early 1980s but in 
recent years the number of deaths leveled off and actually 
increased in 1988 
fire officials attribute the trend in large part to smoke alarm 
neglect 
estepp recalled a house fire in his own jurisdiction this year 
in which a 16yearold boy died in a fire that started when his 
twin brother fell asleep after putting grease on the stove to cook 
french fries 
they had taken the smoke detectors down to replace the 
batteries and never put them back up estepp said you can 
repeat that scenario just about every day 
this week after a st louis woman and her son died in a house 
fire relatives told authorities she had disconnected the smoke 
alarm because of the chirping noise it made as the batteries wore 
down

sen alfonse damato says he was merely 
passing on his concern for the prosecutors office when he 
approached us attorney rudolph giuliani in 1984 and 1985 on 
behalf of people representing two organized crime figures 
i didnt intercede i never interceded damato rny 
said in a telephone interview wednesday i just passed on a 
concern i never asked giuliani to do anything as it related to 
any matter never and he says that 
damato was responding to a report in the village voice that he 
had called giuliani in 1984 to support a sentence reduction for 
jailed mobster mario gigante 
months later the voice said damato asked giuliani to review 
minor charges against paul castellano an alleged gambino crime 
family boss who was later murdered 
but damato said he never mentioned a specific case in the 
latter conversation and that he was was only passing on the remark 
of a lawyer who said he had information that might be 
embarrassing to giulianis office 
asked who the lawyer was damato said i believe i believe 
it was roy cohn 
cohn who died in 1986 won notoriety in the 1950s as the grand 
inquisitor of sen joseph mccarthys communisthunting committee 
later in private practice cohn represented a number of organized 
crime figures including castellano 
giuliani who resigned as us attorney to run for mayor in new 
york city said wednesday that castellanos name never came up in 
the conversation with damato 
nobody was ever identified he said damato talked 
about murder counts being that a lawyer was concerned that the 
us attorneys office would lose the case because although the 
person was guilty of the other things the murder counts would not 
be substantiated 
giuliani told the new york daily news he had concluded damato 
was referring to the castellano case he also said he told damato 
this was not the way to communicate information to me

israel at odds with washington over a plo role 
in peace talks has issued a report claiming yasser arafats 
faction ordered 12 attacks on israeli civilians since the plo chief 
disavowed terrorism in december 
groups affiliated with the palestine liberation organization 
carried out 18 infiltrations or rocket attacks across israels 
borders in the same period the report said 
yigal carmon prime minister yitzhak shamirs antiterror 
adviser prepared the report and provided a copy to the associated 
press on wednesday 
in his report carmon said the attacks are a violation of the 
commitment arafat gave to the united states and shows he cant be 
trusted and that you cant do business with him 
he urged the united states to suspend the dialogue temporarily 
until arafat keeps his commitments 
the report comes as israel and the united states haggle over 
peace moves especially the possible involvement of the plo in 
talks 
israel defines the plo as a terrorist organization and refuses 
to deal with it it has strongly objected to the us dialogue with 
the plo which began 10 months ago when arafat renounced terrorism 
and said he recognized israel 
the israeli report noted that thomas pickering then the us 
ambassador gave israel a pledge a day after the usplo talks 
began dec 15 in tunis that no american administration can 
sustain the dialogue if terrorism continues by the plo or any of 
its factions 
washington told israel it expected the plo to condemn any act of 
terror and to discipline the guerrillas responsible carmons 
report said and added 
not only has the plo failed to fulfill these requirements but 
arafats own fatah organization in particular has itself engaged in 
terrorist acts and it has furthermore encouraged and lauded 
these attacks even in the midst of these talks 
carmons report said security agents uncovered a 10member cell 
in april based near jenin in the west bank whose members were 
recruited by the force 17 unit of fatah arafats guerrilla wing 
in amman jordan in 198788 and ordered to carry out attacks in 
israel 
it blamed the cell for firebombings of two cars in northern 
israel and a hand grenade attack on a commuter bus in february and 
march 1989 none of which caused casualties 
the report said a second group linked to force 17 an elite unit 
led by mahmoud al natur an arafat aide known as abu tayyib was 
blamed for seven bombings in the tel avivpetah tikva area from 
march through june another explosion in the west bank wounded a 
bomber 
two other bombings were attributed to an operation called 
western sector which the report said was under arafats personal 
command one wounded a jewish cemetery worker 
sources said one reason us officials remain unconvinced by 
israeli claims of fatah involvement is that they are based on 
interrogations the credibility of such information was diminished 
after a 1987 investigation revealed the use of torture by the shin 
bet security service 
carmon said plo factions under arafats umbrella were 
responsible for nine attacks across the border in the past 10 
months many aimed at settlements near lebanon in which no 
civilian casualties were reported he said the other raids were by 
prosyrian groups opposed to arafat 
between dec 15 and oct 1 the report said 99 alleged arab 
collaborators were killed by strike committees directed by the 
plos unified command in the occupied lands 
israeli security sources said wednesday they had found a 
twopage handwritten letter from a fatah official ordering a gaza 
strip activist to carry out assassinations it was dated aug 18 
and signed halim a code name used by a force 17 official in 
amman they said 
the activist identified as hamdi sheik khalil was arrested 
sept 19 his lawyer said no formal charges had been filed 
according to the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the letter ordered the killings to be done in the name of the 
revolutionary eagles in order to disguise plo involvement the 
group has claimed responsibility for killing kamal wahidi a senior 
gaza city official suspected of collaborating with israel

critic and novelist mary mccarthy whose ice 
clear observations of politics and literature placed her among 
americas literary giants has died she was 77 
miss mccarthy died of cancer wednesday at new york hospital 
said dixie sheridan spokeswoman for the authors alma mater 
vassar college in poughkeepsie 
called our first lady of letters by norman mailer miss 
mccarthy first made her mark among the brawling new york 
intellectuals of the 1930s writing scathing literary and 
theatrical reviews for the nation and partisan review 
she reached a wider audience in 1963 with her spicy bestselling 
novel the group chronicling the lives of eight women who 
graduated from college in the 1930s 
her numerous awards including membership in the american academy 
of arts and letters and the national institute of arts and letters 
two guggenheim fellowships the national medal for literature and 
the horizon prize 
she was the owner of a wholly destructive critical mind 
possessed of an unerring ability to spot the hidden weakness or 
inconsistency in any literary effort and every person said 
writer alfred kazin 
there was a dedication to the art of living as well as to the 
art of writing said essayist elizabeth hardwick a close friend 
i loved her not only as a writer but as a person she was into 
all the things that go into good living making homes and cooking 
and being enormously hospitable and having friendships that lasted 
for decades 
she also was capable of devastating acerbity she provoked a 
celebrated literary feud with lillian hellman by declaring on 
national television everything she writes is a lie including 
and and the 
miss hellman sued for libel but died in 1984 before the suit 
reached a trial which miss mccarthy eagerly had sought 
to the late poet robert lowell miss mccarthy was rash to 
awkwardness blurting ice clear sentences above the mundane 
gossip and still more mundane virtue of her colleagues 
with her keen eye for detail ruthless wit and deep insight 
miss mccarthy for decades was regarded the ultimate highbrow of new 
york radical and intellectual circles 
she wrote about sexual freedom in the 1930s radicalism in the 
40s and 50s vietnam and social and moral upheaval in the 60s 
watergate and terrorism in the 70s she was among the first 
leftists to denounce stalinism in the 1940s and reported on the 
vietnam war from saigon and hanoi for the new york review of books 
miss mccarthy was born in seattle in 1912 to roy and therese 
mccarthy who died within a day of each other during the 1918 flu 
epidemic 
mary and three younger brothers were entrusted to an aunt and 
uncle in minneapolis she later wrote that they dressed them like 
paupers fed them a diet of root vegetables forbade reading and 
taped their mouths shut at night to prevent mouth breathing 
she recounted her sordid childhood in the 1957 memories of a 
catholic girlhood considered a landmark in autobiographical 
writing 
how i grew published in 1987 as a sequel described her 
rescue at age 11 by grandparents who took her to tacoma wash 
she married her first husband harold johnsrud one week after 
graduating from vassar in 1933 the marriage was brief and in 1938 
miss mccarthy married her professor the eminent critic edmund 
wilson they had one son reuel before a bitter divorce in which 
each accused the other of battery her third husband was bowden 
broadwater 
she is survived by her fourth husband james west and her son 
her drama reviews for the partisan review set the kind of 
standards for the theater that you would apply to ts eliot and 
james joyce said steven marcus associate editor of the magazine 
and english professor at columbia university she really treated 
the theater as literature a lousy broadway play she would call a 
lousy broadway play 
she was among the last of the partisan review literati of 
the 1930s and 40s a group that included wilson lowell hannah 
arendt and poet elizabeth bishop all of whom she survived 
marcus said that while her novels were not great works of 
fiction her nonfiction works were brilliant 
they seemed shocking at the time but that wears off and what 
remains in fact is plain honesty genuine honesty he said 
mary mccarthy believed in the facts said thomas mallon 
professor of english at vassar even her fiction was accurate 
right down to the labels on peoples clothes as well as the 
ideology in their heads 
sometimes we winced for her because she did things in a way 
that she wouldnt cut any corners said poet james merrill 
miss mccarthy moved to paris in 1962 and divided her time 
between there and a home in castine maine a private funeral was 
planned in castine for next week

leftist guerrillas stormed two 
northeastern towns then abandoned them leaving at least six people 
dead in colombias worst rebel violence in two years 
the attacks wednesday by the national liberation army a 
procuban guerilla group apparently were unrelated to the 
governments war against drug traffickers now entering its 10th 
week 
the army has claimed for seven years without producing proof 
that some leftist guerrillas and drug traffickers work in tandem 
the government pressed ahead with the drug war wednesday 
notifying an alleged member of the medellin cocaine cartel that he 
was being extradited to the united states and taking steps to 
protect presidential candidates from violence by traffickers 
according to tv hoy the government notified jose rafael abello 
silva 34 of his impending extradition police have said abello is 
the fourth most important figure in the medellin cartel in charge 
of its activities on colombias atlantic coast 
abello also known by his alias the monkey was arrested 
oct 10 in bogota and faces a charge by an oklahoma federal court 
of conspiracy to distribute cocaine 
according to president virgilio barcos extradition decree 
abello has five days to appeal the extradition 
the barco government has extradited four accused drug 
traffickers to the united states since it launched the crackdown in 
midaugust after the assassination of leading presidential 
candidate luis carlos galan 
suspected traffickers have responded to the crackdown with a 
wave of bombings and assassinations 
defense minister oscar botero announced wednesday that the 
discharge of more than 18000 soldiers was being delayed so they 
could provide security for presidential candidates the soldiers 
service had been scheduled to end this month about 80000 
colombians are enlisted in the army 
the soldiers will be used in operations before during and after 
the presidential elections next may botero told reporters his 
comments were broadcast by tv hoy 
the plan reportedly will cost the government more than 7 
million 
about 100 guerrillas invaded the towns of cachira and la vega in 
the state of norte de santander early wednesday the armys 2nd 
division reported 
the heaviest attack by about 60 men and women was at 1 am in 
cachira a town of 15000 people about 250 miles northeast of 
bogota the guerrillas destroyed a police station with mortar 
shells and opened fire on police officers with automatic weapons 
two policemen were killed and another seven injured during five 
hours of fighting in the town an army communique said 
an hour after the assault on cachira began another group of 40 
rebels invaded la vega 15 miles away and tried to overrun the 
police station there two policemen were wounded in the sevenhour 
battle 
one guerrilla died as the attackers fled the town of 5000 
people into the mountains the army communique said 
guerrillas also ambushed police sent to reinforce the 
beleaguered battalion in la vega three officers died in an attack 
along a dirt road outside town 
the rebel attacks were the bloodiest since 1987 when guerrillas 
raided an average of one town a week and more than 50 people were 
killed during one month of fighting 
the national radio chain caracol said two other leftist 
groups the revolutionary armed forces of colombia and the peoples 
liberation army also participated in wednesdays attacks the army 
could not confirm the report 
the national liberation army believed to have 2000 combatants 
was organized in 1960 and bases its doctrine on the teachings of 
cuban president fidel castro 
headed by a defrocked catholic priest manuel perez the group 
is the most active of colombias six guerrilla organizations it 
swore recently it would never negotiate with the government

television projects based on san franciscos 
killer earthquake are already in the works but some producers say 
a tv show about the devastation would be exploitive 
abc and cbs said wednesday they are considering television shows 
about the oct 17 catastrophe the death toll wednesday stood at 
63 and damage estimates have reached 10 billion 
we are in the earliest stages of development of an 
earthquakerelated production abc spokesman bob wright said 
another abc spokesman said the network had already commissioned the 
project with a producer 
craig hoffman a cbs spokesman said people have been 
contacting us to determine the networks interest in doing a 
project but no decision has been made either way 
nbc spokeswoman sue binford said she was unaware of any san 
francisco earthquakeinspired movie in the works at her network 
tv producer david wolper has had some serious discussions 
about making a quake show said auriel sanderson an assistant to 
wolper wolper was out of town and could not be reached for 
comment she said 
irwin allen producer of several disasterrelated movies said 
he is thinking about developing a quake project 
were considering it but we just completed a script for cbs 
on hurricane hugo allen said the earthquake is on the desk 
and were surely thinking of it but the hurricane comes first 
some producers said such a program would not be a good idea 
we are not doing anything on it said lindy dekoben vice 
president of creative affairs for the lansburg co which 
specializes in factbased movies such as quiet victory the 
charlie wedemeyer story and the ryan white story 
we dont find anything redeeming in the story and a movie 
would only exploit the misfortunes of others dekoben said 
marcy gross coowner of gross weston productions makers of i 
love you perfect and the billionaire boys club doubted that 
a television movie based on the earthquake could serve a purpose 
its too soon and too painful gross said i wouldnt want 
to intrude on anybodys tragedy as much as we love to sell 
shows and we like to do anything thats current i think wed be 
intruding on peoples pain 
such a program likely would include the story julio berumen the 
6yearold whose right leg was amputated above the knee when he was 
rescued from the wreckage of interstate 880 in oakland rescuers 
had to cut through his mothers body to reach him 
another likely subject would be buck helm who survived for 90 
hours in the i880 rubble or a firefighter such as gerry shannon 
who grabbed a woman pinned in her blazing marina district apartment 
as a gas leak threatened to set off an explosion

un poll watcher elliot richardson says 
nicaragua is headed for a free fair and honest election 
despite the state departments stated fear that the leftist 
sandinista government will rig the vote 
richardson a former us attorney general is secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellars personal representative for monitoring 
the campaign for nicaraguas feb 25 presidential and national 
assembly elections 
he briefed reporters wednesday before reporting to perez de 
cuellar on his weekend talks in nicaragua with president daniel 
ortega and members of the supreme electoral council which 
interprets the election laws 
the council has been performing in a conscientious fair and 
impartial manner richardson said 
it is certainly my impression and i think that i speak for 
all of us representing the united nations in nicaragua that the 
goal of a free fair and honest election is being taken seriously 
by all those concerned in the government in the parties and 
among the people he said 
on monday us ambassador thomas r pickering said the state 
department fears the ruling sandinistas are trying to rig 
nicaraguas election and cited the reported presence of armed 
soldiers at nicaraguan voter registration centers 
richardsons un team had observers at many polling places 
during the four sundays in october on which voters registered and 
he said i cannot tell you that they did not see any soldiers or 
guards 
however he said no one complained to him about intimidation 
this is not a matter that has been brought to my attention 
the sandinista government reported several attacks on polling 
places over the weekend that it blamed on usbacked contra rebels 
it accused the rebels to whom washington now provides only 
nonlethal aid of trying to disrupt the voting process 
richardson served as attorney general under president richard 
nixon and is remembered for his refusal to fire watergate special 
prosecutor archibald cox on the orders of the white house on oct 
10 1973 
he resigned rather than carry out the order

a day after being sentenced to 72 hours in 
jail zsa zsa gabor ridiculed the judge as needing a blood 
transfusion and derided the prosecutor as enjoying the trials 
circuslike atmosphere more than she did 
during an appearance wednesday night on fox tvs a current 
affair the actress was asked if she were at all repentant for 
slapping beverly hills police officer paul kramer on june 14 
for what she replied that i was beaten half to death by 
a 6foot4 macho policeman because my drivers license had 
expired i was defending myself i think all of beverly hills owes 
me an apology i tried to fight for the battered woman 
a jury convicted miss gabor on sept 29 of misdemeanor charges 
of battery on a police officer driving without a valid drivers 
license and having an open container of alcohol in her car 
the former hungarian beauty queen believed to be at least in 
her mid60s was acquitted of failing to obey an officer 
on tuesday municipal court judge charles rubin ordered her to 
serve the jail time by dec 29 but gave her the option of 
reporting to any jail in los angeles county 
during her confinement the star of such bmovies as picture 
mommy dead and queen of outer space will have to trade in her 
designer gowns for a jailissued cotton shift or pantsuit and will 
forsake her luxurious home for an 8by10foot concrete cell with a 
bed sink and toilet 
although authorities promised no special privileges miss 
gabors celebrity will allow her to be segregated from other 
prisoners 
anytime we have an inmate who is recognizable we separate 
them from the general population for their own safety said 
sheriffs lt joe surgent head of operations for sybil brand 
institute the countys main jail for women people with that 
kind of notoriety can be preyed upon i imagine there are some 
people who dont like zsa zsa gabor 
the judge also ordered miss gabor to pay 1293750 in fines and 
restitution and perform 120 hours of community service in a womens 
homeless shelter 
she also was ordered to be interviewed by a psychiatrist and 
refrain from driving until she gets her real age on her drivers 
license court documents said she was 66 during the trial miss 
gabor claimed the license was stolen and altered by someone else 
maybe i should have my head examined she said on a 
current affair hes right if i tried to fight city hall and 
the beverly hills police a woman should have her head examined 
miss gabor seemed unaffected by rubin chastising her for 
comments made to reporters during the trial about rubin she said 
after he got through with the sentencing he looked like he 
needed a blood transfusion 
as for district attorney ira reiner she said hes not on my 
hit list hes not good enough for my hit list this man is not 
equal to me 
she said both men loved the publicity surrounding the case 
they milked it i dont need it she said im a rich 
woman i dont need these people they needed me

states have made only modest gains toward school 
reform this decade and few are heeding calls to shift more power 
and responsibility to local schools a report says 
the report the progress of reform an appraisal of state 
education initiatives found that only a few states such as 
washington arkansas maine and massachusetts have programs to 
encourage local districts to find creative ways of improving 
classroom instruction 
the study released wednesday concluded that state efforts 
since 1983 when the federal report a nation at risk heralded 
the school reform movement generally have lacked coherence 
it suggested that future items on the reform agenda such as more 
equitable distribution of school funds to poorer districts and 
giving teachers and parents more authority in school governance 
will be dauntingly difficult 
if were going to get those kinds of things people are going 
to have to be willing to stay at it for a long time said william 
a firestone associate professor of education at rutgers 
university and coauthor of the report 
the study was produced by the center for policy research in 
education a consortium of the eagleton institute of politics at 
rutgers michigan state university school of education the 
stanford university school of education and the university of 
wisconsinmadison center for education research 
high school curricula are more academically oriented 
standards for entering the teaching profession are more selective 
teachers salaries are higher and state and local governments have 
boosted educational funding the report said 
but there are still doubts about the rigor and challenge of 
some of the new courses in academic subjects the impact of reform 
on atrisk students the quality of teachers and teaching and the 
equitable funding of schools 
educators have said lately that the current reform movement 
passed through a first wave from 198286 during which states 
tightened teacher certification standards boosted graduation 
requirements and required students to pass more tests and 
demonstrate competency 
since then reformers have spoken of a second wave of 
educational improvements often called restructuring during 
which schools themselves are being given more freedom to innovate 
and teachers and parents are being made more equal partners with 
administrators in school governance 
president bush endorsed many of those second wave ideas at 
last months education summit with the nations governors 
but this latest study suggests that those principles remains 
wishful thinking in most states 
while a few pioneering districts such as rochester ny 
cincinnati and dade county fla have local restructuring 
strategies states are still enacting policies more 
characteristic of the first wave of reform according to the 
report 
states are exhibiting no clear shift in direction from the 
first wave of reform to the second the report said 
its other authors were susan h furhrman professor of policy at 
eagleton and michael w kirst an education professor at stanford

a tablet on a plain narrow cross tucked 
away almost hidden in a corner of a cemetery on warsaws southern 
outskirts bears chilling witness to polands torment during the 
stalinist years 
in mokotowski prison there was a shot in the back of the 
head and then a little horse brought us to sluzew 
the unsigned verse and cross in walbrzyska street cemetery mark 
where an estimated 500 to 3000 political prisoners were buried 
after being executed or tortured to death at mokotowski prison 
during the late 1940s and early 1950s 
the prison is about three miles away from the sluzew burial 
ground 
on a golden autumn day children play and men wash cars only a 
few steps away from the cross in a parking lot where some of the 
victims are thought to lie drab modern housing blocks stretch 
along a small adjacent stream 
only a few curious visitors find their way to the cross to lay 
a flower or say a prayer 
but now four decades later people are beginning to talk openly 
about the midnight burials 40 years ago when sluzew then a tiny 
hamlet seemed a safe place to hide a shameful deed 
and for the first time saturday the still unidentified victims 
will have a funeral mass said for them at nearby st catherines 
church 
the parish priest the rev jozef maj is leading the struggle 
to lay bare the history of the executions and help families whose 
loved ones may lie here 
the victims were from the leading circles of poland the ones 
who might have created centers of social support who might have 
formed an alternative leadership he says of those killed by the 
kremlinimposed communist regime as it waged class war and 
consolidated power in poland after world war ii 
if the new solidarityled coalition government led by prime 
minister tadeusz mazowiecki is to establish its credibility the 
priest said it can start by helping to find out the truth about 
the killings 
indeed the mazowiecki government has shown great interest in 
examining the dark postwar years in poland when the political 
persecution stalin practiced at home also found favor among the men 
ruling eastern european countries under soviet influence 
justice minister aleksander bentkowski this month issued an 
appeal for evidence of stalinistera crimes for his ministry to 
investigate 
a longbanned movie about the period the interrogation is 
now being released in stateowned cinemas and state television 
news this week broadcast majs story of the walbrzyska street 
cemetery 
the cemetery stands as a symbol of the martyrdom of poles 
during the communist terror says malgorzata shejnert of the 
churchsocial committee for homage to the victims of the terror of 
the authorities in the years 194556 
it also symbolizes the indestructability of memory 
the memory of the burials was kept alive by a few older 
residents of the area 
they say victims were brought by night in horsedrawn wagons and 
buried just outside the new cemetery of st catherines on 
walbrzyska street maj said most of the burials took place between 
1945 abnd 1951 but he has heard of one as late as autumn 1956 
according to the local accounts lime was poured on the bodies 
and the ground was afterward leveled 
after two years there was no sign of a grave of a body or 
bones that was the point of this method maj said 
further evidence of the burials came last year when st 
catherines one of the areas oldest churches was cleaning out 
its archives preparing for its 750th anniversary as a parish next 
year 
the archive keeper found letters from majs predecessor canon 
adam wyrebowski who had written to both the ministry of public 
security and the rakowiecka street prison about the burials in 
unhallowed ground 
still more proof comes from poetry such as the verse on the 
narrow cross in sluzew that circulated among prisoners at 
mokotowski prison 
maj says it is believed bodies were buried in what is now the 
back section of the churchs cemetery expanded in 1959 in a 
meadow leading down to the stream where the apartment blocks now 
stand and around the city horserace track a few miles away 
already people are coming to me bringing their reports and 
whatever different documents they possess he said 
maj said he has also heard of such burial sites in rawicz and 
wroclaw provinces and there may be others 
maybe the number of victims and some of their names will be 
established said mrs szejnert said on state tv but even then 
the families will not find any remains and the place where the 
relatives rest will only be known inexactly

officials of the international society for 
traumatic stress studies say a disaster drill planned here for 
today has been canceled 
last weeks earthquake prompted some 500 visiting psychiatrists 
and experts to call off their longplanned experiential program 
where people will be asked to act as victims 
instead a panel of psychiatric and disaster relief experts will 
be host of an open discussion on the reallife emotional 
aftershocks from the oct 17 quake 
yael danieli an israeli psychologist and president of the 
society said northern california is handling the quake in a 
typically american manner pushing ahead and not allowing it 
to get in the the way of things like the world series 
its wonderful how america keeps going but theres a danger 
in just forgetting about the quake said danieli who has done 
extensive research with holocaust survivors its like people 
gave themselves a week to deal with it but never had a chance to 
cry to scream maybe they can blow off some steam at the world 
series

a tanker carrying more than 14 million 
gallons of crude oil was anchored in cook inlet after it being 
turned away from a refinery dock because it lacked a stateapproved 
oil spill contingency plan 
the unocal vessel the sansinena ii was bound for the 
tesoroalaska petroleum co refinery when the state department of 
environmental conservation denied it permission to dock on tuesday 
larry dietrick the departments environmental quality director 
said unocal had been denied a variance that would allow the tanker 
to load or unload in cook inlet 
cook inlet and prince william sound have been the focus of state 
department of environmental conservation review since the march 24 
grounding of the tanker exxon valdez it caused the nations 
largest oil spill with nearly 11 million gallons coating 1000 
miles of shoreline 
unocal had planned for the vessel to unload its cargo at the 
refinery and then pick up cook inlet crude oil before returning to 
california said joe sautner an environmental field officer for 
the state 
state law requires spill contingency plans for any vessel 
carrying more than 420000 gallons of oil and the plans must be 
for specific areas sautner said 
unocal submitted a plan for the tanker late wednesday but it 
had not been reviewed he said state officials have up to 65 days 
to review such plans although unocal referred to plans submitted 
in 1978 and 1984 those could not be found and would have expired 
in three years sautner said 
that plan will probably not get reviewed in time to solve this 
situation in the immediate future he said the reason that we 
cant do it really quickly is that we dont want to put ourselves 
in a position of doing a quick review 
unocal officials in kenai and anchorage could not be reached for 
comment late wednesday 
last week department commissioner dennis kelso announced that 
all tanker owners operators and charterers in prince william sound 
would need to have stateapproved spill response plans by nov 13 
following the valdez grounding the state announced that the 
cook inlet tanker traffic would be reexamined the department said 
it would turn away tankers lacking appropriate spill contingency 
plans

teachers administrators and staffers in two 
school districts called dialaporn called information and called 
collect to the tune of thousands of dollars in telephone misuse 
investigators were told 
its absolutely disgusting people spending their time making 
porn calls and baseball trivia calls declared james f gill 
chairman of a commission investigating political patronage hiring 
and other abuses in new york city schools 
misuse or waste amounted to 13 cents of every dollar spent on 
telephone service in the two largely poor districts in east harlem 
and the bronx the commission said 
their personnel made at least 18000 worth of calls on school 
phones to dialaporn sports horoscope and gab lines amyjane 
rettew a counsel for the commission testified wednesday 
records showed hundreds of calls at 50 cents to 35 each to 
telephone lines like erotic fantasies dirty joke and 
smut she said 
rettew said irregularities leaped off the pages when 
investigators who werent particularly looking for telephone 
misuse saw the telephone bills of the local boards 
about 35000 went down the drain because school personnel 
called information instead of using a telephone directory and 
30000 more was lost in penalties for late payment of telephone 
bills she said 
an additional 6500 was billed as collect or thirdpartycharge 
calls categories frowned upon or forbidden in board of education

in a statement issued later in the day schools acting 
chancellor bernard mecklowitz said he has directed the boards 
business office to arrange for electronic blocks to prevent school

the search for a gunman who killed a pregnant 
woman and shot her husband narrowed down to a chosen few after 
police got a description from the critically injured husband 
meanwhile the couples baby delivered by caesarean section 
several hours after the shooting and eight weeks premature 
struggled for life today 
the citys attention has been riveted on the story of charles 
and carol stuart since the suburban couple was attacked monday 
night by a man who commandeered their car as they left a childbirth 
class at an innercity hospital 
he demanded money and got keys and jewelry but then opened fire 
after demanding stuarts wallet police said 
he shot mrs stuart 33 of reading in the head she died 
shortly after her son christopher was delivered the boy was 
alive at brigham and womens hospital but officials refused to 
further describe his condition 
stuart 29 general manager in a fur store spoke to police 
wednesday night though he was in critical condition with a gunshot 
wound to the abdomen in addition to filling in details of the 
attack he gave an excellent description of his attacker said 
police superintendent joseph v saia jr 
the list of suspects has been narrowed down to a chosen few 
saia said as soon as his condition improves we will go in with 
our artists and come up with a composite drawing 
also wednesday more than 400 people attended a memorial mass 
for mrs stuart at mission church in the mission hill neighborhood 
where the couple was shot 
the rev joseph krastel said he didnt believe any of the 
stuarts relatives attended the mass 
we hope our prayers can console them krastel said adding 
that members of his congregation are increasingly troubled by 
violenece in the area every week people in this neighborhood are 
stabbed or shot theres been a tremendous escalation of violence 
here he said 
after the attack stuart called for help on a car telephone that 
his wife a lawyer had installed after she got pregnant so she 
could stay in close touch with her husband 
police originally thought the gunman shot the couple because he 
spotted the mobile phone and thought that indicated they were 
undercover police officers 
after a 90minute hospital interview with stuart detectives 
changed the theory the boston globe reported today citing 
unidentified sources the husband told police the gunman said 
fiveo street slang for police after stuart said he didnt 
have a wallet 
investigators believe the gunman thought stuart was refusing to 
hand over his wallet because it contained a police badge the globe 
said 
as media attention focused on mission hill some residents 
suggested the interest was because the victims were white 
professionals 
there have been other people whove been murdered in this 
neighborhood people that i knew and that i cared about said 
mission hill resident paul everly but not one of them has 
brought out the police and you reporters like this one what makes 
this one demand so much attention 
it shows there is a double standard when violence reaches 
beyond the urban area and beyond minorities said louis elisa of 
the boston chapter of the national association for the advancement 
of colored people

a genetically engineered protein that stimulates 
the body to make more blood may help people avoid transfusions by 
allowing them to store several pints of their own blood before 
planned surgery according to a study 
people make donations before surgery so they can use their own 
blood if transfusions are needed however people frequently cannot 
produce enough extra blood ahead of time to replace all that is 
lost during the operation 
the research shows that the hormone erythropoietin can stimulate 
the body to make more red blood cells so people can make larger 
donations for themselves 
we have previously shown that if you ask people to store 
significant amounts of blood for themselves over a short period of 
time about 40 percent are unable to do that as you draw blood 
out they become anemic said dr lawrence t goodnough of case 
western reserve university in cleveland 
his research published in todays new england journal of 
medicine found that people getting erythropoietin increased their 
blood donations by 41 percent 
the new treatment is a product of genetic engineering the human 
gene that oversees production of erythropoietin is inserted into 
hamster tissue which produces the human hormone in large 
quantities 
the protein was approved by the us food and drug 
administration in june specifically for people suffering anemia 
caused by kidney failure however doctors can also prescribe it 
for other conditions 
in the study 47 patients at 12 hospitals were asked to try to 
give up to 6 pints of blood during three weeks before elective 
orthopedic surgery they were randomly assigned to take 
erythropoietin or placebos 
only one of 23 patients getting erythropoietin could give less 
than 4 pints compared with seven of 24 in the controlled group 
goodnough said the treatment before surgery may be especially 
suitable for people who are small and have less blood to give and 
for women who are more prone than men to have anemia 
doctors frequently recommend selfdonations so people can avoid 
using blood from other people while ordinary transfusions are 
reasonably safe recipients do run added risk of hepatitis or other 
viruses as well as suffering adverse reactions to other peoples 
blood

antiabortion activists were bolstered 
after the michigan senate approved a bill that would require 
parental consent before girls 17 or younger could obtain abortions 
the bill goes to the house for consideration possibly next 
week after senators passed it wednesday on a vote of 298 
backers of the bill feel they have the votes in the house 
although its uncertain whether the house would vote to override an 
expected veto by democratic gov james blanchard 
we expect a very favorable vote in the house said barbara 
listing president of the antiabortion group michigan right to 
life with such wide public support for a parental rights 
measure we fully expect our representatives to reflect the will of 
the citizens of michigan 
howard simon executive director of the american civil liberties 
union in michigan criticized the measure 
i hope the public isnt suckered into thinking that this is a 
family rights bill he said the issue is forcing unwanted 
pregnancies to term 
about 30 states have parental consent laws on abortion and most 
are tied up in court and not enforced both sides of the abortion 
issue are watching progress of the michigan legislation because it 
is among the first antiabortion bills acted upon since the us 
supreme court on july 3 gave states more power to restrict 
abortions 
among several amendments the senate rejected was one that would 
have waived parental consent if a girl was the victim of rape or 
incest 
democratic sen john cherry said it was unbelievable that a 
victim of incest or rape might be required to ask her attacker for 
permission to abort his child this bill is deficient he said 
its shocking 
the legislation would require a girl age 17 or less to get one 
parents written consent to obtain an abortion if consent were 
refused or the girl couldnt discuss the matter with a parent she 
would be able to seek a juvenile court order allowing the abortion 
the court would be required to grant a waiver of parental 
consent if it determined the girl was mature enough to make the 
decision or found the abortion would be in the best interests of 
the minor 
parental consent wouldnt be required in an emergency where the 
continued pregnancy would endanger the girl

the national assembly speaker 
announced today that prime minister benazir bhutto will face a 
noconfidence motion next week at the request of conservatives 
opposed to ms bhuttos leftleaning party 
flagwaving government supporters waited outside the assembly 
for the announcement they were watched by dozens of helmeted riot 
police 
there was no unrest but speaker meraj khalid warned noisy 
lawmakers you should avoid a scene which could god forbid 
present a bad example before the nation he said 
the islamic democratic alliance a group of nine mainly 
conservative and islamic fundamentalist parties called monday for 
the noconfidence motion against the government of ms bhuttos 
leftleaning pakistan peoples party 
about 105 of 237 assembly members have announced they will vote 
against ms bhuttos 10monthold cabinet 
the governing party has 116 seats in the legislature following 
the defection of one member on wednesday but with the help of 
independent lawmakers it appeared likely to get the necessary 119 
votes to stave off a challenge 
khalid said debate on the motion will begin nov 1 
ms bhutto predicted the opposition wont be able to muster more 
than 90 votes 
the opposition will be totally exposed when the vote takes 
place as its members continue to desert its ranks she told 
reporters at the assembly building 
ms bhuttos party won by far the largest bloc of seats in the 
national assembly in novembers elections the first free elections 
in more than a decade 
but her rivals gained control of punjab province where 60 
percent of pakistans 109 million people live 
since ms bhutto became prime minister on dec 2 1988 both 
sides have vowed to unseat each other 
ms bhuttos government has been plagued by ethnic violence 
particularly in the countrys largest city karachi 
the southern port is in ms bhuttos home province of sindh 
where hundreds of people have died and thousands more have been 
hurt in ethnic turmoil over the past three years

people who catch the aids virus while young have a 
far better chance than adults of remaining healthy with the 
infection for many years a study published today shows 
the research conducted on people who caught the human 
immunodeficiency virus through blood products is the largest of 
several recent studies to show that the older people are the 
faster their infection progresses to aids 
the popular notion is that aids is inevitable if one is 
infected with hiv and in fact there is no study that shows that 
said dr james j goedert the opportunity to provide longterm 
health for an hivinfected child is relatively good especially 
with azt and other treatments coming along 
the drug azt is often recommended for people infected with hiv 
as a way of forestalling the start of aids symptoms 
goederts research conducted at the national cancer institute 
was published in the new england journal of medicine it was based 
on 319 people who got the aids virus through treatment for 
hemophilia 
because of an inherited defect hemophiliacs require regular 
treatment with a protein called factor viii that makes their blood 
form clots the factor is made from blood obtained from thousands 
of donors during the early 1980s the treatment was often 
unknowingly contaminated with hiv 
manufacturers began heating factor viii to kill the virus in 
1984 but by then an estimated 60 percent of hemophiliacs in the 
united states were already infected 
as the epidemic progressed doctors noticed that infected 
hemophiliacs seemed to do better than male homosexuals and drug 
abusers the other main risk groups however the latest research 
suggests this is simply because the hemophiliacs are frequently 
younger 
the study found that 13 percent of those who caught the aids 
virus before age 18 had gone on to develop aids after eight years 
of infection by comparison aids had occured in 27 percent of 
those infected between ages 18 and 34 and in 44 percent of people 
who got the virus after age 34 
goedert said young people might resist the virus longer because 
they have more of the blood cells that are primary target of the 
virus another explanation is that they have never been exposed to 
the otherwise harmless microbes that can cause fatal illnesses in 
people whose immune defenses are destroyed by hiv 
possibly there is some unmeasured cofactor associated with 
aging he said the cells themselves may respond better in a 
young person and control the virus better for a longer period of 
time if that could be demonstrated to be true that might have 
some implications for vaccine research because a vaccine could be 
targeted to enhance that factor 
an editorial in the journal by dr harold r roberts of the 
university of north carolina said those who treat hemophiliacs can 
take little comfort in the latest findings while the work may 
eventually lead to improved therapy it is unlikely that this 
will happen within the anticipated life span of currently infected 
patients 
a separate study in the journal conducted by german 
researchers found no aids infections among 155 hemophiliacs who 
were treated with purified factor viii during the early 1980s

receiver he had a short phone conversation in russian but it was 
not known with whom 
the meeting at the confederation of finnish industries came on 
the second day of a threeday state visit focusing on how to get 
western knowhow and business acumen to bolster gorbachevs 
economic reform 
many of the companies represented already have joint projects 
with soviet firms but gorbachev told the industrialists there 
should be many more we should have dozens and dozens he said 
one new venture could be forthcoming the finnish company oy 
warsila ab announced today that the soviet union and a group of 
finnish and norwegian companies will launch a feasibility study on 
exploiting a natural gas field under the barents sea and will set 
up a joint venture if it is deemed profitable 
gorbachev showed particular interest in the environmental 
controls in such industries as mining and metal technology asking 
the cost of such controls 
finnish officials have complained that soviet factories are 
responsible for much of their countrys air pollution and the 
sides prepared an agreement aimed at curbing transboundary 
pollution 
the chairman of the business confederation casimir ehrenrooth 
told gorbachev the finns agreed to a soviet request to train 
industry leaders in western business management and practices 
more than 30 other agreements are to be signed for joint 
businesses development projects and political issues 
earlier gorbachev had a breakfast meeting with prime minister 
harri holkeri to explore statetostate projects 
the meetings came as finnish newspapers lauded gorbachevs 
unequivocal recognition of finnish neutrality which in previous 
soviet statements had been couched in qualifications 
in a dinner speech wednesday the soviet president said i 
want to greet a neutral finland 
the issue of neutrality strikes a sensitive chord in finland 
which often has been derided as being under moscows thumb and 
adopting subservient policies in exchange for being allowed to 
remain independent following military defeats at the hands of the 
soviets 
gorbachevs dinner speech was marked by new thinking from 
beginning to end said an editorial in helsingi sanomat 
on wednesday thousands of finns chanted gorba gorba and 
waited in damp weather as gorbachev visited a room where lenin 
founder of the soviet state once hid from czarist forces before 
the 1917 bolshevik revolution the room is in the house of the 
police commissioner of the time in downtown helsinki 
the 58yearold kremlin chief shook hands and chatted with the 
surging crowd some held up placards with slogans likewelcome 
gorbachev welcome new thinking 
but gorbachev also was dogged by a few protesters who demanded 
negotiations for the return of parts of the eastern karelia region 
finland ceded the region after fighting two bitter wars with the 
soviets in 1939 and 1944 
give us back karelia some demonstrators shouted from the 
back of the crowd gorbachev showed no sign he heard

fighting intensified in four provinces 
of cambodia this month as guerrillas attacked key routes and other 
areas held by the provietnamese government the thai army 
spokesman said today 
lt gen naruedol dejpradiyuth said that before peace talks 
resume the two sides will try to control more areas and to 
attain the upper hand to increase their bargaining power 
he reported increased fighting in the western provinces of 
battambang banteay meanchey and siem reap and the central province 
of kompong thom he said that in frequently fierce combat the 
guerrillas focused attacks on key routes 68 and 69 in the northwest 
and on highway 6 which runs from the northwestern town of sisophon 
to the capital phnom penh 
naruedol spoke at a regular news briefing at which maj gen 
anusorn krisanasereni the armys secretarygeneral also appeared 
anusorn said the guerrillas have been able to successfully 
launch offensives in many areas while the provietnamese forces 
are trying to maintain important strategic positions 
he said the guerrillas use the method of launching an 
offensive seizing certain areas and pulling back their forces 
probably because they do not have enough forces to control the 
areas 
fighting is expected to intensify in the dry season starting 
next month as the provietnamese army tries to recapture lost 
areas anusorn said 
the most important guerrilla victory this month was the khmer 
rouge seizure of the gemrich town of pailin on sunday the khmer 
rouge said that opened the way for an assault on the provincial 
capital of battambang cambodians largest city after the capital 
phnom penh 
the khmer rouge army radio said wednesday the guerrilla group 
has set up a military committee to defend pailin and to allow 
guerrilla forces to continue their advance 
the radio said the guerrillas had set up a provisional 
military committee to defend and keep pailin town this is being 
arranged to allow our bigger forces to move ahead freely 
it said that once a political settlement to the war is reached 
pailin and other areas liberated by the khmer rouge will be 
placed under the provisional government that will organize an 
election 
the khmer rouge killed hundreds of thousands of cambodians 
during the 1970s before it was ousted by vietnams invasion in late 
1978 it is the largest member of the threeparty guerrilla 
coalition fighting the government installed by vietnam 
the two other groups the noncommunist khmer peoples national 
liberation front and the army of prince norodom sihanouk also have 
scored significant victories recently 
vietnam claimed to have pulled the last of its troops from 
cambodia last month raising fears the cambodian government would 
not be able to defend itself alone the guerrillas claim vietnamese 
soldiers remain in the country 
talks aimed at reaching a political settlement to the war have 
broken down over the governments refusal to give the khmer rouge a 
role in a future government

researchers said today that the worlds oceans 
and seas did not show significant warming from 1982 to mid1988 a 
finding that contradicts a recent report 
the new work which used data gathered from ships and buoys is 
at odds with an analysis of satellite data published in april 
a major reason for the difference was that airborne particles 
from a mexican volcano skewed satellite readings during 1982 and 
1983 making water temperatures appear cooler than they really 
were researchers said 
scientists are interested in ocean temperatures because they may 
reflect the greenhouse effect a predicted global warming due to 
buildup of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere 
the 198288 period itself however is too brief to draw any 
conclusions about the greenhouse effect researchers said 
the new study by richard reynolds research oceanographer at 
the federal climate analysis center in washington dc and two 
british scientists appears in todays issue of the british journal 
nature 
they took issue with a study by ae strong a research 
oceanographer with the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration and a visiting scientist at the us naval academy 
in annapolis md 
in april strong reported that satellite observations show the 
worlds oceans and seas were warming at the surface by about 
onefifth of a degree fahrenheit a year between january 1982 and 
mid1988 
the new work considered some satellite data as well as readings 
from ships and buoys reynolds in a telephone interview said the 
volcanic particles were the main problem with the original study 
he also said calculating a temperature trend over the analyzed 
period is difficult because the period is brief and because it 
included two unusual warmings of the eastern equatorial pacific 
ocean events called el ninos 
strong who wrote the april paper said wednesday he is working 
with the other researchers to study the discrepancies 
he said that when satellite readings affected by the volcanic 
particles were replaced with data from ships and buoys the 
strength of the overall calculated warming trend decreased by about 
30 percent

was shot in the thigh in the gaza strip village of beit hanoun and 
a 26yearold man was wounded in the west banks faraa refugee

a pathologist says a device he invented 
that allows terminally ill patients to kill themselves is humane 
and painless but some authorities say making it available could 
result in criminal charges 
the apparatus developed by dr jack kevorkian injects a lethal 
drug he says death would occur in three to four minutes 
the device can be hooked up by a doctor but is then controlled 
by the patient when the patient presses a button a harmless 
intravenous injection of saline solution is shut off and the drug 
thiopental is injected the drug induces a coma and potassium 
chloride is injected automatically to stop the patients heart the 
royal oak private researcher said 
oakland county assistant prosecutor gerald poisson said someone 
providing such a device could be charged with murder but the chief 
of the wayne county prosecutors appellate division jim baughman 
disagreed 
if you actually take part in the act thats criminal 
baughman said if you provide the means to do it thats not 
doctors said the device presents an ethical dilemma 
we do not actively intervene to end life said dr myron 
laban president of the oakland county medical society hes 
providing this instrument its no different whether you give the 
patient a gun or a knife 
kevorkian said he doesnt fear criminal or ethical violations 
its dignified humane and painless and the patient can do it 
in the comfort of their own home at any time they want he said 
im here to help anybody whos in distress or thinks he is i 
couldnt let dogs suffer like that how can i let a human 
the american medical association opposes the instrument the 
organization will accept cutting a patients lifesupport system in 
some cases but has said it doesnt believe a doctor should provide 
the means of death

a group of israeli merchants have asked police 
to probe whether an arab noodle maker is wrapping its pasta in the 
palestinian flag 
a spokesman for the israeli manufacturers association said 
today that the group has filed a police complaint against the firm 
for using the four colors of the outlawed palestinian flag on its 
spaghetti packages 
we asked police to investigate why they are allowed to 
distribute the flag in this way it should be considered against 
the law said danny leish a spokesman for the israeli industrial 
group 
the police complaint is the latest battle in a war of symbols 
that is part the palestinian uprising against israeli control of 
the occupied territories the complaint also reflects the anger of 
jewish industrialists with an economic slump partly caused by the 
22month rebellion 
the palestinian flag which israel considers a plo flag is 
outlawed by israel as is the plo which the jewish state considers 
a terrorist organization 
the spaghetti in question is produced by the al ghazel macaroni 
co in the west bank city of bethlehem it is marketed in a package 
decorated with green black red and white stripes 
the companys owner wadi abu eta could not be reached for 
comment because phone lines were cut to the bethlehem area 
ruth shlesinger a spokeswoman for national police in jerusalem 
declined to comment on the complaint which was filed two weeks ago 
leish denied the complaint was aimed at harming an arab 
competitor but acknowledged israeli food manufacturers were among 
the hardest hit in the recession touched off by the rebellion in 
the occupied west bank and gaza strip unemployment currently 
exceeds 95 percent in israel 
food manufacturers have lost about 100 million during the 
22monthold uprising and had to cut about 1000 jobs leish said 
he blamed much of the damage on an uprising boycott of israeli 
products by the occupied territories 17 million arabs 
leish complained that the problem is compounded by arab 
competitors marketing their products within israel adding the 
manufacturers association already has asked the army to insist 
palestinian products be clearly identified as such 
the spaghetti dispute is the latest of a string of israeli steps 
against symbols of palestinian nationhood forcing arab youths to 
pull down palestinian flags is a regular occurrence in the disputed 
lands 
sometimes names also are considered symbols the hadashot daily 
reported that an israeli hospital refused this week to register a 
bedouin arab baby girl given the popular uprising name tahrir 
arabic for liberation 
speaking of symbols israeli reports noted the al ghazal 
spaghetti package also bears a kosher stamp showing it meets with 
jewish dietary laws

defense secretary dick cheney said 
today that despite changes in the east bloc the west must remain 
very cautious about selling it hightechnology equipment 
answering questions during a visit to a us air base in eastern 
england cheney said it was necessary to maintain the cocom regime 
the organization of industrial democracies that regulates trade 
in items to soviet bloc nations cocom stands for coordinating 
committee for multilateral export controls 
cheney arrived here wednesday from a nato meeting in portugal 
and had talks with british defense secretary tom king his next 
stop was west germany 
the export committees 17 member states the united states 14 
of its nato allies australia and japan are meeting at a secret 
venue in paris 
cheney welcomed the changes in the soviet union and eastern 
europe but said the west needs to remain very cautious about the 
kinds of technology we allow to be transferred to the eastern 
bloc 
he said the soviet union still has a huge arsenal of 
intercontinental ballistic weapons and other strategic systems 
targeted against the united states and other nato members 
they are the only nation in the world capable of destroying 
us i think it is in our interests under those circumstances to 
continue the cocom regime cheney said 
the united states cocom allies are pressing for an easing of 
trade restrictions leaving washington all but isolated according 
to a us source who spoke on condition of anonymity before the

a highranking communist party official met today 
with leaders of east germanys largest prodemocracy group and 
discussed reform efforts the latest government gesture to the 
growing protest movement 
it was the first time a member of the ruling communist party 
politburo had met with opponents of the east german political 
system the activists later called the talks an encouraging step 
toward reform 
earlier today west german chancellor helmut kohl called new 
east german leader egon krenz to talk about ways to improve 
relations 
east berlin communist party chief and politburo member guenter 
schabowski met for two hours with jens reich an east berlin 
biology professor and founding member of the proreform group new 
forum another new forum founder sebastian pflugbeil also 
attended the meeting 
we presented new forums concepts and ideas reich told 
reporters after the meeting at the party central committee 
building the talks were open and constructive 
asked why they were invited to meet with schabowski reich said 
he told us he wanted to begin a new political course and wanted 
to learn about the whole political spectrum here 
reich said schabowski assured him the governments newfound 
interest in dialogue to solve the nations problems was a real 
change and not a tactical move schabowski also said the 
government would consider changes in election procedures 
the government in the past has refused to deal with opposition 
activists ignoring or persecuting them activists have campaigned 
for a more democratic electoral system and the right to travel to 
the west 
asked if he believed a genuine dialogue could develop between 
prodemocracy groups and the government reich said we will see 
i can say cautiously that i have a positive impression 
schabowski told west germany television on wednesday we are 
ready for a dialogue with all levels of society 
communist authorities banned new forum in september but it has 
been tolerated since then schabowski was asked about official 
recognition of the opposition group but he said it was out of 
his capacity reich said 
krenz on wednesday hinted that opposition groups could be 
included in talks about possible reform but reiterated that the 
nations communist system is not a matter for debate 
hans klein kohls spokesman said kohl and krenz talked for 20 
minutes in a businesslike and constructive atmosphere it was 
the first contact between the leaders since krenz replaced erich 
honecker last week as the government struggled with ways to quell 
growing public unrest 
krenz although considered an orthodox socialist like honecker 
has been trying to keep an unruly citizenry in check by offering to 
open dialogue with groups advocating economic and social reform 
krenz made clear that east germany will remain a socialist 
state though reforms will be considered and reiterated a call on 
bonn to recognize east german citizenship the east german 
staterun news agency adn reported 
west germany gives immediate citizenship to any immigrant of 
german origin which has played a role in the flight of more than 
60000 east germans to the west over the past few months 
east berlin mayor erhard krack called today for a town hall 
debate on reform another sign of the governments recent 
willingness to consider public views the communist partys 
berliner zeitung newspaper said the meeting would be held sunday 
under the motto open doors open words 
prodemocracy protests continued wednesday in various parts of 
the country thousands marched in the cities of neubrandenburg and 
jena and about 2000 people joined in a church vigil on east 
berlins alexanderplatz adn reported 
adn said 20000 people joined in what it called a march of 
hope in neubrandenburg north of berlin 
the marchers called for a dialogue with authorities and the 
citys mayor heinz hahn promised talks with citizens adn said 
in jena 5000 people marched peacefully to the city hall and 
delivered a petition to mayor hans spahn adn said no details of 
the petition were given but adn said spahn urged the crowd to 
refrain from further demonstrations and promised that the city hall 
was open to every citizen 
opposition activists are demanding free elections and speech and 
many say they do not object to socialism as long as it is truly 
democratic 
krenz has promised new laws shortly that would give east germans 
greater freedom to travel but made clear the berlin wall will not 
come down 
strict curbs on foreign travel have been a prime source of 
complaint by east germans tens of thousands of young skilled 
workers disillusioned with their homeland have fled to west germany 
in recent months

the federal government will allow wider 
distribution to children of azt the only governmentapproved 
antiaids drug health and human services secretary louis sullivan 
announced today 
the action marks the first time any aids drug has been approved 
even conditionally for use in children under 13 
the drug will be available under what the food and drug 
administration calls a treatment ind which allows widespread 
distribution of a drug that appears to be promising on the basis of 
clinical trials 
todays action is a significant advance in extending aids 
therapy to children it will give many sick children availability 
to a drug that offers promise for improving or even extending their 
lives sullivan said in a statement announcing the program 
we still need more data to be absolutely sure about the full 
range of effects from azt sullivan said on abctvs good 
morning america program but we have enough preliminary 
evidence that the drug is effective and seems to be safe under the 
conditions of usage 
sullivan said studies on azt in children will continue 
this is indeed an interim process before the drug is finally 
approved for use in children the secretary said 
in the past many physicians have been reluctant to use azt 
for children because it is not labeled for this use and because of 
concerns that the drugs side effects might be even more severe in 
children sullivan said in a speech to an aids conference but 
clinical data now indicates that children receiving azt experience 
the same degree of side effects that occur in adults 
children ages 3 months to 12 years who have symptoms of advanced 
infection with the aids virus will be eligible to receive it free 
under the program sponsored by the maker of azt burroughs wellcome 
co based in research triangle park nc 
according to the latest count by the national centers for 
disease control in atlanta 1859 children under 13 have aids they 
constitute about 2 percent of all aids cases 
mathilde krim of the american foundation for aids research said 
the announcement was a good step but was overdue 
sullivan defended against such criticism saying we really 
have a very careful balancing act that we have to undertake first 
of all we want to be sure that the drugs we approve are effective 
for what they are intended to do but at the same time we need to 
be sure that they do not have adverse side effects that might 
override the beneficial effects of the drug 
krim also said she is worried about future access to the drug 
what worries me is once this is marketed how available will 
it be to children when it is no longer distributed free she said 
she said 75 percent of children with aids are from poor and 
modestincome families often minorities where the mother and 
father also have aids but may not qualify for medicaid they 
wont have the means to buy the treatment for themselves or their 
kids she said a years course of azt now costs between 2700 
and 6500 depending on the dose 
azt is now available in the form of a new strawberryflavored 
syrup that is easier for children to swallow than capsules are it 
also allows dosages to be adjusted for body size 
zidovudine commonly called azt and which attacks the aids 
virus was approved by the food and drug administration for 
teenagers and adults with advanced symptoms of aids in march 1987 
recently completed studies have shown the drug extends the lives 
of adults with aids and delays the development of symptoms in those 
who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus or hiv but 
are not yet sick 
though the drug is not labeled for use in children physicians 
still could prescribe it for this age group however many have 
been reluctant because of fears that the side effects of the highly 
toxic drug may be more severe in children than in adults the 
sources said 
but research studies that involved more than 200 children have 
indicated that azt may prolong their survival without raising the 
risk of side effects 
it seems the drug is as effective in kids as in adults and the 
toxicity risks are about the same one source said 
in september researchers reported that the most extensive study 
of azt in children part of a national institutes of health 
project showed the drug is safe helps children gain weight and 
avoid lifethreatening infections and improves their wellbeing 
studies will continue to evaluate the effects on children of azt 
in combination with other drugs and the benefits of the drug when 
used in children in earlier stages of the disease

a fire at a nuclear power plant here has 
renewed nearby residents worries about evacuation plans and has 
energized opponents facing the ruling socialist party in a general 
election on sunday 
the oct 19 fire damaged one of the two turbine generators 
powering the plants cooling systtem but never affected its 
graphite core said fausto sanchez cascado spokesman at the 
17yearold vandellos i nuclear plant 
everything happened in the exterior electrical part of the 
plant it never affected the reactor sanchez cascado said in a 
telephone interview today 
there was no radiation released and the fire caused no injuries 
sanchez cascado said the fire did reduce the plants cooling 
capacity by half but it still had double that needed to cool the 
nuclear core 
authorities have shut down the spanishbuilt plant indefinitely 
and spains nuclear safety commission is investigating the 
accident industry minister claudio aranzadi said it was too early 
to decide whether to close the plant permanently 
the accident sparked major media coverage some of it erroneous 
and calls for a nuclear power moratorium by campaigning opposition 
leaders a week before general elections 
all of the political parties are trying to take advantage 
industry and energy minister undersecretary victor perez pita said 
recent newspapers polls indicate voters are expected to give the 
socialists their thirdstraight parliamentary majority 
the incident could have been serious said carlos barcelo 
mayor of vandellos a small town about six miles from the plant 
but it has been capitalized on by politicians and the public has 
not received good information 
spains leading daily el pais which published five frontpage 
articles on the fire in six days erroneously reported wednesday 
that the viennabased international atomic energy agency had 
described the accident as the worst since the april 1986 chernobyl 
disaster in the soviet union 
in todays edition el pais said the judgment it attributed to 
the agency had come from the agencys press clipping service in 
which el pais and other spanish dailies had been mentioned 
el pais cited itself attributing its own views to the atomic 
energy agency according to an agency statement issued today by 
spokesman hans friedrich meyer 
meanwhile barcelo and three other area mayors threatened to 
pull out of the governments nuclear emergency evacuation plan 
after claiming that civil defense officials failed to notify them 
about the fire for 30 minutes 
the fire highlighted inadequate civil defense measures barcelo 
said the towns city administration has decided to take the 
national civil defense agency to court if it fails to better equip 
local officials for an emergency 
vandellos i is spains thirdoldest nuclear power plant it was 
built using french technology went into service in 1972 and is to 
remain operating until 2003 
a consortium formed by the french utility electricite de france 
and several spanish electric companies own the plant a coldgas 
reactor that uses natural uranium as opposed to the enriched 
uranium used by pressurized water reactors 
these types of plants are set to be phased out of operation in 
france in the next five years

jim bakker seems to be adapting to a 
lifestyle much different from the one he lived as the leader of a 
multimilliondollar religious empire 
instead of silk the ptl founder wears an orange jumpsuit and 
he changed more luxurious quarters for a cell shared with another 
inmate 
still he was in good spirits this morning when i met with 
him said brian ross a spokesman at the mediumsecurity 
talladega federal correctional institution where bakker on 
wednesday served the first full day of his 45year sentence 
the ministers mother said her son was wrongly imprisoned 
they treated jim like he was a dog said bakkers mother 
furnia in a telephone interview today from her home on the grounds 
of heritage usa at fort mill sc weve been through a lot but 
this is the worst 
she said she cannot stop thinking of her son i cant believe 
my son is in prison mrs bakker said 
my husband raleigh bakker just went to the doctor she 
said this is awfully hard on both of us were both 83 and this 
is hard to take 
bakker arrived at the facility tuesday night in handcuffs and 
shackles after a sixhour drive from charlotte nc where a 
federal judge banished him immediately to prison after imposing the 
sentence and a 500000 fine 
bakker was convicted oct 5 of defrauding thousands of followers 
of his television ministry 
hes settling in ross said hes adjusting and becoming 
familiar with his surroundings hes doing fine 
two former bakker aides are being held at another federal prison 
in alabama brothers james and david taggart reported wednesday to 
a montgomery lockup to begin serving more than 17 years for tax 
evasion 
bakker was assigned to a twoman cell prison officials would 
not reveal his cellmates identity 
ross said bakker made some telephone calls wednesday morning and 
exercised he would not disclose if bakker had spoken with his 
wife tammy faye bakker or other family members 
the bakkers new television ministry in orlando fla has been 
suspended but the storefront church they had been running in a 
shopping mall remains open mrs bakker and guest ministers were 
expected to conduct sunday services 
mrs bakker who did not attend tuesdays sentencing was 
staying with friends in the orlando area and did not make herself 
available to reporters 
ross said he met with bakker wednesday morning to relay numerous 
media requests for interviews which bakker referred to his 
attorney in north carolina 
bakkers lawyer harold bender said prejudicial pretrial 
publicity will be the key issue on appeal which he filed tuesday 
moreover he said bakkers sentence is excessive we believe 
because of his celebrity status that the sentence was in the range 
that it was he told cbs news wednesday 
ross said no additional security measures were planned during 
bakkers stay at the prison which often is the first stop for 
prisoners in the southeast he is expected to stay there no more 
than two weeks before he is transferred to another federal prison 
which officials declined to reveal 
ross said bakkers family and attorneys can visit the defrocked 
tv evangelist for three evenings during the week and all day on 
weekends bakker also will be able to attend religious services on 
sunday

president bush today signed a record 345 
billion disaster relief package intended primarily for 
earthquakestricken northern california saying the aid signals 
that all of us care very much about this 
bush flanked by members of the california congressional 
delegation in the oval office said the package that was rushed 
through the house and senate this week will provide 28 billion in 
aid to quake victims 
asked by reporters whether the aid would be enough in the face 
of mounting damage estimates the president replied ive pledged 
to do what we need to do and we got this done 
we are hopeful that this action taken in great speed and 
compassion by the congress will send a signal that all of us 
crossing party lines care very much about this he said 
bush also said that the government action cannot exceed the 
action of private citizens who are pitching in to help neighbors 
and friends out there 
the legislation also contains assistance for victims of 
hurricane hugo and other natural disasters 
besides providing earthquake recovery aid the measure averted a 
federal government shutdown today and keeps the government 
operating through nov 15 while congress and the white house 
complete some late spending bills 
this bill is an unprecedented federal response to a disaster 
of unprecedented dimension rep glenn anderson dcalif said 
wednesday 
but the californians predicted theyd be back for more 
we have done a little better than a down payment said rep 
vic fazio dcalif he predicted a request for more aid in the 
spring but said the current bill would help provide some 
sustenance some security and some comfort in their hour of need 
the bill was given final congressional approval wednesday night 
when the house accepted by a 303107 vote a senate amendment that 
added to a 285 billion relief plan the house passed tuesday 
the senate beefed up the package which it passed 971 by 
waiving federal rules that would have slowed the flow of money to 
the state and blocked federal aid in some cases including repair 
of the san franciscooakland bay bridge 
in addition to the 285 billion in federal spending passed by 
the house the senate voted to allow earthquake victims as well as 
those rebuilding from hurricane hugo to take more out of a small 
business administration disaster fund that could bring an extra 
600 million more to california sponsors said 
the legislation dwarfed the previous largest disaster bill a 
11 billion package passed only a few weeks ago in response to 
hugo 
many expect the san franciscoarea quake to rank as the 
costliest natural disaster in us history with estimates running 
above 7 billion 
the emergency legislation includes 11 billion for the federal 
emergency management agency 1 billion for highway repair and a 
250 million fund for the president to spend on earthquake efforts 
at his discretion 
the legislation adds 500 million to the existing sba disaster 
fund and includes a provision designed to let the agency make 
available up to 18 billion from that fund this year with an 
estimated 11 billion of that going to california earthquake 
victims seeking to rebuild their homes or businesses 
california lawmakers said they would try to persuade bush to 
lift a 100000 cap on what the sba can loan to any individual 
homeowner 
the state won approval of provisions that would waive several 
rules designed to control federal highway spending in any single 
emergency 
those include a 100 million aid limit per state on highway 
funds and extending from 90 days to 180 days the time period 
during which california can receive 100 percent federal 
reimbursement for emergency road repairs 
the bay bridge normally would not be repaired at federal expense 
because it is a toll road 
rep bill frenzel rminn complained that while the area was 
surely in need the congress was embarking on excessive and 
largely unknown disbursements 
lawmakers of both parties expressed concern that relief agencies 
carry out the job with speed and efficiency 
a house democratic organization released a report pointing out 
that all eight top management positions at fema remain unfilled by 
bush with a nomination pending for only one of those slots 
the bush administrations attempt to manage without managers 
is likely to prove costly before all the bills are paid said the 
report by the democratic study group which recited complaints 
about femas slow response to hugo

the bush administation today signaled the 
soviet union that it is willing to discuss an offer by foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze to curtail its military bases in 
europe 
we support that aim and are willing to work with them to 
preserve their security through political rather than military 
means the state department said 
a statement issued by the press office said similar soviet 
proposals in the past appeared to be aimed at the elimination of 
us bases on foreign soil we cannot accept such an outcome 
the statement said we maintain bases as part of a successful 
system of collective defense which has assured our security and 
that of our friends and allies 
however the state department said the proposal tuesday by 
shevardnadze in a moscow speech could mean the soviets now are 
searching for ways to disengage from some of their foreign military 
commitments particularly in europe 
initially the white house brushed off shevardnadzes proposal 
which vied for attention with his acknowledgement that the soviet 
invasion of afghanistan in 1979 was a mistake and that the radar 
installation at krasnoyarsk violated the 1972 antiballistic 
missile treaty with the united states 
but the statement from the state department which apparently 
was cleared by highranking officials signaled a us willingness 
to talk to the soviets about the proposal 
secretary of state james a baker iii is expected to go to the 
soviet union this winter for a meeting with shevardnadze that 
probably will concentrate on preparations for a superpower summit 
between presidents bush and mikhail s gorbachev 
defense secretary dick cheney said in europe that were always 
looking at base structure especially in a time of tight budgets 
and he noted that us operations at torrejon in spain were based 
phased out at the request of the spanish government the f15 jet 
fighters stationed there are being moved to italy 
meanwhile us intelligence sources disclosed the soviets were 
deploying two new kinds of advanced nucleartipped missiles around 
moscow as part of a vastly upgraded defense of the capital 
a sophisticated new radar system also is being deployed the 
sources said wednesday night 
when completed the threepart upgrading program legal under 
the 1972 treaty with the united states would defend moscow with 
100 new launchers most of them underground 
the complex network would also protect the soviet high command 
sources told the associated press the soviets already have a 
labyrinthian system designed to speed soviet leaders to safety in 
the event of a nuclear war 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
soviets had been working on an improved missile defense since 1980 
but only last spring were found to have begun making the system 
operational 
new longrange missile interceptors designed to take the place 
of an earlier less sophisticated version of the weapon known in 
western military circles as galosh have the mission of 
stopping incoming ballistic missiles above the atmosphere 
a shorterrange extremely fast missile known as gazelle is 
being deployed as a complementary defensive missile designed to 
catch missile warheads in the atmosphere that might have gotten by 
the galosh 
gazelle is supposed to be able to discriminate between decoys 
and the real thing 
the new radar at pushkino about 25 miles northeast of moscow 
was described as considerably advanced and able to track 
targets anywhere in its 360degree field of vision 
first word of the new soviet deployments came in a report on the 
cable news network 
the 1972 treaty limits us and soviet defenses on the basis of 
the thendominant theory that a potential attacker might be 
deterred from striking if massive retaliation was the likely 
response a defense against retaliation might lead the possessor of 
such a defense to the conclusion that he could strike in safety 
according to that theory 
however the treaty was amended to permit the two countries to 
protect their capitals and one other target and then was amended 
again to permit the defense of one place in each country 
the soviets chose to shield moscow while the united states 
installed a safeguard system to protect minuteman missiles near 
grand forks nd the north dakota system was dismantled shortly 
after it was finished in 1975 and none has been built since

give federal officials such high marks thirtysix percent of bay 
area residents polled found the federal response the the quake fair 
or poor

59 percent positive rating for the state 
damage estimates have been set at 71 billion

an attorney who has handled more than 100 
toxic shock syndrome lawsuits says two lawyers for a tampon maker 
offered to pay him if he would stop taking such cases 
playtex family products inc signed a 500000 consulting 
agreement with another plaintiffs lawyer who has stopped pressing 
toxic shock cases said the attorney mark b hutton 
hutton and a partner in his wichita law practice won an 112 
million civil award for the family of a woman who died of toxic 
shock syndrome it is one of hundreds of lawsuits around the 
country seeking damages from makers of highabsorbency tampons 
which were linked to the rare and sometimes fatal infection by the 
us centers for disease control in 1980 
hutton said he first was approached by playtex attorney charles 
mccaghey in 1985 or 1986 when mccagheys new york law firm was 
coordinating the companys defense against the lawsuits 
hutton alleged that mccaghey offered him money in addition to 
any settlement he might get for clients if he would refuse to take 
future toxic shock cases 
mccaghey however denied offering to pay hutton to back off 
toxic shock litigation 
its false to my knowledge mccaghey said wednesday i 
never offered him anything to buy him off 
hutton said he dismissed that approach and others later from 
william h robinson of richmond va another lawyer for playtex 
i thought it was just cocktail talk hutton said lawyers 
do a lot of jousting among themselves and teasing hutton said 
i never took it seriously 
but he thought otherwise after learning another plaintiffs 
attorney j michael liles of fort worth texas accepted a 
500000 fiveyear consulting deal with playtex 
robinson said today he was unable to comment i would like 
very much to be able to respond but because of pending litigation 
i cannot 
playtex never attempted to do anything unethical or buy 
anyones silence said playtex spokesman martin petersen today in 
a statement issued from his paramus nj office 
these allegations are being litigated in court and we are 
confident that it will be proved the charges are baseless since 
the matter is in litigation we are unable to comment further 
playtex and other manufacturers have stopped making the kind of 
highabsorbency tampons linked to toxic shock syndrome but 
typically dont admit the tampons are to blame in settling damage 
lawsuits 
liles said in a telephone interview wednesday he hasnt done any 
toxic shock syndrome consulting work yet for playtex some 10 
months after he signed the agreement with the company the 
consulting contract doesnt have anything to do with toxic shock 
cases he said refusing to discuss the terms of the agreement 
this is a matter where people have brought my ethics into 
issue and i havent done anything unethical liles said wednesday 
playtex said in a court brief in an orange county calif toxic 
shock case that it is paying liles for being available to consult 
with it regarding toxic shock syndrome litigation 
one of playtexs insurance companies st paul surplus lines 
insurance co refused to pay liles 500000 consulting for the 
company in a dec 28 letter to playtex the company said its 
coverage didnt encompass such an agreement 
in addition we are concerned by the ethical considerations 
and the longterm ramifications of an agreement of this nature 
said the letter which is part of the court file in a delaware 
superior court case involving a dispute among playtex columbia 
casualty co and other insurance carriers 
hutton said he and the attorneys for playtex never discussed how 
much he might be paid 
they didnt get specific with me because i didnt express an 
interest he said 
hutton said liles had found a smoking gun playtex didnt want 
revealed before he settled a texas case against playtex withdrew 
from others and accepted the consulting arrangement liles 
telephoned hutton and said he had found a memo showing playtex had 
been planning to remove its superabsorbent tampons from the market 
since 1983 hutton said 
that memo is part of the delaware case record in that action 
the insurance carriers claim playtex fraudulently obtained recall 
coverage and other policies by concealing vital information 
including longstanding plans to recall the product

the desperate search for a 9yearold boy 
missing since sunday with his pony in the rugged canyons of central 
oregon resumed at daybreak today but already poor weather worsened 
heavy snow was falling and the temperature was 20 degrees said 
klamath county search and rescue spokeswoman betty lucht despite 
the weather around 300 searchers planned to continue looking for 
nathan madsden on horseback and on foot she said 
nathan was dressed in a slicker and chaps and his mother sarah 
madsen said earlier that she was confident he could take care of 
himself 
nathan disappeared sunday while herding cattle with his family 
during an annual roundup relatives said the boy and his 
10yearold sorrel tony surely stayed together 
this weeks snow sleet and rain have erased any tracks the boy 
and his horse may have left overnight temperatures have been 
freezing four nights in a row 
if he can stay with the horse and huddle with it hes got a 
chance if hes a tough little cowboy he may still be alive 
said klamath county sheriff carl burkhart 
two helicopters and a c130 transport plane were sent wednesday 
by the air force reserve 304th aerospace rescue amp recovery squadron 
based in portland they joined a civil air patrol plane that began 
searching wednesday after being grounded all week because of 
inclement weather 
sheriffs spokeswoman becky collins said todays poor weather 
would keep the helicopters grounded 
the search party grew to about 350 wednesday from 70 on monday 
and volunteers continued to call from as far away as richland 
wash collins said 
searchers on foot and horseback covered 60 square miles 
wednesday expanding beyond the 13squaremile canyon searched 
previously 
several searchers walked through an area called the bogs 
filled with treacherous mud pits one man sank to his waist tuesday 
only a nearby log saved the guy from going all the way in over 
his head said russ herbison of the lane county sheriffs posse 
for obvious reasons we want to be sure there are no signs of 
nathan having been in there 
no ones giving up hope and no ones going home herbison

hundreds of inmates ended a fiery 
sevenhour uprising after the warden agreed to meet with a small 
group about their complaints fortyfour people were hurt during 
the siege and the prison was heavily damaged 
eight guards were held hostage wednesday in the states second 
prison rampage in two days 
corrections department spokesman ken robinson said inmates would 
remain locked in their cells until further notice and routine 
prison operations were suspended 
robert m freeman superintendent of the mediumsecurity state 
correctional institution at camp hill said 1200 of the prisons 
2600 inmates joined the riot at various stages 
he planned to talk with five inmates today 
a new rule barring inmates families from bringing in homemade 
food may have sparked the outbreak said freeman who explained 
that the rule was established to prevent contraband from slipping 
into the prison 
about 300 police officers and firefighters were sent to the 
52acre complex after the riot began wednesday afternoon when an 
inmate beat a prison staffer 
smoke permeated the air as police struggled to secure the prison 
so firefighters could extinguish four blazes 
inmates demanded a press conference changes in medical and 
family visitation rules and amnesty 
john palakovich assistant to the superintendent said the 
uprising spread quickly to six cellblocks fires were started at 
the prison furniture factory a commissary another food service 
area and a gatehouse he said 
no damage estimate was immediately available 
officials said 35 injuries were confirmed among staff and 
guards including nine who were admitted to local hospitals with 
one of them in intensive care nine inmates were injured with two 
admitted to hospitals in fair condition 
using homemade weapons inmates took the hostages but released 
them within six hours 
the prison in camp hill 3 miles west of harrisburg is about 45 
percent above capacity freeman said overcrowding was not mentioned 
by inmates but he added it might have been a factor in the riot 
on monday night a threehour rampage at the huntingdon state 
prison injured 29 staff members and 19 prisoners inmates took over 
a cellblock and broke windows and furniture and set small fires 
authorities said huntingdon is about 100 miles west of camp hill 
freeman doubted a link existed between the two prison upheavals 
but sometimes you have a domino effect he said

exxon corp will move its headquarters from new 
york city to dallas next fall the worlds largest oil company 
announced today 
chairman lawrence rawl said the company had considered moving 
its headquarters for some time and had evaluated several locations 
we concluded that on balance the dallas area offered the 
best combination of factors from the standpoint of our employees 
personal and professional lives and from an overall business 
standpoint he said 
at least 300 headquarters employees will be affected by the 
relocation 
exxon is the biggest energy company in the world and the 
thirdlargest us industrial company with sales of more than 
875 billion in 1988 
its departure from new york reflects a trend of large companies 
relocating in areas that are more affordable 
other leading us companies historically based in new york also 
have been leaving or expressed their intention to partly because 
of high costs jc penney amp co moved its headquarters from new 
york to the dallas area in 1987 saving about 60 million a year in 
office and administration expenses 
the dallasfort worth area is considered one of the most 
attractive areas for corporate relocations fortune magazine ranked 
it as no 1 for business in its oct 23 issue calling it the 
most diverse and dynamic economic base in the us 
rawl did not specify how much money exxon might save by the 
relocation from new york where it occupies leased space in a 
54story skyscraper in the heart of midtown manhattan one of the 
most expensive pieces of real estate in the world 
exxon and rockefeller group inc sold the building in 1986 to a 
large japanese insurance conglomerate mitsui amp co for 610 
million at the time it was the largest single real estate 
transaction in the citys history 
rawl said the company told employees the decision to relocate 
the office was not taken lightly 
it was unclear why exxon decided to move its headquarters at 
this time but the company has faced enormous cleanup costs 
stemming from the march 24 oil spill in alaska by a company tanker 
exxon said recently that the cost would probably exceed 12 
billion with less than a third covered by insurance 
rawl said the company would be leasing temporary office space in 
dallas prior to moving into permanent offices to be constructed 
about a mile from the las colinas complex a large office 
development in the dallas suburb of irving close to the 
dallasfort worth airport

china is sending as many governmentsponsored 
students abroad this year as in past years but will make changes in 
their criteria and where they are sent an official said thursday 
the official did not comment on privately funded students the 
government is expected to enact new regulations that will sharply 
limit their numbers 
for all of 1989 5000 students are being sent abroad with 
central government funds the official xinhua news agency quoted 
the unidentified official of the overseas students service center 
as saying 
it said this is the same number as were sent in each of the past 
two years in other recent statements the government put the 
number being sent annual at 3000 the discrepancy could not 
immediately be resolved 
xinhua noted the figure did not include students sent by local 
governments or work units it also does not include students who 
find private sponsors or win scholarships from overseas colleges 
rational readjustment will be carried out this year in respect 
to the percentage of students sent to various countries and the 
composition of students the official said 
improvement is needed in the selection of students the 
tendency to stress foreign language only while neglecting 
comprehensive quality should be put right 
he did not elaborate but education officials have said students 
should show they are ideologically sound as well as academically 
qualified the government also has said it will send fewer students 
for longterm degree programs and more shortterm visiting 
scholars 
china is concerned that many students sent overseas have failed 
to return and many of those who do return are filled with western 
economic and political ideas such as democracy 
the impact of this new policy has yet to be felt because many 
students going abroad this year made arrangements well in advance 
there have been individual cases of students or older scholars who 
planned to go overseas but have not been permitted to because of 
suspected involvement in the crushed spring democracy movement 
the state education commission has drafted new regulations that 
would sharply cut the number of overseas students by requiring 
college graduates to first work at least five years in china 
according to sources in the commission and at universities 
the requirement would apply to students who find their own 
financial sponsors or win scholarships from foreign schools they 
are estimated to number several thousand each year 
the sources say the draft regulations are still being discussed 
but likely will be approved next year 
more than half of chinas approximately 80000 students abroad 
are in the united states and the rest are concentrated in japan 
australia and canada 
english is the second language studied by most college students

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
today announced a major plan to reduce nuclear weapons in the 
baltic sea that will include the scrapping of moscows 
nucleararmed submarines there 
in a goodwill gesture to northern europe the kremlin chief said 
the soviet union has removed all tactical nuclear missiles that 
could strike the region and will take certain types of sealaunched 
nuclear weapons out of the baltic sea 
he made these announcements in remarks prepared for delivery to 
1500 finnish politicians businessmen and other invited guests 
gorbachev said the eventual goal was to rid the baltic of 
nuclear weapons 
we are prepared to come to agreement with all the nuclear 
powers and the baltic states on effective guarantees for the 
nuclearfree status of the baltic sea he said 
gorbachev said the steps were being taken unilaterally and were 
a followup to a speech he gave two years ago in the soviet 
northern port of murmansk many of his proposals in that speech 
including a call for a nuclearfree zone in northern europe were 
dismissed by nato 
in washington white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
said we do not believe nuclearfree zones contribute to security 
in europe 
most of these proposals have been designed to affect nato 
deterrence capability while leaving soviet nuclear weapons 
intact fitzwater said on the other hand we do appreciate the 
intent of this and if it can develop into something concrete why 
that might be a hopeful sign 
gorbachev said the soviet union already has taken two of its 
golfclass submarines out of operation from the baltic and he 
pledged to destroy the remaining four by the end of next year the 
nuclear missiles aboard the subs will also be destroyed and not 
replaced he said 
gorbachev did not specify which types of sealaunched nuclear 
weapons the soviets would remove from the baltic sea 
the united states has expressed concern that removal of the 
sealaunched missiles cannot be verified and it has balked at 
their inclusion in a superpower arms pact now being negotiated 
in another announcement gorbachev said the kremlin has agreed 
to norways proposal to negotiate an agreement providing for mutual 
notification of accidents involving ships including 
nuclearpowered submarines 
three soviet nuclearpowered submarines have been involved in 
accidents since april in the barents and the norwegian seas 
gorbachevs announcements came on the second day of a threeday 
visit to finland

coal miners in the northern vorkuta region 
returned to work today after a 24hour strike demanding promised 
benefits and political reforms a spokesman said miners in the 
ukraine met to consider a walkout 
miners in vorkuta 950 miles northeast of moscow walked off the 
job at midnight wednesday in violation of a new law banning strikes 
in such vital areas as energy defense and transportation 
due to pressure from the local media and managements taking 
the case to court the regional strike committee made a decision to 
end the strike at midnight today sergei masolovich a member of 
the regional strike committee said by telephone he said hearings 
on the strike had begun in regional court 
the areas largest coalfield remained on strike but the other 
strikes were called off masolovich said he said a total of 18000 
miners in nine of the regions 13 mines took part 
in the ukraine miner representatives were meeting to consider 
resumption of the massive strike that last summer paralyzed the 
donetsk coal basin the countrys largest coal producing region 
top soviet officials have openly voiced concern that the miners 
actions by cutting the nations coal supplies could force a 
rationing of heat and light as the brutal winter begins 
the miners were demanding delivery of benefits promised by the 
government during a massive strike last summer said anatoly 
litvinenko another strike committee member 
first deputy premier lev voronin warned earlier this month that 
power stations and public utilities have 45 million fewer tons of 
coal on hand now than at this time last year due to the strikes 
miners in virtually every major soviet coal field walked off the 
job during the summer demanding better consumer goods and working 
conditions and more financial independence 
litvinenko said the miners now also are demanding political 
changes including elimination of article 6 of the constitution 
which makes the communist party the leading and guiding force of 
soviet society and barring the partys general secretary from 
holding the job of president 
litvinenko said the miners want their demands to be debated by 
the supreme soviet legislature and be put on the agenda of the next 
congress of peoples deputies scheduled to be held before the end 
of the year 
he said the political demands were not aimed specifically at 
president mikhail s gorbachev but at constititional changes for 
the future 
the miners are calling for their demands to be debated by the 
supreme soviet legislature and put on the agenda of the next 
congress of peoples deputies scheduled to be held before the end 
of the year 
alexei bokharev chairman of the donetsk strike committee in the 
ukraine said in a telephone interview the government was playing 
bureaucratic games they said that only three paragraphs in the 
46paragraph agreement reached over the summer had been fulfilled 
the miners want exact dates when all promises will be 
fulfilled bokharev said 
he said miners will decide friday on a course of action 
either the strike will be resumed or a conciliation commission 
will be appointed bokharev said 
on monday about 20000 miners in the western siberian mining 
town of mezhdurechensk staged a twohour warning strike declaring 
that the government had failed to come through on some of the 
promised benefits from the summer strikes 
local officials in mezhdurechensk said the miners had shown 
disrespect for the new law but they took no other action

president bush came under attack today from 
environmentalists who said he isnt taking an aggressive leadership 
role in worldwide efforts to combat global warming 
eleven environmental groups accused bush of failing to live up 
to election promises to confront the socalled greenhouse 
problem early in his presidency 
we have great rhetoric but no leadership dan becker of the 
sierra club declared at a news conference 
he and the other environmentalists noted that during his 
election campaign bush promised to tackle early in his presidency 
the concerns of expected rising world temperatures because of 
manmade pollution 
in fact the president has not even made clear who within the 
government should be in charge of developing a national climate 
policy said brooks yeager vice president for government affairs 
at the audubon society 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said we dont 
believe progress has been slowed the president has made whatever 
decisions are necessary we feel that progress has been made 
these are difficult issues that have longterm ramifications 
in terms of costs and regulatory intrusion and those issues have to 
be considered fitzwater said 
the latest round of criticism was set off by reports of discord 
within the administration over whether william k reilly 
administrator of the environmental protection agency should attend 
a meeting in the netherlands on the problem of global warming 
reilly told reporters wednesday he would head the us 
delegation to the conference attended by environmental ministers 
from 68 nations but that the united states wouldnt make any 
specific commitment to curb greenhouse pollutants chiefly 
carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels 
administration sources confirmed however that reillys 
attendance at the conference nov 67 was uncertain until just a 
few days ago and that key white house advisers had suggested no 
delegation be sent 
christopher flavin an expert on global warming issues for 
worldwatch institute said the flap was seen by many european 
officials as further indication that the united states isnt 
prepared to lead the effort to deal with global warming 
this is a major meeting flavin said in an interview its 
been in the planning stage for better part of a year the united 
states just doesnt have its act together 
the united states accounts for about onefifth of the pollutants 
linked to global warming 
the environmental groups including the sierra club audubon 
society natural resources defense council friends of the earth 
and the environmental defense fund called on bush to commit the 
united states to a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions by 20 
percent by the year 2000 
carbon dioxide is the chief pollutant causing global warming 
sharp reductions or even stabilization would require 
significant energy conservation including development of more fuel 
efficient automobiles and appliances as well as other conservation 
measures 
reilly declined wednesday to discuss reports of discord within 
the administration on the global warming issue 
the president has made it very clear we recognize the global 
warming problem he said 
but reilly said it would be premature to present a detailed 
commitment for the reduction of greenhouse pollutants until after 
a whole range of questions are resolved including the role of 
developing nations 
the dutch government was expected to propose that nations in 
2000 freeze carbon dioxide emissions at current levels 
presidential advisers failed friday to reach agreement on how to 
respond to the dutch proposal prompting some members attending the 
white house domestic policy council meeting to suggest that reilly 
skip the conference sources said 
reilly the sources said suggested at the meeting that the 
united states might be the host of a conference next year to begin 
negotiating an international convention on global warming that 
idea was met with strong opposition the sources said 
bush on several occasions has expressed concern about the 
greenhouse effect and during his presidential campaign promised to 
convene an international conference during his first year in the 
white house 
while reilly has advocated an aggressive response to global 
warming other administration officials including the presidents 
science adviser d allan bromley and chief of staff john sununu 
have cautioned against moving too quickly 
they argue a clear scientific consensus on the impact of the 
greenhouse effect on global temperatures hasnt emerged 
furthermore they maintain the economic costs of dealing with 
the problem primarily curbs on the use of fossil fuels may be 
so significant that no action is warranted until the actual danger 
is better known

chippewa indians rejected a 356 
million offer to give up traditional spearfishing practices that 
anger sport fishermen prompting one tribal leader to remark the 
great spirit won 
the indians of the lac du flambeau reservation voted 439366 
wednesday night against a state of wisconsin proposal to settle a 
dispute over a 19th century treaty that gives the tribe rights to 
fish hunt and cut timber off their reservation 
the settlement would have paid each member of the lac du 
flambeau band 1800 cash this year and 1200 in each of the next 
10 years the 356 million 10year settlement offer included 15 
million in state and federal aid for indian programs 
i feel great said tribe member scott smith who joined the 
drumpounding cheering opponents of the treaty outside the center 
where the votes were counted they saved our rights 
the chippewas annual spearfishing forays during the spring run 
of walleye pike have become the focus of protest by nonindian 
sport anglers they say indians spearing fish in shallow water have 
an unfair advantage over others who must use rod and reel 
the battle heated up this year after the state announced it 
would reduce walleye pike catch limits for sport anglers the cut 
followed a federal court ruling the chippewa could catch up to 100 
percent of the number of the pike which biologists determine can be 
safely taken from the lakes 
demonstrations against spearfishing erupted last spring and 200 
were arrested 
gov tommy thompson called the rejected settlement which would 
have required the approval of the legislature the best hope of 
ending friction in northern wisconsin 
its done its dead thompson said it had to be ratified 
by the tribe or its done were going to have to review all of 
our options 
lac du flambeau chairman mike allen said before the vote that 
the band wouldnt resume negotiations with the state if the tribe 
defeated the referendum 
thats the end of the trail here for us its over right now 
the people made their choice allen said today 
he predicted that one consequence of the vote will be more 
violent protests next spring when tribe members leave the 
reservation to spearfish again 
i believe its going to get worse he said its been 
getting worse every year and we anticipate it for this next 
year 
tribal attorney james jannetta announced he was resigning 
because defeat of the settlement he negotiated was a clear message 
his services were no longer wanted 
the great spirit won over tonight said thomas maulson a 
former tribal judge and leading opponent of the settlement 
federal courts have ruled since 1983 that the states six 
chippewa bands retain the hunting fishing and gathering rights 
under 19th century treaties that ceded northern wisconsin to the 
federal government 
the lac du flambeau with about 2500 members is traditionally 
the most active chippewa band in spearfishing 
so far the state has failed to reach treaty rights settlements 
with any of the chippewa bands the mole lake band rejected a 
proposed settlement in january 
tribal council member dave vetterneck said after the vote the 
people spoke for what they wanted as far as im concerned there 
will be no more negotiations 
opponents of the agreement demonstrated outside the tribe 
center and security was tight as votes were cast but there were 
no disturbances

prime minister yitzhak shamir today denied 
reports that israel provided technology for a nuclearcapable 
missile that reportedly was testfired in south africa in july 
shamir told israel radio there was no truth to the nbc 
television news report which said israel has been engaged in a 
partnership with south africa to develop nuclear missile capability 
we totally deny this story said shamirs media adviser avi 
pazner there is no nuclear link or cooperation between israel 
and south africa 
south africas foreign minister pik botha said i bear no 
knowledge whatsoever of such cooperation 
in washington however a us official said today that south 
africa has testfired an intermediaterange ballistic missile that 
could carry nuclear warheads and was built with help from israel 
israel and south africa are also cooperating in development of a 
longrange missile that can be used to launch reconnaissance 
satellites into space said the official speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
the us official said intelligence reports showed south africa 
had tested a modified version of the israelimade jericho ii 
mediumrange missile at armaston on the indian ocean coast near 
capetown last summer 
israels defense ministry spokesman eitan haber said his 
country is adhering to a march 18 1987 cabinet decision that no 
new defense contracts between israel and south africa be signed 
nbc cited unidentified intelligence sources and a cia document 
in its report 
it said israel provides missile technology to south africa in 
return for a continuous supply of enriched uranium for its own 
nuclear warheads and the use of the overberg longrange test site 
in south africa 
the network said the overberg site and a missile assembly 
building there were built for both countries and that israeli 
engineers have worked there for several years 
the first test resulting from the joint project took place july 
5 when a missile flew 900 miles southeast from the test site nbc 
quoted the cia paper as saying 
the document identified the south african state arms maker 
armscor as the builder of the missile and said israeli technology 
was provided through urdan industries ltd based outside tel aviv 
nbc reported 
reached by telephone a secretary at urdan said the companys 
director general yaacov ben bassat was out of the country and 
could not be reached for comment 
the british newspaper the guardian published a report in june 
that south africa was preparing to test a mediumrange nuclear 
missile developed in cooperation with israel 
trade and industry minister ariel sharon defended the principle 
of israeli cooperation with south africa recalling south africas 
help when israel was facing arabinspired boycotts 
but on this matter we have a government decision and we are

martial law entering its sixth month in beijing 
will be lifted soon the peoples daily newspaper reported thursday 
i cannot offer a timetable government spokesman yuan mu 
told the newspaper martial law is for a limited time and it 
seems that it will be lifted before very long 
he said the government already had reduced the scope of martial 
law and will continue to do so as the capital becomes more 
stable 
yuan spoke wednesday with journalists from the nihon keizai 
shimbun japans leading economic newspaper 
he noted that many foreigners have urged martial law be lifted 
in order to increase confidence in the government 
we understand their feelings and will consider their 
suggestion he said but added that china would not yield to 
sanctions or other pressures although western countries have never 
listed conditions diplomats say privately that they are unlikely 
to resume normal relations with china until martial law is lifted 
premier li peng declared martial law in most of beijing on may 
20 when tens of thousands of college students occupied tiananmen 
square in the city center and demanded democratic reform however 
it was enforced only after june 34 when the army shot its way 
into the city killing hundreds and perhaps thousands of people 
under martial law the army banned marches strikes class 
boycotts giving speeches distributing pamphlets spreading rumors 
and other destructive actions 
it also banned foreign reporters from conducting interviews or 
making tapes or shooting videotape on the streets or at government 
offices schools and factories enforcement of the ban has relaxed 
since midsummer but all interviews still must be approved by 
martial law headquarters 
martial law has helped keep tourists away even though soldiers 
are visible at only a few key places they still guard tiananmen 
square and still occupy the chinese academy of social sciences 
many of whose researchers were active in the protests 
an undetermined number remain camped in several courtyards of 
the former imperial palace now a musuem soldiers also are posted 
prominently in the university district 
squads of nearly 100 soldiers four abreast periodically jog 
down beijings main street their automatic weapons slung over 
their shoulders 
gunfire still rings out at night but there is never official 
explanation residents claim at least some of the shots have been 
civilian attacks on soldiers 
yuan also welcomed a recent statement by the french foreign 
minister that france does not allow people on its territory to 
conduct political activities against countries that france 
recognizes 
we hope france is as good as its word yuan said however 
france has made similar statements in the past without strictly 
enforcing the policy 
china repeatedly has condemned france for giving haven to many 
dissidents who fled china after the june crackdown 
yuan refused to comment on movement in hungary and poland away 
from communism but said socialist reform aims to improve and 
develop the sociaist system and cannot deviate from the track of 
socialism 
on monday li told the vice president of yugoslavias federal 
executive council zivko pregl that china was greatly concerned 
about events in some east european countries but he said each 
country must decide how to follow the socialist path 
in internal debates some chinese theorists have begun referring 
to hungary and poland as revisionist meaning backsliders in the 
socialist cause but the word has not been used publicly

community colleges salvage hope for poor 
and minority students but are failing to motivate them to go 
beyond the twoyear programs according to a study released 
thursday 
the transfer function of community colleges is in crisis 
said the academy for educational development report which was 
funded by the ford foundation and published by the college board 
researchers fred pincus and elayne archer said twoyear colleges 
are a critical part of the educational system and have an important 
role to play because they have taken on the awesome task of 
working to salvage hope for so many who have been given up on by 
others 
but the researchers said it is equally important that community 
colleges work to provide paths of upward mobility by helping 
students transfer to fouryear colleges 
community or junior colleges usually are twoyear institutions 
established to serve a certain community and often emphasize 
career rather than academic programs a large percentage of the 
students are lowincome or minorities as well as students seeking 
to upgrade skills with a few remedial or specialized courses 
the report agreed with the american association of community and 
junior colleges that those who attend a community college tend to 
be economically better off than those who attend no college 
but they pointed to a recent government report that showed the 
average annual income of individuals with bachelors degrees is 
almost 6000 higher than those with associate degrees and 7464 
higher than those with vocational certificates 
the report bridges to opportunity said a small percentage 
of community college students transfer to fouryear schools and 
fewer yet actually get bachelors degrees it said the transfer 
rates are smaller for black hispanic and indian students than for 
white and asianamerican students 
pincus said studies show that onethird to onehalf of students 
say they enrolled in a community college to prepare for transfer to 
a fouryear school 
but he said the current transfer rate is 15 to 25 percent of all 
community college students and 20 to 30 percent of those students 
who say they want to transfer only 10 to 15 percent of all 
community college students ever receive a bachelors degree he 
said 
to increase community college transfers the report recommended 
that 
community colleges promote transfers by emphasizing both the 
intellectual and economic benefits of attaining the bachelors 
degree 
community colleges might consider requiring that at least 25 
percent of a students grade in any course carrying transfer credit 
be based upon writing assignments involving some degree of critical 
thinking 
students who complete approved associate degree programs should 
be guaranteed admission with junior status to any public fouryear 
institution in their state and not be required to repeat courses 
taken in the community college 
states should develop financial incentives to reward community 
colleges that have successful transfer programs and federally 
funded scholarship programs should be created for lowincome 
students who transfer to fouryear colleges

crews clearing tons of wreckage left by a 
huge plastics plant explosion found three bodies bringing the 
number of confirmed dead to five and continued to search today for 
17 people believed killed 
elsewhere two industrial plant explosions in wyoming and 
connecticut killed one man and injured 12 
investigators in texas have not determined the cause of the 
series of explosions monday at the phillips petroleum co plant 
which produced 45 million pounds of plastic a day 
at midday today safety crews discovered a reactor leaking 
hydrocarbon gas several reporters and television crews were asked 
to move a few hundred yards back from the cleanup area 
we asked the press to move back as nonmembers of the search 
team phillips spokesman scott carlberg said we are taking an 
extremely conservative safety measure but we see no danger of 
explosion 
even experts were surprised at the extent of the destruction 
apparently touched off somehow in leaking ethylene and isobutane 
gas 
its total devastation said assistant us labor secretary 
john scannell who heads the occupational safety and health 
administration 
in 30 years of experience in the chemical industry ive never 
seen such massive equipment twisted and strung about said 
scannell who toured the plant on the houston ship channel on 
wednesday 
fifteen osha investigators joined phillips workers cleaning up 
the plant and searching for the cause of the explosion 
the cleanup continued around the clock with big floodlights 
illuminating the scene at night as workers used hydraulic shears 
cranes and other heavy equipment to cut through a tangle of metal 
beams and pipes 
of the three bodies found wednesday two were near a storage 
area for polyethylene pellets manufactured at the plant said 
company spokesman bill wicker the third was in a maintenance area 
two others were found monday and tuesday 
an official of the oil chemical and atomic workers union said 
plant employees had complained that staff shortages long hours and 
an abundance of workers from outside contractors could have caused 
lapses in safety procedures 
the official bob wages vice president of the ocaws oil 
section didnt have specific safety complaints about the plant 
its symptomatic of whats going on in this industry wages 
said of the complaints i think companies are concerned about 
safety but i think they have competing interests profit and 
production 
a natural gas explosion in august killed a worker at the plant 
union officials said the accident was an example of poorly trained 
contract labor possibly endangering phillips workers 
plant manager robert benz discounted any possible connection 
between the use of contract workers and the two explosions he said 
contract workers get safety seminars twice a month 
scannell said the recovery of victims could take weeks part of 
the problem is that when one piece of wreckage is moved it sets 
off a chain reaction of falling debris he said 
outside evanston wyo a natural gas blast at an amoco 
production co gas processing plant blew out a wall and threw 
workers out of the building one man was killed and 11 injured 
including five in serious condition today with burns authorities 
said 
investigators were trying to determine what caused natural gas 
to leak from a compressor building said amoco spokesman dick 
brewster 
in new haven conn an explosion at a chemical and insulation 
plant left one man with serious burns the fire that followed the 
blast at the acme division of the allied products corp was quickly 
put out with dry chemicals stored inside the plant said fire chief 
john riordan who said the cause was under investigation

president bush says he is not uptight 
about attending a multinational meeting with daniel ortega but 
would be very firm if he encounters the marxist president of 
nicaragua 
the administration is renewing a trade embargo against nicaragua 
and complaining to the soviets that ortega is exporting revolution 
i have no agenda with mr ortega but were not going down 
there to have some battle with mr ortega bush said in an 
interview with latin american journalists wednesday the transcript 
of which was released today im not uptight about his being 
there 
bush said what we dont want to do is inject a lot of regional 
tensions into their meeting but im going to be polite charming 
if i did have an encounter with ortega it would be very firm 
because i dont see why that one sandinista regime is swimming 
against the tide of democracy 
and everybody knows we have a tense relationship so i dont 
want to act like were waltzing around there in great harmony 
because were not bush said 
plans were abandoned for a group communique from the summit 
participants on general themes of democracy and the environment 
which had been proposed by the host government for the meeting 
friday and saturday of hemispheric leaders 
the us objected to signing any statement with daniel 
ortega said one senior administration official adding that 
other countries also had raised concerns about the documents 
contents 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater acknowledged today 
that that attitude was generally conveyed to the costa ricans 
regarding ortega but he said the ortega aspect of this is being 
totally overblown at least in terms of our planning 
secretary of state james a baker iii on wednesday criticized 
nicaragua in the face of claims by conservatives that bush will be 
giving a stamp of legitimacy to the leftist sandinista regime by 
attending the meeting with ortega in costa rica 
baker who also will attend the meeting in costa rica 
castigated the preparations for nicaraguas feb 25 elections as 
unfair to the sandinistas opposition saying the opponents did not 
have adequate access to the countrys media 
but elliot richardson united nations secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellars representative for monitoring the campaign told 
reporters wednesday the supreme electoral council has been 
performing in a conscientious fair and impartial manner 
it is certainly my impression and i think that i speak for 
all of us representing the united nations in nicaragua that the 
goal of a free fair and honest election is being taken seriously 
by all those concerned in the government in the parties and 
among the people richardson said 
baker also said nicaragua is still shipping sovietbloc arms to 
marxist rebels in neighboring el salvador and called that a 
major problem despite repeated soviet and nicaraguan denials 
the administration contacted the soviets on wednesday baker 
said to complain about the activity in light of soviet assurances 
that moscow would urge a stop to such shipments 
also wednesday bush extended for another six months a us 
trade embargo against nicaragua that was imposed by president 
reagan in mid1985 
he did it because nicaragua poses an unusual and extraordinary 
threat to national security and foreign policy of the united 
states bush said in a statement to congress 
bush must report to congress twice a year on the status of the 
embargo and on usnicaraguan relations 
bush will be one of 18 heads of state attending the twoday 
celebration of 100 years of democracy in costa rica participants 
will all be seated around a common table for lunch dinner and a 
lengthy working session friday 
administration officials say the president will not go out of 
his way to be discourteous to ortega but will not hold private 
talks with him 
i doubt he would refuse to speak if spoken to but hes not 
going to meet with him and hes not going to be extending any 
particular courtesies in that direction baker told reporters at 
the white house 
nicaragua has unsuccessfully sought talks with the united 
states the administration is trying to bolster opposition efforts 
to win next years elections 
bush and ortega exchanged greetings and shook hands in 1986 at 
the guatemalan inauguration of president vinicio cerezo when bush 
headed the us delegation they did not converse 
bush also will meet in costa rica with ortegas election 
opponent violeta chamorro at a breakfast for political leaders

aid to poland and hungary will be delayed and 
perhaps killed by a republican attempt to inject capital gains tax 
reductions into the aid debate senate majority leader george 
mitchell said today 
obviously the capital gains issue has nothing to do with aid 
to eastern europe the maine democrat told the senate 
obviously the only effect can be to delay and perhaps kill aid to 
poland and hungary 
he called the gops decision to inject capital gains into the 
aid debate one of a series of unwise and almost baffling steps 
that president bush and the republicans have taken 
but republican leader bob dole accused democrats of injecting 
partisan politics into the debate over the size of the aid package 
and said republicans had no choice but to seek action on capital 
gains on every possible bill 
options on this side for at least a look at capital gains are 
shrinking daily the kansas republican said it finally 
occurred to us that if we didnt act on this bill we would be shut 
out entirely 
sen robert packwood rore introduced the capital gains tax 
reduction bill as an amendment to the aid package during debate 
wednesday night 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater offered a 
lessthanenthusiastic endorsement of packwoods strategy saying 
the administration was generally supportive of his proposal 
were willing to go along with it 
fitzwater said the decision to link capital gains with aid to 
poland and hungary was made on capitol hill and that the 
administration did not have much advance warning about it 
stressing that the administration wants a vote on a capital gains 
tax cut fitzwater said were certainly willing to see what 
happens 
dole contended that while republicans will stand our ground 
on the capital gains issue the delay will not affect aid to poland 
and hungary over the long run 
but it will have the beneficial effect of further focusing 
attention on the wisdom of adopting a costly democratic plan to 
provide nearly 1 billion in aid to poland and hungary over three 
years the gop leader said 
dole asserted that the less costly republican approach has more 
safeguards against funneling the money to failed socialist 
enterprises 
we are not reducing our sympathy to poland or to the 
solidarity movement dole said we are not denying anything to 
poland 
but mitchell said leaders of polands noncommunist government 
have stressed the importance of prompt action as much as the 
nature and level of the assistance itself 
noting that winter is coming on that food shortages persist and 
that inflation is skyrocketing mitchel said this is one of 
those cases where assistance provided too late will be of no 
assistance at all 
the administration has made clear that it believes the capital 
gains reduction is more important than aid to poland and hungary 
mitchell said 
surely the brave leaders of solidarity who have struggled so 
hard to restore democracy to poland know that this assistance is 
needed in a timely fashion he said 
sen patrick leahy of vermont and other democrats said the 
president has offered eastern europe encouragement but no real or 
solid commitment as it begins to move away from communism and 
toward democracy and free enterprise 
why is this administration so willing to commit billions for 
war but only small change for peace leahy asked 
republicans contended no solution will be found to polands 
serious economic problems by throwing money at them and that 
the gops less costly approach is the more responsible practical 
and prudent course 
dole accused democrats of an illadvised and risky attempt to 
flood eastern europe with us taxpayer dollars 
we have to be very careful and pragmatic about what we propose 
to do dole said there should not be a contest about how much 
money we can drag out of the us treasury 
but even some republicans endorsed the costlier democratic aid 
measure as an essential step 
events are changing quickly and we must change our policies 
with equal speed said sen gordon humphrey rnh we must 
grasp this opportunity before it slips away i say lets go for it 
and go for it aggressively 
the republican version of the threeyear authorization would 
provide a total 585 million more than 100 million over the 451 
million assistance proposed by bush 
the democrats however seek approval for 989 million in aid 
over the threeyear period nearly 150 million more than the 840 
million approved by the house last week 
their measure includes 125 million in food aid 200 million in 
currency stabilization loans 200 million in trade credit 
insurance guarantees 40 million in environmental aid and 320 
million for poland and 80 million for hungary to promote 
development of private enterprise

the education minister fired another shot in the 
scarf war by deciding moslem girls can wear islamic head coverings 
to school and a newspaper said thursday he was trying to 
reconcile the irreconcilable 
at issue is the law barring religion from french public schools 
and to some extent the situation of immigrants 
education minister lionel jospin appeared bent on satisfying 
everyone in his comments to parliament on wednesday and in a 
magazine interview published thursday but in the end seems to have 
satisfied hardly anyone 
roman catholic moslem and jewish leaders in france generally 
see no harm in the wearing of religious symbols to class but in 
political circles the secularity of schools is nearly a religion in 
itself 
the controversy began this month when three girls in a town 
north of paris decided to wear hijab scarves covering hair 
ears and neck to their junior high classes the principal said they 
could not that doing so amounted to proselytizing in school which 
is illegal 
jospin told parliament that school authorities should try to 
persuade the students and their families to respect the 
secularity of the school but if that failed the school must 
accept and welcome them 
he also stressed however the firm and absolute refusal that 
must be applied to all proselytism 
teachers unions were particularly unhappy and some members of 
jospins own socialist party were clearly discomfited 
in an interview with le nouvel observateur published thursday 
the minister said there is no threat to the french republic by 
fundamentalist islam if this republic doesnt know how to respond 
in a humanitarian way to a handful of young girls wearing scarves 
i would be worried 
liberation a leftist daily described jospin as a minister of 
education alone in the tempest abandoned even by part of his own 
party who is trying to reconcile the irreconcilable 
it said the conservative opposition was tempted to take up the 
issue but doesnt quite know how to grab it 
le quotidien de paris a conservative paper said jospins 
decision is both against tradition and against the law 
church and state were officially separated in this largely 
catholic country in 1905 public schools are required to be 
completely neutral about religion 
this business is going to have many consequences because we 
have begun a process of confrontation with islam of which we are 
seeing only the first symptoms said jeanmarie le pen leader of 
the extremeright national front party which opposes immigration 
i say that the right to wear a religious symbol must be total 
on the condition that it is discreet he said but the chador 
is more than that it is a provocative proclamation and that we 
cannot accept 
in the debate many people use the terms veil chador and scarf 
interchangeably the item in question is a simple scarf covering 
only the hair while the chador is an anklelength cloak 
yannick simpron head of the national education federation the 
largest teachers unions and a pillar of socialist party support 
said he was waiting for written instructions from the education 
ministry 
lionel jospin proposes to negotiate in cases of wearing the 
islamic veil but says the minister if at the end of the 
discussions the families do not agree to give up this religious 
symbol the child must be accepted simpron declared where is 
the margin for negotiation when the outcome is known 
some see the wearing of scarves as an attempt to slow the 
emancipation of moslem women not just a religious custom 
in parliament jospin said for these young moslem girls 
school is their only chance to emancipate themselves they have no 
other alternative 
among those welcoming his decisino was radical lawyer jacques 
verges who represents several moslem families 
we won he said in an interview secularity means the 
neutrality of teachers not the neutrality of students the law 
calls for the prohibition of all proselytism it does not talk 
about living a faith

the chilly climate of tibet has been warmer 
over the past halfcentury than at any time in thousands of years 
a team of scientists sponsored by the national science foundation 
reported thursday 
the analysis of ice collected in remote northcentral tibet 
revealed what the scientists termed a striking warming in that 
region since the 1940s 
their report in the journal science is based on the different 
types of oxygen that collect in ice at different temperatures it 
does not include estimates of actual temperature changes in tibet 
the study was conducted by researchers from the byrd polar 
research center at ohio state university the chinese institute of 
glaciology and geocryology and the university of copenhagen 
denmark 
they compared the various isotopes of oxygen in accumulated ice 
to analyse temperature changes in tibet over the past 6000 to 
8000 years and concluded that the readings suggest recent 
temperatures are the warmest 
a connection with any greenhouse effect global warming has 
not been established the researchers said 
the term greenhouse warming refers to a possibility of 
rising temperatures worldwide that has many researchers concerned 
about disruptive changes in world climate 
another report on that topic appeared thursday in the british 
journal nature where researchers concluded that the worlds oceans 
and seas did not show significant warming from 1982 to mid1988 
contradicting earlier reports 
the reports of warming in tibet but none in the oceans could be 
consistent with one another however 
james e hansen of the national aeronautics and space 
administration a leading spokesman on the global warming issue 
has estimated that if greenhouse warming is taking place the large 
land masses would be affected sooner and more strongly than the 
oceans 
thus an area such as tibet landlocked in the largest 
continent could be expected to record a warming before any of the 
worlds oceans which absorb heat and change temperature much more 
slowly than does the land 
the greenhouse warming according to scientists could result 
from the gradual increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere due 
to industrial processes the fear is that this gas would trap heat 
somewhat like a greenhouse causing temperatures to rise 
however other scientists question this theory and urge more 
research before taking any actions to halt the threatened climate 
change

the un high commissioner for refugees 
jeanpierre hocke resigned today amid an investigation focusing on 
his use of un money for firstclass air travel 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar accepted hockes 
resignation effective nov 1 said un spokesman francois giuliani 
hocke a swiss was in new york as his resignation was 
announced his letter to perez de cuellar read by giuliani said 
in part 
at a time when you have decided to prolong and intensify 
an investigation which you initiated i do not wish my presence at 
the head of hcr to complicate in any way the ongoing 
investigation 
the high commissioner serves a three year term hocke won the 
post in 1986 as the favored candidate of the us state department 
and won reinstatement in january 
the commissioner is officially responsible for at least 12 
million refugees worldwide though there are many more than that 
hockes fouryear tenure was plagued by allegations of 
mismanagement and favoritism to the major donor nations which 
include the united states 
his latest problem erupted in september when swiss television 
reported he used a special educational fund set up by sweden 
and denmark to upgrade his air travel to firstclass 
hocke admitted he had flown firstclass a right reserved only 
for perez de cuellar under stringent un austerity measures but 
he denied impropriety 
the commission is struggling with a shortfall of at least 40 
million in its budget this year 
the swiss television report said internal documents showed hocke 
had drawn 300000 dollars since 1987 from the special 
educational account to upgrade his flights from business to 
firstclass 
hocke said in late september that he had flown firstclass on 
some long intercontinental flights when he had a busy work schedule 
the fund was established in the late 1960s and is replenished 
by sweden and denmark 
on tuesday danish foreign minister uffe ellemannjensen said 
that hocke told officials that the unhcrs fundraising director 
ole volfing told him danish authorities had approved the fund for 
travel costs 
in recent years hocke has been criticized by his staff and 
private refugee relief groups for not challenging the increasingly 
restrictive asylum policies of the united states west germany and 
other major donors to the refugee commission 
in january 1988 hocke ordered the burning of all 138000 copies 
of the agencys official monthly magazine refugees because it 
contained an article critical of west germanys refugee policy 
hocke said the article was out of date and west germanys 
policies were improving but the book burning image engendered 
by the move greatly embarrassed bonn

defense secretary dick cheney on 
thursday welcomed political reforms in the soviet union but said 
the cold war cant be declared over because of the kremlins 
military might 
cheney toured the us armys infantry training site in the 
central west german town of butzbach at the start of a threeday 
visit to west germany 
i look at the developments in the east with i think a kind 
of hope and optimism that we may in fact be at the beginning of a 
new era if you will in international relations cheney said 
but i think its far too soon for us to declare that the cold 
war has ended or that peace is at hand he said 
the soviets strategic nuclear capability is more robust 
today than when mikhail s gorbachev came to power in march 1985 
cheney said he said he has to deal with the reality of military 
power 
that reality today is that the soviet union is still the only 
nation in the world that has the power to destroy the united 
states he said 
cheney arrived by helicopter at a huge open range covered with 
dust and tread marks 
there he received a briefing on the defensive strategy of a 
platoon of four bradley fighting vehicles tanklike weapons 
capable of firing missiles and outfitted with a 20mm gun 
the bradley had been plagued by criticism that it was unable to 
operate in water as designed however army officials say those 
problems have been fixed 
cheney received a briefing from 2nd lt curt carney 24 of 
boise idaho of the 1st brigade of the 3rd armored division 
carney described his platoons strategy and explained how he 
works with army heavy equipment operators who dig huge holes with a 
ramplike exit that let the bradley hide most of its bulk 
underground 
at one point cheney climbed onto the bradley to shake hands 
with the young crew members 
standing before the combatready crew cheney praised us 
military personnel as being some of the most talented and 
dedicated men and women weve ever had in uniform 
we welcome the effort of mr gorbachev to seek to reform the 
soviet union hopefully he will be successful cheney said 
hopefully that success will result in a soviet union that is 
less hostile less threatening to the west than has been true for 
the last 40 years 
he said there were signs of reductions in soviet conventional 
naval forces but said he would speculate that the new units 
coming in will be more capable than the old ones going out which 
is after all the way we operate as well 
were pleased with the announcement by the soviets of an 
intention to reduce conventional armaments unilaterally in the 
east he noted 
cheney was asked about disclosures from us intelligence 
sources that the soviets were deploying two new kinds of advanced 
nucleartipped missiles around moscow as part of a vastly upgraded 
defense of the capital 
cheney said he was not aware of any specific developments but

the chairman of the us civil rights 
commission said thursday he resigned as head of the panel to give 
president bush an opportunity to set the administrations civil 
rights agenda and name a new chairman 
it is time for the new administration which has been too 
reticent to give forth to speak to the question and make clear 
what it has to contribute to the debate on civil rights william 
b allen told a news conference at the national press club 
allen whose tenure at the agency has been marked by 
controversy said he could not speak for the administration because 
i have not had a single conversation with president bush since 
his election last year 
president bush alone can tell the country where he stands and 
what he has to contribute he added 
by naming a new chairman bush could give a particular signal 
of the mark with which he chooses to stamp the agency allen said 
the white house revealed last week that bush had accepted 
allens resignation from the commission asked to comment thursday 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said only we accept 
his resignation 
allen had said last march the president would have to ask him 
personally to resign his post after reports that bush had planned 
to replace him with arthur a fletcher a moderate republican and 
one of bushs early black political supporters 
allen distributed copies of the letter of resignation he had 
sent to the white house dated sept 9 
attached was a terse onesentence letter from bush dated oct 
16 saying only i accept your resignation as chairman of the 
united states commission on civil rights effective immediately 
in his letter allen who is black challenged bush to reduce 
civil rights litigation and to turn our country around away from 
its conscious discouragement of american blacks in particular from 
relying upon and profiting from the justice of our courts of law 
allen said bush should work to simplify civil right law which 
now probably stands second only to our tax code for ambiguities 
complexities and internal contradictions 
allens tenure as chairman of the panel has been marked by 
confrontation with other commissioners and public incidents such as 
his arrest at gunpoint when he intervened in a custody battle over 
an indian girl 
allen a professor of government at harvey mudd college in 
claremont calif was appointed chairman of the commission in june 
1988 after the death of clarence pendleton 
allen came under fire from fellow commissioners recently for a 
speech titled blacks animals homosexuals what is a minority 
he delivered earlier this month before a conservative coalition 
in a 61 vote the commission branded the speech thoughtless 
disgusting and unnecessarily inflammatory 
i do not believe in coddling people said allen in defending 
his leadership style 
my predecessor in the office im afraid wore himself out 
holding the hands of his colleagues and trying to patch together a 
consensus which really existed as nothing more than a paper 
consensus 
saying he felt a moral obligation as the only conservative 
on the panel allen said he would continue to serve on the 
commission his sixyear term expires dec 1 1992 
commission vice chairman murray friedman will act as the head of 
the agency until bush appoints a new chairman

west germanys ambassador to poland 
has resigned because of stress from the recent east german refugee 
exodus and the upcoming visit of chancellor helmut kohl to warsaw 
officials said thursday 
franz joachim schoeller has been granted early retirement after 
complaining of exhaustion said foreign ministry spokesman juergen 
chrobog 
chrobog denied rumors in warsaw that schoeller 63 was 
pressured into resigning that is absolutely untrue said 
chrobog 
but the west german visit to poland the first by a federal 
chancellor in more than a decade and the moves toward 
reconciliation of the former world war ii enemies has been an 
emotionally and politically charged issue for the bonn leadership 
chrobog said schoeller cited the stress of recent times in 
asking to be allowed to go on pension on medical grounds 
schoeller said he and the embassy staff had been overtaxed by 
preparations for kohls nov 914 visit and by the arrival of 
several thousand east german refugees at the embassy 
at least 3000 east germans who escaped to poland or refused to 
return from authorized trips appealed to the west german embassy in 
warsaw for help in emigrating and were sheltered there and at 
other buildings at the disposal of the diplomats about 2000 
refugees remain in warsaw awaiting the bonn governments help in 
getting to west germany 
chrobog declined to say who would replace schoeller but said 
the polish government has agreed to a speedy succession because of 
the pending summit and the extra workload caused by the refugees 
wellinformed sources in the bonn government who asked not to be 
identified said schoeller would be replaced by the current 
ambassador to chile guenter knackstedt 
schoeller a career diplomat had been ambassador to poland for 
two years 
his resignation was effective immediately 
under the governments pension system officials can take early 
retirement for health reasons after age 62 
kohls trip to poland had been put off repeatedly because of 
differences between the two governments and the change in 
leadership in poland this summer 
there had also been broad differences of opinion within the bonn 
leadership coalition about the lengths to which west germany should 
go to reconcilewith poland whose invasion by nazi germany on sept 
1 1939 touched off world war ii west germany and poland have 
never signed a peace treaty 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher a member of the liberal 
free democratic party that is the junior partner in the bonn 
coalition reportedly favored more generous offers of west german 
aid during the early stages of negotiations between the two nations 
kohl leader of the conservative christian democrats put his 
senior foreign affairs adviser horst teltschik in charge of the 
reconciliation talks rather than leaving them to genschers 
diplomatic staff 
the talks stalled several times early this year and were 
suspended during the leadership transition in poland over the 
summer 
a broad agreement resolving all outstanding problems between 
poland and west germany was reached on oct 3 clearing the way for 
kohls visit

three railroad boxcars of plywood from 
the pacific northwest arrived thursday in what officials called the 
largest single donation of building materials since hurricane hugo 
struck 
but as shipments of relief supplies begin to taper off five 
weeks after the storm mayor joseph p riley jr said he is 
concerned about meeting the needs of a rebuilding effort that could 
take as long as two years 
the city is coming back but the great problem is housing 
riley said were going to be rebuilding homes in the aftermath 
of hugo for a couple of years we need money and building supplies 
in tremendous quantities 
the storm destroyed 3437 homes and caused major damage to 
13757 in the charleston area said howard chapman who is 
coordinating the citys relief effort 
local homebuilders could build only about 8000 new homes in the 
charleston area in a year chapman said 
that gives you an idea of the magnitude of how long its going 
to take he said 
its going to take a long long time riley agreed 
the donated plywood will be used to repair homes both in 
charleston and outlying areas hardhit by hugo which smashed into 
the state with 135 mph winds on sept 21 
the materials will be used in part by charlestons heartline 
program and charleston countys raise the roof program in which 
volunteers help make repairs to damaged homes for those who cant 
afford such repairs 
the classic example would be the poor family which has no 
insurance they dont have insurance because they dont have a lot 
of things in some instances insurance was hard to get because 
they were in a rural area that didnt have a fire department the 
mayor said 
some people may be eligible for money from the federal emergency 
management agency and in those cases what were trying to do is 
fill the gaps riley said 
the boxcars of plywood were shipped by a group known as the 
oregon lands coalition which represents 10 organizations in both 
washington and oregon said rita kaley of hood river ore 
we really want it to go to the people in need but of course 
everyone is in need right now she said 
part of the shipment was donated by stevenson coply inc of 
stevenson wash and one of the boards was autographed by workers 
at the plant 
above the signatures was a message which read our thoughts go 
with you in your crisis

them all the time said ohio native john tsugranes whose two 
palm beach county floral shops sell bags of leaves ranging in price 
from 1 to 12 but after 18 years here without fall i sort of 
miss them 
most of the leaves are brought in from the carolinas though 
some come from as far away as oregon and canada florists who 
douse them with preservatives to maintain their color say oak and 
maple leaves are best 
at publix supermarkets the leaves go for 99 cents a branch

an unpublished and nearly forgotten story by 
robert louis stevenson will appear in the fall issue of the georgia 
review the university of georgias literary magazine 
the story the enchantress was handwritten in pencil by 
stevenson probably in 1889 on a ship en route from hawaii to 
samoa according to an announcement thursday from the university 
the ailing author who wrote treasure island and other 
classics spent the last five years of his life on samoa 
the 27page manuscript was held by private collectors until it 
was acquired recently by yale university the announcement said 
yale had not yet cataloged the story 
david mann a professor at miami university of ohio found it at 
yale while doing research on another project and recognized it 
scholars had known of its existence and believe it is the last of 
stevensons unaccountedfor completed manuscripts 
in an introduction in the georgia review mann speculates that 
stevensons heirs declined to publish the story because it was too 
biographical one of its characters closely resembled stevensons 
wife who had divorced someone else to marry the author 
the story apparently was written as part of an agreement that 
each passenger on the cruise would write a story to be read to the 
others mann said 
were delighted that professor mann and yale chose to offer 
the story to us first said stanley lindberg editor of the 
georgia review and a professor of english at the university of 
georgia 
it has value both as a story worth reading today and as a 
piece of literary history

the soviet military intervention in 
afghanistan was immoral unnecessary and partly to blame for the 
countrys current plight a top government official said thursday 
the remarks of karim masiq the mayor of kabul and member of the 
central committee of the ruling peoples democratic party were the 
first time a government official has openly criticized moscows 
decision to send troops to afghanistan 
masiq in a wideranging interview with western reporters also 
said his party which for years has adhered to marxist economic 
policies now wants the private sector to expand and help save 
afghanistans people from starvation 
even private merchants selling stolen goods will not be 
prosecuted he said because they are still involved in bringing 
necessary goods to the market 
masiq a former political prisoner and shortstory writer was 
appointed wednesday to the central committee as the ruling party 
held its first plenum since soviet troops withdrew in february 
unlike last years meeting when security forces rounded up 
hundreds of members of opposing political factions this years 
plenum exuded an atmosphere of intraparty unity diplomats said 
on monday soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze said 
moscows invasion of afghanistan was illegal and violated cvil 
norms and ethics masiq agreed with that and called the incursion 
immoral 
it is very clear that it was unnecessary masiq said and 
it is only natural that the afghanistan people would defend against 
the soviet force 
significantly masiq did not criticize the united states or 
other countries for aiding the moslem guerrillas known as the 
mujahedeen or holy warriors during the soviet involvement 
but he said they were wrong to continue supporting the rebels after 
the soviets left afghanistan 
there are no mujahedeen now masiq said we are the 
mujahedeen 
he said that although many factors have hurt afghanistan the 
soviet military presence had added to the problems in this poor 
country 
although masiq is the first government official to openly 
criticize the soviet incursion other public figures have done so 
recently tuesday night a leading religious figure told staterun 
tv he thought the intervention was wrong a group of former 
officials who served under the deposed king zahir shah have made 
similar statements 
the campaign appears to be part of president najibs attempts to 
broaden the base of his government among a people who strongly 
opposed the soviet military presence and have little love for 
moscow 
masiq is a member of the khalq or masses faction of the ruling 
party in 1979 he was on the central committee and the 
policymaking politburo when the soviet troops entered afghanistan 
khalq forces who came to power in 1978 in a militarybacked 
communist coup opposed the soviet incursion many faction members 
including masiq were jailed 
since the soviet withdrawal the government of najib who leads 
the parcham or flag faction has rehabilitated leading khalq 
members in an attempt to heal the party rift and improve relations 
with the military 
khalq has traditionally held sway among the armed forces while 
parcham is strong among intellectuals 
masiq was recently released from house arrest and appoined mayor 
of kabul his appointment to the central committee was another move 
at at peacemaking 
in the interview masiq said the government would welcome all 
former rebels and help them get settled he said even mercenaries 
who became rich by selling weapons and using the money to buy land 
would be helped 
the state supports all these poeple because they are tired of 
war he said it is better than rockets

local officials raised a stink about 
it so a waste disposal company decided against accepting a train 
loaded with smelly sewage sludge from baltimore and sent it back 
they took the pooh pooh choochoo where it belongs they 
took it out of this parish said jim simmons president of the 
police jury the governing body of assumption parish 
gsx land treatment inc had subcontracted with an engineering 
firm to take the nonhazardous sewer sludge from a failed baltimore 
composting firm that bought the 12000 tons of sludge from the city 
of baltimore that city is under a state order to dispose of 
200000 tons of sludge by the end of november 
gsx had intended to dispose of the sludge at its land farm 
in nearby white castle la essentially a landfill where 
nonhazardous waste is plowed into the ground some cities process 
sewer sludge and sell it as fertilizer or soil conditioner 
but residents of assumption parish complained vehemently about 
the stench of the train which also had passed through 
donaldsonville in ascension parish 
the company moved its unloading operation to a less populated 
site near labadieville after donaldsonville city attorney sidney 
marchand filed a motion in court to stop the operation 
after district attorney donald carmouche threatened to do the 
same thing on behalf of the assumption parish police jury gsx 
agreed to keep its unloading operation out of the area 
although gsx did accept 27 cars full of the sludge it sent 63 
others cars back and agreed it wouldnt take an additional 110 cars 
not yet shipped to louisiana 
carmouche said the waste train pulled out of the area wednesday 
and was headed back to maryland although there was no confirmation 
of its destination from baltimore officials or gsx 
for the first time baltimore waste is going where it belongs 
baltimore carmouche told the police jury 
disposing of sewer waste isnt illegal in louisiana but 
officials said they objected to taking outofstate waste 
especially outofstate waste that smelled so bad 
gsx facility manager dan martin said the company was spending 
more than anticipated trying to keep the sludge from smelling 
joseph harrison manager and vice president of supreme sugar in 
assumption parish said hes glad the controversy is over and that 
the smells from the waste train arent mixing with the strong odors 
from his companys refinery 
pooh pooh and sugar dont go together he told the police 
jury 
earlier this month five smelly railroad cars full of rotting 
household trash were sent back to philadelphia after indiana 
officials won a court order blocking a plan to dump the garbage in 
their state that garbage was headed for a landfill near brazil 
ind but the state said the four companies involved in carting the 
trash lacked a permit allowing it to be transferred from railroad 
cars to dump trucks 
that wasnt philadelphias first problem with longdistance 
disposal a freighter sailed the seas for two years searching for a 
place to dump 14000 tons of ash from city incinerators the load 
was rejected by 11 countries before the ship turned up empty in 
singapore late in 1988 after changing names and owners 
before that a barge loaded with trash from new yorks long 
island was rejected by states down the atlantic and gulf coasts and 
central american nations before it was sent back

deaths from colon and rectal cancer diseases 
that kill about 55000 americans a year are highest along an 
unexplained line from maine to iowa us cancer specialists said 
thursday 
the national centers for disease control reported that the 
highest mortality rates from colorectal cancer occurred in the 
northeast and the eastern northcentral states from maine with a 
death rate of 258 per 100000 people in 1986 south to maryland 
with 272 across to iowa with 248 and in virtually every state 
in between 
the district of columbia had the nations highest mortality rate 
at 321 
nationwide the mortality rate from colorectal cancer has been 
declining and is now 231 per 100000 55811 americans died of the 
disease in 1986 the cdc said 
in the northeast only connecticut at 245 delaware at 238 
and vermont at 224 had colorectal cancer death rates below 25 per 
100000 other high rates were new hampshire 261 massachusetts 
263 new york 273 new jersey 271 rhode island 287 
pennsylvania 266 ohio 264 indiana 259 and illinois 256 
no other state exceeded a rate of 24 
wyoming had the lowest rate at 162 the atlantabased cdc 
reported 
the pattern more cancer deaths in the northeast fewer in the 
west resembles one researchers have already seen in heart 
disease but they dont know why said dr robert a hahn a cdc 
cancer researcher 
we dont know enough about the risk factors or their 
distribution to say why that region is one with the highest 
rates hahn said we doubt its just a matter of physical 
environment but we just dont know 
while few risk factors for colorectal cancer have been firmly 
established evidence points to highfat diets as risky and 
suggests that fruits and vegetables may help protect against the 
disease the cdc said 
obesity and a highcalorie lifestyle also may increase the risk 
while exercise may lower it the cdc added 
approximately 145000 colorectal cancer cases are diagnosed in 
the united states each year hahn estimated 
colorectal cancer accounted for 12 percent of all cancer deaths 
in the united states in 1986 incidence of the disease has risen in 
recent years from a rate of 493 cases per 100000 americans in 
1979 to 505 in 1986 hahn said 
but the mortality rate has dropped from 248 deaths per 100000 
in 1979 to 231 in 1986 
detection of disease at an earlier stage might account for 
some of the increase in survival the cdc said stool blood 
screening a noninvasive and relatively inexpensive 
technique appears to detect a higher proportion of colorectal 
cancers at earlier stages 
the cdc also noted that colorectal cancer is primarily a 
cancer of the older population the median age of diagnosis from 
198286 was 71 years for cancer of the colon and 69 for rectal 
cancer 
only three in 100000 30to34yearolds developed colorectal 
cancer compared to 532 in 100000 in the 85andolder category 
the case rate in 1986 was 61 per 100000 for men compared with 
43 per 100000 for women

president bushs principal campaign promises 
the white house showed little enthusiasm for the gop move 
merely expressing a willingness to go along 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas accusing democrats 
of pure politics and crying wolf said the gop might also 
use the capitalgains issue as a bargaining chip in negotiations to 
reduce the cost of the 989 million democratic aid package for 
eastern europe the republicans want a 585 million total 
sen robert packwood rore introduced the taxcut proposal 
fiercely opposed by the senates democratic leadership as an 
amendment to the aid bill the move late wednesday halted all 
action on the measure 
packwood said on thursday that a majority of senators including 
several democrats favor a cut but he acknowledged he does not 
have the 60 votes needed to shut off a filibuster 
mitchell dmaine told the senate obviously the capital 
gains issue has nothing to do with aid to eastern europe obviously 
the only effect can be to delay and perhaps kill aid to poland and 
hungary 
mitchell who later said the delay in passage of the 
authorization bill could stall action for a week called the gops 
move unwise and almost baffling 
the leaders of polands noncommunist government have stressed 
the importance of prompt action as much as the nature and level of 
the assistance itself the majority leader said 
noting that winter is approaching and that inflation is 
skyrocketing mitchell said this is one of those cases where 
assistance provided too late will be of no assistance at all 
the administration has made clear that it believes the capital 
gains reduction is more important than aid to poland and hungary 
mitchell said 
but dole noting that food aid already is on the way to poland 
said delaying the bill will have no negative impact especially 
since it is an authorization and does not actually appropriate any 
money for the two countries 
all of this wringing of hands is pure politics dole said 
its the old democratic game of crying wolf 
although dole insisted he would force the matter to a 
conclusion the white house appeared only mildly enthusiastic 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the 
administration was generally supportive of the packwooddole 
strategy and was willing to go along with it 
fitzwater said the decision to link capital gains with aid to 
poland and hungary was made on capitol hill and that the 
administration did not have much advance warning stressing that 
the administration does want a vote on a capital gains tax cut 
fitzwater said were certainly willing to see what happens

said hed pay cold hard cash for a happy way to end the world 
turner chairman of the turner broadcasting system which 
includes wtbs creator of cable news network and owner of two 
atlanta sports teams told members of the national newspaper 
association that the biblical ten commandments do not relate to 
current global problems such as overpopulation and the arms race 
were living with outmoded rules turner said the rules 
were living under is the ten commandments and i bet nobody here 
even pays much attention to em because they are too old 
when moses went up on the mountain there were no nuclear 
weapons there was no poverty today the commandments wouldnt go 
over nobody around likes to be commanded commandments are out 
so turner listed 10 rules of his own 
he called them the ten voluntary initiatives and said they 
would have people vowing among other things to help the

former hud secretary samuel pierce informed a 
house subcommittee today he will again refuse to answer its 
questions about mismanagement and political favoritism at the 
department he led for eight years 
because he plans to invoke his constitutional right against 
selfincrimination pierce through his attorneys asked the panel 
to cancel a hearing friday and another session next week at which 
he has been subpoenaed to testify 
pierce who headed the department of housing and urban 
development throughout the reagan administration said that forcing 
him to appear would subject him to unnecessary adverse publicity 
and be punitive 
it was not immediately clear whether the subcommittee would 
grant the request but a congressional aide said there were no 
plans to cancel fridays hearing 
pierces attorneys in a letter to the house government affairs 
subcommittee on employment and housing 
upon the advice of counsel mr pierce will again invoke his 
rights under the fifth amendment of the constitution mr pierce is 
concerned that there continues to be an atmosphere wherein he 
remains a target of the subcommittee hearings 
the attorneys paul l perito and robert plotkin asked the 
subpoenas be vacated 
the stalemate between pierce and the subcommittee has brought 
the investigation to a crossroads the former secretary and three 
of his deputies have refused to cooperate with the panel and some 
members say it should move past the investigative phase and work on 
reform initiatives 
but its chairman rep thomas lantos dcalif has raised the 
possibility of granting immunity to two former pierce deputies who 
also have refused to testify in hopes their accounts would shed 
light on pierces role in fraud mismanagement and 
influencepeddling at hud 
after pierce refused to testify last month several subcommittee 
members questioned whether he had waived his constitutional 
protections when he appeared before the panel voluntarily in may 
pierces attorneys disputed such interpretations of the law and 
house rules and lantos said he would rule on the question he 
informed pierces attorneys of his finding today but they declined 
to discuss it 
a congressional source however indicated that lantos had 
concluded he could compel pierce to testify but was inclined not to 
do so 
pierces latest move comes as his attorneys stepped up their 
effort to defend him by challenging the sworn account of a former 
hud official shirley wiseman who said pierce personally ordered 
her to fund a north carolina project over the objections of several 
department officials 
prior to her testimony pierce in his initial appearance before 
the subcommittee said he took no direct role in funding decisions 
lawmakers who have accused the former secretary of misleading them 
and possibly commiting perjury often refer to wisemans account 
in 1985 when huds inspector general questioned wiseman about 
the project she said pierces top aide spoke to her about 
approving it but never mentioned a conversation with pierce 
according to the notes of the investigator who interviewed her and 
a memo he prepared for pierces lawyers 
perito said pierce acknowledges supporting the development the 
conversion of a hosiery mill into housing but cannot recall the 
conversation she told congress took place 
if she didnt mention the call from the secretary months after 
the project was funded it seems strange that she can remember it 
so clearly years later perito said he said the subcommittee 
staff had access to the same documents before it questioned wiseman 
but never asked her about the seeming inconsistency 
although congress may never get to question pierce again about 
his role at hud it appears likely he will issue a written rebuttal 
of allegations raised in congressional hearings and media accounts 
of fraud mismanagement and influence peddling during his 
eightyear tenure 
my client certainly has a story to tell and wants to tell his 
story but needs to decide the how and when and where of doing so 
said perito

major environmental groups accused the bush 
administration thursday of having no plans no action and no one 
in charge to deal with global warming which many scientists say 
could cause severe problems by the middle of the next century 
the criticism came amid reports that top advisers to president 
bush were divided on how aggressively the united states should push 
for specific commitments on reducing socalled greenhouse 
pollutants 
eleven environmental groups at a news confernce accused the 
president of reneging on a campaign promise to tackle the global 
warming issue early in his presidency bush said during the 
campaign that he would host an international conference on global 
warming and other environmental issues during his first year in 
office 
the other industrial countries are looking at the united 
states for leadership but we have silence from the president 
and total disarray within the administration said brooks yeager 
governmental affairs director for the audubon society 
we have great rhetoric but no leadership declared dan 
becker of the sierra club there are no plans no action no one 
in charge 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said we feel 
progress has been made in confronting concerns about expected 
rising world temperatures because of the enormous manmade 
pollutants allowed into the air 
but fitzwater said pollution curbs should not be proposed 
unilaterally and the administration must consider the longterm 
economic impacts of any actions aimed at dealing with global 
warming 
there are economic aspects of this that cannot be ignored just 
blindly in the search for global warming said fitzwater 
the latest round of criticism was prompted by reports of 
disagreement within the administration on whether to send a 
delegation to an upcoming conference of environmental ministers in 
the netherlands 
william k reilly administrator of the environmental protection 
agency said on wednesday that he would head a delegation to the 
conference nov 67 but that the united states was not prepared to 
endorse a proposed commitment for a freeze by the year 2000 on 
greenhouse gases at current levels 
the dutch government has said it plans to propose such a freeze 
at the conference and environmentalists have argued even a freeze 
is inadequte calling for at least a 20 percent reduction by the 
end of the century 
administration sources speaking on the condition they not be 
named acknowleged that until recent days it was not even certain 
that reilly would attend the conference 
reilly declined to discuss reports of discord within the 
administration on the global warming issue the president has 
made it very clear we recognize the global warming problem he 
said but he added a whole range of questions remain to be 
resolved 
environmentalists said uncertainty within the administration has 
sent a signal to european leaders that the bush administration is 
not prepared to lead the effort to curb global warming pollutants 
although the united states accounts for onefifth of the worlds 
greenhouse gases 
this is a major meeting said christopher flavin a global 
warming expert at the worldwatch institute its been in the 
planning stage for the better part of a year the united states 
just doesnt have its act together 
the environmental groups called for the united states to endorse 
a 20 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by the year 
2000 such cuts would require sharp increases in automobile fuel 
efficiency and other energy conservation measures many scientists 
say unless these pollutants are curbed the world will see 
significant increases in world temperatures by the middle of the 
next century 
other major environmental groups critical of the bush 
administration included the natural resources defense council 
friends of the earth and the environmental defense fund

israeli manufacturers have filed a police 
complaint against an arab pastamaker whose packages of spaghetti 
are red white green and black the colors of the outlawed 
palestinian flag 
a spokesman for the israeli manufacturers association said 
thursday the group has asked police to investigate the al ghazel 
macaroni co in the occupied west bank city of bethlehem 
we asked police to investigate why they are allowed to 
distribute the flag in this way it should be considered against 
the law said danny leish the spokesman for the group israels 
largest industrial association 
the palestinian flag is illegal in israel and the occupied 
territories israel considers it the flag of the palestine 
liberation organization which the government defines as a 
terrorist organization 
the spaghetti dispute is the latest in a long string of battles 
over the flag during the 22monthold palestinian uprising it also 
reflects israeli anger over at economic slump blamed partly on the 
revolt which has sent unemployment to a record 95 percent 
wadi abu eta the owner of al ghazel could not be reached for 
comment his factory is on the edge of beit sahour a village that 
the army has declared a closed area since it has boycotted israeli 
taxes during the uprising telephone lines to the area also are cut 
ruth shlesinger a spokeswoman for national police in jerusalem 
declined comment on the complaint filed two weeks ago 
leish denied the complaint was aimed at harming an arab 
competitor but acknowledged israeli food manufacturers were among 
the hardest hit by israels recession 
israeli food companies have lost 100 million in the last 22 
months and had to cut about 1000 jobs leish said 
he blamed much of the damage on a boycott of israeli products by 
the 17 million arabs of the west bank and gaza strip as part of 
the uprising against occupation 
the problem is compounded leish said by arab competitors who 
market products within israel in package that have hebrew but not 
arabic letters 
he noted al ghazels spaghetti has only hebrew letters on its 
package with red white green and black strips and added the 
manufacturers group has asked the army to insist arab products be 
clearly identified 
palestinian manufacturers also have complained that israeli 
products sold in the occupied lands often are not tagged with their 
place of origin 
packaging and lettering are only some of the symbols that are 
fought over in the palestinian uprising soldiers and police 
regularly force arab youths to pull down palestinian flags and 
sometimes order them to remove shirts in the flags colors 
earlier this week the hadashot daily reported an israeli 
hospital refused to register a bedouin arab baby girl given the 
popular uprising name tahrir arabic for liberation 
israeli reports on al ghazal spaghetti noted the package also 
bears a kosher stamp showing it conforms with jewish dietary laws

the bush administration notified the soviet 
union on thursday that it is willing to discuss an offer by foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze to curtail military bases in europe 
we support that aim and are willing to work with them to 
preserve their security through political rather than military 
means the state department said 
the administration gave a quick brushoff however to another 
soviet arms control initiative an offer by president mikhail s 
gorbachev to make the baltics a nuclear free zone coupled with an 
announcement he would withdraw four nuclear submarines from the 
area 
it seems rather curious to me assistant secretary of state 
raymond seitz said i am not aware there are nuclear weapons in 
the baltic republics although there may be 
secondly seitz told reporters at a washington journalism 
seminar he is making a declaration about moving nuclear weapons 
from what he regards as national territory so in terms of the 
internationalism of it it doesnt make much sense to me 
seitz who runs the european affairs bureau added at first 
blush i would find it troubling because it seems to be kind of 
sleightofhand 
the white house also dismissed the initiative but the state 
department warmed to shevardnadzes proposal on european bases 
which also got short shrift from the white house earlier in the 
week 
a statement issued by the departments press office said similar 
soviet proposals in the past appeared to be aimed at the 
elimination of us bases on foreign soil we cannot accept such 
an outcome the statement said we maintain bases as part of a 
successful system of collective defense which has assured our 
security and that of our friends and allies 
however the state department said the proposal tuesday by 
shevardnadze in a moscow speech could mean the soviets now are 
searching for ways to disengage from some of their foreign military 
commitments particularly in europe 
defense secretary dick cheney said in europe meanwhile that 
were always looking at base structure especially in a time of 
tight budgets and he noted that us operations at torrejon in 
spain were based phased out at the request of the spanish 
government the f15 jet fighters stationed there are being moved to 
italy 
gorbachev in a speech in helsinki finland said the soviet 
union had removed all tactical nuclear missiles that could strike 
the baltic region and would take certain types of sealaunched 
nuclear weapons out of the baltic sea 
the soviet leader said the eventual goal was to rid the baltic 
of nuclear weapons 
we are prepared to come to agreement with all the nuclear 
powers and the baltic states on effective guarantees for the 
nuclearfree status of the baltic sea he said 
gorbachev said the steps were being taken unilaterally and were 
a followup to a speech he gave two years ago in the soviet 
northern port of murmansk many of his proposals in that speech 
including a call for a nuclearfree zone in northern europe were 
dismissed by the north atlantic treaty organization 
initially marlin fitzwater the white house spokesman said 
we do not believe nuclearfree zones contribute to security in 
europe most of these proposals have been designed to affect nato 
deterrence capability while leaving soviet nuclear weapons intact 
on the other hand we do appreciate the intent of this and if it 
can develop into something concrete why that might be a hopeful 
sign 
a few hours later fitzwater returned with a colder assessment 
a notice to the press said the united states remains 
opposed to the concept of nuclear weapons free zones in europe or 
in waters surrounding europe because we think such zones do not 
make a real contribution to preserving european security and 
stability 
also a bush administration official speaking on condition of 
anonymity called the proposal another step in marching toward 
their goal of getting nuclear weapons out of europe primarily 
ours

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
said thursday that moscow will cut its nuclear forces in the baltic 
sea and will destroy four aging submarines and the nuclear missiles 
they carry 
gorbachev also said the soviet union has removed all tactical 
nuclear missiles that could strike the northern european region and 
will take certain types of sealaunched nuclear weapons out of the 
baltic sea 
in a 45minute speech to finnish business leaders politicians 
and other guests on the second day of a threeday visit to finland 
gorbachev repeated his hope to eliminate nuclear weapons from the 
148600squaremile baltic sea 
we are prepared to come to agreement with all the nuclear 
powers and the baltic states on effective guarantees for the 
nuclearfree status of the baltic sea he said in a nationally 
broadcast speech in helsinkis finlandia hall 
gorbachev said the soviet union was taking the steps 
unilaterally dropping previous conditions that western countries 
first agree to a nuclearfree zone 
in washington white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
said we do not believe nuclearfree zones contribute to security 
in europe 
most of these proposals have been designed to affect nato 
deterrence capability while leaving soviet nuclear weapons 
intact fitzwater said on the other hand we do appreciate the 
intent of this and if it can develop into something concrete why 
that might be a hopeful sign 
later fitzwater revised his remarks saying in fact we do 
not consider this a hopeful sign 
gorbachev said the steps were a followup to a speech he gave 
two years ago in the soviet unions northern port of murmansk in 
which he first proposed a nuclearfree zone in northern europe two 
nato countries in the region norway and denmark do not permit 
nuclear weapons in their territory in peacetime 
gorbachev said the soviet union already has taken two of its six 
golfclass submarines out of operation from the baltic sea and 
pledged to destroy the remaining four by the end of next year 
in his murmansk speech gorbachev had offered to remove 
nucleararmed subs from the baltic sea and soviet officials offered 
to withdraw the remaining four only if countries of the region 
agreed on a nonnuclear north 
on thursday he dropped that requirement 
the soviet union started by removing from operational status 
two golfclass submarines and before the end of 1990 it will 
destroy the four remaining submarines of the same class we will 
also destroy their standard nuclear missile payloads and we have no 
plans for their replacement he said 
six golf ii subs 321 feet long with a displacement of 2950 
tons have been deployed in the baltic sea since 1976 according to 
the british reference book janes fighting ships the soviets have 
said the subs carried 18 ballistic missiles 
the stockholm international peace research institute has 
described the golf ii as obsolete and predicted they would be 
removed from service because they are of limited value 
gorbachev did not specify which types of sealaunched nuclear 
weapons the soviets would remove from the sea 
the united states has expressed concern that removal of the 
sealaunched missiles cannot be verified and it has balked at 
their inclusion in a superpower arms pact being negotiated in 
geneva 
finnish officials welcomed gorbachevs announcements and they 
also are likely to please grassroots political groups in the baltic 
republics of estonia latvia and lithuania that have urged the 
kremlin to remove nuclear weapons from the region 
in another announcement gorbachev said the kremlin has agreed 
to norways proposal to negotiate mutual notification of accidents 
involving ships including nuclearpowered submarines 
three soviet nuclearpowered submarines have been involved in 
accidents since april in the barents and norwegian seas 
in other comments gorbachev 
reversed decades of finlandization pressure on finland 
to toe the kremlin line by saying to applause the soviet union 
unreservedly recognizes finlands neutral status 
proposed that the next followup meeting to the 1975 helsinki 
accords which outlined eastwest security measures cooperation in 
economic and scientific and human rights affairs be held in 1992 
in helsinki and be attended by leaders of the 35 states involved 
paved the way for direct contacts between legislators in the 
soviet baltic republics and scandinavian countries grouped in the 
nordic council 
gorbachev seeking finnish help in modernizing the soviet 
economy met with industrialists and reviewed finnish developments 
in a range of industries from forestry to clothing for seamen on 
icebreakers or arctic construction workers many of the companies 
represented at the meeting already have joint projects with the 
soviets but gorbachev said there should be more 
he showed special interest in pollutionmonitoring equipment for 
mining and metallurgy and asked how much they would add to costs 
he made clear he had in mind soviet industries in the kola 
peninsula bordering finland 
ive been there ive seen it with my own eyes he said of 
the pollution the target should be higher

the roman catholic church entered the 
world of polish primetime television thursday with the first 
broadcast of a regular weekly religious show believed to be the 
first such program in eastern europe 
the church which claims more than 90 percent of poles as 
believers has long sought access to television 
but while coverage of such major religious events as papal 
visits to poland and polishborn pope john paul iis christmas mass 
had been permitted in recent years the former communist rulers 
long balked at allowing regular religious programming 
finally in connection with a new law establishing the legal 
basis for the churchs activities in poland an agreement allowing 
the church television and radio programs was concluded in june with 
the previous communist government 
the rev andrzej koprowski the host of the new show said 
before the broadcast that it answers the needs of the 
overwhelmingly catholic society which had listed a demand for 
broadcast masses in the labor upheaval that gave rise to solidarity 
in august 1980 
koprowski said the church wants to present the forms of its 
presence in the world of culture in social problems and on a world 
scale 
on the show itself koprowski dressed in his black cassock 
welcomed cardinal jozef glemp the highest roman catholic authority 
in poland who in turn blessed the program the segment had been 
recorded earlier in the day 
i welcome television with great joy and hope a television 
which will broadcast programs of faith programs of the church and 
of believers said glemp who wore a large silver cross around 
his neck 
i attach great hopes to this service today technology 
especially in the mass media helps us a lot and we would like to 
be able to pass on a richness of spirit 
the program is being produced by a newly formed religious 
programs desk within the episcopate the administrative arm of 
polands bishops 
state tv said the programs are produced on church premises and 
its only responsiblity is to broadcast the shows it receives from 
the episcopate 
the 20minute church programs are to be appear each thursday at 
625 pm on polish channel 1 in addition channel 2 will 
broadcast a 20minute evening prayer on tuesdays at 630 pm 
two months ago the church began broadcasting weekly radio 
programs 
this has been a year of major achievements for the church with 
the signing in may of a bill by parliament guaranteeing the right 
of the church to operate legally 
in addition to glemps blessing the new show carried an 
interview with jerzy turowicz editor of the influential catholic 
weekly tygodnik powszechny who battled with communist authorities 
for years to keep publishing the paper he founded after world war 
ii 
television is a very powerful means of influencing people and 
public opinion it is a very valuable thing that the church in 
poland obtained the possibility to use this means and its very 
important to take full advantage of this big chance he said 
turowicz said he believed the program should not focus on church

society 
it should be about problems that the church is living with 
which the church must face about difficult problems which must be 
solved and should give catholics something to think about

president bush extended mostfavorednation 
trade status to hungary on thursday ending 15 years of us 
economic sanctions 
bushs action at a rose garden ceremony made hungary the first 
nation to be freed from trade restrictions imposed under the 
socalled jacksonvanik amendment which links human rights to 
trade policy 
the sanctions have been the centerpiece of us trade policy 
toward the communist world and remain largely in place against the 
soviet union and most nations in eastern europe 
but bush praised hungary which declared itself a democracy 
three days ago for riding at the crest of the historic tide 
of freedom sweeping eastern europe 
hungary fulfilled its part of the bargain and im here to 
fulfill our part of the bargain bush said 
he noted that he had promised hungary such trade treatment 
during his trip to budapest in july if the hungarian government 
took steps to liberalize its emigration policy 
the action gives hungary full access to us markets and the 
lowest possible tariff rates putting it on an equal footing with 
major us trading partners 
the jacksonvanik amendment to the trade act of 1974 denies 
trade benefits to nations that restrict emigration it is named 
after its congressional sponsors the late sen henry m jackson 
dwash and former rep charles vanik rohio 
bush said that hungary under legislation approved by its 
parliament on sept 26 now meets all the freeemigration 
requirements of us law 
todays action signals the recognition that a quiet 
revolution is taking place in thousands of shops and farms and 
factories bush said at a ceremony signing documents exempting 
hungary from the jacksonvanik sanctions it signals the rebirth 
of hungary as an entrepreneurial nation 
the people of america are exchanging more than blue jeans and 
fine wines were exchanging ideas and ideals that can only be the 
shared province of free people he added 
the jacksonvanik law requires an annual report to congress on 
the emigration policies of each nation covered under the 
restriction and an assessment of whether there has been progress 
toward unrestricted emigration 
bush signed a report to congress asserting that hungary does not 
deny its citizens the right or opportunity to emigrate 
there are no known cases of government refusal to allow 
emigration from hungary whether to join a close family member in 
the united states or for any other reason the report said 
on capitol hill meanwhile senate majority leader george 
mitchell said that us aid to poland and hungary will be delayed 
and perhaps killed by a republican attempt to inject capital gains 
tax reductions into the aid debate 
but republican leader bob dole accused democrats of injecting 
partisan politics into the debate over the size of the aid package 
and said republicans had no choice but to seek action on capital 
gains on every possible bill

deputies set out on horseback thursday 
to intensify the search of brown dry fields near the spot where an 
11yearold boy was abducted by a masked man with a gun 
hundreds of people have volunteered to help search for jacob 
wetterling some 600 people attended a prayer vigil wednesday 
this is an area of the country where tornadoes occur we have 
blizzards people get lost in them and die but how do you protect 
yourself against the stranger who steps out of the dark and 
snatches your child said anthony sorem who teaches psychology 
at two private schools in the area 
sunday night was the first time jacob had been allowed to ride 
his bicycle after dark to go to a convenience store when he 
planned to rent a videotape said his father jerry wetterling 
jacob was accompanied by his 10yearold brother trevor and an 
11yearold friend 
on the way back to the wetterlings house outside this central 
minnesota town of 2200 they were accosted by a man who had what 
appeared to be panty hose pulled over his head to distort his 
facial features 
the two boys who escaped told police the man pulled a gun and 
asked them their ages then ordered them to run away and threatened 
to shoot them not until they were a distance down the road did 
they realize jacob wasnt with them 
stearns county sheriffs lt charlie brigham said 43 special 
deputies from at least five central minnesota counties formed a 
volunteer posse thursday hoping to find clues that searchers on 
foot and allterrain vehicles might have missed in a 15squaremile 
area around the abduction point 
he said riding on horseback expands the searchers field of 
vision its unbelievable what you can do with these things 
brigham said 
charlie grafft the stearns county sheriff said the group was 
looking for any clues especially clothing that may have been left 
behind 
wetterling said he and his wife patty 39 a substitute school 
teacher had warned their four children to be wary of strangers 
my advice would be to take time to sit down and instruct 
children that there are sick people in the world said 
wetterling 41 a chiropractor and president of the st cloud 
chapter of the national association for the advancement of colored 
people 
they described jacob as an allaround student who loved to study 
math and play goalie on a youthleague hockey team 
ms wetterling said she expects jacob is trying to befriend his 
captor in an effort to escape hes incredibly patient she 
said she added that the boy hopes to be a veterinarian 
jacobs at an age where the world is full of possibilities 
ms wetterling said 
wetterling said they had received no ransom demands and doubts 
his civil rights activism is a factor in the abduction its an 
abnormal situation he said 
the kidnapping shook this quiet town which is the home the 
college of st benedict and is near the collegeville campus of st 
johns university the two schools where sorem is associate 
professor of psychology pictures of jacob have been posted in 
store windows throughout the area 
mark bina who lives near the wetterlings said he ordered his 
children to stay home at night when its dark theyre in 
theyre throwing a fit about it bina said 
sandy larson whose daughter goes to school with the wetterling 
children said she is taking her kids elsewhere to trickortreat 
on halloween 
were new in the area im taking them to our old 
neighborhood she said 
fbi spokesman byron giglerd said 20 agents have been assigned to 
the case 
the fbi released a personality profile of the type of person 
likely to have kidnapped jacob according to the profile the 
kidnapper is probably a sex offender a white male 25 to 35 years 
old with some type of physical deformity and is likely to work at 
some type of unskilled job

the justice minister on thursday ordered charles 
ng extradited to the united states to face murder charges in a 
string of sextorture slayings 
ng still could appeal the ruling and continue his fouryear 
fight against extradition to california where he is accused of 
murdering 12 people 
in a letter to defense lawyer don macleod lewis rejected 
defense arguments that he should refuse extradition unless 
california agrees to refrain from imposing the death penalty on ng 
macleod had argued that the death penalty is cruel and inhumane 
and that there is evidence it is applied in a racially biased 
manner he also raised questions about the jury selection process 
and the independence of california judges 
but lewis concluded that the us constitution and criminal law 
protect the rights of the accused 
canada accepts and has confidence in the body of criminal law 
and the manner in which it is administered in the united states 
said the minister 
the fact that the death penalty has been abolished in canada 
does not make extradition impossible under the canadian charter he 
said 
if criminals knew that by fleeing to canada they could escape a 
death sentence elsewhere canada would become a safe haven for 
such criminals in my view such a prospect is simply 
unacceptable he said 
ng a native of hong kong who was educated in britain and served 
in the us marines is charged with murder kidnapping and 
burglary in the deaths of 12 men women and children 
eleven deaths involved sex slayings at a cabin 120 miles east of 
san francisco the 12th involved the slaying of a san francisco 
disc jockey 
ng 28 is serving a 4year sentence for shooting a security 
guard in the hand in a bungled shoplifting attempt in calgary in 
1985 he has been fighting to avoid extradition upon completion of 
his sentence 
the supreme court of canada in a ruling delivered in august 
upheld lower court rulings in favor of extradition 
under the canadaus extradition treaty the final decision 
rests with the federal justice minister who has the option of 
refusing to extradite any prisoner unless american authorities 
agree not to impose the death penalty 
now that lewis has ruled in the case his decision could in turn 
be challenged in the courts in a second round of appeals 
ng came to canada after his alleged accomplice in the 
sexandtorture slayings leonard lake was arrested for 
shoplifting in san francisco and subsequently committed suicide 
lake later was linked to the grisly killings and disappearances 
of several people and the investigation led to the charges against 
ng

the soviet unions failure to communicate clearly 
the limits on a drastic devaluation of the ruble left confused 
experts businessmen and travelers scrambling for clarification 
thursday 
wednesdays announcement that the ruble would fall from 159 to 
16 cents but only for certain transactions was of enormous 
importance in international trade but where most governments are 
careful to speak quickly and precisely on such issues to avoid 
upsetting markets the soviet bureaucracy dribbled out confusing 
conflicting tidbits of information 
the original tass announcement on wednesday raised more 
questions than it answered it was only an izvestia newspaper 
article hours later that said the lower rate would apply to 
foreigners and those soviets going abroad but not to commercial 
transactions still there were gaping holes left and on thursday 
officials offered contradictory clarifications 
it doesnt seem to show a lot of coordination one western 
diplomat said speaking on condition of anonymity here we all 
are stumbling around trying to figure out what it means 
several westerners said they were told by highly placed soviet 
officials that foreign businessmen and diplomats living in moscow 
would enjoy the new more favorable exchange rate 
but vladislav lashinsky of the state banks protocol department 
said the lower rate would apply only to foreign tourists not to 
foreign residents 
foreign businessmen were left to speculate whether they could 
finance operations at the lower rate by bringing in tourists from 
the home office once a month carrying cash one diplomat wondered 
if he would be able to buy a roundtrip ticket from moscow to new 
york on aeroflot for 150 
lashinsky also said the lower rate will affect only the 
conversion of cash and travelers checks not purchases made by 
credit card 
neither the government tourist agency intourist nor the network 
of state hardcurrency stores were able to say how the new exchange 
rate would affect their sales which are priced in rubles but paid 
in dollars or other hard currency 
the change will help sop up some of the estimated 400 billion 
rubles of unspendable savings that is contributing to the countrys 
severe shortages 
izvestia said the devaluation was designed to restrict a serious 
drain on the national treasurys foreign currency reserves by 
soviet tourists flooding out to sample the onceforbidden fruits of 
the west though each has been allowed to convert a mere 200 rubles 
to foreign currency on leaving the country they have been paid at 
the official lopsided rate terrible for foreigners but great 
for soviets 
when thanks to new thinking and a new policy in the area of 
human rights thousands and hundreds of thousands of our citizens 
have received the possibility of free exit even the sale of a 
limited sum of hard currency at a symbolic price in rubles presents 
a serious financial problem izvestia said 
the devaluation could be disastrous for soviet tourists who 
instead of setting off overseas with 318 in their pockets will 
have only 3195 unless the government raises the 200ruble limit 
on how much they can exchange the change is scheduled to take 
effect nov 1 
even if the limit is altered soviets would have to pay 1252 
rubles or more than five months average salary instead of 200 
rubles to receive that same 318 in spending money

prime minister margaret thatcher on thursday 
defended plans to send thousands of vietnamese back to their 
communist homeland and said it is no different than the united 
states deportation of illegal aliens 
having already made clear its refusal to take in hong kong 
chinese when the colony reverts to chinese rule the government is 
facing additional public disapproval with its stance on the boat 
people 
most of the 56000 vietnamese in hong kong are being held in 
crowded prisonlike detention centers where violence rioting and 
infectious diseases have broken out 
britain maintains the majority have not fled political or 
religious persecution but are simply seeking a better standard of 
living than that available in vietnam 
each is being screened in accordance with standards set by the 
united nations high commissioner for refugees and mrs thatcher 
told the house of commons that only 13000 have been declared 
genuine refugees 
the foreign office said britain and vietnam have been discussing 
for several weeks how to handle the repatriation of those refused 
permission to stay in hong kong 
it would not say when a decision is expected or how many people 
would be affected newspaper reports put the figure as high as 
40000 and said britain is considering chartering aircraft to take 
them back 
foreign secretary john major said wednesday the influx of 
vietnamese into densely populated hong kong cannot be borne much 
longer 
we are seeking to cajole and persuade the vietnamese boat 
people to return but i now have to recognize that the problem in 
hong kong is acute and getting worse he said 
britains opposition labor party opposes forcible repatriation 
when lawmakers confronted mrs thatcher with the issue thursday 
one of them reminded her of the outrage in britain over the 1972 
mass expulsion of asians from uganda 
mrs thatcher retorted most countries repatriate illegal 
immigrants that is to say we also put back over the chinese 
border some 35000 illegal immigrants from china into hong kong 
each year the united states repatriates people to mexico and 
haiti theres nothing unusual about deporting to repatriate 
britain is expected to pay some compensation to the boat people 
it sends back so they can buy tools and seeds on their return a 
foreign office spokesman said it would likely be comparable to the 
600 paid to boat people who go home voluntarily 
so far 386 have returned voluntarily to vietnam and another 600 
to 700 have agreed to he said 
an international conference in geneva in june concluded that 
nonrefugees must go back to vietnam but it could not agree on 
when or how this should be done 
japan also has had an influx of vietnamese boat people so far 
3372 boat people supposedly from vietnam have arrived in japan 
this year compared with 219 in all of 1988 but immigration 
officials have found at least 1642 chinese nationals trying to 
enter japan by posing as vietnamese refugees 
a small wooden vessel believed to be carrying about 100 boat 
people was sighted thursday in the east china sea off southwestern 
japan the maritime safety agency reported 
a coast guard plane confirmed sighting the boat flying a 
vietnamese flag and a white flag marked sos

four state agents including an arson 
expert began an investigation thursday of an explosion at an amoco 
gas processing plant that killed one man and injured 11 
the prime thing is to find out what happened and to see also 
if there were any violations of osha rules said steve foster 
assistant administrator for the state occupational health and 
safety commission that agency sent three investigators and the 
fourth came from the state fire marshals office 
a malfunctioning valve in a compressor building at amocos 
anschutz ranch east gas processing plant may have caused the leak 
that led to wednesdays explosion but were not absolutely 
certain amoco spokesman dick brewster said thursday 
he said static electricity could have ignited the gas but 
emphasized that was just a possibility 
had it not been for some unusual event the gas might have 
simply escaped and been vented outside of the building brewster 
said this is one of those tragic things where there shouldnt 
have been ignition and there was 
david phipps plant operations center foreman said workers had 
little warning before the blast they heard the hiss of gas 
escaping just a few seconds before it ignited he said 
when it was realized there was gas escaping they shut down 
the compressor immediately and they were on their way out of the 
building brewster said some were outside and some were just 
inside 
he said there were 15 workers in the gas compressor building 
about onequarter mile from the plants main building in 
southwestern wyoming 
the dead man was struck by one wall of the steel building that 
was blown out by the blast 
it appears as if he had just gotten out the door when the 
explosion occurred brewster said 
brewster said a short fire followed the explosion 
once the explosion occurred the fire was over because the 
supply of gas to the building was cut off as soon as the leak was 
detected he said 
brewster said the plant had a good safety record before 
wednesdays explosion no workers had lost time on the job because 
of an injury in seven years

the state department said thursday that libyan 
leader moammar gadhafi was not telling the truth when he asserted 
that he has halted support for international terrorist activities 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said libya is still supplying 
funds weapons safe havens and training facilities to such groups 
as the japanese red army the provisional irish republican army 
the popular front for the liberation of palestinegeneral command 
and other terrorist groups 
in addition she said the notorious abu nidal organization 
a palestinian group otherwise known as the fatah revolutionary 
council is still headquartered in tripoli 
gadhafi acknowledged to an interviewer during a visit to egypt 
that libya once supported terrorist groups but he said he halted 
the aid once we discovered that these groups were causing more 
harm than benefit to the arab cause 
he said that hijacking planes and killing civilians are acts of 
murder that have nothing to do with combat libya he added 
should not be called to account for any of these acts because we 
have withdrawn our support of such groups he said 
but ms tutwiler said libya is still trying to acquire 
chemical weapons capability and is engaged in destabilizing efforts 
around the world 
we want to see irrevocable actions not pronouncements or 
short term adjustments that can be reversed 
the us government she said is interested in actions not 
words 
in the interview gadhafi said he would welcome a dialogue with 
the united states on the possibility of establishing friendlier 
relations 
we do not believe that conflict with the united states is 
necessary he said

the weather turned against volunteers 
thursday as they resumed the search for a 9yearold boy missing 
with his pony for more than three days in rugged southcentral 
oregon 
as the search began again at daybreak heavy snow was falling 
and the temperature was 20 degrees said klamath county search and 
rescue spokeswoman betty lucht 
the snow continued through the morning as about 130 people 
looked for the boy about a third of them on horseback said 
sheriffs spokesman dexter patmon 
nathan madsen who lives in rural veneta disappeared sunday 
afternoon while herding cattle with his family during an annual 
roundup family members said the boy and his 10yearold sorrel 
tony were inseparable and would have stayed together 
the number of searchers thursday was down from a high of about 
350 the day before but patmon said that was not necessarily bad 
since more searchers might obscure signs of the boy and his horse 
confusing the situation 
lucht said a us forest service crew of smokejumpers brought in 
to search through the night determined that a set of hoofprints 
found wednesday did not belong to the missing boys pony klamath 
county sheriff carl burkhart had called the hoofprints the first 
good news since the search began but lucht said they turned out 
to be prints left by a searchers horse 
contingency plans were in place to airlift the child to a 
hospital in bend if he is found said maj pat kelly of the us 
air force reserves 304th aerospace rescue and recovery squadron 
the unit sent two helicopters and a military transport airplane to 
the area wednesday to help in the search 
the poor weather kept the helicopters grounded thursday morning 
however said sheriffs dispatcher becky collins 
the temperature was below freezing for the fourth straight 
night but the sheriff said authorities were optimistic about the 
boys chances 
the boy was dressed in a slicker and chaps and his mother 
sarah madsen said earlier that she was confident her son could 
take care of himself until he is found

the seven warsaw pact foreign ministers 
assessed the revolutionary changes taking place in the east bloc 
thursday at the military alliances first meeting since solidarity 
took over the leadership in poland 
noncommunist foreign minister krzysztof skubiszewski of poland 
welcomed the warsaw pacts foreign affairs committee as well as the 
ministers for foreign trade from each country also invited to 
attend the two days of talks 
skubiszewski stressed that despite the government change poland 
wants to maintain friendly mutually advantageous ties with its 
warsaw pact partners and strict respect of mutual interests on 
the principle of equal rights 
although not officially on the agenda changes sweeping the 
region were expected to be the main topic in informal moments of 
the meeting 
since the foreign ministers last met a year ago the oncebanned 
solidarity movement has taken the reins of government in poland 
hungarys communist party has dissolved itself and become a 
democratic leftist party and the aging hardline leader of east 
germany erich honecker has been replaced by a younger man 
promising reform and dialogue with the opposition 
meanwhile the soviet union continues to press ahead with change 
in its fourth year under the leadership of mikhail s gorbachev 
only czechoslovakia bulgaria and particularly romania have 
resisted the trend toward reform 
illustrating the gulf of attitudes the pervade the alliance 
romania as recently as august tried to rally its warsaw pact allies 
to intervene to halt the formation of a solidarityled government 
as a threat to socialism according to documents leaked in poland 
the proposal found no support 
it is not customary for the committee of foreign ministers to 
discuss internal affairs of any country said foreign ministry 
spokesman stefan staniszewski of poland nevertheless i think 
the ministers taking part in the meeting will find an opportunity 
to share news and opinions concerning their countries 
he also said that certain problems concerning the future and 
evolution of the pact will be discussed 
skubiszewski told his fellow foreign ministers that he hoped the 
session would contribute to the construction of a lasting 
foundation of one indivisible europe 
developments in east germany shaken by protests and the exodus 
this year of 100000 of its citizens have renewed discussion on 
german reunification and even brought into question the future of 
two rival military alliances that have formed the basic 
geopolitical structure of europe since the late 1940s 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze said in moscow on 
monday that the soviet union would be interested in negotiating the 
dissolution of both nato and the warsaw pact by the year 2000 
for the time being though the two alliances do exist and one 
should aim for their gradually being transformed into 
politicalmilitary organizations through developing civilian trends 
of their activity with a simultaneous reduction of all military 
elements shevardnadze told pap in warsaw 
in addition to the broader issues warsaw pact foreign trade 
ministers were also invited to the meeting to discuss ground rules 
for reforming economic cooperation within the pact 
reformist tendencies in eastern europe which are gaining new 
territory apart from the traditional centers of ferment in warsaw 
and budapest cause questions about the future of the warsaw 
pact said a commentary thursday in the daily zycie warszawy 
the article titled ties chains or alliance said greater 
flexibility should be allowed among the pact countries while 
respecting the strategic interests of the dominant partner the 
soviet union 
all the reforms which no one could have imagined a few years 
ago will be accepted in moscow unless they lead to the questioning 
of membership in the warsaw pact the commentary said 
efforts aimed at renovating the warsaw pact are gaining new 
force which will speed up the final results the article said 
the warsaw pact the east bloc military alliance founded in 
warsaw in 1955 after the formation of nato by the united states and 
western europe consists of the soviet union poland east germany

president carlos menem said 
thursday he will not give in to wage demands by unions depite 
widespread strikes and growing opposition to his 4monthold 
government 
let them protest menem said of the strikes which have 
involved teachers subway workers metal workers court staff and 
employees at public ministries nobody is restraining their 
constitutional right and freedom to express their thought and 
sentiments 
menem made his statement to journalists after attending a 
celebration honoring the federal police 
the government has offered public employees an acrosstheboard 
raise of 12000 australs or about 16 a month through march 1990 
it told businesses their wage increases above 15 percent for that 
period may not be added to prices 
higher salary increases would fuel inflation which has been 
reduced through devaluation and wage and price guidelines to about 
7 percent this month in july it was 197 percent 
the 350000member metalworkers union has demanded an 82 percent 
pay raise which it claims is necessary to make up for cuts in real 
wages during recent months 
postal workers are seeking a 100 percent pay raise and bus 
drivers subway employees teachers airline personnel and others 
have demanded increases of up to 110 percent 
on wednesday unions representing employees at public ministries 
listened for five minutes to labor ministry undersecretary roberto 
digon then stormed out of the collective bargaining session 
we listened as the 12000 austral payment was made official 
but walked out because the offer cannot be modified and leaves no 
room for a counterproposal said andres rodriguez a delegate of 
the national civil personnel union 
the increase would bring monthly wages for most members of his 
union to about 78 rodriguez said 
the wage issue is a key test of the governments commitment to 
quell inflation which has ranged between 100 percent and 1000 
percent for years the cost of living soared by 38264 percent 
during the first nine months of this year 
the government also has introduced controversial legislation to 
privatize state industries attract foreign capital and revamp tax 
collections to narrow the perennial fiscal deficit 
governors of menems peronist party have spoken out against cuts 
in federal subsidies to businesses banks and payrolls in their 
provinces 
economy minister nestor rapanelli has quarreled with top menem

the government is settling a lawsuit filed by 
the widow of a communist party leader who was ostracized by his 
colleagues after the bureau planted a forged document falsely 
suggesting the man was an informant 
the 177000 settlement which will go to the widow of william 
albertson of new york city is the largest ever made in connection 
with abuses by the fbis cointelpro operation the american civil 
liberties union said thursday 
under cointelpro which stands for counterintelligence program 
the fbi used a variety of tactics to disrupt antiwar groups civil 
rights advocates and radical organizations in the united states 
the program ended in 1971 
albertson was a national committee member of the communist party 
in 1964 when the fbi created a phony report in which albertson 
appeared to be asking his fbi handler for more money according to 
internal bureau documents released as part of a lawsuit filed by 
albertsons wife lillie 
the fbi slipped the handwritten document signed bill into a 
car in which albertson rode to party meetings 
party members found the note confronted albertson didnt 
believe his denials that the document which appeared to be in his 
handwriting was forged and kicked him out of the party 
he was stripped of his job running a partyowned bookstore his 
wife and mother were expelled from the party and his children bore 
the stigma of having an informer for a father 
the fbi agents who set up the operation were recommended for 
incentive awards according to a july 7 1964 fbi headquarters memo 
released as part of the albertson case 
in a message to the field fbi director j edgar hoover said 
headquarters is extremely pleased with the sophisticated and 
imaginative counterintelligence action against albertson 
albertson spent the next eight years trying to clear his name 
with party officials and became increasingly depressed because he 
was having difficulty finding work his wife said 
it was really the destruction of a human being mrs 
albertson told a news conference at aclu offices its just not 
something the government should be doing 
he was committeed to socialism the community party the labor 
movement his mother said it would have been better had they killed 
him 
she said some of her husbands old party colleagues have told 
her recently that they never really believed he was an informer 
but she said some of those same people denounced him at the time 
the settlement ends a dispute over information the justice 
department says would endanger national security if it were 
publicly disclosed in the course of the lawsuit 
the department invoked the statesecret privilege to protect the 
information but a federal appeals court ruled 21 this year that 
albertson could proceed with the case 
in a dissent appeals court judge douglas ginsburg said the 
government had a legitimate and compelling interest in preventing 
disclosure of exceedingly senstive national security information 
disclosure of evidence would pose a serious risk to the 
personal safety of government informants assistant fbi director 
james geer said in an affidavit 
under the settlement the aclu agreed to move jointly with the 
government to vacate the appeals court opinion this would mean the 
apeallate court decision would not have any legal significance as a 
precedent 
as part of the settlement the justice department will withdraw 
a petition for supreme court review of the case 
both sides stipulated that the settlement was not an admission 
of liability or fault by the us government

the justice department charged thursday that a 
pittsburgh suburb is violating federal civil rights law by 
restricting the number of group homes for disabled people 
the departments civil rights division sought to join a private 
lawsuit against moon township pa by three mentally retarded 
persons who are trying to prevent their eviction from a group home 
the lawsuit challenges a township zoning ordinance stating that 
group homes cannot be located within a mile of one another a 
restriction the justice department contended discriminates against 
residents of such facilities 
moon township manager greg smith said the suburb has 14 or 15 
group homes and didnt object to others moving in but enacted the 
ordinance because township officials wanted the handicapped 
residents to have a normal neighborhood setting rather than be 
concentrated in a few areas 
the issue came to a head when four or five group homes opened in 
one apartment complex he said 
we didnt want to have one home after another in a row we 
wanted a normal situation smith said our basis was spread 
them out so that one neighborhood wouldnt be inundated 
the zoning code makes dwellings unavailable to persons on 
account of handicap in violation of the fair housing act the 
justice department said it sought an injunction to prevent the 
township from enforcing the provision 
the justice departments action marks the first time the federal 
government has sought under the newly amended fair housing act to 
set aside a zoning ordinance on the ground it is discriminatory 
said spokesman david runkel 
the fairhousing amendments which took effect last spring 
prohibit housing discrimination on the basis of a handicap the law 
allows the department to intervene in private discrimination 
lawsuits 
the justice department intends to use all of the new 
enforcement tools at our disposal under the amended fair housing 
act to redress housing discrimination james p turner acting 
head of the civil rights division said in a statement 
in june the department filed a suit charging that chicago 
heights ill had violated the fair housing act by denying a 
specialuse permit for the construction of a group home for 15 
mentally retarded adults that case is still pending in federal 
court in chicago

the un high commissioner for refugees 
resigned thursday amid allegations of financial impropriety 
mismanagement and favoritism to western donor nations 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar accepted jeanpierre 
hockes resignation effective wednesday said un spokesman 
francois giuliani 
on tuesday denmark called for an investigation of hockes use 
of danish refugee funds for firstclass air travel 
hockes letter to perez de cuellar read out by giuliani said 
at a time when you have decided based on a first evaluation 
which has just been presented to you to prolong and intensify an 
investigation which you initiated i do not wish my presence at the 
head of hcr to complicate in any way the ongoing investigation 
perez de cuellar has received a report by un auditors on 
hockes use of funds but its conclusions have not been disclosed 
hocke became high commissioner for refugees in 1986 as the 
favored candidate of the us state department 
the commissioner is officially responsible for at least 12 
million refugees worldwide although there are many more than that 
a separate un agency helps palestinian refugees 
officials of private relief agencies had expressed concern that 
hocke was bending to the restrictive national polices of major 
donor nations rather than speaking out as the protector of refugees 
worldwide 
western nations are adopting more restrictive refugee policies 
accepting only those who can prove they are politically persecuted 
and excluding economic refugees 
we do think that hocke was protective of the more 
restrictive actions taken by some developed governments including 
the united states said roger winter director of the us 
committee of refugees an umbrella group for refugee agencies 
hockes latest problems began in september when swiss 
television reported that internal documents showed he had drawn 
300000 since 1987 from a special educational fund set up by 
sweden and denmark to fly first class instead of business class 
hocke admitted he had flown first class a right reserved only 
for perez de cuellar under stringent un austerity measures but 
denied any impropriety he said he had flown first class on some 
long intercontinental flights when he had a busy work schedule 
hockes agency is struggling with a budget shortfall of 40 
million 
part of the criticism that he did not challenge the refugee 
policies of major donor nations came in january 1988 when he 
ordered the burning of all 138000 copies of the agencys monthly 
magazine refugees because it contained an article critical of 
west germanys policy 
hocke said the article was dated and that west germanys 
policies were improving the act greatly embarrassed bonn however 
a year ago an internal report by the un panel on 
discrimination and other grievances criticized hockes management 
practices 
the report condemned the personalization and centralization of 
authority around the high commissioner as being part of the cause 
of the rapidly growing management crisis at the refugee agency 
hockes staff was so demoralized that they began leaking 
documents to undermine him un officials have said among the 
documents were the air travel expense reports 
gerald hinteregger an austrian who heads the genevabased un 
economic commission for europe will serve as interim commissioner 
until perez de cuellar selects a replacement giuliani said 
the refugee agency spends about 500 million in aid money 
annually it has a staff of 2300 people including 800 in geneva 
and the rest as field specialists 
the united states japan and west germany are the leading 
contributors in that order 
hocke was a former director of operations of the international 
committee of the red cross

call it a walkaway a shooin a breeze or a 
coronation but a mayor by any other name than coleman a young 
doesnt look likely this election year despite the incumbents 71 
years four terms in office and a wellknown paternity suit 
two of his rivals in the primary have fallen in behind him the 
rev jesse jackson has come into the fold after a longstanding 
coolness and young has refused to debate his opponent saying there 
is nothing to talk about since the man has no record to discuss 
the man who wants to stop young from winning an unprecedented 
fifth term on nov 7 is accountant tom barrow 40 who has never 
held office and who lost to young in 1985 by 39 percent to 61 
percent 
barrow entered this years general election campaign with the 
momentum of his nonpartisan primary victory on sept 12 over 
13term congressman john conyers and city council president erma 
henderson 
conyers and another mayoral alsoran paint store owner charles 
costa endorsed young at the same news conference last week at 
which jackson announced his support henderson has held out even 
though she appeared at the press conference and despite youngs 
suggestion two weeks ago that the city council name a park in her 
honor 
results of a poll conducted for wjbktv and the wayne state 
university center for urban studies released wednesday showed young 
with 46 percent to barrows 29 percent with 17 percent undecided 
and 8 percent refusing to answer the poll of 310 registered voters 
had a margin of error of plus or minus 55 percent 
a poll conducted earlier this month for the detroit free press 
showed young with 51 percent to 35 percent for barrow with 14 
percent undecided 
jacksons endorsement seemed like the final blow young had 
incurred jacksons wrath by supporting michael dukakis in the 1988 
democratic presidential primary and by frequently criticizing 
jacksons credentials to run for president jackson supported 
conyers in the primary 
people who might have decided to support barrow just arent 
going to take a chance on him now wilbur rich a political 
science professor at wayne state university and the author of a 
young biography said thursday 
even the paternity lawsuit earlier this year was settled 
amicably young set up a trust fund for his 7yearold son joel 
loving and will provide for the boy through his 25th birthday 
young has campaigned steadily appearing at groundbreakings 
anniversaries and ribboncuttings as well as at dozens of the 
citys black churches 
he started the campaign with a fund of nearly 5 million actor 
james earl jones did the voiceovers for some of his early 
television ads barrows total fund is said to be less than 
250000 
rich said barrows lack of political experience has hindered him 
from getting support from other politicians he hasnt paid his 
dues and hes indicating that he isnt going to pay them rich 
said 
barrows campaign strategy generally has been one of attacking 
youngs leadership 
he has said this may be his last run for mayor even though 
young has indicated he will step aside in 1993 after two decades in 
office 
i dont think i have another shot barrow said i think 
this is it

the sponsor of a failed proposal to allow 
medicaid abortions for rape and incest victims said thursday that 
pressure will build on president bush to change his mind while she 
and allies look for a new opportunity to press the issue in 
congress 
rep barbara boxer dcalif sent a letter to bush on thursday 
signed by 74 members of congress asserting that a congressional 
majority favors the expansion of federally financed abortion 
they urged him not to again veto bills to which congress may add 
similar language a move that could put the abortion issue at the 
center of an impasse between the white hosue and congress 
we urge you to accept the will of the majority and not hold 
any more bills hostage in order to exert a minority view the 
letter said 
the house sustained bushs veto wednesday on a 231191 vote 51 
fewer than the twothirds majority needed to overturn a veto two 
weeks earlier the house for the first time in this decade voted to 
relax the restrictions on medicaid abortions 
the vote followed bushs veto on saturday of the provision 
which is but a paragraph in a 1567 billion appropriations bill 
for health education and labor programs for the 1990 fiscal year 
that began oct 1 
boxer in an interview said she and her allies have not decided 
whether to try to attach the same vetoed provision to the same 
bill which has now been sent back to the house appropriations 
committee 
house speaker tom foley said the democratic leadership in the 
house has not decided on how to handle the spending bill but said 
he expected further efforts to push the more liberal abortion 
provisions in an effort to force bush to relent 
i wasnt surprised by the outcome but its not going to be 
the last i think well hear on this issue this year foley said 
house republican leader robert michel of illinois told reporters 
that maybe some adjustments will have to be made in the current 
medicaid prohibitions because of the changing house sentiment 
michel voted with bush on the issue but said he has always favored 
permitting abortion in cases of rape or incest 
claiming that the vote was a victory because it showed there is 
now a majority in the house and senate in support of broader 
abortion rights boxer said her side was content to let the issue 
percolate while it decided where next to push it 
were going to win it eventually she said just keep 
building pressure on the president were going to let people 
contemplate whats happened and how times are changing on this 
issue 
in their letter the members of congress said that in past years 
they had gone along with the more restrictive abortion provisions 
in passing the full spending bill even though they objected to the 
abortion restrictions known as the hyde amendment 
the majority of the house has a new opinion on this and it 
should be respected just as those of us who disagreed with the 
restrictive hyde amendment accepted it as the will of the house and 
voted for the bill the letter said

president bush says he wont confer with 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega at a hemispheric meeting friday 
but will use every chance i get to complain about sovietbloc 
arms shipments to nicaraguas marxist government 
were not going down there to have some battle with mr 
ortega bush said before flying to costa rica for a twoday 
celebration of that centralamerican countrys 100 years of 
democracy ortega will be among the 18 heads of state engaging in 
informal discussions at the meeting 
bush said he hoped the summits focus on democratic government 
doesnt get cluttered up by members of the news media wanting 
to see a picture of me and ortega together 
bush spoke in a white house interview with latinamerican 
journalists on wednesday the transcript of his remarks was 
released thursday 
the president said it was somewhat ironic that mr ortega is 
there to salute democracy but nevertheless so be it thats 
good 
if he does encounter ortega at the summit he said it would 
be very firm because i dont see why that one sandinista regime is 
swimming against the tide of democracy 
bush criticized nicaraguas preparations for scheduled 
presidential elections on feb 25 as unfair to opposition 
candidates and he denounced sovietbloc shipments of weapons and 
ammunition to ortegas sandinista government 
the soviet union has denied shipping arms to nicaragua but the 
bush administration nevertheless contends that nicaragua is still 
shipping sovietbloc weapons to marxist rebels fighting the 
usbacked government of el salvador 
asked if he would bring up that problem at the costa rica 
meeting bush replied ill bring it up every chance i get 
the president said he also will continue to work with the 
soviet union which had promised to use its influence with 
nicaragua to halt arms exports 
we will make clear every chance we get to the soviets that 
that is not in their interests and certainly we view it against 
the security interests of the united states and we view it against 
the tide in terms of democracy bush said 
the united states complained to moscow on wednesday about a arms 
cache that was intercepted last week along the nicaraguahonduras 
border and found to contain several sovietproduced weapons us 
officials said the shipment was headed for salvadoran rebels 
referring to the ortega government the president asked why 
should that military clique who at one point were espousing their 
own marxist beliefs deny through having a military force far 
bigger than is required and bigger than any of its neighbors the 
will of the people 
as he heads for costa rica bush said i have no agenda with 
mr ortega and as he takes a step that might lead to democracy 
great im for that but were not going to solve any problems 
there in costa rica im there as a guest of the country 
bush extended a 1985 trade embargo against nicaragua on 
wednesday for another six months and let the costa ricans know he 
would refuse to sign any joint communique produced by the summit if 
it bore ortegas signature the plan for such a statement was 
scrapped after objections from other summit nations

president bush called for legislation thursday 
that would allow dangerous pesticides to be taken off the market 
more quickly saying the governments ability to ensure a safe food 
supply was being called into question 
but his proposed changes in how pesticides and other chemicals 
on foods are regulated were criticized immediately by 
environmentalists and some members of congress who said provisions 
of the presidents plan could instead make foods less safe 
while bushs proposal to streamline regulation was praised 
critics said other provisions of his plan would ease the risk 
levels used to determine if a pesticide is to be banned and also 
would have the government preempt state pesticidecontrol laws that 
often are stronger than federal rules 
the president in announcing the proposed legislation alluded 
to widespread publicity earlier this year over the use of alar on 
apples and the governments inability to remove the cancercausing 
chemical from the market swiftly 
these stories have fueled the public concern about cancer 
risks and more important for us have called into question the 
governments ability to ensure a safe supply of food for our 
citizens said bush in brief remarks at a white house photo 
session with administration officials and members of congress 
involved in food safety issues 
bush said he was convinced the country has the safest food 
supply in the world but that there also are valid concerns 
about the governments slow and cumbersome process for removing 
pesticides from the market 
the proposed food safety package which administration officials 
said would be sent to congress within weeks includes 
redefining the criteria to be used for temporarily removing 
or suspending from use a pesticide that poses a possible health 
hazard making it easier to get the chemical off the market even 
though formal proceedings might still be under way 
streamlining the procedures under which a dangerous pesticide 
may be permanently removed from the market officials said the new 
process would reduce by at least half the fourtoeight years it 
often takes for a chemical to be banned 
providing tougher enforcement against misuse of pesticides 
including a proposal to increase penalties from 5000 per day to 
25000 per day for violations 
environmentalists welcomed those moves 
however sen patrick leahy dvt said the administration 
is taking one step forward and two steps back when it weakens 
important food safety protection in exchange for some procedural 
improvements in pesticide regulations 
leahy chairman of the senate agriculture committee said the 
proposed shift in determining negligible risks from pesticides 
would make the safety standards ten times weaker for chemicals 
on some food products and could weaken them even more in some cases 
where economic considerations are weighed heavily 
under the presidents proposal the environmental protection 
agency may not have to take action against a pesticide even with a 
cancer risk as high as one in 100000 currently the standard is 
one cancer case in 1 million people exposed to a substance 
there is no justification for giving in to the pesticide 
industry and weakening the health and safety standard said sen 
edward m kennedy dmass 
kennedy whose labor committee has been considering pesticide 
regulations said the provision in the presidents plan that would 
raise the risk levels at which action would be taken against a 
chemical would weaken current federal health and safety 
standards 
environmental groups also denounced the changing of the risk 
standard and the federalstate preemption provision 
were talking about the erosion of the concept of negligible 
risks said janet hathaway an attorney for the natural resources 
defense council which has been a strong critic of current 
government efforts to safeguard foods from high levels of 
pesticides 
she said that states have always had a central role in health 
and safety and often prod the federal government to take action 
against certain pesticide uses 
william k reilly administrator of the environmental protection 
agency said the epa needs risk standards that are flexible 
while conceding the proposal calls for uniform federal standards 
that would supersede state laws reilly said the epa would consider 
approval of stronger state provisions on a casebycase basis 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said uniform pesticide 
standards are needed for international trade purposes state 
governments should not have a standard that is different from those 
of the federal government he said 
dean kleckner president of the american farm bureau federation 
said bushs plan was a workable approach that would make the 
worlds safest food supply even safer 
those who favor zero tolerance and farmers disarming 
themselves and surrendering to all pests probably wont be happy 
with this kleckner said but they wouldnt be happy with the 
disruptions in the food supply and distribution system that would 
result from such policies either

gilman said he did not ask the ministry to leave because of 
bakkers conviction and sentence but because of the ministrys 
actions 
in the past few weeks ministry volunteers have moved much of 
their property into a smaller section of the plaza in hopes of 
paying less rent but gilman said there had not been any change in 
the rental contract 
he said he would not interfere with sundays service 
from my point of view they should be out of there as soon as 
it is possible or convenient for them to do so he said 
at last report the new tv ministry had only five stations as 
subscribers 
bakkers mother said thursday she couldnt believe her son is in 
prison 
my husband just went to the doctor mrs bakker said this 
is awfully hard on both of us were both 83 and this is hard to 
take i was just trying to relax 
mrs bakker and her husband raleigh are among about 800 people 
who have homes at heritage usa where a large sign at the front 
entrance reads closed until further notice 
were not letting any cars in only residents and staff 
said guard mickey rhymer 
bakker 49 was taken immediately after sentencing taken to the 
medium security federal correctional institution at talladega 
depending on the outcome of an appeal he will serve at least 10 
years before being eligible for parole 
prison officials said thursday that bakker appeared to be doing 
well but they declined to say much more about him as far as i 
know hes adjusting well said spokeswoman dana newell 
she said the prison had received numerous requests from 
reporters for interviews with bakker and was referring those to his 
lawyer 
baker is expected to stay at talladega no more than two weeks 
before he is transferred to another federal prison which officials 
declined to reveal

a blueribbon panel of advisers to energy 
secretary james d watkins has recommended a further delay of at 
least two years in starting operation of a defense nuclear waste 
dump in new mexico a panel member said thursday 
the suggestion if accepted would mean the department would 
have to arrange temporary storage of nuclear wastes for much longer 
than currently planned said leonard slosky a member of the 
advisory panel 
the site known as the waste isolation pilot plant and situated 
just north of the texas border near carlsbad nm is designed to 
store drums of plutonium waste from nuclear weapons manufacture for 
thousands of years in caves of bedded rock salt 
watkins had told congress earlier this month that he expected to 
have to persuade seven states to accept some excess waste starting 
next april until about september 1992 when operational testing of 
the permanent repository would start governors of the seven states 
have told watkins they wont take the waste 
the seven states are washington idaho colorado new mexico 
nevada tennessee and south carolina 
the 800 million carlsbad installation was supposed to have 
opened a year ago and as recently as june watkins was saying it 
would open in september of this year in early october watkins said 
he hoped to accept experimental shipments next july but could not 
say when fullscale operation should start 
four of the five advisory panel members told watkins in a 
private meeting tuesday that the operational testing should be put 
off at least an additional two years to 1994 slosky said in part 
because the results of some scientific experiments wont be known 
before then 
the four also said they believed that the first phase of 
experiments would take longer than the department has planned and 
that the tests should be broadened 
slosky said only robert bishop representing an industry group 
disagreed with the recommendation to put off the operational 
testing essentially an effort to show that the waste can be 
safely loaded shipped unloaded deposited in the dump and if 
necessary retrieved 
the panel wrote no joint report but instead the members 
presented individual recommendations in separate papers for watkins 
on tuesday slosky said 
department officials familiar with the reports declined to 
return a telephone call thursday the department has not published 
the papers 
an environmental group said in response to the advisory panels 
recommendations that watkins faced further delays and political 
fights over the dump 
for political and technical reasons its not going to open 
anytime soon said elizabeth kassen a senior attorney for the 
environmental defense fund 
the panel members also told watkins they saw serious management 
problems that should be corrected before the dump is opened 
slosky an environmental consultant based in denver said in a 
telephone interview that the panel members agreed that the site is 
a good one and we have not uncovered anything that we think is a 
fatal flaw

dr andrew wiznia wrote his first azt 
prescription thursday for a pediatric aids case an 18monthold 
baby who weighs only 17 pounds and is unable to lift her head or 
sit up 
even if the drug doesnt cure or at least improve her 
condition hopefully it will stop at least some of the 
deterioration said wiznia the director of the pediatric aids 
unit at bronxlebanon hospital 
until thursday doctors were not permitted to prescribe azt the 
only governmentapproved antiaids drug for anyone under the age 
of 13 
but health and human services secretary louis sullivan lifted 
the restriction saying preliminary evidence indicated that the 
drug is effective and seems to be safe 
children ages 3 months to 12 years who have symptoms of advanced 
infection with the aids virus will be eligible to receive azt free 
under the program sponsored by the maker burroughs wellcome co it 
was previously only available to children enrolled in clinical 
trials 
almost 1900 children under 13 have aids about 2 percent of all 
aids cases according to the national centers for disease control 
pediatric aids specialists generally welcomed thursdays news 
but cautioned that azt was no more a cureall in children than in 
adults 
research studies that involved more than 200 children have 
indicated that azt may prolong their survival without raising the 
risk of side effects 
anecdotal evidence has been mixed 
dr ayre rubinstein who has worked on pediatric aids for a 
decade at the albert einstein college of medicine in the bronx has 
used azt for some time in symptomatic patients 
one was a 6yearold girl who lost the use of her legs from 
progressive encephalopathy a brain disease he said after 
receiving azt there was a marked improvement 
yet the same treatment had no effect when it was tried on 
another patient 
the same syndrome about the same age he said so you can 
see from that its very hard to predict the outcome of the azt on 
brain disease 
dr ed connor who runs the pediatric azt trials at childrens 
hospital in newark nj said initial evidence indicates that 
the majority overall have benefited 
he mentioned one girl who has been receiving azt by prescription 
because shes over 13 
she was losing weight and really not doing very well in 
school connor said she improved significantly and now 
religiously takes her azt because shes really seen the benefits 
azt also called zidovudine was approved by the food and drug 
administration for teenagers and adults with advanced symptoms of 
aids in march 1987 
doctors thursday praised the new form of azt a 
strawberryflavored syrup that is easier for children to swallow 
than capsules are it also allows dosages to be adjusted for body 
size 
but all warn that there is still much to be learned about the 
drug which is highly toxic and can cause serious side effects such 
as anemia and low white blood cell counts 
studies will continue to evaluate the effects on children of azt 
in combination with other drugs and the benefits of the drug when 
used in children in earlier stages of the disease 
the number of small children treated with azt in this country 
has been so small that i dont think you can make a statement as to 
whether its going to work wiznia said 
rubinstein said he will not use azt as a prophylactic in his 
pediatric clinic the largest in the country until more research 
is done on the proper dosage 
there are some people who say we are ready to take the 
risks its a fatal disease well prescribe it 
i dont think thats the right attitude rubinstein said 
physicians who want to enroll child patients in the azt program 
can call burroughs wellcomes tollfree number 18008297337 from 
8 am to 7 pm edt

condition of anonymity the five were identified as group chairman 
petar slabakov dejan kiuranov alexander karakachanov dimitrina 
petrova and krasimir kurnev 
kiuranov karakachanov and mrs petrova were later released the 
sources said however the fate of the others detained was unknown 
for 10 days the activists have been permitted to campaign 
publicly against plans to build a governmentbacked hydroelectric 
plant in the rila mountains about 75 miles southwest of sofia 
the petition drive coincided with the oct 16 opening of a 
35nation conference on the environment in europe the activists

the bush administration said thursday it would 
not object if congress forgives interest and penalties on an 
obscure 123yearold liquor tax that has stirred up tavern owners 
grocers and fraternal groups 
the administration stopped short of endorsing a waiver of 
overdue taxes themselves 
protests over the tax have grown since a pennsylvania elks lodge 
got a 9776 bill last year for 50 years of nonpayment and a 
california pizza shop owner got a 2911 bill four weeks ago both 
establishments said they never had heard of the socalled special 
occupational tax on liquor retailers 
about 600000 beer wine and distilled spirits dealers that sell 
directly to the public must pay the annual tax which was increased 
in january 1988 from 54 to 250 per retailer accompanying the 
increase has been a vigorous enforcement effort by the bureau of 
alcohol tobacco and firearms 
the administration recognizes that the tax has created special 
problems kenneth w gideon assistant treasury secretary for tax 
policy said at a house ways and means subcommittee hearing 
although we continue to believe that taxpayer amnesty programs 
are generally inappropriate this case involves a tax that for 
years before 1987 was insignificant and not well publicized 
gideon told the subcommittee on select revenue measures in a 
prepared statement 
it appears that noncompliance in years before 1987 was due to 
the fact that many taxpayers were simply not aware of the tax 
gideon said there is no evidence that dealers were attempting to 
avoid the tax 
before 1987 only about 40 percent of retailers were paying up 
gideon said he said the compliance rate is 80 percent now 
a recent proposal by rep ed jenkins dga to the ways and 
means panel would forgive interest and penalties on the tax 
accruing before last july 
rep paul kanjorski dpa told the subcommittee thursday that 
it should also move to forgive tax debts on the books before 1985 
not just interest and penalties 
that approach was backed by the national restaurant association 
the great protest over this tax that you have heard recently 
from constituents in the restaurant business grows from a feeling 
that the federal government is unfair in penalizing honest 
entrepreneurs for failure to pay a socalled user fee that the 
irs has never publicized or made any serious effort to collect in 
the past 30 years the lobbying group said 
gideon said the administration would balk at any proposal that 
resulted in the forgiveness of significant amounts of tax

more than 1200 salvadorans who 
fled their warravaged nation for camps in honduras in the early 
1980s returned home thursday un officials said 
the refugees crossed the border at el poy 45 miles north of san 
salvador in a caravan of 34 buses and 148 trucks that carried 
their belongings said werner blatter regional director for the 
un high commission for refugees 
he said the refugees who numbered 1200 to 1300 will resettle 
in three northern towns that have been virtually abandoned since 
the early 1980s because of civil war 
the 10yearold war is still being fought between a rightist 
government and leftist guerrillas 
however the refugees who had been living at mesa grande camp 
decided to try to rebuild their lives at home despite the conflict 
about 12000 salvadorans remain in four camps in honduras most 
say they want to go home 
several more repatriation caravans of 1000 to 1500 people each 
are planned for the coming months 
with thursdays group more than 8000 refugees have returned 
since the program began in october 1987

a factory worker was executed thursday for tax 
evasion and black marketeering bringing to more than 70 the number 
of death sentences announced since midaugust 
the convicts crimes ranged from embezzlement to murder and the 
official press has not confirmed in all cases that the executions 
have been carried out however death sentences are rarely 
overturned on appeal 
a count of cases publicized in national newspapers found 74 
since aug 15 when the government began a new anticorruption 
campaign many more cases are reported only in local newspapers and 
some are never reported so the actual total may be much higher 
the official xinhua news agency said the factory worker jian 
jianguo 30 was sentenced and immediately executed in beijing it 
said he evaded customs tariffs of more than 251480 by forging 
documents and official seals together with customs officers 
he also made 148090 in illegal profit by selling goods he 
bought illegally in dutyfree shops xinhua said 
a second man who was convicted of embezzling 106355 was 
sentenced to death but then given a twoyear reprieve with the 
chance for commutation to life in jail because he confessed 
the two cases clearly were publicized to encourage more people 
to turn themselves in for economic crimes in the last five days of 
a 10week leniency period 
the government said aug 15 that anyone turning himself in 
before oct 31 for embezzlement bribery and other economic crimes 
would be treated less severely while those like jian who did 
not would be sentenced harshly 
by midoctober more than 13600 people nationwide had taken up 
the offer many cities including beijing have held public 
meetings to parade the offenders 
not all of the 74 death sentences publicized since aug 15 were 
for economic crimes 
five men were sentenced for holding up train passengers at 
knifepoint two men for trafficking in the skins of rare giant 
pandas two men for abducting and selling mentally retarded women 
as wives and several for murder or theft 
chinese law gives judges wide discretion in sentencing and the 
death sentence can be given for almost any crime if the 
circumstances are judged serious the supreme court occasionally 
hands down instructions to judges nationwide to treat certain 
classes of criminals harshly as in the aug 15 ultimatum and in a 
june notice calling for severity in sentencing participants in the 
spring democracy movement 
there have been no new announcements of executions of 
protesters twelve such cases were announced in the first weeks 
after the army crushed the protests in june 
executions in china occur with a bullet to the back of the head

the white house raised the possibility 
thursday that president bush might not meet next month with israeli 
prime minister yitzhak shamir even though shamir requested such a 
meeting 
shamir planned to visit the united states in midnovember 
the administration was in the process of weighing 
israelisuggested changes in secretary of state james a baker 
iiis proposal for direct israelipalestinian talks 
but presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater said there was 
no link between this review and the question whether a bushshamir 
meeting would take place 
asked if the administration were trying to prod israel by 
hinting such a meeting might not take place fitzwater said i 
dont think so i dont think a meeting is the kind of thing thats 
going to influence israels position on these matters 
he told reporters that a meeting between the two leaders was 
probably likely 
but later in the day his office issued a terse twosentence 
statement that said shamir would be in the united states for a 
private visit 
no decisions have been made concerning a possible meeting with 
the president it continued 
it would be unusual for a us president not to meet with an 
israeli prime minister visiting this country 
we have asked for a meeting with president bush and were 
still waiting for an answer said israel embassy spokeswoman 
ruth yaron 
both us and israeli officials privately suggested that 
scheduling problems were uppermost plus some confusion on the 
exact dates of shamirs visit 
he was to speak to the general assembly of the zionist 
federation in cincinnati on nov 16 but israeli embassy officials 
said it was still not clear exactly when shamir would arrive in the 
country or how long he would stay 
shamirs government notified baker on monday night that it 
accepted his proposal talks with palestinians but only if two 
conditions were met exclusion of the palestine liberation 
organization and limiting the meeting to making arrangments for an 
election on the west bank and in gaza 
baker in a white house news conference on wednesday said he 
would review israels request that he revise his fivepoint 
proposal but he said he could not overhaul it because that would 
touch off a long process of bargaining with both sides delaying

coal miners in the soviet far north defied the law 
and struck thursday but then returned to work miners however 
threatened new walkouts in the ukraine 
a total of 18000 workers in nine mines in the northern vorkuta 
region struck to demand the kremlin make good on promised benefits 
a spokesman said 
they decided to return to work at all but one mine after 
hearings on the illegal strike began in regional court said strike 
committee member sergei masolovich 
he said the walkout would continue at the vorkuta regions 
biggest coalfield but that workers would return to the job friday 
at other mines 
due to pressure from the local media and managements taking 
the case to court the regional strike committee made a decision to 
end the strike at midnight masolovich said by telephone 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev in finland on an official 
visit said thursday that strong administrative measures through 
the prosecutor and the court might be taken against the strikers 
to promote stability 
in the ukraines donetsk coal basin the countrys largest 
coalproducing area miner representatives voted against 
immediately resuming the strike that paralyzed the region this 
summer soviet television reported 
but they decided to hold a referendum to gauge miners support 
for a renewed walkout the nightly news program vremya said 
in the western ukrainian city of lvov about 5000 people massed 
thursday evening and supported calls for a oneday general walkout 
friday in solidarity with miners and to push political demands a 
ukrainian activist said 
top soviet officials have voiced concern that strikes by 
cutting the nations coal supplies could force a rationing of heat 
and light as the traditionally brutal russian winter begins 
the walkouts violated a law passed earlier this month by the 
soviet legislature that sets arbitration procedures for wouldbe 
strikers and bans walkouts in such vital areas as energy defense 
and transportation 
strikes this summer in virtually all the soviet unions major 
coalfields from the central asia in the south to vorkuta 
paralyzed much of the countrys coal industry 
the miners went back to work after the government promised to 
meet their demands for better working conditions improved supplies 
of consumer goods and more financial independence 
but ukrainian miners representatives claimed thursday the 
promises have not been kept 
alexei bokharev chairman of the donetsk strike committee said 
in a telephone interview that the miners will decide friday on a 
course of action either the strike will be resumed or a 
conciliation commission will be appointed he said 
coal industry minister mikhail shchadov said in an interview 
with soviet television that the ministry is fulfilling all promises 
to the miners 
but vremya also said conditions at many mines remain worse than 
ever and that they are producing far below capacity because of the 
lack of needed spare parts and new technology

since sunrise the day after the big 
earthquake firemans fund insurance co has had claims adjusters 
on the streets handing out checks for collapsed or burned homes 
it was just like old times for the novato califbased company 
we made our reputation in the quake of 1906 when every other 
san franciscobased insurer went under says spokesman john 
kozero our headquarters was destroyed and we had no records but 
we paid everyone half cash and half stock which in a few years 
was worth more 
theres no problem for insurers in coming up with cash to pay 
for the destruction of the oct 17 quake and this time none are 
expected to succumb to claims that could cost the industry 2 
billion to 3 billion 
most insurers are scrambling to keep clients and win new ones by 
responding quickly to claims taking out ads in newspapers and 
broadcasting commercials on radio 
state farm insurance co flew in 250 claim handlers from around 
the country to join 600 others working out of eight offices and 
eight trailers 
despite more expensive costs and a year of calamities from coast 
to coast the insurers said thursday theyre not expecting soaring 
rates as anticipated by wall street investors who bid up their 
stocks after the big earthquake and hurricane hugo 
instead the insurance companies said home owner rates and 
earthquake riders in some damageprone areas might go up a little 
next year others might go down and overall there wont be any 
major changes 
there should be no impact on personal home owners and 
earthquake insurance kozero said the rates were based on a 
pattern of what happened in the past and the quake was part of 
what was expected 
if there is a rate hike the companies said it will more likely 
affect commercial policies which have benefited from a price war 
much of the estimated 4 billion for hurrican hugo and the 
billions for the quake will be collected back from dozens of 
reinsurers in europe asia and the united states who assume part of 
the liability of primary insurers 
the quake is not going to bankrupt any insurance company said 
gloria vogel industry analyst for bear stearns amp co in new york 
the industry does have the capital to pay out these enormous 
losses and the risk is spread around the world 
the insurance companies also were buffered by 10 to 15 percent 
deductibles on the expensive earthquake riders that make up for the 
exclusion of quakes from home owners policies because of that 
only about 20 percent of home owners carry earthquake insurance 
which by law must be offered in california 
insurers say there has been a small increase demand for 
earthquake insurance since last week just as there was after a 
quake in southern california a few years ago but interest 
typically dies down as memories of quakes fade 
state farm the largest home and auto insurer in california and 
the country has 14 billion of home owners and earthquake policies 
in force in the san francisco bay area and expects to pay out about 
300 million in quake claims 
unlike most insurers state farm will not collect much from 
reinsurers 
because of our size theres not enough reinsurance available 
to make a significant impact on the amount of exposure we have 
said jim stahly spokesman for the bloomington illbased company 
state farm suffering its worst year in catastrophe claim 
payments that include 500 million for hurricane hugo will likely 
have an underwriting loss for the year stahly said 
so far state farms adjusters and agents have processed about 
7500 quake claims about onethird of what it expects to handle 
firemans fund says its payout will be about 200 million but 
after reinsurance collection and taxes the impact on its fourth 
quarter will be no more than 50 million 
the burden of at least half of firemans funds payouts will be 
shared by 13 other insurance companies around the world mostly in 
london west germany switzerland italy and japan 
often the reinsurers will reinsure again said kozero 
hurricane hugo and the quake triggered a scramble among 
insurance companies in london to make sure their reinsurance 
protection was in place for the rest of the year 
that increase in demand boosted reinsurance rates and eventually 
could lead to higher primary rates unless the primary companies 
absorb the extra costs for competitive reasons 
in the past two years many policies have been written under 
cost because insurers are trying to win market share said kozero 
psychologically this quake has a big effect on pricing 
said vogel but it will be at least late 1990 before we see the 
full effects of any price increases if they come 
insurance stocks were attractive to investors before the quake 
because of the perception interest rates may be coming down she 
said but the rise in the past week may have been a little 
overdone and we may see them backing off a little bit 
insurance companies especially those who handled reinsurance 
were the most popular plays on wall street after the quake general 
re corp rose 275 to 8650 the day after the quake and has 
continue to climb this week week nac re corp american 
international group and cigna corp also were higher 
the companies are not sounding as optimistic as investors are 
that things are going to turn vogel said but then again the 
companies were the last ones to see pricecutting too

a pregnant woman who asked to have 
her 60day jail sentence delayed so she could get an abortion was 
refused by a judge who retorted so you can murder your baby is 
that it 
pamela forney who began her third month of pregnancy this week 
asked for a 10day delay before the start of her sentence for 
violating probation on a 1987 conviction of driving under the 
influence 
she said she needed the time because she was scared that when 
she got out of jail it might be too late for a safe abortion 
even though attorneys for both prosecution and defense agreed 
pasco county judge dan c rasmussen would have no part of it 
being pregnant is not going to keep you from doing this jail 
time the judge said monday before sending the woman directly to 
the west pasco detention centeryou want a continuance so you can 
murder your baby is that it 
a sobbing ms forney pleaded with the judge saying she is 
financially unable to care for a baby rasmussen suggested she 
carry it full term and then give it up for adoption 
i thought it was my choice ms forney said in a jail 
interview tuesday hes telling me i dont have a choice its 
not right that he can choose for me 
the decision provoked criticism from the american civil 
liberties union which moved thursday to take over ms forneys 
defense 
its an outrage said aclu attorney charlene carres in 
tallahassee since when is the penalty for violating probation 
for dui a sentence of mandatory motherhood 
ms forney a 26yearold parttime bartender doubts that 
shell have a job when she gets out of jail she said she someday 
wants children but only when she can afford them 
i dont want to have to go on welfare and i would have to if 
i have a baby she said i knew when you went to jail you gave 
up some rights but the rights over your own body 
in a statement the judge said his personal views on abortion 
had nothing to do with the sentence imposed 
it was only after the sentence was approved by the court that

federal child pornography indictments are 
soaring while obscenity charges for material involving adults are 
declining according to federal statistics that suggest the justice 
department is focusing its antismut attack on material using 
children 
attorney general dick thornburgh pledged to a religious audience 
thursday that the department will continue to fight pornography on 
all fronts 
however he said in regard to material involving children 
pornography to me is degrading to human dignity in every form 
but it is most degrading to the human dignity of those who are 
innocent and defenseless and who are preyed upon by criminal 
actors 
the number of indictments for federal obscenity violations 
dropped from 66 in 1987 to 37 last year according to figures of 
cases compiled by the justice departments national obscenity 
enforcement unit 
the figures are incomplete because us attorneys are not 
required to report obscenity prosecutions to the justice 
department said joseph krovisky a department spokesman 
but during the same period the number of federal 
childpornography prosecutions increased from 281 in 1987 to 406 
last year according to the units figures 
fbi figures also reflect a decline in prosecutions involving 
hardcore adult pornography the number of open matters dropped 
from 355 in 1987 to 302 in 1988 to 194 in the first nine months of 
the 1989 fiscal year which ended sept 30 
thornburgh said the statistics dont reflect the length of 
investigations and he said the department would not abandon any 
part of our acrosstheboard effort 
he also stressed that law enforcement officials considering 
obscenity charges must be mindful of first amendment protections 
against censorship 
we must be attentive to the preservation of first amendment 
rights just as we are attentive to the enforcement of laws that 
attack those practices that lie outside the area of first amendment 
protection the attorney general said 
critics of the obscenity unit which was set up in 1987 by 
thornburghs predecessor edwin meese iii have charged that 
prosecutions for obscenity violations trampled on constitutional 
rights 
obscenity prosecutions involving adult pornography often involve 
sensitive first amendment questions that law enforcement officials 
are not often eager to confront 
in his speech to the religious alliance against pornography 
thornburgh noted the difficulties making obscenity charges stick 
eight obscenity counts against a los angeles pornographer were 
dismissed by a judge who couldnt define a prevailing community 
standard for obscenity thornburgh said 
but the defendant rubin gottesman was convicted of a 
childpornography violation because the star of many of his videos 
was a minor last week gottesman was sentenced to a year in prison 
and fined 100000 
before meese set up the obscenity unit in response to 
recommendations made by a commission he appointed to study 
pornography there were very few federal obscenity prosecutions 
said john weston a los angeles attorney who defends distributors 
of xrated material 
thornburgh said the department had virtually stamped out 
mailings of sexually oriented advertising for xrated videos and 
other pornography the department has obtained convictions of 11 
individuals and 17 corporations since the socalled postporn 
investigation began last year he said 
im sure youve noticed as we have at justice a dramatic 
decline in complaints thornburgh said in most regions of the 
country those mailings simply dont go out anymore

speaking to about 2000 people who gathered at a santiago suburb to 
welcome them 
its the workers right to strike which we have fought for 
martinez said 
bustos is president of the united workers central and martinez 
is vice president of the group they were sentenced to 541 days

congressional negotiators neared completion of 
a 305 billion defense bill thursday with lawmakers considering a 
11 billion cut in president bushs strategic defense initiative 
and one less b2 bomber in fiscal 1990 
after nearly seven weeks of wrangling house and senate 
conferees cited pressure from congressional leadership to adjourn 
by thanksgiving and the planned start on a defense spending bill by 
the appropriations committees next week as the reasons for the push 
to finish 
its coming together said rep john rowland rconn a 
member of the house armed services committee 
late thursday house and senate conferees on procurement and 
research and development met separately to mull over the latest 
proposals including the following 
approximately 255 million for research and development of the 
marine corps v22 osprey tiltrotor aircraft but no procurement 
money the future of the program would be tied to commercial use of 
the v22 said lawmakers and congressional sources who requested 
anonymity 
a plan to purchase 18 of the navys f14d tomcat jet fighters 
in fiscal 1990 but none in fiscal 1991 
bush has proposed canceling the two conventional programs 
decisions that met with strong opposition on capitol hill 
about 950 million for the national guard and reserves the 
house bill had earmarked 12 billion for the guard and reserves 
lawmakers ruled out a final agreement on the defense bill by 
weeks end but said a resolution was possible sometime next week 
among the other compromises still being considered between the 
two widely divergent house and senate blueprints for the fiscal 
year that began oct 1 
a pentagon total of 355 billion for sdi popularly known as 
star wars according to rep william dickinson of alabama ranking 
republican on the house armed services panel 
the total represents a 11 billion cut in bushs request and is 
about 200 million less than the amount spent in fiscal 1989 the 
compromise is a split between the 28 billion approved by the 
house and 43 billion the senate adopted but does not include 
about 250 million in department of energy money and military 
construction dollars 
this is the first time it will take a real hit said 
rowland who indicated that strategic programs are suffering at the 
hands of conventional programs that translate into jobs in 
lawmakers home districts 
approximately 12 billion for the mx multiplewarhead 
railbased missile and the midgetman singlewarhead truckbased 
missile which is equivalent to the 11 billion bush proposed for 
the mx and 100 million for the midgetman dickinson said 
however the proposal requires cheney to cut 100 million from 
the 12 billion and gives him the discretion on how to spend the 
amount remaining cheney had favored funding only the mx missile 
but bush opted for the two landbased nuclear missiles 
the proposal also includes house language imposing a 50missile 
cap on the mx the total number of the missiles currently in fixed 
silos 
lawmakers and congressional sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the other proposals being consider include money to 
buy two stealth bombers in fiscal 1990 and parts for five in fiscal 
1991 
the bush administration had sought funds to buy three of the 
batwinged aircraft in fiscal 1990 and components for five in 
fiscal 1991

house republicans and conservative democrats 
who sustained president bushs veto in june of a minimum wage 
increase struggled thursday to find a compromise that would avoid 
another showdown next week 
but the white house in a meeting with leaders of the two 
parties refused to budge on bushs demand for a sixmonth 
subminimum training wage and labor leaders balked at accepting 
anything less than a 425 minimum wage by january 1991 
whether a compromise is reached or not democratic leaders plan 
to bring to the house floor next wednesday a scaledback 425 
version of the bill that bush vetoed which would have set a 
455anhour minimum wage with a 60day subminimum training wage 
key players in both parties and lobbyists for business and labor 
groups said the white house has been sending signals since late 
last week that bush wanted to avoid a showdown and was open to 
negotiating a deal 
there is a lot of nervousness on the part of the white house 
that they could look like a mean old ogre here fighting day and 
night to get a capital gains tax break while also fighting equally 
hard against raising the minimum wage said rep timothy j 
penny dminn 
they want to come in at the last minute and make a deal but 
theres no firm decision on what they want said penny one of 28 
democrats who voted last summer to sustain bushs veto 
despite pleas from democrats like penny and several republicans 
white house chief of staff john sununu told house speaker thomas s 
foley dwash and gop leader robert h michel of illinois that 
bush would not yield 
we didnt reach agreement on anything foley told reporters 
after the white house meeting 
bush in what he called a best and only offer promised 
shortly after taking office to veto any bill that would raise the 
minimum wage above 425 an hour or that reached that level before 
jan 1 1992 
coupled with any increase he said must be a sixmonth 
subminimum training wage that would maintain the current wage floor 
of 335 an hour for newly hired workers regardless of their 
experience 
sununu according to congressional sources and lobbyists 
floated as a possible compromise gradually increasing the wage 
floor to 425 an hour by july 1991 six months earlier than bush 
wanted with a threemonth subminimum for new hires 
but that offer was not put forth thursday foley and michel said 
the president will have to bend a little bit to avoid a veto 
fight michel said and there may be room for some bending i 
dont think the president would enjoy vetoing a second minimum wage 
bill 
rep david bonior dmich said supporters still lack a 
twothirds vetoproof majority for a new bill that would raise the 
wage floor to 380 this january and to 425 by january 1991 with 
a 60day training wage only for firsttime workers 
but were gaining ground he said our whip count from 
republicans and conservative democrats is much better than it was 
the last vote 
democrats want to have a bill approved by both the house and 
senate and on bushs desk before the nov 13 arrival in washington 
of polish solidarity union leader lech walesa believing the 
occasion will make a veto more difficult politically 
we want to get it to him and give him an opportunity to think 
about it said bonior the priorities of this administration in 
terms of economic justice for people are nowhere near reality 
robert mcglotten the aflcios chief lobbyist expressed a 
willingness to negotiate the training wage issue as long as there 
are assurances that employers cannot use it to rotate workers in 
and out of entrylevel jobs so that they never rise above the 
subminimum level 
they keep talking like they want to make some movement he 
said of the administration but when we sit down with them we 
get nowhere theyre floundering all over the place 
mcglotten said theres no give by unions on the issue of 
achieving a 90cent increase to 425 an hour by january 1991

president bush said thursday he has serious 
doubts about the constitutionality of a law that takes effect 
saturday to outlaw the desecration of the american flag 
in a written statement bush reiterated his belief that a 
constitutional amendment is the only way to ensure that the flag is 
protected 
the law which will take effect at one minute after midnight 
friday provides a prison term of up to a year for anyone who 
knowingly mutilates defaces physically defiles burns 
maintains on the floor or ground or tramples upon any us flag 
while i commend the intentions of those who voted for this 
bill i have serious doubts that it can withstand supreme court 
review bush said 
he said the supreme court has held that the governments 
interest in preserving the flag as a symbol can never be compelling 
enough to justify prohibiting flag desecration that is intended to 
express a message since that is precisely the target of this 
bills prohibition i suspect that any subsequent court challenge 
will reach a similar conclusion

treasury secretary nicholas s brady said 
thursday that the securities and exchange commission should have 
the power to halt stock trading in market emergencies 
brady noted that sec chairman richard c breeden said just a day 
earlier that he doesnt want such authority 
but the treasury secretary said the bush administration backs 
bills in congress to strengthen the sec in the belief that 
governments initial response to market emergencies should come 
from a regulator with expertise and proximity to the markets 
testifying before the senate banking committee in support of the 
legislation brady who headed a government commission that 
investigated wall streets 1987 crash said the 190point slide in 
the dow jones industrial average on oct 13 had not altered his 
belief in the soundness of the us economy 
but he said the tailspin did point up the need for changes 
in market regulation 
he supported legislation introduced by sens christopher dodd 
dconn and john heinz rpa to give the sec emergency powers to 
restrict or halt trading a power vested now only in the president 
brady in a letter accompanying his testimony noted that the 
legislation would give the president power to terminate sec 
emergency actions and would require presidential approval for any 
trading halt lasting longer than 24 hours 
he said the administration supports other provisions of the 
legislation to 
give the sec authority to request reports on large securities 
and options trades 
set rules for regulators to use in assessing the financial 
soundness of the parent holding companies of brokerage houses 
provide for improved coordination in the clearing and settling 
of market transactions 
legislation making the same changes but with minor variations 
is also before the house 
on wednesday breeden told a house panel he supports the 
legislation except for the provision giving the sec the power to 
halt trading in emergencies 
breeden said that safety mechanisms called circuitbreakers 
temporary automatic trading halts in times of market volatility 
have eliminated much of the need for officials to order trading 
stopped 
the sec chairman said he also believes the possibility of 
arbitrary halts could cause uncertainty and volatility in the 
markets 
late in the day breeden said through a spokeswoman that he 
would have no comment on bradys testimony 
the brady commission in a january 1988 report on the stock 
market crash of the previous october recommended that one agency 
should coordinate all the financial markets the recommendation 
was not acted upon by the reagan administration 
but the treasury secretary said thursday that given the nature 
of the various market regulators the sec the commodity futures 
trading commission and the federal reserve board i dont 
believe thats a practical possibility 
maybe that was something written naively by somebody outside 
the government brady conceded noting that the report was issued 
some 60 days after the crash he said perhaps we overreacted 
to some extent 
brady was noncommittal about program trading in which millions 
of shares of stocks are traded almost instantaneously by 
computerized systems used mainly by huge indstitutional investors 
such as banks mutual funds and pension funds 
i dont have a view as to whether we ought to do anything 
about program trading brady told sen timothy e wirth dcolo

the senate voted thursday 6535 to approve 
legislation that would create a commission to investigate the 
eastern airlines strike after debate in which democrats challenged 
president bushs lack of efforts to settle the 8monthold dispute 
thursdays vote followed a narrow democratic vote earlier this 
month to close debate on the bill 
fiftyfive democrats voted for the measure and none against ten 
republicans also supported it 
the house already has passed a similar legislation and the house 
and senate will have to work out differences in the bills 
republicans had been delaying since shortly after the strike 
began march 4 president bush has refused to appoint an emergency 
board under provisions of the railway labor act to investigate 
the strike 
that refusal led to democratic criticism thursday of bushs 
handling of the strike some 30000 machinists flight attendants 
and pilots have been out of work as a result 
mr president nobody is asking you to come down on the side 
of the workers the strikers said sen howard metzenbaum 
dohio nobody is asking you to come down on the side of 
management 
metzenbaum cited 34 previous occasions under which democratic 
and republican presidents have appointed emergency boards causing 
settlement of 26 strikes without a work stoppage 
but for some reason that i dont understand this president is 
reluctant to provide some leadership in bringing about a settlement 
of the case metzenbaum said 
bush has said management and employees should resolve the 
problem 
under the bill a democrat and a republican from the house and 
one each from the senate would be appointed by their respective 
leaders in congress to the commission 
the panel would make recommendations on how to settle the strike 
and make further recommendations on maintaining competiveness in 
the airline industry the panel also would make recommendations on 
how to protect employee collective bargaining rights in bankruptcy 
proceedings involving air carriers 
the report will be due in 45 days after enactment 
five days after the eastern strike began the company filed for 
protection under the us bankruptcy act eastern has been 
continuing efforts to reorganize in bankruptcy court and the 
airline has said it plans to emerge as a carrier twothirds its 
former size 
eastern was purchased by frank lorenzo in 1986 and he has been 
accused by strikers and senate democrats of siphoning away 
easterns cash and assets he has been criticized for allegedly 
draining the assets of other airlines as well 
aflcio president lane kirkland said we are delighted that 
the senate has approved this laborsupported proposal which 
provides a process that should lead to a fair and equitable 
settlement of the eastern air line strike we urge the house accept 
the senate bill and the president to quickly sign it into law

it will be the first round of talks between the two nations 
since president bush and foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
unveiled competing proposals to reduce chemical weapons last month 
in un general assembly speeches 
the ussoviet talks are intended to lead to a superpower 
treaty banning all poison gas and to spur a 40nation conference in 
geneva to ban all chemical weapons 
seven days of talks will begin monday in new york said us and 
soviet officials max friedersdorf will lead the us delegation 
in his un speech bush offered to cut us chemical weapon 
stockpiles by 80 percent if the soviets reduce their arsenal by the 
same amount 
a day later shevardnadze said the superpowers should go still 
further he challenged washington to agree to stop making all 
poison gas including socalled binary weapons 
such weapons are activated by combining two chemicals 
congress has approved funds to continue production of binary 
poison gas bombs and shells bush administration officials have 
confirmed they intend to continue producing shells even after a 
treaty is signed 
the soviets said they would raise that point on monday 
the chief soviet delegate to the talks sergei batsanov said 
from a practical point of view it could be called nonsense if 
you start destroying your chemical weapons under an agreement and 
at the same time you start producing new chemical weapons 
washington contends moscow has far greater stockpiles of poison 
gas than the united states the soviets say they have 50000 tons 
compared with an estimated 30000 tons for the united states 
bush proposed a ussoviet agreement to begin cuts at once 
while an international treaty is worked out in which the united 
states would destroy 98 percent of its chemical weapons over eight 
years 
the remaining 2 percent would be destroyed within 10 years if 
all nations capable of building such weapons agreed to a total ban 
the us and soviet negotiators will be working on the basis of 
a memorandum of understanding signed by secretary of state james a 
baker iii and shevardnadze during september talks in wyoming 
the memorandum calls for inspections and even surprise visits by 
each side to verify agreements

a power plant fire a week ago was spains 
worst nuclear accident since it introduced nuclear power in 1968 
but no radiation was leaked the national nuclear safety commission 
said thursday 
a preliminary report by the commission said the fire at the 
vandellos i plant on the mediterranean coast probably began when 
excessive shaft vibration caused failure of a mount holding one of 
the two turbine generators 
no radiation was leaked during or after the accident and there 
was no radiation risk to firemen plant personnel or the public 
the report said 
the plant one of seven in spain went into service in 1972 at 
vandellos a coastal town in tarragona province 90 miles south of 
barcelona spains secondlargest city 
although the accident caused no injuries it prompted local and 
national concern about plant safety and evacuation plans the 
commission said preliminary results of its investigation indicated 
plant personnel acted correctly 
its report said vibration of the turbine shaft created a leak of 
lubrication oil and damaged an attached electric generator which 
leaked hydrogen used to cool the generator 
contact between the hydrogen and oxygen in the air started the 
fire which fed on the leaking oil and spread through the 
electrical production area below the turbines and next to the 
concrete structure housing the nuclear reactor the report said 
the reactor is a gascooled unit of french design 
according to the commission the fire began at 939 pm oct 19 
and was brought under control by plant and area firemen at 130 
am oct 20 but was not extinguished entirely until 3 am 
the vibration also ruptured a pipeline carrying sea water to the 
condenser in the turbine area the commission reported it said 
water washed across the floor below the turbines and eventually 
leaked into the basement area of the steelandconcrete containment 
structure around the reactor affecting numerous plant systems 
it said the fire and flooding shut down two of the four 
watercooled pumps that propel cooling gas to the reactor but said 
the two remaining were enough to cool the reactor 
the actions taken permitted the overcoming of the critical 
situation provoked by the precariousness of the plant following the 
fire and flooding the report said 
at this time any statement on the future of the plant would be 
premature the report said the commission said it was preparing 
a technical report on the circumstances and consequences of the 
accident for the government 
a consortium of the french utility electricite de france and 
several spanish companies owns the plant which has a coldgas 
reactor using natural uranium

drug agents staged dozens of raids nationwide 
thursday arresting 119 people on charges of growing marijuana 
indoors or selling equipment for it and seizing 65 indoor groves 
the drug enforcement administration said 
in addition the agents raided 22 stores that sell the equipment 
for the indoor marijuana growing seizing and boarding up seven or 
eight of them said dea spokesman frank shults who provided the 
figures as of early evening for the raids in operation green 
merchant 
the dea planned to raid a total of 65 commercial businesses in 
22 states as well as more than 100 indoor cultivation locations in 
46 states on thursday the raids continued into the night 
a marijuana legalization advocate said the raids were just a 
publicity stunt 
a law enforcement source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said earlier in the day that federal agents had expected to make 
only 100 arrests thursday in the previous month 112 people had 
been arrested in connection with the same investigation 
the stores raided range from momandpop to something 
equivalent to a kmart said the source 
we have established through the advertising and other means 
that these stores do sell the indoor cultivation apparatus and give 
advice about its use for the cultivation of marijuana shults 
said they openly do it 
the dea used undercover agents in every store to determine 
whether the owners knew the equipment such as lighting 
irrigation and ventilation apparatus was being used for indoor 
marijuana cultivation the source said 
the stores were located in alaska arizona california 
colorado georgia illinois kentucky massachusetts michigan 
minnesota missouri new york north carolina ohio oklahoma 
oregon pennsylvania south carolina texas virginia washington 
and wisconsin 
the only four states where no raids were planned on indoor 
cultivation sites were hawaii nebraska north dakota and west 
virginia 
doug mcvay of the national organization for the reform of 
marijuana laws said the raids on stores were a publicity stunt 
a largely ineffective one and silly really silly 
i can understand the deas frustration mcvay said its 
true some of this equipment is being used for indoor marijuana 
cultivation on the other hand dirt is used for indoor 
cultivation i dont think were going to stop people from selling 
dirt 
an increasing number of us marijuana growers have been moving 
their plants indoors because of extensive aerial surveillance that 
enables officials to spot drugs grown outside 
in the past month 112 people have been arrested on charges of 
cultivating marijuana at 94 indoor growing locations containing 
17000 sinsemilla marijuana plants according to shults 
we are trying to send the message to all those people in the 
united states who have been cultivating marijuana that they are 
violating the law they will be caught they will be prosecuted 
and if found guilty they will serve time said shults 
the raided stores specialize in the sale of these otherwise 
legitimate products with the knowledge that they will be used to 
cultivate marijuana he said 
a dea statement said the agency has obtained the names and 
addresses of thousands of individuals who are suspected of being 
involved in the indoor cultivation of marijuana 
steve hager editor of high times magazine said he believed 
federal drug agents had subpoenaed the united parcel service 
shipping records of the publications advertisers and have been 
using that information to build a conspiracy case of some kind 
ive been told that by people who have been visited by the 
dea hager said they were told they the agents got their 
names from ups 
however ups spokesman al winnik said theres no word here of 
any subpoenas by dea or any agency of that type 
the dea would not comment except to say there was still an 
ongoing investigation 
mcvay noted that legitimate manufacturers sell such items as 
lights used for growing plants indoors and kits of indoor gardening 
equipment and that they can be bought at hardware stores 
shults said such companies were not targeted by the dea which 
carried out the raids in coordination with state and local 
officials 
domestic suppliers produce about 25 percent of the marijuana 
consumed in the united states while colombia produces about 40 
percent mexico 25 percent and other countries 10 percent 
according to government estimates 
the dea estimated that domestic production increased from 2100 
tons in 1986 to 4350 to 4850 tons in 1988 the national drug 
control strategy announced by president bush in september called 
for increasing federal funds for domestic marijuana eradication 
from 8 million in fiscal 1989 to 16 million in the 1990 fiscal 
year 
a pound of sinsemilla the highly potent form of marijuana that 
accounted for about 53 percent of the domestically eradicated 
cannibis in 1988 costs 2000 to 4000 mcvay said

the government thursday ordered the 
local office of united press international closed and gave its 
foreign correspondents 72 hours to leave the country 
an order from the government and justice ministry delivered to 
the upi office said the us news agency has systematically 
violated journalistic ethics by the publication of false news with 
the evident intention of discrediting the authorities of the 
republic of panama and damaging the image of its leaders 
despite having this called to its attention frequently 
united press international upi has not varied its conduct and on 
the contrary has accentuated its hostility to the national cause of 
the people and government of panama the order said 
milt capps senior upi vice president for corporate affairs 
said in washington the panamanian government has in a written 
communique to us today indicated they expect one of our staffers to 
leave the country in the near future we right now are pursuing 
every avenue to contact government officials to attempt to resolve 
this matter 
were confident that we will be able to continue to report 
from panama objectively and fully 
the government order canceled the registration of upi 
correspondents in panama and gave its foreign personnel 72 hours to 
leave the country 
chief correspondent tomas cupas a panamanian who has been with 
the agency 27 years was in puerto rico on thursday the other 
correspondent elizabeth f lordan an american citizen has been 
based in panama for a year 
upi formerly united press has had an office in panama since 
the 1930s 
according to the justice ministry the order was placed on the 
door of the upi office which is in cupas home as formal 
notification and the agency has two days from the time of the 
posting to appeal 
luis romero villalobos government director of communications 
media who signed the order told the associated press the decision 
was based on several cases of false information 
it may be that the correspondent is not to blame as they say 
but that the editing desk changed the story he said 
the government ministry fined lordan 1500 in august for a 
dispatch it said contained false information and upi executives 
met with panamanian authorities at the time villalobos said upi 
had not paid the fine because the ministry had not yet decided to 
collect it 
lordan said that she was cited again for another story they said 
was false in both cases the upi central editing desk had included 
statements made in the united states not in panama she said 
government and justice minister renato pereira told reporters 
upi systematically has taken it upon itself to denigrate the 
government of panama and its national leadership we require of 
news agencies objectivity and respect for panamanian legislation 
asked whether the action was a warning to other news media 
pereira said it is not a warning it is a reiteration of a 
civilized policy of the panamanian state which as any other 
country requires that its personality be respected that it not be 
denigrated that what happens in its territory not be crudely 
falsified 
the government has expelled three foreign correspondents since 
1987 but this is the first time it has closed a news agency office

the former chief of the agency for 
international developments worldwide malaria research program was 
indicted thursday for allegedly lying about a grant proposal 
dr james m erickson was accused of falsely stating in a 
written report that a proposal by ktampr laboratories inc of st 
paul minn to devise a simple test for the disease had been 
approved by a panel of outside experts 
the indictment returned by a federal grand jury in alexandria 
va charged that erickson who was also chief of aids 
communicable disease division knew that the proposal had not been 
approved by the review panel 
if convicted erickson could be sentenced to five years in 
prison and fined up to 10000 
the indictment sought by justice department prosecutors was 
returned a week after the general accounting office found financial 
irregularities and serious management problems in the malaria 
program which has an annual budget of 9 million 
the gao study of the projects operation between 1982 and 1987 
found waste fraud and abuse as well as questionable contract 
and grant awards and inadequate financial management 
without identifying him by name the gao report said that as 
project manager erickson had more influence than any other 
individual over the direction and daytoday management of the 
malaria vaccine research project and he initiated many of the 
questionable actions 
the indictment did not specifically describe the ktampr grant at 
issue in the criminal case but it appeared to refer to grant 
referred to in the gao report 
the gao report said that aid terminated a 736801 grant ktampr 
after the agency found major deficiencies and unreasonably high 
expenditures given the subprojects limited accomplishements 
in that case erickson falsely reported to superiors that the 
grant proposal had received favorable reviews from an evaluation 
panel the gao report also noted that erickson had made similarly 
false statements about an evaluation of a proposal by the 
university of illinois 
the university received a 238 million contract for the 
proposed research 
both cases were investigated by the inspector generals office 
of aid which referred the information to the justice department 
the gao report said 
in september a prominent malaria researcher at the university 
of hawaii wasim siddiqui and his administrative assistant susan 
lofton were charged by hawaii authorities with stealing more than 
130000 in aid research grants to the university 
they were accused of diverting the money from the university to 
help finance an international malaria conference held in honolulu 
in 1985

prime minister yitzhak shamir on thursday 
dismissed as pure lies a news report that israel traded 
ballistic missile technology to south africa for uranium 
however a us official in washington said south africa has 
testfired an intermediaterange ballistic missile built with 
israeli technology the official said the missile could carry 
nuclear missiles 
in south africa foreign minister pik botha said he had no 
knowledge of nuclear cooperation between the two countries 
the israeli defense ministry issued a statement saying there 
is no truth whatsoever on alleged links between israel and 
south africa in the nuclear field 
the denials came in response to a wednesday report on nbctv 
news which cited unidentified intelligence sources and a cia 
document nbcs report said israel provided missile technology to 
south africa in return for a continuous supply of uranium and use 
of the overberg longrange test site in south africa 
its pure lies shamir told reporters at a political rally

prime minister margaret thatchers treasury chief 
nigel lawson and her personal economic adviser both resigned 
thursday in a dramatic government upheaval during difficult 
economic times 
lawson quit his cabinet post as chancellor of the exchequer 
saying he could not work for mrs thatcher unless she dropped her 
adviser sir alan walters 
walters who was visiting the united states resigned shortly 
afterward 
mrs thatcher expressed the most profound regret after 
lawsons resignation but moved quickly to demonstrate stability by 
replacing him with her foreign secretary john major home 
secretary douglas hurd became foreign secretary 
no replacement was announced for walters and no other details 
on the shakeup were immediately available 
the financial markets were shaken by the news and the pound fell 
3 cents against the dollar 
lawson 57 had held the job since 1983 engineering tax cuts 
and an economic recovery that won him mrs thatchers praise as one 
of britains greatest chancellors 
it was the first time since the 1986 resignation of defense 
secretary michael heseltine that mrs thatcher has had a senior 
cabinet official quit on her 
lawson and thatcher appeared to be in close harmony as long as 
the economic boom lasted but when it began to falter 18 months 
ago reports of discord surfaced 
they were said to disagree over the pound with lawson 
advocating a managed exchange rate and mrs thatcher insisting it 
be controlled by market forces 
lawson also was thought to favor britain joining the european 
monetary system a mechanism for stabilizing exchange rates mrs 
thatcher favors joining only after britains inflation rate moves 
down and capital flows freely in europe 
walters bluntly opposed joining the ems and has criticized 
lawsons policies 
in his letter of resignation lawson wrote the successful 
conduct of economic policy is possible only if there is and is 
seen to be full agreement between the prime minister and the 
chancellor of the exchequer 
recent events have confirmed that this essential requirement 
cannot be satisfied so long as alan walters remains your personal 
economic adviser 
mrs thatcher replied you have been responsible for possibly 
the most farreaching reform of our tax structure this century as 
well as for a period of unprecedented growth and prosperity it is 
a matter of particular regret that you should decide to leave 
before your task is complete 
she said there is no difference in our basic economic 
beliefs and britains economy is vastly stronger 
lawson a former financial journalist is a member of parliament 
whose career highlight was his 1988 budget which slashed taxes for 
the top income bracket from 60 percent to 40 percent 
plump and darkly handsome he has a boyish funloving manner 
and is known to have complained that his government salary is too 
low and that he would like to go into business in july he lost 
his official country residence in what was seen as an unseemly 
byproduct of a cabinet reshuffle 
walters a johns hopkins economist is mrs thatchers appointee 
and is sometimes referred to as her economic guru one of the group 
of freemarket apostles who shaped mrs thatchers thinking in the 
1970s 
he was her adviser from 1981 to 1983 went back to johns 
hopkins and returned to a downing street post earlier this year in 
what was seen as a slight to lawson 
on tuesday night lawson publicly rebuked him telling a tv 
interviewer i think it is right that advisers do not talk or 
write in public 
opposition labor party members elated at the apparent disarray 
in conservative party ranks said lawson must have made his 
decision when mrs thatcher failed to use a regular appearance in 
parliament to express absolute confidence in her chancellor 
labor leader neil kinnock said when the prime minister failed 
to give real support to nigel lawson this afternoon he really 
could not stay and it is entirely the prime ministers fault 
mrs thatcher gave the job to major just three months after she 
lifted him out of political obscurity and made him foreign 
secretary at the age of 46 
major is a former senior treasury official born into a 
bluecollar family with a father who was for a time a circus 
trapeze artist he represents the new breed of workingclass 
tories who have flourished in the thatcher decade 
major inherits an economy suffering from inflation of 76 
percent interest rates at an eightyear high of 15 percent and a 
trade deficit running at record levels this year 
labor is up to 10 points ahead of the tories in opinion polls 
but elections need not be held until mid1992 giving the new 
thatchermajor team more than two years to head off a recession and 
the threat of electoral defeat 
hurd 59 has served as a junior minister in the foreign office 
and was northern ireland secretary before moving to the home office 
in 1985 in whos who he lists his recreation as writing 
thrillers he has written nine

day laborers many of them undocumented 
aliens who hang out on street corners in hopes of finding work 
have a new friend beginning friday the city of los angeles but 
immigration officials are concerned 
city officials hope the program will help keep aliens from being 
exploited and will quiet the complaints of merchants and residents 
near the many unofficial gathering spots for people seeking 
construction or landscaping work 
the sixmonth test project is a fair compromise on a difficult 
issue councilman richard allatore said in february when the 
15member city council unanimously approved the 90000 program 
but federal immigration officials say contractors and other 
employers will have no assurances the workers are legal and will 
risk fines under the 1986 immigration reform law which penalizes 
employers who knowingly hire unauthorized aliens 
benjamin g davidian western regional commissioner of the 
immigration and naturalization service said thursday the city will 
not check to determine whether workers are authorized but will 
simply match them up with potential employers 
they may cause potential employers to be misled into thinking 
theyre getting workers who have a government stamp of approval for 
hiring davidian said 
davidian said there had been meetings with city officials to 
discuss the program were trying to work out the best approach 
for everyone 
he did not guarantee there would be no raids of the centers but 
said im not going to send a phalanx of border patrol agents to 
sweep through the hiring halls on a daily basis 
davidian said he would have preferred a program like that in the 
orange county city of costa mesa which has banned laborers from 
seeking work on the streets and instead checks their documents at a 
cityrun hiring hall 
los angeles officials and immigrants rights groups have 
countered that the city has no legal or moral duty to check 
workers documentation 
although residents and merchants in cities throughout southern 
california have complained about the jobhunters immigrants rights 
groups say the right to gather on the streets and seek work is 
constitutionally protected 
people are always talking about these lazy shiftless welfare 
people here we have a group of people who want to work said 
linda mitchell of the coalition for humange immigrant rights of los 
angeles an umbrella group for about 50 organzations 
ms mitchell said the job centers will create a better 
environment for the workers 
at the center opening friday in the harbor city district two 
spanishspeaking city workers with a phone will keep tabs on what 
kind of workers employers need and what skills workers have 
social service workers are expected to drop in from time to time 
to offer free english classes and healthcare information 
if the project succeeds the number of job centers will increase 
to 15 
the mostly male mostly hispanic jobseekers some without 
skills some talented craftsmen have gathered informally on the 
citys streets for years their numbers have increased since the 
1986 immigration law 
not all the workers are unauthorized in july 1988 for example 
63 illegal aliens were arrested in sweeps of sections of placentia 
and orange where day laborers gather but about the same number 
proved they had applied for amnesty

two members of congress planned to spend the 
weekend in beirut to meet with lebanese christian gen michel aoun 
despite warnings from the state department that their lives could 
be in danger 
reps mary rose oakar dohio and nick rahall dwva were 
scheduled to leave thursday night and return to washington sunday 
afternoon said ambassador clovis maksoud the arab league envoy in 
washington 
they are going to try and lend their moral support to the arab 
league efforts to bring peace to lebanon he said 
the offices of both lawmakers declined any comment on the trip 
and it could not be confirmed that they had left 
the state department also declined to discuss the trip but 
noted that travel to lebanon was banned for most americans eight 
americans are being held hostage by iranianbacked extremists there 
the danger for americans is compounded by the fact that the us 
embassy evacuated all its personnel last month in response to 
veiled threats of kidnapping by aoun 
there is no support we can provide for americans there now 
said one official its a very unsafe place lifethreatening 
but maksoud insisted the two american lawmakers would be safe 
its not a problem he said security is guaranteed in the 
city by a committee of officers from several arab league members 
including algeria and saudi arabia he said necessary measures 
will be taken 
aoun has rejected the plan for ending lebanons 14year civil 
war saying it fails to set a deadline for the pullout of 40000 
syrian troops sent into the country in 1976 the plan worked out 
by christian and moslem lawmakers after three weeks of 
deliberations in saudi arabia would shift control of the countrys 
political institutions from the christian minority into the hands 
of the moslem majority 
oakar and rahall both of lebanese descent visited lebanon in 
1982 at the height of the fighting between israeli syrian and 
lebanese troops to condemn the israeli invasion of lebanon 
ms oakar sought to travel to beirut again in august but was 
asked by the state department to refrain from traveling to the 
capital which was under intense artillery pressure from syrian and 
lebanese christian gunners

a politburo member met with prodemocracy leaders 
thursday a first for the orthodox communists who run east germany 
and authorities urged reform activists to stop voicing their 
demands in street protests 
about 100000 people in dresden ignored the appeal and attended 
a rally thursday night at which speakers demanded rapid reform 
lutheran church sources said 
adn the official news agency said thousands showed up earlier 
in the day for a meeting on reform sponsored by communist party 
officials in the southern industrial city 
it said 15000 people conducted a candlelight march through 
downtown erfurt in the southwest and that 25000 people marched 
through rostock on the baltic coast 
the news agency said 5000 demonstrated in gera west of 
dresden shouting democracy now or never and we are the 
people 
premier willi stoph announced that more highquality consumer 
goods would be imported although east germanys economy is the 
envy of soviet bloc neighbors such goods often can be found only 
in hardcurrency shops 
egon krenz the nations new leader spoke by telephone for 20 
minutes with chancellor helmut kohl of west germany the haven for 
tens of thousands of east germans who fled in search of freedom it 
was their first contact since krenz replaced erich honecker as 
party chief last week 
a statement from the national lawyers union called for 
multiplecandidate elections and public control of vote counting 
adn reported 
the twohour meeting between guenter schabowski and two leaders 
of new forum largest of the new prodemocracy organizations was 
the first of a member of the ruling party politburo with the 
opposition 
new forum is officially banned although tolerated and the 
party had said it would not talk to opposition groups 
schabowski also the east berlin party chief met with jens 
reich a molecular biologist at the academy of sciences and 
physicist sebastian pflugbeil both founding members of new forum 
reich told reporters after the meeting held in the communist 
party central committee building that the talks were open and 
constructive 
we presented new forums concepts and ideas he said 
asked why schabowski invited them reich said he told us he 
wanted to begin a new political course and wanted to learn about 
the whole political spectrum here 
he said schabowski assured him the governments new interest in 
dialogue as a way of solving the nations problems was a real 
change and not a tactical move 
when asked if he believed that the scientist replied we will 
see i can say cautiously that i have a positive impression 
official recognition of new forum was discussed reich said but 
schabowski told him it was beyond his capacity the 
organization was banned last month 
adn reported that reich and pflugbeil described as members of 
an initiative group that calls itself new forum had met with 
schabowski 
new forum which advocates democratic change within the 
communist system claims more than 15000 members 
krenz hinted wednesday the opposition might be included in 
discussion of reform but repeated that the communist partys 
leading role in society was not to be questioned 
on wednesday night about 20000 people marched in 
neubrandenburg and 5000 in jena despite the new leaderships 
promise earlier in the day to permit freer travel and consider 
reform 
a protest by more than 300000 people monday in leipzig was the 
largest in the nations 40year history 
police initially used clubs to break up peaceful prodemocracy 
protests but have not done so since oct 9 
mayor erhard krack of east berlin invited citizens interested 
in dialogue to attend a discussion sunday adn reported in 
dresden it said government leaders met thursday to discuss 
regional reforms 
schabowski and other officials have appealed to citizens to stop 
the protests he told west german tv on wednesday he had spoken 
with lutheran church officials and asked them to use their 
influence 
neues deutschland the communist party newspaper said in a 
commentary thursday we need dialogue not howling unrest 
dresdens mayor said a recent peaceful march there was marred by 
a people who instead of seeking dialogue shouted red bums 
communist pigs and hang them 
kohls spokesman hans klein said the west german chancellor 
telephoned krenz to discuss ways of improving relations 
an adn dispatch said krenz made clear to kohl that east germany 
would remain a communist state and asked once again that bonn 
recognize separate east german citizenship 
west germanys policy of immediately recognizes any german 
immigrant as a citizen has been a major factor in the flight over 
the past few months of more than 60000 east germans most of them 
young skilled workers 
both krenz and kohl have expressed interest in a summit but it 
is not expected before next year

a federal jury convicted three men and 
acquitted two others thursday on charges they conspired with 
colombian drug kingpin carlos lehder rivas to smuggle cocaine into 
the united states 
the jury reached its verdict after 18 hours of deliberation over 
three days in the socalled son of lehder trial which grew out 
of testimony in last years trial of lehder lehder 40 reputedly 
one of the founders of the medellin cocaine cartel was convicted 
and is serving a life prison term 
the five defendants in the sevenweeklong trial were accused of 
conspiring with lehder to either smuggle cocaine into the united 
states or distribute it once it got there 
jack carlton reed 59 was found guilty of conspiracy to 
distribute cocaine and operating a continuing criminal enterprise 
reed was convicted last year on drug conspiracy charges and 
sentenced to 15 years in prison 
prosecutors called reed one of lehders chief lieutenants who 
worked as lehders contact with americans in the organization 
hyannis mass attorney barry kane 52 and donald lady 41 of 
pomona calif were both convicted of conspiracy to import 
cocaine but were found innocent of conspiracy to distribute 
cocaine 
kane collapsed after us district judge john h moore ii 
formally pronounced him guilty but was quickly revived 
reed kane and lady face prison sentences of 10 years to life 
moore ordered them held pending sentencing jan 12 
according to the charges kane picked up 250 kilograms of 
cocaine from cartel leader pablo escobars ranch and flew it back 
to the us on two occasions in the summer of 1977 
lady was accused of acquiring a ranch in the baja peninsula to 
be used as a waystation for cocaine flights from colombia in early 
1987 
acquitted were thomas h herington 35 of mill valley calif 
and samuel t stewart 53 of anaheim 
justice prevailed said stewart who was accused of flying 
cocaine from colombia to normans cay in the summer of 1978 as he 
left the courthouse following the 7weeklong trial if it is any 
consolation i was innocent 
stewarts attorney kevin sanders said the trial had damaged 
his clients aircharter business as well as his health and 
reputation 
herington a student in engineering physics refused to comment 
but his attorney patrick hallinan of san francisco said its a 
great pleasure hes very very happy 
herington who was accused of transporting cocaine from orlando 
to california in a rented lear jet in the late 1970s had testified 
he didnt know lehder and had withdrawn from the conspiracy more 
than five years ago the statute of limitations for the crime is 
five years 
raymond david who represented lady said he couldnt understand 
how his client could have been found guilty when others were 
acquitted 
its inconsistent david said he was not very happy 
the prosecutor assistant us attorney ernst mueller said 
jurors had a difficult job sorting out the evidence he also said 
he wanted to prosecute all the cartel leaders in the indictment 
it is our hope we can get pablo escobar gonzalo rodriguez 
gacha jorge ochoa fabio ochoa and gonzalo mejia he said 
naming several leaders we feel we have the best case against 
them

after nine stressful days since the 
earthquake the audience was ready thursday to look away from 
natures fury and consider what isnt there 
the issue who invented the doughnut hole 
mankind in its own wisdom invented the hole in the 
doughnut municipal court judge george t choppelas ruled after 
an hour of hilarious legal outrage in the 59th session of the mock 
san francisco court of historical review 
so ruling if meaninglessly the judge shot down conflicting 
opinions that the hole in the doughnut may have been the work of a 
dutch sea captain a nearsighted chinese baker 4600 years ago or 
an italian cook who took his eye off the pasta 
the judge a real jurist in a real courtroom started the 
whimsical proceedings on a serious note telling a standing room 
audience of 100 people that he had second thoughts about convening 
the mock court because of the deadly terror of last weeks 
earthquake 
we almost did cancel choppelas said but this is a part 
of a tradition of san francisco we do this for those who expect it 
and enjoy it 
after all he said was this not the forum where has been 
decided such weighty matters as where was the martini 
invented is chicken soup jewish penicillin who invented 
spaghetti and did albert einstein have a fling with marilyn 
monroe 
with that the trial commenced and attorney frank winston 
said his opposing counsel had laryngitis and the case could be 
settled without further ado he was for the dutch sea captain 
i object said san francisco supervisor angela alioto 
arguing that an italian inspired either by the roman coliseum or a 
ciambella a tire invented the hole 
wearing kitchen duds chef jo jung of the restaurant of the same 
name took the stand to testify that an anonymous chef 46 centuries 
ago was frying some dough and stuck a chopstick through it 
thats where we get hole jung testified whipping out a 
package of chinese dumplings he deftly impaled with a handy 
chopstick that how he said trumphantly offering a morsel to 
the judge 
bribery hollered winston 
after choppelas threw jung off the stand italian chef and 
restaurateur angelo quaranta of the allegro was called 
hah he sneered jung is a cook i am a chef and he 
hauled out his toque and planted it on his head 
jung leaped to his feet winston called for a bailiff and the 
judge held his head 
it was an italian i tell you quaranta testified 
passionately as he was ejected from the witness chair 
i object yelled jung 
in the end the italian chef ordered a tray of his own doughnuts 
handed around the courtroom with napkins

research scientists on thursday criticized the 
energy departments plans for greater competition for funds between 
two different approaches toward harnessing fusion the energy 
source of the sun and stars 
the researchers told a house panel they would like to see a 
substantial increase perhaps as much as a doubling of government 
support for both approaches magnetic fusion and inertial 
confinement fusion 
a billion dollars a year to me does not seem like too much to 
have an energy future said robert l mccrory director of the 
laboratory for laser energetics at the university of rochester 
for the current fiscal year that began oct 1 the department 
has about 510 million for fusion research 340 million for 
magnetic fusion and 170 for inertial confinement fusion 
fusion is the release of energy by the combination of certain 
forms of hydrogen atoms to make helium enormous amounts of energy 
are required to trigger the reaction 
the magnetic approach uses powerful magnetic fields to compress 
a superheated gas plasma whirling at high speed within a 
doughnutshaped apparatus known as a tokamak 
the inertial confinement approach would fire laser or particle 
beams at a peasized target to try to attain the extremely high 
temperatures and pressures needed 
in opening the hearing rep robert a roe dnj chairman of 
the house science investigations and oversight subcommittee said 
that fusion energy needs to be a central part of our energy 
policy for the next century 
we should take the lead in developing for the world a 
technology that will allow china to stop burning dirty coal that 
will remove the need for using the amazon forest as a fuel source 
and that will save our atmosphere from pollution and warming he 
said 
earlier this month robert o hunter director of the energy 
departments office of energy research testified the department 
favors a competition between magnetic and inertial confinement 
fusion with a winner to be selected early in the next century 
however mccrory said he was worried that such a competition 
could be used as a pretext for shortchanging the effort to achieve 
useful fusion energy 
erik storm deputy associate director for inertial confinement 
fusion at lawrence livermore national laboratory livermore 
calif said the two approaches to fusion should be complementary 
and collaborative rather than being in competition 
he predicted that very ambitious research and development 
probably could produce prototype fusion plants by 2020 but without 
substantial increases in spending it might take 30 to 50 years 
longer

incidents of shootings on los angeles county 
roads soared between 1985 and 1987 but contrary to popular 
belief most gunplay occurred on streets instead of highways 
researchers said thursday 
it was occurring on the surface streets and everyone thought 
it was the freeways so they were trying to avoid the freeways 
said chukwudi onwuachisaunders lead author of the study published 
in fridays journal of the american medical association 
in 45 percent of the cases drivers said there was no 
confrontation before the attack said the researchers from the 
national centers for disease control in atlanta 
there were 32 firearm assaults on roadways in 1985 followed by 
91 in 1986 and 137 in 1987 said the researchers who used figures 
compiled by california law enforcement agencies assaults were 
defined as shootings or the threatening display of a gun 
california authorities were unable to provide 1988 figures 
thursday but california highway patrol officer jill angel said the 
number of highway shootings had dropped dramatically since 1987 
our last confirmed shooting was in july 1988 she said 
highway violence is still going on in terms of fights between 
drivers angel added we average anywhere between five and 10 
incidents a week we just arent getting the reported shootings 
of the 137 assaults in 1987 83 or 61 percent were actual 
shootings the study said in the other 54 cases a gun was 
displayed but not fired the breakdown for other years was not 
provided 
two of the 1987 shootings were fatal and 15 caused wounds said 
the authors who had been asked by california health officials to 
look into highway shootings 
the assaults occurred on all types of roads but usually took 
place on surface streets defined as streets with speed limits of 
35 mph or less said onwuachisaunders 
of the 1987 cases only 49 or 36 percent occurred on freeways 
and one incident occurred on a highway the researchers said 
unlike freeways highways have intersections and traffic lights 
in 38 percent of the incidents victims told police some sort of 
interaction with the gunman had occurred such as changing lanes 
the study said but in 45 percent no such provocation had taken 
place seventeen percent were unsure whether a drivingassociated 
act had prompted the attack 
onwuachisaunders said the chances of being assaulted by someone 
carrying a gun while driving are tinythe overall number of 
roadway assaults was very small she said 
however the national safety council is so concerned with driver 
behavior that it is initiating a course on driving attitudes said 
john mccarthy of the nonprofit organizations driver improvement 
section 
a driver angered by another driver should not take the slight 
personally mccarthy said 
you dont know whats going on in the other persons head 
he said they could be involved in an emergency situation they 
could be on the phone but its not a personal thing life is 
too short to get that upset at another driver

bolar pharmaceutical co has agreed to extend 
a recall of an antibiotic used to treat urinary tract infections to 
include drugstore shelves the food and drug administration said 
thursday 
bolar had agreed oct 6 to recall its generic nitrofurantoin 
macrocrystalline antibiotic capsules from distributors and 
wholesalers but the fda had said it wanted the drug removed from 
pharmacies as well the agency had said it would recommend legal 
action if the company did not comply 
the agency requested the recall because it said it had evidence 
that bolar substituted the brand name product norwich eatons 
macrodantin for its own in tests required for fda approval 
the fda said that while no safety problems were found with the 
drug the agency could not assure that it was therapeutically 
equivalent to macrodantin 
in a letter to its customers wednesday bolar requested they 
extend the recall to the retail level 
in addition to the recall request the fda is trying to revoke 
the companys approval to sell the drug

canadian observers of nicaraguas election 
preparations said thursday that united states is doing everything 
it can to disrupt the elections set for next year 
american intervention continues as the main obstacle to the 
attainment of free and fair elections in nicaragua the 
registration observer mission said in a report prepared after four 
weeks in the central american country 
the group also said usbacked contra rebels were trying to 
sabotage the elections set for feb 25 nicaraguas leftist 
sandinista government has made the same charge 
the fourman canadian observer mission was sponsored by the 
committee for peace and democracy in nicaragua a group of 
representatives of church human rights and academic groups as well 
as unions and development agencies 
its report said the us government is disrupting the election 
process by its continued support of contra guerrillas and by 
largescale massive illegal financing of opposition groups and 
parties 
robert fox who coordinated the observer mission said the us 
actions are all part of a strategy to destabilize the election 
process 
the report said the us government is spending millions of 
dollars supporting the united national opposition an opposition 
party and other antigovernment groups it called the aid an 
intrusion on nicaraguan sovereignty 
earlier this month president bush signed a 9 million aid 
package designed to support nicaraguan opposition groups 
the bush administration wants to see president daniel ortegas 
government voted out of office and contends that election 
preparations unfairly benefit the sandinistas 
the elections come under a regional peace plan under which five 
central american presidents agreed to disband the contras based 
in neighboring honduras by dec 8 in exchange ortega moved up 
the election date from 1991 and promised free balloting 
the canadian observers said the contras are waging a campaign 
of intimidation with the clear message if you support the 
sandinista government we will be back to kill you 
contras killed 42 people last month in election violence fox 
said 
last year washington cut off military aid to the contras but 
it still supplies them with nonlethal aid

retired engineering professor george 
housner will head gov george deukmejians investigation of the 
oakland freeway collapse the governors office announced thursday 
his shortlived predecessor meanwhile applauded the 
appointment while offering his own theories on what might have 
caused the collapse during the oct 17 earthquake that killed more 
than three dozen motorists 
housner professor emeritus at the california institute of 
technology in pasadena is the elder statesman of earthquake 
engineering in this country said ian buckle who occupied 
housners post until monday when deukmejian decided he had 
compromised his objectivity the governor issued no comment on his 
latest appointment other than to say his work must be fair 
objective and complete 
george housner certainly has the stature and therefore i would 
expect him to do a good job said buckle reached at his desk at 
the national center for earthquake engineering research in buffalo 
ny 
housner will head an unnamed panel of experts in the search for 
reasons and circumstances behind the collapse of the 14mile 
elevated freeway the performance of the state department of 
transportation will fall under the panels scrutiny deukmejian has 
indicated 
on monday deukmejian said buckle also a noted earthquake 
engineer would be replaced after the governor learned that buckle 
had published an article the previous thursday that among other 
things defended the transportation department 
buckle who served about four days said thursday that he 
actually offered to resign after learning from transportation 
director robert best late sunday that the governor had doubts 
about my objectivity 
buckle largely unreachable since last week on wednesday threw 
his theories into the bubbling brew of what might have caused the 
i880 doubledecker to collapse 
first of all i want to say that i believe there will be 
surprises there will be lessons to learn from this collapse the 
obvious thing is that the columns failed said buckle who was 
among the first experts to spend extensive time at the site the 
question is did they fail first or was it something else he 
said 
other factors he said could range from a theory advanced 
wednesday by berkeley scientists that the base of the upperdeck 
columns failed first to a theory of unstable ground beneath and a 
lack of uniform rigidity along the length of the structure we 
have learned from the past that variations in rigidity can cause 
problems in earthquakes he said 
as for the berkeley scientists theory buckle said it makes 
sense that where the thighbone connects to the shinbone so to 
speak youre going to have problems i would say that theory 
probably is a good one 
in another development clayton giroux the designer of the 
collapsed i880 said he watched in horror as televised newscasts 
showed the wreckage of what he had viewed as one of his greatest 
engineering achievements 
giroux 63 added but he added i dont have guilt over it 
just a strong sense of disappointment and tragedy 
out of this will come learning similar to sylmar the 1971 
earthquake in southern california and future lives will be 
saved giroux said unfortunately we only learn about 
earthquakes from earthquakes

state officials in august had enough 
concern about the seismic weaknesses of three san francisco bay 
area elevated freeways to seek expedited repairs 
but the almost identical i880 freeway which collapsed in last 
weeks quake wasnt mentioned an internal memorandum shows state 
engineers have said several times since the collapse that they 
firmly believed i880 would not fall down in a quake 
the memo from james gates a structural engineer with the state 
transportation departments special projects office to engineer 
bill jones described extensive seismic retrofit work needed 
for san franciscos embarcadero freeway 
the memo adds that san franciscos i280 viaduct and its central 
viaduct also are known to contain this vulnerable 
configuration and at the request of chief structural engineer 
jim roberts should also be added to the phase 2 retrofit 
program along with the embarcadero 
all three structures were closed with extensive damage after 
last weeks 71magnitude quake but none collapsed like i880 
also called the nimitz freeway 
roberts asked to comment during caltrans daily press briefing 
thursday said gates may have written a memo i havent seen 
that memo and added that much of it was not accurate 
he said that among the four bay area doubledecker freeways 
only the embarcadero had been singled out for expedited seismic 
strengthening 
but according to gates the department performed a seismic study 
on i280 and the central viaduct roberts said again thursday that 
his department had not analyzed the nimitz for earthquake strength 
since 1977 when was fitted with cables to strengthen horizontal 
decking against quakes that 1977 analysis cannot be found roberts 
said earlier this week 
the gates memo notes that the design of some vertical columns on 
the upper deck of the embarcadero create a potentially unstable 
situation and need strengthening the same condition exists on 
i280 and the central viaduct

a tanker carrying more than 14 million 
gallons of north slope crude oil remained in limbo thursday after 
state officials refused to let the vessel dock without a 
stateapproved oil spill contingency plan 
the unocal corp vessel the sansinena ii was bound for the 
tesoroalaska petroleum co refinery with 147 million gallons of 
oil when the state department of environmental conservation denied 
it permission to dock on tuesday 
dec commissioner dennis kelso said the agency had checked the 
schedule of incoming tanker traffic and noticed the tanker had no 
stateapproved spill plan 
were still continuing to work on the problem said barry 
lane a unocal spokesman in los angeles we do know we do have a 
plan for the vessel we thought we had a stateapproved plan were 
in the process of updating it 
cook inlet and prince william sound have been the focus of 
heightened dec review since the march 24 grounding of the tanker 
exxon valdez the 11 million gallon spill coated 1000 miles of 
shoreline from the sound to cook inlet disrupting fishing seasons 
after the grounding the dec announced that cook inlet tanker 
traffic would be reexamined the department said it would turn 
away tankers lacking appropriate spill contingency plans 
kelso however said the unocal tanker was nabbed under a law 
strengthened last year after the tanker glacier bay in july 1987 
spilled 125000 gallons of oil into the inlets salmonrich waters 
the law requires spill contingency plans for any vessel carrying 
more than 420000 gallons of oil and allows the dec to ensure they 
will work 
the 810foot unocal tanker with a capacity of slightly more 
than 22 million gallons has been sailing between alaska and san 
francisco since it was built in 1971 lane said 
larry dietrick the decs environmental quality director said 
unocal had asked for and been denied a variance that would allow 
the tanker to load or unload in cook inlet 
the sansinena ii is the third tanker caught this year operating 
in cook inlet waters without a spill plan kelso said 
unocal had planned for the vessel to unload its cargo at the 
refinery in nikiski a small port community on the kenai peninsula 
the ship was then supposed to pick up cook inlet crude oil before 
returning to california said joe sautner an environmental field 
officer in the decs oil program 
unocal submitted a plan for the tanker late wednesday and it 
was under review thursday kelso said state officials have up to 
65 days to review such plans but they said it seldom takes that 
long 
while unocal made reference to plans submitted in 1978 and 1984 
those could not be found and would have expired in three years 
sautner said 
sautner said the new unocal plan would be reviewed carefully 
but he added that state officials were anxious to find some way of 
allowing the tanker to unload to reduce the chances of an incident 
we are suggesting they unocal officials first look into 
whether they can contract with another company that has an approved 
plan so they might be covered that way dec spokesman joe 
ferguson 
unocal has other vessels but not working in cook inlet and 
carrying the necessary plan sautner said 
if another company amended its plan to incorporate the tanker 
the vessel would be treated as that companys in the event of a 
spill and that might make it difficult to find a willing company 
he said

novelist and critic mary mccarthy whose 
scathing wit and bold explorations of social mores made her one of 
americas preeminent literary lions died of cancer wednesday at 
the age of 77 
miss mccarthy died at new york hospital said dixie sheridan 
spokeswoman for the authors alma mater vassar college in 
poughkeepsie 
though she first made her mark among the brawling new york 
intellectuals of the 1930s writing literary and theatrical reviews 
for the nation and partisan review miss mccarthy reached a wider 
audience only in 1963 with her novel the group 
the spicy bestselling chronicle of the lives of eight college 
graduates starting out in the 1930s was made into a movie in 1966 
miss mccarthy had an unerring ability to spot the hidden 
weakness or inconsistency in any literary effort and every person 
to this weakness she instinctively leaped with cries of pleasure 
surprised that her victim as he lay torn and bleeding did not 
applaud her perspicacity wrote alfred kazin a member and 
chronicler of new yorks jazz age intellectuals 
norman mailer once called her our first lady of letters 
she provoked a celebrated literary feud with lillian hellman by 
declaring on national television everything she writes is a 
lie including and and the 
hellman sued for libel but died in 1984 before the suit reached 
a trial which miss mccarthy eagerly sought 
she had also been sued by a former lover partisan review editor 
philip rahv who objected to her portrait of him in the oasis 
the suit was dropped 
she had a reputation for being a sharp and dangerous woman but 
there was no justification whatever for it in the sphere of her 
friendships said poet james merrill one of miss mccarthys 
close friends upon hearing of her death 
william jovanovich chairman of harcourt brace jovanovich inc 
miss mccarthys publisher said in a statement she treasured 
intelligence and wit and was herself blessed with both mary 
mccarthy doubted much but was never a cynic her political views 
were at times criticized at times applauded but were at all times 
selfless 
she was very very clever and also very brave in saying what 
she thought said essayist elizabeth hardwick another close 
friend there was no trendiness in mary she stood up for what 
she believed in 
most of her writing was autobiographical beginning with the 
company she keeps published in 1942 a series of interconnected 
short stories about the people she knew in new york during the 
depression 
memories of a catholic girlhood published in 1957 and now 
considered a landmark in autobiographical writing recounted her 
sordid childhood in minneapolis where she was brutally mistreated 
by relatives after her parents died 
she was awarded many honors for her work including membership 
in the american academy of arts and letters and the national 
institute of arts and letters two guggenheim fellowships the 
national medal for literature and the horizon prize 
miss mccarthy was born in seattle on june 21 1912 the daughter 
of roy winfield mccarthy and therese preston mccarthy a handsome 
and romantic couple who died within a day of each other during the 
flu epidemic of 1918 
mary who was 6 and three younger brothers were entrusted to 
the care of aunt margaret and uncle meyers sadistic and miserly 
guardians who dressed them like paupers fed them a diet of root 
vegetables forbade reading and at night taped their mouths shut 
to prevent mouth breathing 
how i grew published in 1987 as a sequel to memories 
described her timely rescue at 11 by her maternal grandparents who 
took her west to tacoma wash and enrolled her in the fashionable 
annie wright seminary the book she once wrote was the story of 
the birth of a mind 
the seminary where she became an atheist prepared her for 
vassar where she hobnobbed with the bright wealthy eastern 
society girls she used as models for her characters in the 
group 
with her keen eye for detail ruthless wit and deep insight 
miss mccarthy for decades was regarded the ultimate highbrow of new 
york radical and intellectual circles she moved to paris in 1962 
dividing her time between a comfortable left bank apartment and her 
home in castine maine in recent years she occupied a creative 
writing chair at bard college in annadaleonhudson ny 
one week after graduation in 1933 she married harold johnsrud 
an actor the marriage was brief and in 1938 miss mccarthy married 
her professor the eminent critic edmund wilson they had one son 
reuel before a bitter divorce in which each accused the other of 
battery 
she met her fourth husband james west while on a trip to 
warsaw divorced her third husband bowden broadwater and married 
west in paris in 1961 
combative outspoken and independent miss mccarthy wrote about 
subjects as diverse as the pretentious world of academia a 
charmed life and terrorists cannibals and missionaries 
taken as a whole her work explored the concerns of mccarthys 
liberal intellectual set from the 1930s through the 1970s sexual 
freedom in the 30s radicalism in the 40s and 50s vietnam and 
social and moral upheaval of the 60s the watergate scandal and the 
rise of terrorism in the 70s 
mccarthy was often hailed as a feminist before her time but she 
always refused that label saying equality between the sexes was 
unrealistic 
somebody has to give more she told an interviewer in 1987 
her belief was simple women should learn to think for themselves 
and act accordingly 
if she appeared cold and hard in her judgments of others she 
was even harder on herself at 74 on the eve of the publication of 
how i grew in 1987 she was asked her assessment of herself 
not favorable she replied 
she is survived by west and her son a private funeral was 
planned for next week in castine

about 1200 of the 12000 
salvadoran refugees in honduras began returning home wednesday as 
part of a unsponsored program that refugees and their supporters 
said had stalled 
everything is ready for them to go back home said ulrich 
von blumenthal the un high commission for refugees 
representative in tegucigalpa 
his agency contracted for 41 buses and 150 trucks to carry the 
refugees and their few belongings back to el salvador 
blumenthal said the convoy probably would reach el salvador 
before dawn thursday traveling slowly over dangerous dirt roads 
the salvadorans have been living in refugee camps operated by 
the united nations during the nearly 10yearold civil war in their 
homeland those returning first have been staying in a camp at mesa 
grande 35 miles from the salvadoran border 225 miles west of 
tegucigalpa 
they included 189 refugees who abandoned the camp to make a 
sevenmile protest march oct 16 to a small roman catholic church 
in san marcos de ocotepeque 
spokesmen for the refugees said they protested to pressure the 
united nations into providing transportation for the return to el 
salvador 
blumenthal maintained the refugees moved because they did not 
want to be caught by authorities who showed up later at mesa grande 
to check documents he said his commission does not aid the return 
of undocumented refugees 
about 20 members of the us church group going home formed a 
human chain around the san marcos church to protect the refugees 
from the repression and the aggressive attitude of the honduran 
army they said in a communique 
blumenthal said the honduran soldiers are there to facilitate 
the repatriation 
members of the church group say the un commission opposed the 
refugees return because salvadoran president alfredo cristiani 
doesnt want them back 
the salvadoran armed forces say the leftist guerrillas of the 
farabundo marti national liberation front have converted honduran 
refugee camps into retreats for rebels and their families 
providing sanctuaries for rest from combat fatigue and recuperation 
from injuries 
the us government which has backed the salvadoran government 
against the marxist insurgents considers refugees to be rebel 
sympathizers 
eugenio castro a spokesmen for the salvadoran foreign ministry 
denied the church groups charge the salvadoran government has 
demonstrated its willingness to receive refugees and will do it 
he said 
blumenthal said the church group just wanted to politicize the 
repatriation the organization has made a series of stupid moves 
and blocked the relocation of the salvadorans he said 
salvadoran interior secretary enrique ortiz colindres said the 
10800 refugees remaining in honduran camps will be repatriated 
within two weeks

to do said senate republican leader bob dole of kansas there 
should not be a contest about how much money we can drag out of the 
us treasury 
under pressure to do more bush has expanded his aid proposal to 
its current level of 451 million over three years 
however the house last week voted for an 840 million package

zsa zsa gabor accustomed to a life of 
entertainment and elegant gowns can expect a lonely cell and a 
cotton shift or pantsuit if she chooses to serve her 72hour jail 
term at the county womens jail 
but she would get color television 
under the sentence handed down tuesday by beverly hills 
municipal court judge charles g rubin the convicted copslapper 
may choose any jail in los angeles county to complete her 72hour 
stay behind bars before dec 29 
miss gabor said she was still upset about the sentence wednesday 
in a brief telephone interview with the associated press miss 
gabor said she was afraid of most reporters because one demanded to 
see the age listed on her drivers license 
i dont know why you all do this to me she declared i 
was just trying to save the women of america she said before 
hanging up abruptly the actress was in the middle of taping an 
interview for the television program a current affair 
in that interview miss gabor said the judge and prosecutor ira 
reiner enjoyed the trials circuslike publicity more than she did 
they loved it they milked it i dont need it she said 
im a rich woman i dont need these people they needed me 
a jury convicted miss gabor on sept 29 of misdemeanor charges 
of battery on a police officer driving without a valid drivers 
license and having an open container of alcohol in her car the 
former hungarian beauty queen believed to be in her mid60s was 
acquitted of failing to obey an officer 
the judge ordered also miss gabor to pay 1293750 in fines and 
restitution and to perform 120 hours of community service in a 
womens homeless shelter where she may not talk about her case or 
give interviews 
its nothing for me she said of the community service 
during the television interview i do much more a year i love 
it 
the judge said her unrepentant attitude contributed to the 
sentence she faced a maximum of 18 months in jail 
miss gabor also was ordered to be interviewed by a psychiatrist 
and refrain from driving until she gets her real age on her 
drivers license during the trial miss gabor claimed the license 
was stolen and altered by someone else 
maybe i should have my head examined hes right miss gabor 
told a current affair if i tried to fight city hall and the 
beverly hills police a woman should have her head examined 
sybil brand institute the countys jail for women is probably 
the institution best equipped to deal with a celebrity inmate such 
as miss gabor sheriff sherman block said wednesday 
she will receive absolutely no special privileges here said 
lt joe surgent in charge of operations for sybil brand which has 
an estimated 2000 inmates 
such personalities as patty hearst have been held at sybil brand 
and cynthia garvey exwife of former baseball player steve garvey 
recently spent a night there for contempt in a childcustody 
dispute 
anytime we have an inmate who is recognizable we separate 
them from the general population for their own safety surgent 
said people with that kind of notoriety can be preyed upon 
miss gabor would be alone when she eats showers and even 
watches television except for when a deputy escorts her from her 
cell to the shower area he said 
block called miss gabors ability to choose where she will serve 
her sentence a perversion of the system 
if she chooses sybil brand miss gabor will be booked searched 
and ordered to trade her clothes for a jail uniform like any other 
inmate surgent said wednesday she would be given an 8by10 foot 
concrete jail cell furnished with a bed sink and toilet he said

president bush called for legislation thursday 
that would allow dangerous pesticides to be taken off the market 
more quickly saying the governments ability to ensure a safe food 
supply was being called into question 
but his proposed changes in how pesticides and other chemicals 
on foods are regulated were criticized immediately by 
environmentalists and some members of congress who said provisions 
of the presidents plan could instead make foods less safe 
while bushs proposal to streamline regulation was praised 
critics said other provisions of his plan would ease the risk 
levels used to determine if a pesticide is to be banned and also 
would have the government preempt state pesticidecontrol laws that 
often are stronger than federal rules 
the president in announcing the proposed legislation alluded 
to widespread publicity earlier this year over the use of alar on 
apples and the governments inability to remove the cancercausing 
chemical from the market swiftly

clings to about a third of the nation 
its not as bad this year said norton strommen chief

nationwide producers are seeing yield increases of up to 30 
percent over last year strommen said farmers also planted more 
acreage than in 1988

the final date of reckoning may be more than 
five months away but many people are checking up now on the 
incometax bill they expect to owe uncle sam for 1989 
their purpose is simple to avoid facing a penalty for 
underpayment of estimated and withholding taxes when they file 
their returns for the year 
ordinarily this isnt a big worry for people who get most or all 
of their income from wages or salaries the withholding tax 
collected from each paycheck covers what they will owe 
in fact most individual tax returns that are filed each year 
carry claims for refunds 
but the penalty still lurks as a potential pitfall for anyone 
wealthy or not who for one reason or another gets down to the 
bottom line of the tax form with a significant unpaid balance 
withholding may not cover your tax warns the jk lasser 
institute in its annual guide your income tax 
the withholding tax rate may be below your actual tax rate 
when considering other income such as interest dividends business 
income and capital gains 
there are specific rules to determine who must pay a penalty 
and who doesnt have to when there is a balance owed to the 
internal revenue service at the end of a year 
you are generally in the clear if your withholding and any 
estimated payments made on schedule add up to at least 90 percent 
of the tax owed or if the shortfall is less than 500 
alternatively no penalty is assessed if your payments made in 
1989 at least equal the final amount of tax you owed for 1988 
provided you filed a 1988 return that covered a 12month period 
similarly you are exempt if you had no tax liability for 1988 
and were living in the united states throughout that year 
that gives you several yardsticks to use on your likely 1989 tax 
bill which should be relatively easy to estimate this late in the 
year 
the research may require nothing more than checking the 
amount of yeartodate withholding from your latest paycheck stub 
against the total tax on your return for last year 
but suppose your payments still dont look as though they will 
measure up if you should have been making estimated payments it 
is probably too late to eliminate a penalty with an increased 
quarterly payment for the last installment of the year due in 
january 
there is another way to approach this problem however you can 
narrow or close the gap by asking an employer to take increased 
withholding taxes out of your last few paychecks of the year 
unlike quarterly estimated taxes withholding tax is treated as 
though it were paid in a steady stream through the year unless you 
choose to establish otherwise 
thus notes the research institute of america an 
organization that collects and publishes tax information if an 
employee asks his employer to withhold extra large amounts for the 
rest of the year the penalty can be retroactively eliminated

at a quickening pace scientists are discovering 
the keys to heredity what they learn in the 90s may help man 
control some of his worst ills this is one of a periodic series of 
articles the 90s looking ahead to the promise and peril of 
the upcoming decade in the environment medicine technology and

in the 1980s biologists uncovered the genetic causes of such 
perplexing ailments as cystic fibrosis in the 90s they will turn 
their attention to the genetics of human behavior 
in human genes the basic units of heredity scientists may find 
the roots of such complex disorders as manicdepressive illness and 
schizophrenia unlike simpler ailments studied so far these are 
the result of more than one genetic malfunction 
it will take more than 10 years to understand the molecular 
nature of our emotional life said philip leder chairman of the 
genetics department at harvard medical school but understanding of 
some behavioral disorders should come by the year 2000 he said 
we know a number of these run in families he said we 
dont know what genes are involved in that process they havent 
been identified yet but there is the possibility that with gene 
mapping we will be able to sort them out 
gene mapping is the process of sorting through human chromosomes 
to find the particular genes related to a particular disorder 
heart disease and cancer the nations two leading killers are 
also caused in part by multiple genetic abnormalities they too 
may begin to yield to the rapidly expanding capabilities of 
geneticists leder said 
there are very few diseases that afflict man or mouse that are 
not genetic in one way or another leder said recently at a 
gathering of geneticists at the jackson laboratory in bar harbor 
maine 
by the end of the 1990s researchers should be closer to a 
complete chemicalbychemical understanding of some of these 
ailments said leder one of the inventors of the genetically 
engineered mouse that became in april 1988 the first animal to be 
patented 
david baltimore a nobel laureate at the massachusetts institute 
of technology shares leders optimistic view of the next decade 
the fast pace of molecular biology shows no sign of slowing 
down he wrote recently 
baltimore said studies of the central nervous system are showing 
that nerve cells respond to signals in nearly the same way that 
kidney cells respond to hormones or skin cells respond to growth 
factors 
i think this will be a tremendously exciting field in the next 
10 years one that will not only stimulate discoveries in neurology 
and lead to new treatments for alzheimers disease and other 
degenerative brain diseases but also greatly enrich the fields of 
psychiatry and psychology he wrote 
the growing biotechnology industry where basic research is 
beginning to be translated into products has also issued glowing 
predictions for the 1990s 
the industrys total sales exceeded 2 billion last year that 
is expected to climb to 50 billion by the turn of the century 
according to an industry survey by the ernst and young high 
technology group in new york 
one of the most notable efforts of the coming decade is the 
socalled human genome project a 3 billion program to determine 
the genetic code or sequence of all the estimated 50000 to 
100000 genes that govern human hereditary characteristics the 
complete set of genes is called the genome pronounced jeenome 
the project is being coordinated by the national center for 
human genome research part of the national institutes of health in 
bethesda md 
the centers director james watson one of the discoverers of 
the double helix of dna predicts the project can be completed in 
10 to 15 years 
that will vastly simplify the process of understanding the 
function of individual genes and linking certain genes to disease 
finding disease genes does not immediately lead to a cure for 
the disease researchers must discover how to correct the defective 
genes which can be a difficult task but finding the disease 
genes is a necessary first step in the process of curing disease 
socalled gene therapy in which defective genes can be replaced 
with normal genes was a goal of genetics during much of the past 
decade but it has remained elusive 
many scientists believe however that the first steps toward 
gene therapy will be taken during the next decade and some 
experiments are likely to be at least partly successful 
the leading method will use viruses engineered in the laboratory 
to insert corrective genes into cells as they infect them the 
first trials of the feasibility of this method have just begun at 
the national institutes of health 
some of the difficult questions biologists will have to answer 
in the 1990s will be asked outside the laboratory leder said 
recent events suggest that continuing social concerns over 
animal rights could impede biological research he said 
in april for example demonstrators pounded on windows and 
broke open a door at the national institutes of health and 37 were 
arrested were protesting the murders of millions of animals 
they said 
in june the city council in cambridge mass home to harvard 
and mit adopted animal rights legislation that will allow a 
commissioner to make unannounced lab visits and fine researchers 
300 a day for violations 
there are those who feel the life of a rat is as important as 
the life of a child said leder we have to be prepared to make 
people understand that genetics is another very powerful tool in 
the armamentarium we have against disease

the episcopal church is exploring the frontier 
of desexed liturgical language with proposed text changes that 
will cheer some churchgoers but may upset others in the pews 
among the changes included in the alternative texts under study 
is substituting god who creates redeems and inspires for 
father son and holy spirit 
the supplemental liturgical texts now being experimented with 
in a few hundred parishes also offer other alternatives to 
referring to god and jesus in masculine terms such as lord and 
add prayers that highlight the role of women in religion 
we are trying to answer the need of people throughout the 
country who feel left out women in particular who feel the liturgy 
is maleoriented said bishop vincent pettit chairman of the 
churchs standing liturgical commission 
but while some church leaders welcome the new texts as offering 
a broader vision of god others predict the radical changes in 
church services will unsettle many of the denominations 25 
million members 
are you going to provide flak vests with the book bishop 
robert witcher of the diocese of long island in new york asked the 
commission when the texts were recently presented to the house of 
bishops 
the churchs general convention of 1985 required the liturgical 
commission to develop inclusive language liturgies liturgies that 
do not refer to god in exclusively masculine terms 
in 1988 the general convention voted that the supplemental 
services be made available for testing in parishes no later than 
this advent following a year of consultation between the liturgical 
commission and the house of bishops theology committee 
the rev sarah motley coordinator of the liturgical 
commissions committee on inclusive language in the liturgy 
estimates that 200 to 800 of the churchs approximately 7400 
parishes would experiment with the services in prayer book 
studies 30supplemental liturgical texts 
after the texts are evaluated in the parishes the commission 
will propose supplemental liturgical texts to the 1991 diocesan 
convention 
the change ms motley refers to as in many ways the most 
difficult frontier is the proposed alternative language for the 
traditional terms for the three divine persons in one god that make 
up the christian trinity the father the son and the holy spirit 
for example in the book of common prayer the gloria patri 
recited in morning prayer is glory to the father and to the 
son and to the holy spirit as it was in the beginning is now 
and will be forever the alternative offered by the supplemental 
texts is honor and glory to the holy and undivided trinity god 
who creates redeems and inspires one in three and three in one 
for ever and ever 
other options offered by the supplemental texts include several 
instances where phrases in the prayer book are altered to provide 
genderneutral terms for jesus and god in one part of the holy 
eucharist for example the supplemental texts offer the prayer 
blessed is the one who comes in the name of our god as an 
alternative to blessed is he that cometh in the name of the 
lord 
the supplemental texts are long overdue said marjorie 
christie head of the episcopal womens caucus the ability to 
obliterate the totally masculine words from our worship time is a 
way we are able to broaden our vision of god she said 
pettit said it is helpful for churchgoers to pray to a personal 
god but they have to be careful not to take masculine terms 
literally 
god is not male or female he said 
while the supplemental texts do not advocate deleting all 
masculine references to god they also offer feminine imagery not 
in the current prayer book 
instead of ending the evening worship service asking for the 
blessing of the lord the supplemental texts offer the 
following alternative may the blessing of the god of abraham and 
sarah and of jesus christ born of our sister mary and of the holy 
spirit who broods over the world as a mother over her children be 
upon you and remain with you always 
the texts already have drawn criticism 
i think the result is going to be catastrophic said the 
rev jerome politzer president of the prayer book society in 
america a group of conservative episcopalians who are opposed to 
the 1979 revisions to the 1928 book of common prayer 
politzer said there is nothing universal aesthetic or 
religious about the changes in the supplemental texts and charged 
they amount to a new prayer book 
this is heresy and should be rejected politzer said 
pettit said even if the 1991 general convention approved the 
supplemental texts for use in parishes as an option in addition to 
the prayer book they would not be allowed to be published within 
the book of common prayer 
were looking 20 years down the road to prayer book 
revision he said 
but advocates for inclusive language hope one day the prayer 
book will be revised to reflect their concerns 
yes it will be uncomfortable because explorations are 
uncomfortable but it may bring us closer to the god who calls 
us said ms motley its the old question do people go to 
church to be comforted or to be challenged

some american jewish organizations have 
expressed concern about a proposed statement by three roman 
catholic archbishops calling upon israel to negotiate with 
palestinians over territory and sovereignty 
the antidefamation league of bnai brith said the statement 
drafted by cardinal john oconnor of new york archbishop roger 
mahony of los angeles and archbishop william keeler of baltimore in 
effect calls for a palestinian state 
hope for progress rests on getting the parties together 
without predetermined results the league said to call for a 
state forecloses options of which there are many and injects a 
proposal into the equation that israel and the us oppose 
a statement from the synagogue council of america said the 
bishops proposal prejudges what can only be achieved through the 
process of negotiations which is the domain of the political 
entities rather than religious bodies 
rabbi alexander m schindler president of the union of american 
hebrew congregations the central body of reform judaism in north 
america also said the issue of palestinian territorial and 
political sovereignty should be left to the negotiating parties 
themselves 
the bishops statement toward peace in the middle east 
problems and principles will be presented to the national 
conference of catholic bishops fall meeting nov 69 in baltimore

thomas powers oversees the nations 
smallest state prison population like a businessman spreading 
responsibility among his staff and employing what he likes to call 
mbwa management by wandering around 
we have a product and our product is people said powers 
32 weve got to do a pretty good job of making them better 
people 
the 6foot4 245pound powers tours each cell block twice a 
week and meets with 20 to 25 prisoners a week to discuss their 
problems it gives the inmates the opportunity to know that from 
the top down were here to help them and not punish them 
robert cartledge a guard for seven years called him a new 
generation warden hes more of a handson guy hes a lot 
closer with the inmates 
cool guy said laverne charley fasthorse whos doing 
three years for burglary hes a christian you know hes a good 
man tom participates with the people i mean im on his basketball 
team 
powers became warden a year ago of a prison with cell blocks as 
new as 1987 and as old as 1915 with an average population of 515 
one to a cell 
in september the us justice department listed the 
penitentiary as the nations smallest 456 inmates down from 466 
in 1988 and one of two states with a drop in prison population 
the other was tennessee 
and while the national recidivism rate is 50 percent to 60 
percent powers estimated only about 45 percent to 50 percent of 
north dakota prisoners make a return trip and said i think a 
realistic goal is 33 percent 
while acknowledging that some prisons crazy places 
overcrowded and rife with related problems are beyond any 
wardens help he said it would be theultimate challenge to 
run one 
powers credits his staff for much of his success and believes 
that with a good staff the programs and the type of rapport he has 
built with inmates at the north dakota state penitentiary could be 
successful at larger prisons 
i ran a 100bed prison and was told i couldnt do those things 
in a 250bed prison i ran a 250bed prison and was told i couldnt 
do it in a 500bed prison although im content now i might want 
to move on to a bigger penitentiary in the federal system and do 
what were doing here 
a native of syracuse ny powers grew up in pennsylvania and 
graduated from villanova university majoring in sociology and 
criminal justice after he attended the pennsylvania department of 
corrections training academy he became a deputy warden of the 
cumberland county prison in carlisle pa and at age 27 became the 
warden at the bradford county prison in towanda pa 
he supports president bushs call for the death penalty for 
heinous crimes and drug kingpins i think it needs to be 
stringent and narrow in scope but believes america needs more 
minimumsecurity prisons and halfway houses to keep people 
convicted of lesser crimes separate from hardcore criminals 
i think in this business there is a degree of overkill he 
said anytime you take an individual out of their home 
environment and they cant see their family youre going to have 
an impact 
we use the family to our benefit the family is too often 
overlooked in this business 
where possible criminals should be imprisoned close to their 
families and communities and should participate in workrelease 
programs that would benefit the community he said my philosophy 
is that inmates have taken from society and they have to give 
something back 
he acknowledges however that there are 10 percent of the 
people in this business who you will never reach 
ninetytwo percent of north dakota prisoners are employed or 
enrolled in some educational program eightyfive percent are in 
treatment programs for alcohol or drug the root of most of the 
crimes powers said weve made treatment the central focus of 
our facility 
the north dakota prison houses minimum and maximumsecurity 
inmates property offenders probably are the biggest majority 
and then sex offenders and then those who have committed crimes 
against people he said we seem to be seeing more sex 
offenders that seems to be more of a trend over the last five 
years 
we get them from all over the country some just passing 
through some boarding for the federal prison system 
the visiting room resembles a school cafeteria with rules 
posted at the front and no glass windows to separate inmates from 
visitors escape attempts are rare and one attempt that was made 
recently ended when the inmate gave up a handmade gun peacefully 
after a talk with the chief security officer

now isnt the time less than 2 months after 
taxpayers bailed out the savings and loan industry to consider 
easing capital standards for commercial banks the general 
accounting office says 
in the aftermath of the thrift disaster neither the public 
nor the banks should be given a signal by the regulators that lower 
capital levels are acceptable said harry s havens assistant 
comptroller general 
testifying wednesday before the senate banking committee havens 
inserted the gao congress auditing and investigative agency into 
a contentious dispute between bank regulators over the governments 
key financial standard ensuring the safety of the nations 13000 
commercial banks 
comptroller of the currency robert l clarke a treasury 
department official who regulates nationally chartered banks is 
proposing a new capital standard that the federal deposit insurance 
corp which insures deposits at both state and national banks 
says is too low 
capital representing the investment of bank stockholders 
serves as a cushion absorbing losses before federal deposit 
insurance kicks in financial institutions with low capital levels 
are more inclined to make risky investments because their owners 
have less to lose the crisis in the sampl industry was blamed in 
part on regulatory moves in the early 1980s to relax capital rules 
both the fdic and clarkes office have agreed to a riskadjusted 
standard starting in 1991 which would apply a more lenient test to 
banks holding safer investments such as home mortgages and 
government securities however they disagree over a backup 
standard known as a leverage ratio 
clarke is proposing but has not yet implemented a 3 percent 
leverage ratio fdic chairman l william seidman is pushing for 
more than that preferably 6 percent 
he maintains that clarkes proposal would permit nearly 10000 
banks to reduce their capital by a total of 8 billion clarke 
however said seidmans proposal would negate the beneficial 
effects of riskadjustments 
now is not the time to be reducing capital standards the 
banking business is an increasingly volatile one seidman said 
noting bank problems in real estate lending and in loans to third 
world countries 
havens of the gao agreed saying adequate capitalization is 
the first line of defense of any financial institution any 
proposal that could yield a reduction in that capitalization should 
be viewed with great caution 
the disagreement among regulators raises the prospect that more 
lenient standards will apply to the 4250 national banks regulated 
by clarke than to the 7650 state banks for which seidman writes 
the capital rules 
manuel h johnson vice chairman of the federal reserve board 
which sets the capital standards for about 1100 state banks that 
are members of its system said the fed has not yet taken a formal 
position on the issue but believes the regulations should be 
uniform for all banks 
if were not able to agree i think congress will have to get 
in and decide it for us seidman said 
donald w riegle jr dmich chairman of the senate banking 
committee declined to reveal a position saying he expected the 
regulators would be able to reach a consensus

the chairman of the house banking committee 
has urged federal officials to use caution in permitting foreign 
takeovers of banks 
rep henry gonzalez dtexas said wednesday that foreign 
interests control an estimated 21 percent of the us banking 
market financial experts say japanese and other foreign banks are 
poised to purchase additional us banks 
before this happens before it is too late i would ask the 
federal reserve to be cautious in permitting such takeovers 
before we fully understand how our economy is affected by increased 
foreign ownsership of us banks and financial services firms 
the banking chairman said 
gonzalez statement was prepared for a hearing by his 
subcommittee on domestic monetary policy alan greenspan chairman 
of the feds board of governors was the chief witnesss for the 
hearing called to discuss the feds traditional independence 
gonzalez said he was concerned the fed has not been as sensitive 
as some foreign competitors in enforcing the requirement that 
foreign banks have the same opportunities as us banks with some 
special regulations and requirements for the foreign banks 
it is important that we have a better understanding of how 
foreign banks affect the profitability of domestic banks as well as 
how such presence affects the availability of credit to domestic 
corporations and individuals he said 
in recent years cashrich japanese banks have made significant 
inroads in the us market by adding and expanding their own branch 
offices here or buying into established financial units from 
banking to securities operations in the largest such transaction 
yet japans daiichi kangyo bank the worlds biggest bank 
agreed last month to acquire a 60 percent interest in cit group 
the financial services unit of manufacturers hanover corp for 
about 14 billion 
other recent major transactions have included the 750 million 
acquisition of union bank by california first bank last year and 
daiwa bank ltds agreement to acquire the us commercial banking 
operations of britains lloyds bank plc for about 200 million 
japaneseowned banks now reportedly account for nearly 20 
percent of the banking business in california while eight of the 
10 largest foreign bank branches in new york are part of japanese 
banks 
japanese institutions make about 5 percent of all us loans and 
hold about 9 percent of us banking assets according to industry 
estimates and the figures are expected to grow in the next 18 
months as japanese banks try to remain competitive with each other

broadcast and cable industry executives appear 
close to ending their bitter fight over who gets the best channel 
positions on viewers televisions 
the executives indicated at a senate hearing that they intended 
to stop their feud over what channels broadcast stations should get 
on cable tv systems and give the federal communications commission 
a chance to adopt procedures to arbitrate such disputes 
such a ceasefire which was proposed wednesday by sen daniel 
inouye dhawaii at a hearing of the senate commerce 
communications subcommittee inouye chairs would clear the way for 
a broadcastcable agreement on new rules to determine which 
stations cable systems must carry 
the fcc had established must carry rules in 1965 that had 
required cable systems to carry all or most local broadcast 
signals and mostly on their fccdesignated channels but a court 
struck down the rules in 1985 on constitutional freespeech 
grounds 
broadcasters have claimed that without the rules cable systems 
have been dropping local stations or changing the channel positions 
assigned by the fcc 
inouyes subcommittee has been working with the tv industry to 
write new rules that will pass court scrutiny but the 
channelpositioning controversy has held up agreement 
james mooney president of the national cable television 
association told inouye on wednesday he was amenable to inouyes 
plan national association of broadcasters president edward o 
fritts said he would be glad to present the proposal to his board 
of directors as did preston padden president of the association 
of independent television stations 
inouye said he believed mustcarry legislation could be passed 
before the end of this year perhaps by attaching it to pending 
legislation that would reimpose commercial advertising limits on 
childrens television shows 
broadcasters claim they are disadvantaged when a cable system 
bumps them from their overtheair channel positions often the 
broadcasters get pushed to higher numbers on the tv dial which 
broadcasters call cable siberia and away from the mostwatched 
213 channel positions some cableconnected tvs dont receive 
channels higher than 13 
the fccs mustcarry rules required cable systems to carry all 
or most of the local broadcast signals in their service area and 
vhf stations 213 on channel 
after the 1985 ruling the fcc adopted new mustcarry rules 
without any onchannel requirement but the court struck those down 
in 1987 finding that the fcc had not justified the requirements

a us proposal to reform world agricultural trade 
by phasing out farm supports export subsidies and import tariffs 
received a mixed reaction from negotiators at the 97nation general 
agreement on tariffs and trade 
a trade source said wednesday the european community and japan 
criticized the proposal as being too drastic while countries such 
as canada and australia which do not subsidize agriculture welcomed 
the document 
third world nations relying on imports of farm produce voiced 
concern that the plan might increase the price of these imports he 
added 
deputy us trade representative julius katz described the 
proposal as realistic and said it was essential to extend 
gatts freetrade principles to agriculture 
the plan unveiled in washington on tuesday calls for the 
abolition of export subsidies within five years and the phasing out 
of national farm support measures that distort trade within 10 
years 
it also says import barriers such as quotas should be converted 
into tariffs and these should gradually be reduced over a 10year 
period 
the us proposal to reform world farm trade is the most 
comprehensive to be put on the table so far in the gattsponsored 
uruguay round of trade negotiations which close at the end of 1990 
however ec negotiator rolf moehler told the meeting in geneva 
that the proposal risked stopping the clock on agricultural 
negotiations the trade source said 
moehler said the ec was in favor of gradual but not overnight 
reform 
officials in brussels said the proposal would destroy the ecs 
agricultural policy and said it did not form an adequate basis 
for negotiation 
they accused the united states of disregarding an april 
agreement that called for progressive and substantial reductions in 
farm supports but not for total elimination 
more than half the ecs annual budget is spent on supporting 
farmers through the common agricultural policy 
the united states has said that the cost of farm programs to the 
industrial countries alone amounts to 165 billion a year 130 
billion of which is borne by consumers and taxpayers 
the fouryear uruguay round is also trying to agree on new trade 
rules on areas such as textiles tropical products copyright and 
other intellectual property rights and services like tourism and 
transportation

federal regulators have approved plans by the 
new york stock exchange and chicago board options exchange to begin 
trading a financial instrument known as a stock basket 
the securities and exchange commission voted unanimously 40 
wednesday to approve trading in those two products as well as 
allowing the chicagobased midwest stock exchange to establish an 
afterhours computerized trading session for transactions in 
portfolios of securities 
the new york product to be known as the exchange stock 
portfolio will allow large institutional investors but not 
individuals to trade in baskets 5 million blocks of about 
126000 shares apiece of stocks reflecting the standard amp poors 
500 stock index 
the chicago product also limited to institutional investors 
will permit trading in 16 million baskets based on the sampp 100 
index and 173 million baskets based on the sampp 500 stock price 
index 
both products were recommended in the wake of the october 1987 
stock market crash as a means of reducing volatility in the markets 
without cutting efficiency 
the chicago and new york stock baskets are different from two 
hybrid financial instruments developed earlier this year by the 
philadelphia stock exchange and the american stock exchange also 
known as stock baskets 
those baskets represented the sampp index itself rather than 
the actual stocks that make up the index 
for that reason a federal appeals court in chicago has ruled 
the products are more like futures than securities and must be 
regulated by the commodity futures trading commission 
the court ordered the philadelphia and american exchanges which 
received permission to trade their products from the sec to cease 
trading until they receive approval from the cftc 
on monday the court turned down an appeal of its ruling 
in the third item approved at the secs first open meeting since 
richard c breeden took over as chairman two weeks ago the midwest 
stock exchange will be able to start a secondary trading session 
from 430 pm to 6 pm est for the execution of stock portfolio 
trades using a new automated portfolio trading system 
there is still one vacancy on the fivemember sec breeden was 
the numerical replacement for commissioner charles cox no one has 
been nominated by president bush to fill the numerical vacancy left 
by formr chairman david ruder

the failed pilotmanagement bid for ual corp may 
aggravate relations between the company and its unions but a 
machinist union official says his organization might be willing to 
participate in a deal to help protect the parent of united airlines 
from an unwanted takeover 
machinist leaders celebrated the end of the bid and union 
flight attendants who have been seeking a new contract for about 
two years were left disgruntled after the ual board announced 
monday it would remain independent while directors examine 
alternatives to the scrapped 675 billion offer 
however despite the machinists opposition to the buyout john 
f peterpaul a vice president of the union told the new york 
times he would meet today with other machinist officials and 
advisers to discuss ways of making ual less vulnerable to a 
takeover 
this company will continue to be in jeopardy and we want to 
see what we can do to help he said 
the times also quoted a source as saying several japanese banks 
had contacted the union to see whether it might support an 
alternative buyout proposal 
the main union involved in the failed buyout bid the air line 
pilots association planned to meet today in new york with 
representatives of the flight attendants union to try to revive 
the failed plan union sources told the chicago tribune 
ual management however will not be represented at the new york 
meeting the tribune reported 
management is free to participate in a buyout bid but as a 
practical matter they cant lead the charge the newspaper 
quoted an unidentified union source as saying 
management worked with the pilots during the effort to take over 
the nations secondlargest airline but it was unclear how the 
relationship would weather the collapse of the deal earlier this 
month analysts said wednesday 
youve had crummy labor relations all along it certainly 
wasnt made better by this deal said edward starkman an airline 
analyst with painewebber inc in new york 
its going to have mr wolf walking a fine line starkman 
said of stephen wolf uals chairman and the leader of the buyout 
offer 
the contract with the machinists union uniteds largest 
organized labor group representing more than 24000 employees is 
open to negotiations beginning in november 
machinist spokesman jim conley said the union wants to proceed 
with normal talks and does not expect increased difficulty 
because of its view of the failed deal 
the union will pursue wage and benefit increases and may also 
seek to strengthen job protection language that currently allows 
the machinists to extend their contract provisions for three years 
in the event of a buyout conley said in a telephone interview from 
memphis tenn 
the flight attendants while negotiating to join the buyout 
plan had also balked at some concessions outlined in the proposal 
now they want an immediate resumption of the federal mediation 
that was suspended in august due to the buyout speculation 
resuming the talks could lead to a walkout if the negotiations are 
as unsuccessful as they have been for the past two years said pat 
friend spokeswoman for the association of flight attendants in 
chicago 
for their part in the buyout effort the pilots agreed among 
other things to accept a 7year contract with a nostrike pledge 
and to grant about 250 million in annual concessions 
that contract is no longer valid some goodfaith concessions 
such as flying four additional hours a month without pay have been 
in effect for about a month but some pilots are calling for those 
concessions to be rescinded 
calls to ual and the pilots union for comment were not returned 
the air line pilots association said it will continue to pursue 
an employee ownership plan for ual but some analysts predicted it 
would be some time before a new offer was presented by the union or 
anyone else 
one thing this boards clearly demonstrated is theyre not 
quickly moved into action to do anything on their own said 
robert decker an airline analyst with duff amp phelps in chicago 
theyll follow that approach until someone emerges and forces 
them to take action

the rjr nabisco inc buyout a year ago propelled 
the conglomerates highgrade bonds to the junkbond basement 
prompting lawsuits and a reassessment of the risk of owning 
corporate debt 
but ironically junk bonds sold a few months later by rjr 
nabiscos new owners to finance the recordbreaking takeover are 
considered quality junk issues in todays troubled highyield 
debt market 
that 4 billion junk bond issue the largestever corporate 
bond offering was a hit investors snapped up the securities when 
they were sold in may 
analysts say the inherent value of rjr nabisco brands such as 
oreo cookies ritz crackers and winston cigarettes gave investors 
confidence in the ability of the company to make money and sell 
assets to reduce debt and repay the bonds 
but rjr nabiscos earlier experience with bondholders wasnt as 
pleasant 
shortly after announcing the 2453 billion leveraged buyout by 
kohlberg kravis roberts amp co last october the market price of 
existing rjr nabisco bonds plunged on news of the huge amount of 
new debt the company would assume in the transaction at the same 
time bondrating agencies dropped their credit rating of rjr 
nabisco bonds to the lowgrade junkbond category 
several major bondholders including metropolitan life insurance 
co sued the company contending they were treated as secondclass 
investors to rjrs shareholders who reaped a bonanza when they 
sold their shares 
met life contends in its lawsuit which is pending that rjr 
nabisco recklessly quadrupled debt through the buyout rjr nabisco 
also faces a classaction lawsuit from bondholders and a similar 
suit from the insurance unit of itt corp 
met life said news of the buyout slashed more than 1 billion in 
market value from rjr nabiscos bonds the insurance company said 
its own portfolio of about 340 million in rjr nabisco bonds lost 
40 million in value 
a tenet of corporate finance is that bondholders enjoy 
precedence over shareholders argues met life president john j 
creedon 
this basic concept of corporate priorities was turned upside 
down by the rjr nabisco leveraged buyout substantially all the 
companys net worth was paid out to its shareholders and the 
bondholders received nothing creedon said in a speech earlier 
this year the payment to shareholders was funded by enormous 
levels of new debt 
concern over plunging bond prices resulting from the rjr nabisco 
deal and other takeovers at the time brought new awareness of 
event risk or corporate restructurings that deteriorate the 
value of a companys securities 
no longer could it be presumed that highgrade corporate bonds 
were a relatively safe investment many institutional investors 
such as insurance companies and pension funds said at the time 
they were steering clear of all corporate bonds 
since the rjr nabisco buyout one of the major creditrating 
agencies standard amp poors corp has started ranking corporate 
bonds by the degree of protection they provide against eventrisk 
price drops 
the buyout made it more important to consider event risk as 
one buys investmentgrade securities said james c goss a 
highyield analyst for the chicago investment firm duff amp phelps 
inc 
added sampp analyst bill wetreich what it brought home was that 
size is not a protection against event risk prior to rjr there was 
a sense that the size of certain deals would preclude them from 
being done 
while holders of existing rjr nabisco bonds werent pleased by 
the buyout the new junk bonds have done well in the market while 
other lborelated junk issues have plunged 
thats due to several factors including the sheer size of the 
rjr nabisco bond issue which gives it builtin liquidity the 
companys predictable cash flow its strong nofrills consumer 
products which should fare well in a recession and its ability to 
sell divisions for a good price analysts say

tokyu department store is negotiating to buy new 
yorks famed bloomingdales department store chain news reports 
said today 
the tokyobased chain will likely buy bloomingdales for 13 
billion from its current owner campeau corp a canadian real 
estate company the economic newspaper nihon keizai shimbun 
reported 
tokyu officials were not available for comment today due to a 
company holiday 
campeau spokeswoman carol sanger today declined to comment on 
the japanese news reports she said campeau has received 
expressions of interest in buying bloomingdales but she would 
not say whether any formal bids had been made 
an investment group formed and headed by tokyu which ranked 
seventh in earnings last year among japanese department stores and 
other investors will invest approximately 400 million in the 
buyout and the remaining 900 million will be covered by loans 
from financial institutions the newspaper said 
kyodo news service reported that campeau which bought 
bloomingdales in the spring of 1988 later announced its intention 
to sell the upscale department store chain due to its difficulties 
in obtaining capital 
but the real estate company had not yet reached agreement with 
tokyu on many details of the purchase including price and the 
manner in which the buyout would be completed 
owned by campeau which is reportedly in financial trouble 
bloomingdales presents a negative image to some banks and 
investors said the nihon keizai shimbun report 
bloomingdales a popular american department store chain has 
17 stores mainly on the east coast of the united states including 
new york and washington kyodo reported bloomingdales has annual 
sales of about 12 billion 
however kyodo quoted department store sources as saying the 
deal was seen as involving risks for tokyu and said they 
questioned bloomingdales past performance and profitability it 
did not elaborate

regulators who recommended in 1987 that the 
government seize lincoln savings and loan association told congress 
today they were astonished their superiors allowed it to continue 
to pile up millions of dollars in losses 
mike patriarca principal supervisory agent in the san francisco 
branch of the office of thrift supervision and william black 
district counsel in san francisco told the house banking committee 
they saw no reason why top thrift regulator m danny wall rejected 
their 1987 recommendation 
the committee conducted the second of four scheduled hearings 
into the failure of lincoln based in irvine calif which is 
expected to cost taxpayers 2 billion making it the nations 
costliest thrift collapse 
patriarca and black said they tried to have lincoln closed to 
stop its losses but were thwarted by the vigorous lobbying of its 
owner phoenix millionaire charles h keating jr 
the government did not take over lincoln until this april 
allowing the institution to pile up millions in additional losses 
the panel is focusing on a decision by wall director of the 
thrift office to take patriarca and black off the case and 
transfer it to washingtonbased examiners who subsequently 
recommended against a government takeover 
i was astonished that the washington regulators would 
recommend against a receivership frankly i still find that 
astonishing patriarca said 
clearly we were shot in the back by the washington 
regulators when we battled to protect the taxpayers from lincoln 
savings black said 
rep henry b gonzalez dtexas chairman of the banking panel 
said of wall the chief federal regulator in washington dc 
willingly cut the legs out from under his regulatory troops in 
the middle of the battle 
patriarca told the committee keating wielded influence in all 
three branches of government 
when it came to influence the keating crowd really outshone 
the texas crowd he said in a reference to notorious sampl fraud 
cases in that state 
black said a 1985 letter from federal reserve board chairman 
alan greenspan then a private economist saying lincoln was a 
strong institution was particularly influential with members of 
congress 
gonzalez earlier had accused wall of trying to influence todays 
testimony by summoning patriarca and black to a meeting with a 
thrift agency attorney in washington on oct 10 
however karl hoyle a spokesman for wall said the oct 10 
meeting was voluntary and was called to minimize misconceptions 
rather than to influence the two 
nobodys telling them what to say theyll be under oath 
hoyle said the object was to give the committee the full story 
in another development a source in the office of thrift 
supervision who spoke on condition of anonymity said justice 
department investigators questioned thrift office officials about 
allegations that keating padded top employees salaries with the 
understanding they would contribute to political campaigns 
the los angeles daily news reported over the weekend that the 
thrift office and the federal deposit insurance corp referred the 
matter to the fbi for a criminal investigation after they found 
evidence that political contributions from lincoln were laundered 
through employee salaries 
spokesmen for the thrift office and the fdic would not say 
whether regulators made the referral an fbi spokesman said it is 
against the agencys policy to reveal the existence of an 
investigation 
a lawyer representing keating had no immediate comment 
last week at the first of four planned hearings on lincoln 
fdic chairman l william seidman told the house banking panel that 
his agency had begun an investigation of the political 
contributions 
the lobby group common cause has asked the senate ethics 
committee to examine keatings contributions to five senators who 
in april 1987 met with sampl regulators on keatings behalf 
the five are sens alan cranston dcalif dennis deconcini 
dariz john mccain rariz john glenn dohio and donald w 
riegle jr dmich riegle and deconcini later returned the 
contributions

nv philips the dutch consumer electronics 
giant said thursday its profit rose 41 percent in the third 
quarter in spite of a slump in income from operations 
in a separate announcement philips said it intends to make a 
worldwide public stock offering of about 20 percent of the shares 
in polygram the recording company that owns the classical music 
label deutsche grammophon and represents pop performers such as bon 
jovi def leppard dire straits and the robert cray band 
philips said thirdquarter operating income fell 16 percent 
because of a sharp drop in the price of its chips and computers 
but that falloff was compensated for by lower interest payments and 
lower exchangerate losses on loans 
philips consumer electronics and music businesses as well as 
domestic appliances and personalcare products all grew healthily 
the company said 
philips profit rose to 227 million guilders or 109 million at 
current exchange rates from 161 million guilders a year earlier 
revenue was flat at 136 billion guilders or 65 billion 
because the major domestic appliances business was no longer 
included in consolidated results that business was put in a joint 
venture last year with whirlpool corp excluding that change 
revenue rose 7 percent 
for the januaryseptember period net income rose 37 percent to 
685 million guilders or 329 million from 499 million guilders a 
year earlier revenue rose to 398 billion guilders or 191 
billion from 39 billion guilders a year earlier 
for the polygram stock offering philips said it intends to file 
a preliminary prospectus in the next few weeks with authorities in 
the united states and the netherlands philips owns 100 percent of 
polygram having recently reacquired a 10 percent stake held by an 
instutional investor philips declined thursday to name the

reported a thirdquarter profit of 346 million after losing money 
a year earlier due to the cost of discontinuing some operations 
avon earned 46 cents a share in the three months ended sept 30 
compared to a loss of 4059 million or 778 a share in the 
third 1988 quarter when the company took a 425 million aftertax 
charge for discontinued operations 
worldwide sales grew 8 percent in the third quarter to 7851 
million from 7256 million a year earlier 
james e preston avons chairman and chief executive officer 
attributed the companys earnings growth to aggressive expense 
reduction programs 
the new yorkbased direct sales company implemented new cost 
controls and speeded up the sales of certain holdings earlier this 
year when it was facing unwanted takeover interest 
looked at geographically avon said its thirdquarter direct 
sales slipped a little in the united states falling 2 percent 
while international sales grew 14 percent strong sales in latin 
america are compensating for a belowplan performance in the united

for several decades the national association of 
investors corp has preached a conservative investment philosophy 
through its member clubs and in manuals and a monthly magazine 
smart amateur investors it advised should be able on average 
to double their money in five or six years in sound common stocks 
and do so without taking unusual risks or relying on costly 
professional services 
stories are inspiring but money talks asked what new service 
the naic might offer members it responded a common stock mutual 
fund and so the naic growth fund has been formed it will put the 
philosophers on record 
closed end meaning individual holdings will be traded like a 
stock rather than redeemed through the company shares will sell 
for 10 each minimum of 100 through the allied group po box 
10499 des moines iowa 50306 
it isnt the first time an advisory service was talked into 
direct action because in some ways stocks are an ego game you can 
star you can be a hero you can show up the other fools you can 
be called a guru a genius 
in the not distant past for instance a popular economic 
adviser thought a fund would be nice to publicize his services he 
formed one he soon found however that an adviser can reverse his 
position with a telephone call but that it isnt so in the stock 
market he pulled out a loser 
given time the new naic fund isnt likely to be a loser so long 
as it sticks to its philosophy one thats been demonstrated again 
and again but not always listened to in a market geared to 
frenzied sometimes mindless trading 
thomas ohara and kenneth janke the fund managers believe in 
patience at any one time they might not look good they say but 
over time they think theyll be able to outperform the market with 
a low level of risk 
their criteria 
choose from companies whose salesearnings have doubled every 
five years especially in the latest five whose earnings on 
invested capital are about the best in the industry and whose 
pershare prices are low by most standards 
that too is the philosophy of the the associations 6900 
investment clubs and its 132000 members and of course it is 
part of the philsophy of jankes and oharas own club the 
50yearold mutual investment club of detroit 
in those 50 years investments of the detroit club have doubled 
on average in less than six years based on compound annual growth 
of 125 percent that ohara says is 25 percent better than the 
standard amp poors 500stock index 
it was the detroit club that supplied much of the founding 
energy for the naic back in the 1940s since then the naic has 
published a magazine better investing in which it recommends 
a monthly stock for study 
going back over the records it finds that these 12 stocks a 
year have on average performed about the same that is close to 
doubling every five years the returns were poor in several years 
many of them in a row but in good years they made up for the 
losses they even tripled values in one year 
not bad for nonprofessionals further evidence that people 
willing to work at the job can do well in a marketplace dominated 
by professional traders 
although the new fund will have a professional adviser 
segerelbekorg inc birmingham mich it wont deprive itself of 
amateur opinion at least two are on the board and both ohara 
and janke tend to identify as amateurs although ohara once was a 
governor of the new york stock exchange 
then there are volunteers ohara who is naic chairman janke 
is president relates how youre not likely to sit anywhere next 
to an naic member who wont nudge you and tell you the story of a 
good prospect 
no he said they dont tell you about it because they want 
others to invest and push up the price that would be nice of 
course but its pride says ohara 
these people are intelligent creative and wise he says and 
they are proud of their discoveries like any hobbyist with a 
consuming interest they like to share its their bond with other 
members

nigel lawson resigned today as chancellor of the 
exchequer because of disagreements with an economic adviser to 
prime minister margaret thatcher the treasury said 
the resignation of britains top economic official was effective 
immediately 
lawson told mrs thatcher in a letter released by the treasury 
that he could not serve as her treasury secretary as long as she 
continued to take advice from sir alan walters her personal 
economic adviser 
lawson wrote i have therefore regretfully concluded that it 
is in the best interests of the government for me to resign my 
office without further ado 
lawson said he would continue to support the government as a 
member of parliament 
mrs thatcher quickly named foreign secretary john major as his 
replacement major is a former senior treasury official 
there have been persistent press reports that lawson suspected 
mrs thatcher was ignoring his advice and relying on walters 
instead 
the resignation was seen as a severe blow to her cabinet at a 
time of high inflation and interest rates and declining ratings in 
the opinion polls for her conservative party 
lawson and walters main difference was believed to have focused 
on britains attitude on the european monetary system 
lawson favored linking the pound to the exchange rate mechanism 
which limits swings in currencies but walters was openly against 
it 
lawson 57 became chancellor in 1983

the us economy grew at a moderate annual 
rate of 25 percent from july through september despite the poorest 
trade performance in six years and a 4 billion income loss from 
hurricane hugo the government reported today 
the commerce department said the increase in the gross national 
product the broadest measure of economic health matched a 25 
percent rise in the apriljune quarter thirdquarter growth was 
aided primarily by a boom in consumer spending that resulted from 
heavy car sales 
inflation showed a marked improvement in the third quarter with 
a price index tied to the gnp climbing at an annual rate of just 
29 percent down significantly from a 49 percent annual advance 
in the first half of the year 
michael darby commerce undersecretary for economic affairs 
said the moderate economic growth and lower inflation offer 
encouraging signs that the nations record peacetime expansion will 
extend into the next decade 
the lower inflation rate is creating appropriate conditions 
for stronger noninflationary growth as the decade of the 1990s 
unfolds darby said 
through the first nine months of 1989 the economy has grown at 
an annual rate of 29 percent exactly on target with the bush 
administrations forecast for the whole year 
but many analysts are predicting that growth will slump 
dramatically in the final three months of this year in the absence 
of the auto sales boom that spurred consumer spending from july 
through september 
many economists predict the country will flirt with a possible 
recession over the next 12 months because of expected weakness in 
such areas as trade and business investment 
signs of deterioration were evident in the third quarter as the 
us trade deficit as measured by the gnp surged by 229 
billion it was the worst trade figure since the second quarter of 
1983 
trade had been one of the economys brightest spots as a boom in 
export sales had spurred a rebound in us manufacturing however 
economists have warned for some time that hefty increases in the 
value of the dollar threatened to derail the trade improvement by 
making american goods more expensive on overseas markets 
in the third quarter imports shot up at an annual rate of 151 
percent while exports did not grow at all the poorest showing for 
exports since early 1986 
the economy was also held back in the third quarter by a 4 
billion loss in personal incomes attributed to the devastation from 
hurricane hugo which hit the southeast in september 
the estimate of income loss was attributed to uninsured losses 
and loss of rental income by property owners 
the stock market reacted negatively to the gnp report with the 
dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks dropping 3607 points by 
1 pm edt 
in another economic report today the labor department said 
privatesector labor contracts negotiated through collective 
bargaining from january through september provided average annual 
wage increases of 31 percent firstyear pay hikes in those pacts 
averaged 37 percent 
on capitol hill treasury secretary nicholas brady called on 
congress to make additional reforms in the way financial markets 
are regulated saying the securities and exchange commission should 
be empowered to halt trading in times of emergencies 
the secs chairman richard c breeden has said he does not 
want such authority 
in his first testimony to congress since the oct 13 market 
slide brady said the finaicial turmoil had not altered his belief 
in the souncness of the us economy but did point up the need for 
changes in market regulation 
some economists are predicting that growth in the economy during 
the final three months of the year could slip to an annual rate of 
15 percent or less 
while such an anemic pace increases the risk of a recession 
many analysts are counting on the federal reserve to ride to the 
rescue by lowering interest rates in order to spur activity in home 
building and other interestsensitive sectors of the economy 
at the same time many economists expect unemployment to rise 
during the next 12 months before growth rebounds by the end of 1990 
we are not going to have a recession but we will have a very 
significant slowdown in the economy said david wyss an 
economist with drimcgraw hill an economic consulting firm 
business capital spending another of the economys bright 
spots slowed in the third quarter rising at an annual rate of 53 
percent analysts are looking for further declines in this area as 
businesses hurt by falling profits cut back on investment plans 
housing construction which has been in a slump as a result of 
the federal reservess earlier credit squeeze to fight inflation 
fell at an annual rate of 48 percent in the third quarter the 
third consecutive quarterly decline 
consumer spending was essentially the only area of strength in 
the julyseptember period as purchases shot up by 58 percent the 
strongest rise since the first quarter of 1988 analysts attributed 
the gain to the surge in car sales which resulted from the wave of 
discounts offered by automakers to clear out an inventory of unsold 
models 
however economists say these discounts actually stole sales 
from the 1990 model year for that reason they believe consumer 
spending which accounts for twothirds of all economic activity 
will be exceptionally weak in the current octoberdecember period 
the various changes left the economy after adjusting for 
inflation growing at an annual rate of 4158 trillion in the 
third quarter up 256 billion from the secondquarter pace

treasury secretary nicholas brady today called 
on congress to make additional reforms in the way financial markets 
are regulated saying the securities and exchange commission should 
be empowered to halt trading in times of emergencies 
the secs chairman has said he does not want such authority 
in his first testimony to congress since the oct 13 market 
slide brady said the financial turmoil had not altered his belief 
in the soundness of the us economy but he said it did point up 
the need for further changes in market regulation 
the power to halt market trading now rests solely with the 
president bradys support for giving this authority to the sec is 
at odds with the recommendation from sec chairman richard c 
breeden who told congress on wednesday that his agency does not 
need or want the power to halt trading 
brady in a letter accompanying his testimony to the senate 
banking committee noted the secs reluctance to take on the 
emergency trading halt power but he said he believed the change 
was needed 
he said the initial governmental response to market emergencies 
should come from a regulator with expertise and proximity to the 
markets 
brady noted that legislation pending before both the house and 
the senate gives the president power to terminate sec emergency 
actions and would require presidential approval for any trading 
halt longer than 24 hours 
the stock market continued its gyrations today as the dow jones 
average of 30 indiustrial stocks dropped 3914 points by 130 pm 
edt in a negative reaction to a report that the gross national 
product rose at a moderate 25 percent annual pace in the third 
quarter 
brady a former wall street executive gave his general support 
to the package of changes but cautioned lawmakers against going too 
far in their efforts to eliminate market volatility 
we cannot and should not attempt to eliminate major market 
moves whether by legislation or regulation he said but we do 
need to ensure that our markets are configured in the best manner 
possible to withstand the increasing demands that are placed on 
them 
brady said he supported changes that would require large 
security transactions to be reported to regulators so that the sec 
and other agencies would have a better idea of who was buying and 
selling large blocks of stock during periods of sharp market swings 
other parts of the legislation that brady favored included rules 
that would allow regulators to assess the financial soundness of 
the parent holding companies of brokerage houses he also supported 
improved coordination in the clearing and settling of market 
transactions 
the tailspin of the equity and derivative markets on friday 
oct 13 raised fears of an eerie repeat of the friday before the 
monday collapse in october 1987 brady testified 
but he said that in many ways the governments response to the 
most recent turmoil showed that the reforms instituted since the 
1987 crash had worked well 
although investor concerns were understandable there was 
obviously a greater sense of confidence by all market 
participants brady said 
while disagreeing with brady on whether the sec should have the 
power to halt trading breeden told a house panel wednesday that he 
supported the other recommendations in the pending legislation 
the commission at this time does not have all the tools 
necessary for dealing with periods of market turbulence breeden 
told the telecommunications and finance subcommittee chaired by 
rep edward markey dmass 
another witness edward i obrien president of the securities 
industry association a trade group said he opposed the large 
trade and financial soundness changes saying they were too vague 
and needed more study 
obrien and george bissell chairman of the market reform task 
force of the investment company institute a mutual fund trade 
group supported rules that would give the sec power to halt 
trading for up to 24 hours during market emergencies 
but breeden said safety mechanisms called circuitbreakers 
temporary automatic trading halts in times of market volatility 
have eliminated much of the need for officials to stop trading 
markey suggested halting only program trading the 
computerdriven sale of vast blocks of stocks by large 
institutional investors which many cite as a contributing factor 
in the 1987 market crash 
breeden said he would consider working with the subcommittee if 
new methods were found to be needed but for now he thought 
nondiscretionary halts were less likely to cause uncertainty 
among traders 
it was the first public appearance by the new sec head since the 
oct 13 market slide 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials a key market indicator 
plunged 19058 points friday oct 13 then rebounded to close 
8812 points higher the next monday 
the markets rollercoaster gyrations prompted concern about 
another crash like the 508point drop in october 1987

dear margaret 
the successful conduct of economic policy is possible only if 
there is and is seen to be full agreement between the prime 
minister and the chancellor of the exchequer 
recent events have confirmed that this essential requirement 
cannot be satisfied so long as alan walters remains your personal 
economic adviser 
i have therefore regretfully concluded that it is in the best 
interests of the government for me to resign my office without 
further ado 
i am extremely grateful to you for the opportunity you have 
given me to serve in the government particularly over the past six 
and a half years as chancellor and i am proud of what we have 
achieved together 
i shall of course continue to support the government from the 
backbenches 
yours ever

president bush citing valid concerns over 
food safety regulation because of stories of pesticidetainted 
apples and other foods today proposed legislation allowing 
pesticides to be taken off the market more quickly 
the plan attacked in advance by environmentalists as a step 
backward in some areas would overhaul pesticide regulation laws 
enforced by the environmental protection agency and the food and 
drug administration 
the president said the plan which he called a major 
initiative on food safety was partly in response to publics 
concern over stories alleging the presence of dangerous levels of 
pesticides 
bush said we have the safest food supply in the world im 
absolutely convinced of that and were going to keep it that way 
and while claiming the nations food supply to be safe he said 
some of the publics perception is based on valid concerns about 
the governments slow and cumbersome process for removing 
pesticides from the market 
bush commented during in a picturetaking session with 
administration officials involved in developing the package a task 
he said took several months 
the president mentioned a high degree of awareness by americans 
of news stories earlier this year on the presence of the 
cancercausing chemical alar on some apples and more recently 
concern about the widespread use of the fungicide ebdc on fruits 
and vegetables 
these stories have fueled the public concern about cancer 
risks and more important for us have called into question the 
governments ability to insure a safe supply of food for our 
citizens bush said 
earlier white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the plan 
would streamline epas ability to remove potentially hazardous 
pesticides from the market and enhance the agencys enforcement 
program 
he also said it would tighten fda rules governing the allowable 
tolerances of pesticide residues in food 
overall the plan is a comprehensive program to enhance food 
safety for all americans fitzwater said 
environmentalists began attacking the plan as information began 
surfacing on wednesday 
from our side its worse than the current law said janet 
hathaway a lawyer for the natural resources defense council which 
has been a sharp critic of the governments control of pesticides 
on food products 
responding to the criticism fitzwater said environmentalists 
were being appropriately wary as they always are in these 
cases 
he conceded that one aspect of the plan would require states to 
obtain special waivers to enact tougher foodsafety standards 
than the federal government 
currently no such waivers are required 
still fitzwater said a major benefit of the plan would be in 
giving the government the ability to take suspect pesticides off 
the market swiftly 
currently a long process that sometimes takes months and 
years to do is required he said 
these changes are designed to speed that up make it easier to 
stop the production or the use of pesticides while government 
regulators are considering a total ban the spokesman said 
the pesticide issue gained widespread attention earlier this 
year during the public outcry over use of alar on apples the epa 
acknowledged that alar caused cancer but said it could not be taken 
off the market immediately the manufacturer later stopped selling 
the chemical voluntarily 
while epa administrator william k reilly declined to discuss 
details of the proposal pending the white house announcement he 
said it was responsive to a number of problems this agency has 
had in administering our pesticide law 
sources familiar with the administration plan said it calls for 
a shift in the way the epa determines whether a potentially 
dangerous chemical used on food may be taken off the market 
relying on less timeconsuming rulemaking procedures instead of 
lengthy judicial hearings 
it also gives the epa greater leeway to suspend use of a 
chemical without first having to show an imminent hazard to 
public health as is now required sources said in some cases the 
agency will not have to consider economic costs in suspending use 
of a chemical if the health risks are considered substantial 
environmentalists praised such changes but criticized other 
provisions expected to be in the presidents plan 
ms hathaway said environmentalists are expected to oppose a 
provision calling on congress to establish uniform pesticide 
standards nationwide because that she said would effectively 
preempt stronger state laws 
in addition the presidents plan was expected to call for 
relaxing the threshold at which a chemical will be considered to 
pose an unacceptable health risk the epa has been using a risk 
level of 1 in 1 million as the benchmark that triggers regulatory 
action under the presidents plan the threshold in some cases 
could be increased to 1 in 100000 
were talking about an erosion of the concept of negligible 
risk here said ms hathaway arguing that a risk level of 1 in 
100000 is not adequate to protect the public

the vatican was in the red by 57 million 
last year but reduced its deficit by nearly 9 million from the 
projected figure through austerity measures a financial statement 
said thursday 
a canadian cardinal also said the vatican after resisting for 
five years has agreed to open its books sending a copy of the 
holy sees financial statement to every diocese in the world 
the new statement made no mention of this years financial 
position but indicated that spending for computers and other 
modernizing investments was heavy while its daily newspaper and 
radio station were a drain on the treasury 
in march the vatican had forecast a record deficit of 78 
million for 1989 
the figures were released by the 12member council of cardinals 
for the study of the organization and economic problems of the holy 
see at the end of three days of meetings 
it said the regular 1988 deficit amounted to 435 million 
based on revenue of 744 million and expenses of 1179 million 
but it said extraordinary expenditures for its radio station and 
restoration of buildings increased the deficit to 572 million 
still this was below the 66 million forecast a year ago 
thanks to efforts at austerity by various offices of the holy see 
to reduce expenses to the minimum 
the 1987 deficit stood at 64 million 
the 1988 shortfall was nearly covered by peters pence the 
annual offering from catholics to the pope it said this amounted 
to 529 million 
the budget covers expenses for the curia or the churchs 
central administration vatican radio diplomatic missions and the 
vatican newspaper losservatore romano 
it does not include the vatican bank whose statements are still 
secret or the travels of pope john paul ii which the vatican says 
are paid for by local churches 
the only specific offices listed were the radio in the red by 
156 million and the newspaper with a 52 million deficit 
cardinal gerald carter of toronto a member of the economic 
commission told vatican radio the holy see still is facing a 
financial crunch 
now that we say we covered our deficit this year people are 
going to relax and say well thats fine the holy see is out of the 
hole but were not out of the hole were going to be in the exact 
same situation next year he said 
carter said outside accounts are examining the financial 
statement which will be distributed to dioceses he said the 
vatican had been reluctant to do this 
why what their reluctance was ive never been able to 
understand but it did take us five years every year we were 
pounding on the same thing and finally we got it done he said 
one bright spot is the vatican citystate the equivalent of 
local government which earns more than it spends by providing 
services such as electricity water and mail and running the 
vatican museum 
half of its 13 million surplus went to meet the holy see the 
statement said

seven huge profitable corporations were able 
legally to avoid paying federal income tax last year a decline 
from 50 because of the 1986 tax overhaul a private study concluded 
thursday 
citizens for tax justice a laborfinanced research 
organization said the average tax rate paid by the nations 250 
biggest moneymaking companies rose last year to 265 percent 
compared with 143 percent in 1981 through 1985 fortyfive 
corporations still paid less than 10 percent of their profits in 
income taxes fewer than half the number reported a year earlier 
the study found the new law is shifting a greater share of the 
tax burden to corporations as it was intended to do corporate 
taxes paid 12 percent of the nonsocial security federal budget 
last year up from 8 percent in the first half of the 1980s the 
report stated 
tax reform is working robert s mcintyre executive 
director of citizens for tax justice said in releasing the 
organizations fifth annual report on corporate taxes business 
investment has boomed since tax reform as money that used to go 
into wasteful tax shelters has returned to the productive economy 
mcintyres past reports which found that as many as 70 of the 
250 profitmaking giants paid no income tax in one or more years 
were credited with helping to goad congress into overhauling the 
tax law 
however because the studies are based on the organizations 
interpretation of corporate report they often are disputed by some 
of the companies cited 
for example the new report listed santa fe southern pacific as 
one of the seven profitable companies that paid no tax in 1988 the 
report said the company had profits of almost 180 million 
received a 21 million refund of past taxes paid and thus had a 
negative tax rate of 12 percent 
we had a net loss in 1988 of 465 million as a result of a 
charge of about 627 million relating to divestiture of southern 
pacific railroad which we were required to do by the interstate 
commerce commission said bob gehrt a santa fe vice president in 
chicago 
the new tax law enacted in 1986 repealed the investment tax 
credit sharply curtailed an accounting method that allowed large 
contractors to defer taxes until a project was completed 
eliminated the tax preference for capital gains and tightened the 
minimum tax a special levy aimed at profitmaking businesses 
that use large writeoffs to avoid all or most of their tax 
liability 
the report said that in addition to santa fe southern five 
large companies paid no tax in 1988 and actually received refunds 
of pastyear taxes resulting in negative tax rates 
they were kroger 29 million profit and a negative tax rate of 
283 percent pinnacle west 75 million profit minus 281 
percent csx 402 million profit minus 147 percent illinois 
power 227 million profit minus 113 percent and media general 
75 million profit minus 57 percent 
gulf states utilities was reported as having a profit of 164 
million and neither paying a 1988 tax nor receiving any refund 
the highest effective tax rate among the 250 companies was paid 
by rockwell international at 1925 percent the company a major 
defense contractor paid 137 billion tax last year on profits of 
714 million the study said the high rate reflected rockwells 
payment of more than 1 billion of tax that was deferred during 
19811987 
the 250 companies in 1988 paid 345 billion tax on 130 billion 
in profits an average effective rate of 265 percent

wheat futures prices dropped below 4 a bushel 
for the first time in nearly a month thursday on the chicago board 
of trade as traders weary of waiting for new export business took 
profits 
other grain and soybean futures were narrowly mixed in listless 
trading 
a lack of new us wheat sales to the soviet union was the 
biggest bearish factor in thursdays market said katharina zimmer 
a grain analyst with merrill lynch capital markets inc in new york 
they apparently have picked up canadian wheat and wheat from 
england and the market is just tired of waiting she said 
the agriculture department announced late wednesday it had given 
the soviets approval to buy an additional 4 million metric tons of 
grain in the fiscal year that began oct 1 raising the ceiling to 
16 million tons 
but traders said the announcement had been expected which 
limited its market impact and ms zimmer said recent purchases of 
feed grains have packed the soviet grain pipeline 
nobody expects the russians to be back tomorrow to buy more 
corn or wheat for that matter she said 
at the close wheat futures were 1 cents to 6 cents lower with 
the contract for delivery in december at 398 a bushel corn 
futures were cent to 1 cents higher with december at 244 a 
bushel oats were cent lower to cent higher with december at 
145 a bushel soybeans were 1 cents lower to cent higher with

cash registers fell quiet along the 
fishermans wharf waterfront following the earthquake and the 
multibilliondollar tourism industry still awaits the return of its 
sales 
the usually bustling tourist spots are not a pretty sight these 
days along the barren walkways from pier 39 to ghirardelli square 
tourists are few attractions are empty and tshirt vendors sit 
forlornly next to their stands 
its so deserted that street parking is easy an unheard of 
proposition in normal times 
the tourists who were here before the earthquake have left and 
havent come back says narcis carranza leaning next to his 
sweater stand by pier 41 i havent sold anything 
he says hes suffered a 90 percent drop in business since last 
weeks quake 
as for san francisco bay cruises even a sunny day with views 
all the way to angel island cant lure the few tourists remaining 
the blue amp gold fleets 400passenger sightseeing boats make 
only two daily trips compared to the usual nine these days 
because of sparse business says katie thorsen 
on a typical day she sells 400600 12 tickets she sold 56 
tickets wednesday and wasnt looking to fare any better thursday 
i think people are going to start coming back she says i 
think if you give them a couple of weeks 
hotel operators many of whom have seen their rooms emptied and 
reservations canceled hope thats correct 
business is down i think its all hotels in the city every 
business in the city says fil da cunha assistant general 
manager of the holiday inn at fishermans wharf 
most of the 580 rooms at the holiday inn were filled when the 
71 magnitude quake rumbled through northern california but the 
occupancy rate has dropped to about 25 percent now he said 
da cunha with bitterness in his voice partially blames the 
news media for what he calls an obsession with the damaged areas in 
san franciscos marina district the bay bridge and interstate 880 
they havent showed all the buildings standing up yet he 
says 
at the wharf inn business has dropped dramatically and 
occupancy stands at about 27 percent says suzanne reese general 
manager of the 51room hotel on mason street near the waterfront 
i think it will affect our business for quite a while weve 
had a lot of cancellations says reese 
though there was damage to some tourist areas and other parts of 
san francisco it wasnt devastating the city is not flattened 
something officials are trying to pass on to people planning a 
visit here 
phone calls to the san francisco convention and visitors bureau 
are met with a taped message that begins the city is returning 
to normal 
after the quake the bureaus eightperson sales staff jumped on 
the phones and called convention and meeting planners to assure 
them the city was intact and that we were open for business 
says sharon rooney public relations manager 
they also called travel publications to let them know that most 
businesses in san francisco were not damaged the bureau enlisted 
mayor art agnos to write a letter this week telling meeting 
planners the city was safe 
in san francisco where tourism is the no 1 industry worth 
34 billion only two major meetings were canceled says rooney 
nissan had been expected thursday while the league of california 
cities also canceled its oct 21 convention the city lost at least 
6000 delegates from the two cancellations 
in oakland the tourism industry was initially hurt after the 
quake but has bounced back almost to normal according to linda 
howell of the oakland convention and visitor bureau 
where hotel occupancy at one point fell to 25 percent in 
oakland the rate has increased to about 80 percent she said but 
as howell notes san francisco has about eight times more 
firstclass hotel rooms than oakland 
they have a larger stake there she says theyre going to 
be hurt more 
most tourists fled after the oct 17 quake but some stayed 
there are even a few who arrived after the temblor 
a lot of people have asked us how come you came youre so 
brave says audrey malling who along with her husband gerald 
arrived in san francisco two nights after the quake from 
greenville mich 
the elderly couple leaning against a pier with a clear 
breathtaking view of alacatraz say they really didnt think of 
changing their longstanding plans to visit their son paul 
its kind of nice for us cause we dont worry about getting 
into things quips gerald malling an attorney 
john marshall and his wife ilona of beden west germany 
arrived in san francisco on wednesday they were at disneyland when 
the quake hit 
the marshalls sitting in a courtyard in the hyde street pier 
across the street from the cannery shopping center say theyve 
been through earthquakes before 
so we are not afraid of the earthquake says john marshall 
everyone has to die and if you are in the wrong place you have 
the bad luck

its time to toss out the stationery and tear 
down the signs touting pittsburgh as americas most livable city 
the title was lost to seattle earlier this week and officials had 
to scurry to pull the slogan from promotional plugs 
after more than four years of top billing pittsburgh has 
slipped behind seattle and san francisco in prentice hall travel 
books 1989 edition of places rated almanac which arrived in 
bookstores this week 
im reading it everywhere i go were the no 1 city 
said pittsburgh mayor sophie masloff ive used it and its been 
in every speech ive made practically 
mrs masloff had to revise her speech at a groundbreaking 
ceremony thursday morning 
i said were now no 3 but we believe in our hearts were 
still no 1 
at the greater pittsburgh convention and visitors bureau 
officials were priding themselves on having had the words 
pittsburghs the one printed on the latest batch of lapel pins 
and convention badges 
the bureau had commissioned bumper stickers and pins proclaiming 
pittsburgh as americas most livable city soon after the title was 
bestowed in 1985 none fortunately remain 
we assumed that for a lot of reasons it wouldnt last 
forever said robert imperata the bureaus executive vice

is a more generic phrase 
the greater pittsburgh chamber of commerce also is 
congratulating itself on having waited before ordering new

standard oil of new jersey was one of 40 separate petroleum 
companies organized in 1882 under the standard oil trust formed by 
john d rockefeller 
the original standard oil co was formed by rockefeller in 1870 
and incorporated in ohio in 1911 the standard oil organization 
was dissolved under us antitrust laws and the various companies 
under the trust became independent 
standard oil of new jersey opened its first headquarters in 
lower manhattan across new york harbor from its main facilities 
that at that time included a paraffin plant a barrel factory and a 
refinery capable of processing 2000 barrels a day of crude oil 
shipped from oil fields in western pennsylvania 
in 1919 the company bought 50 percent interest in humble oil 
and refining which eventually became exxon usa based in houston 
in 1972 standard oil of new jersey changed its name to exxon 
corp before changing its name the company marketed gasoline and 
other products under a variety of trademarks including standard 
esso humble and carter many of its overseas affiliates still use 
the name esso 
since its founding exxon has expanded to 100 countries 
worldwide exploring producing refining and marketing oil its 
businesses also include coal hydrocarbon energy natural gas 
rubber minerals mining and nuclear energy and high technology 
exxon now owns or has interests in 25000 miles of underground 
pipelines enough to circle the earth at the equator and 
maintains one of the worlds biggest fleets of oiltransporting 
vessels 
it has refineries in 25 countries its five us refineries are 
capable of processing about 15 million barrels a day of crude oil 
into some 1000 products ranging from motor fuels to special 
lubricants for use in outer space 
exxons leadership history includes such corporate figures as 
rockefeller himself who served as chairman from 1899 to 1911 
the place of lawrence g rawl who has been chairman since 
january 1987 in company annals has been marked by one of the most 
tumultuous periods in exxons history 
a march 24 oil spill by an exxon tanker in alaskas prince 
william sound was the nations worst such disaster ever and has 
subjected the company to harsh criticism by politicians 
environmentalists and consumer groups 
exxons home base shared in the ignominy in may when people 
claiming to be alaskans protested the spill by dumping oil into the 
fountain outside the midtown manhattan skyscraper that houses the 
companys corporate headquarters 
the company offices are in a landmark 54story skyscraper known 
as the exxon building exxon and rockefeller group inc sold the 
building in 1986 to a large japanese insurance conglomerate mitsui 
amp co for 610 million at the time the largest single real estate 
transaction in manhattan history

the dollar gained against most major currencies 
in us trading thursday particularly the british pound which 
plunged after the countrys treasury chief announced his 
resignation 
gold prices rose on the commodity exchange in new york gold 
bullion for current delivery settled at 37250 a troy ounce up 
340 from wednesday the republic national bank of new york quoted 
an ounce of gold at 37110 as of 4 pm edt 260 higher than 
wednesdays late bid 
currency dealers unloaded sterling and bought dollars and west 
german marks following news of nigel lawsons decision to leave 
prime minister margaret thatchers cabinet 
lawson who had served as chancellor of the exchequer since 
1983 said he was resigning because of differences with the prime 
ministers economic adviser sir alan walters 
the pound which had been quoted at 16130 when most trading 
ended in london sank to 15995 on the few european markets still 
open after lawsons sudden announcement later in new york 
sterling fetched 15780 down sharply from 16143 on wednesday 
central banks including the federal reserve reportedly bought 
sterling to cushion its collapse dealers said 
even though the british government quickly appointed a 
replacement for lawson sterling was expected to remain under 
pressure with financial markets questioning the stability of 
britains economic policies 
lawson recently had been stressing the importance of a firm 
pound as part of the governments fight against inflation 
mrs thatcher announced that her foreign secretary john major 
would take over at the treasury 
john mccarthy chief dealer at the new york office of the 
amsterdam rotterdam bank said apart from the impact of the 
sterling selloff the dollar did not do much during most of the 
session 
we were having a rather quiet day until word came of 
lawsons resignation said mccarthy noting that a report on us 
economic growth elicited little response from traders 
the report that the economy grew at a 25 percent annual rate in 
the third quarter was consistent with market expectations the 
commerce departments reading on the gross national product the 
broadest gauge of economic health matched the secondquarter 
increase

the announcement monday that exxon corp is 
moving its headquarters to dallas raised anew the question of 
whether costly crowded new york can continue competing with the 
rest of the countrys offerings 
exxon was only the latest corporate giant to move elsewhere in 
search of cheaper space 
jc penney co inc moved its headquarters to the dallasft 
worth area in 1987 saving about 60 million a year in office and 
administration expenses mobil corp that same year announced plans 
to move its headquarters to virginia over three years 
merrill lynch amp co announced earlier this year that it was 
moving 2600 backoffice jobs to new jersey from manhattan in 1992 
bankers trust new york corp painewebber inc and donaldson lufkin 
amp jenrette inc have moved thousands of jobs from new york to new 
jersey in the last four years 
but city officials say the losses have been offset to an extent 
and the city economy remains vibrant 
rjr nabisco inc for example is moving its headquarters from 
atlanta to new york numerous other companies have been convinced 
by tax breaks and other incentives to stay put 
no matter how you stack it up were a net winner said 
stanley e grayson deputy mayor for finance and economic 
development who said the city had gained 4500 new companies in 
the past 10 years 
although exxon is certainly a major company in new york in 
the country and the world the practical matter is they employed 
300 people here he said 
if it was 30000 jobs it would be a lot more troubling 
said ray horton chairman of the citizens budget commission and a 
professor at the graduate school of business at columbia university 
new yorks economy boomed for most of the 1980s and although 
the 1987 stock market crash slowed the economy the city shows net 
job growth since then 
the trend is that far more stay than actually leave said 
claire tallarico spokeswoman for the office for economic 
development 
people stay because this is the worlds decision center it is 
the capital of commerce the capital of communications the capital 
of banking she said 
the announcements in 1987 that mobil oil and jc penney were 
moving their headquarters out of the city gave the impression that 
new york was losing its grip 
when the national broadcasting co threatened to move to new 
jersey the same year the city offered 100 million in tax breaks 
and other incentives that persuaded nbc to stay 
among the others that decided against moving jobs out of new 
york in the past two years are chase manhattan drexel burnham 
lambert american telephone amp telegraph shearson lehman hutton and 
citicorp 
i would say that certainly any city that loses a corporate 
headquarters ought to be worried about it particularly when 
theyre moving from highcost locations to lowcost locations 
said dennis j donovan head of the business relocation division of 
moran stahl amp boyer a consulting firm 
i would say its not a trend it was a trend in the late 60s 
early 70s because the cost differentials were so staggering 
again i dont see it as a stampede or trend but there are other 
corporations that will consider leaving and new york ought to do 
everything it can to hold on to them donovan said

mcdonalds corp announced thursday its 
restaurants in new england would join forces with a consortium of 
chemical companies to launch a major recycling effort for plastic 
food containers 
mcdonalds is undertaking the program with the national 
polystyrene recycling co a joint venture formed earlier this year 
by several leading producers of plastics including amoco chemical 
co dow chemical co and arco chemical co 
polystyrene products which are not biodegradable have received 
criticism around the country as more than a dozen cities have 
enacted bans on the plastic products 
but officials who spoke at a news conference at a downtown 
mcdonalds said garbage problems cannot be solved simply by 
switching to more biodegradable materials 
where we have a shortage of space in landfills the solution 
lies in putting in less said shelby yastrow mcdonalds senior 
vice president 
ken harman acting chairman of the nprc and director of styrene 
products for dow said landfills inhibit all products from 
biodegrading so to put paper in instead of plastic you dont 
really accomplish anything 
the recycling company has set a goal to recycle 250 million 
pounds of polystyrene per year by 1995 an amount equal to 25 
percent of the polystyrene produced in the united states for food 
service and packaging each year 
harman said new england is serving as the launch site for the 
program because the company has acquired plastics again a 
recycling plant in leominster 
here were ready he said we have a plant we have a 
capability 
the company said it plans to establish four other regional 
recycling centers by the end of 1990 these centers are planned for 
chicago philadelphia southern california and the san francisco 
area 
under the program with mcdonalds restaurant customers will be 
asked to place their polystyrene foam containers utensils salad 
containers hot drink and sundae cups in special trash bins marked 
for recyclable plastic only 
after the recyclable material is taken to the leominster plant 
it will be turned into plastic resins which then will be sold to 
companies that manufacture plastic products 
customers are already being asked to separate their plastic 
waste at 100 mcdonalds restaurants in new england yastrow said 
and about 450 restaurants are expected to be participating by early 
next year 
based on initial tests mcdonalds expects 70 percent of its 
polystyrene waste products will be turned in for recycling yastrow 
said 
richard denison a senior scientist with the environmental 
defense fund said he was encouraged by mcdonalds efforts 
providing customers with an ability to recycle in their stores 
is an important first step denison said in an interview from 
washington dc 
but denison said the program also could have limitations 
it only affects customers who eat in he said people who 
take materials out of the store would have to be awfully ambitious 
to participate in this 
mcdonalds officials estimate that at restaurants equipped with 
drivein windows 40 percent to 50 percent of its customers use 
that service 
but yastrow expressed hope that people who take their food away 
from the restaurants will separate their plastic items once they 
learn about the effort 
in fact officials said educating customers about recycling was 
a key part of the program 
we need to have more initiatives like the one were seeing 
today said paul keough acting regional administrator for the 
us environmental protection agency i hope that its wildly 
successful and will be copied around the country 
tom tomaszek general manager of plastics again in leominster 
noted that next month sturbridge is scheduled to start what is 
believed to be the first community program for separating 
polystyrene products

summertime sales incentives eroded the big three 
automakers thirdquarter profits which skidded a combined 273 
percent from record levels a year ago the companies reported 
thursday 
general motors corp ford motor co and chrysler corp each 
said rebates and other inducements to lure buyers during the 
julyseptember period were much costlier this year and were largely 
responsible for the weakness 
the combined earnings for the big three during the threemonth 
period was 133 billion on revenues of 5692 billion that 
compared with an industry thirdquarter record profit last year of 
183 billion on revenues of 5648 billion 
i dont think it was a real big surprise said analyst paul 
kleinaitis of duff amp phelps a chicago investment research concern 
boosting the big threes total profit figure was a onetime 
309 million increase in chryslers profits stemming from the sale 
of some of its stock in mitsubishi motors corp in japan during the 
quarter 
if that stock sale were removed big three quarterly profits 
would be 102 billion 442 percent below last years level 
gms earnings fell 40 percent and fords income dropped 443 
percent during the period chryslers profits nearly tripled on the 
strength of the mitsubishi stock sale but without that boost the 
companys earnings plummeted 804 percent 
once again ford and gm profits benefited from overseas 
operations chrysler has few overseas operations ford vice 
president and treasurer david mccammon said his company lost 37 
million during the quarter domestically mostly because of 
incentives that averaged 800 a vehicle 
gm spokesman terry sullivan and chrysler spokesman tom houston 
declined to say how much their companies spent on incentives 
sullivan also declined to give north american profit figures for 
the third quarter but said that so far this year all major 
segments of gm business are profitable 
the size of the drop at ford caused some anxiety among industry 
analysts largely because the automaker has been so successful in 
making itself one of the most profitable companies in the world in 
recent years 
that is a little worse than i expected kleinaitis said of 
the ford decline if ford lost money you can imagine that gm was 
cleaned out 
profitsharing amounts for auto workers are based on a formula 
rooted in north american earnings earlier this year ford workers 
got about 2800 each chrysler workers got checks for about 720 
apiece and gm employees got about 265 each in profitsharing based 
on 1988 north american earnings 
thats likely to change next spring when profitsharing checks 
for 1989 business are calculated 
profit sharing will be down for the us workers and will be 
down substantially mccammon said however he said the checks 
still would be meaningful and more than those for gm or 
chrysler workers 
gm the nations largest automaker said it earned 5169 
million on revenue of 2879 billion during the period this year 
compared with 8592 million on revenue of 2822 billion during 
the same time last year 
gms profits could not be translated directly to a pershare 
basis because of a complex system of ownership of gm common class 
e and class h stocks 
for the first nine months of the year gm reported earnings of 
352 billion up 17 percent from profits of 346 billion in the 
januaryseptember period last year 
gms ninemonth revenue totaled 9557 billion up from 9121 
billion a year ago 
no 2 ford said it earned 4771 million or 103 per share of 
common stock during the third quarter this year compared with 
8563 million or 178 a share during the same time last year 
revenue fell to 2024 billion during the period this year from 
2038 billion in the third quarter of 1988 
for the first nine months of the year fords earnings were down 
15 percent to 352 billion or 751 a share from 414 billion 
or 853 a share revenue rose to 72 billion from 6853 billion 
chrysler the nations thirdlargest automaker said it earned 
331 million or 142 a share during the third quarter compared 
with 1125 million or 50 cents a share during the julyseptember 
period last year 
without the 309 million infusion from the mitsubishi stock 
sale chryslers thirdquarter profits would been 22 million or 
10 cents a share 
chryslers 788 billion in revenue for the quarter matched its 
revenue for the same period a year earlier 
for the first nine months of the year chryslers profits rose 
158 percent to 714 million or 306 a share excluding profits 
from the mitsubishi sale with the stock sale worked in chryslers 
ninemonth profit rose 659 percent to 102 billion or 438 a 
share 
chryslers revenue for the first nine months of this year rose 
to 2795 billion up from revenue of 2578 billion during the 
same time last year 
its been a tough quarter chrysler chairman lee iacocca

american telephone amp telegraph co on thursday 
answered a false advertising lawsuit that mci communications corp 
filed 2 weeks ago with a countersuit that contends mcis ads 
deceive the public 
mcis longdistance phone advertising has misled customers 
about prices about the quality and reach of its service and about 
its facsimile service victor pelson atampt group executive told 
reporters in announcing the countersuit 
mci instead of cleaning up its own advertising act had the 
gall to file a lawsuit pelson said we stand by our 
advertising 
atampts us district court lawsuit denies the allegations in 
mcis oct 10 legal complaint and asks the court to enjoin mci from 
making false or deceptive representations with respect to the 
price quality features or any other aspect of any mci service 
it asks the court to order mci to make courtapproved corrective 
ads to mitigate the lingering effects of the misrepresentations 
atampts lawsuit also seeks unspecified profits wrongfully 
amassed by mci on the sale of its products or services during the 
period in question plus triple the damages that atampt has 
sustained because of the ads and legal and court costs 
we are amazed that atampt should label as absurd mcis claim 
that 100000 customers a week are switching to it from atampt yet 
failed to challenge it in court mci spokeswoman kathleen keegan 
said the most significant thing about atampts countersuit was 
what was not in it 
keegan said mci planned to seek an injunction against atampts ads 
soon 
the lawsuits are the latest chapters in mcis long battle with 
atampt which began in the 1970s when mci successfully broke atampts 
longdistance monopoly 
atampt says it has about 70 percent of the longdistance market 
as measured by interstate and intrastate revenues mci is no 2 
with more than 10 percent 
mcis lawsuit claimed atampt was trying to protect its eroding 
share of the longdistance market through maliciously false and 
deceptive advertising 
the mci lawsuit said that beginning in january this year atampt 
launched a counterattack against its competitors to regain market 
share and in july began targeting mcis new primetime cutrate 
longdistance calling plan 
mci chairman william mcgowan said at the time of the filing that 
atampt was losing 100000 customers a week and they are panicking 
about it 
pelson said mcgowans claim was absurd 
merrill tutton atampt vice president consumer services cited an 
mci ad that claims mci always saves you money 
he said mci was making apples and oranges comparisons 
between its cutrate calling plans and atampts standard 
longdistance rates 
we want to inform our customers of the facts tutton said 
he defended an ad that had particularly incensed mcgowan one 
showing a satellite picture of the earth with a quarter segment of 
the planet missing including europe the middle east and north 
africa the ad copy says is this how your worldwide longdistance 
company sees the world 
mcis lawsuit had asked court to enjoin atampt from making false 
or deceptive representations that any atampt service is superior or 
that mci has misrepresented its services or rates

wheat futures prices fell below 4 a bushel for the first time 
in a month thursday on the chicago board of trade reflecting 
disappointment that a newly expanded soviet grain deal contains no 
incentives to boost wheat sales 
corn prices rose in chicago while soybeans were mixed 
on other futures markets cocoa hit a new 16year low copper 
fell and precious metals climbed as the stock market dropped nearly 
40 points stockindex futures plunged energy futures were mostly 
lower and livestock and meat futures largely fell 
wheat futures settled 1 cents to 7 cents lower with the

corn futures were cent to 2 cents higher with december at 
244 a bushel oats were cent lower to cent higher with

the agriculture department announced late wednesday it had given 
the soviet union approval to buy an additional 4 million metric 
tons of grain in the fiscal year that began oct 1 raising the 
ceiling to 16 million tons 
but the expanded deal does not require the soviets to first 
fulfill a 4 millionton wheat purchase requirement contained in the 
original program 
the original deal also requires the soviets to buy at least 4 
million tons of corn but they have already exceeded that amount 
soviet purchases of us corn totaling 4 million tons were 
announced last week alone 
meanwhile the russians have bought just 12 million tons of 
wheat since june 1 said ted mao grain specialist with shearson 
lehman hutton inc 
corn is the commodity of choice he said and even though 
they will buy 4 million wheat it looks like that business will 
come later rather than sooner 
analyst katharina zimmer of merrill lynch capital markets inc 
said there were indications the soviets recently bought wheat from 
canada and england and with last weeks corn purchases she said 
the grain pipeline to russia is full 
nobody expects the russians to be back tomorrow to buy more 
corn or wheat for that matter she said 
cocoa futures plunged to new 16yearlows on new yorks coffee 
sugar amp cocoa exchange following news that brazil the worlds 
secondlargest producer was suspending a 10 percent tax on cocoa 
exports the move is likely to add more cocoa to an already 
overburdened market 
cocoa settled 24 to 38 lower with december at 961 a ton 
copper futures sank to new 2month lows on new yorks commodity 
exchange as the dow jones industrial average dropped 3955 points 
contributing to fears of a recessionrelated drop in copper demand 
copper settled 25 cent to 16 cents lower with december at 
1142 a pound 
the stock markets plunge also sent investors scurrying for the 
perceived safety of precious metals gold futures settled 310 to 
360 higher on the comex with december at 37540 a troy ounce 
silver was 77 cents to 84 cents higher with december at 5237 a 
troy ounce 
the selloff in stocks was reflected in stockindex futures 
trading on the chicago mercantile exchange where the contract for 
december delivery of stocks tracked by the standard amp poors 500 
index settled 51 points lower at 33955 the contract is worth 
500 a point 
stockmarket jitters also got some of the blame for 
significantly lower livestock and meat futures prices on the 
chicago mercantile exchange 
live cattle settled 17 cent to 57 cent lower with december at 
7465 cents a pound feeder cattle were 80 cent lower to 02 cent 
higher with october at 8307 cents a pound live hogs were 02 cent 
to 83 cent lower with december at 4697 cents a pound frozen pork 
bellies were 70 cent to 87 cent lower with february at 5245

average annual wage increases of 31 percent compared to average 
gains of 24 percent in their prior contracts the labor department 
said thursday 
the data covers contracts for 13 million workers negotiated in 
the first nine months of the year if the trend continues for the 
final three months 1989 would be the first year since 1981 in 
which new contracts provide workers with better pay raises on 
average than their prior contracts the department said 
the rebound in wage gains was attributed to the restoration of 
prior concessions in several industries that were slumping earlier 
in the decade particularly the us steel industry 
also the labor department said wage increases given to workers 
in the health care sector particularly nurses were outpacing the 
gains provided in prior contracts competition for skilled workers 
in that sector has pushed wages higher 
the departments bureau of labor statistics tracks collective 
bargaining agreements affecting 6 million workers in bargaining 
units of at least 1000 employees 
contracts affecting an additional 903000 workers in the private 
sector are up for collective bargaining in the fourth quarter more 
than onethird of those workers are rail workers the government 
said 
most of the settlements reached in the first nine months of the 
year 81 percent covering 1 million of the 13 million workers 
were in nonmanufacturing sectors about onethird of those were in 
the construction industry where settlements called for average 
annual wage increases of 30 percent the settlements in the other 
nonmanufacturing sectors primarily communications food stores 
and utilities provided average annual pay hikes of 33 percent 
the government said 
in manufacturing a sector which has slumped most of the year 
the settlements provided lower wage adjustments averaging 29 
percent a year over the life of the new contracts

cellular communications inc to acquire control of lin broadcasting 
corp 
on aug 31 the fccs mass media and common carrier bureaus 
granted mccaws transfer applications and denied counterpetitions 
filed by lin and others who objected to the requests 
the new yorkbased lin which has interests in cellular 
telephones television stations and specialty publishing has 
resisted mccaws nearly fivemonth takeover effort and appealed the 
bureaus actions 
the commission concluded that it should not engage in 
comparisons of the transferee and transferor in determining whether 
grant of the transfer will serve the public interest 
further the commission said hostile takeover cases should not 
be considered differently than other transfer cases the commission 
also said it will not generally consider an applicants level of 
debt when assessing the applicants financial qualifications 
the commission said mccaw has demonstrated reasonable 
assurance of acquisition financing from three prominent banks 
mccaw which already owns 51 million on lins shares has 
offered 125 a share or 275 billion for an additional 22 
million lin shares that would give mccaw about 503 percent of 
lins stock 
lins board has taken no position on the offer but previously 
agreed to merge its cellular operations with those of bellsouth 
corp the regional telephone company based in atlanta

when its all counted up the damage from 
hurricane hugo may exceed 8 billion the director of the national 
hurricane center said thursday 
robert sheets told a senate committee that damage from the 
september storm could climb to the 8 billion to 10 billion level 
in his opinion 
the insurance industry is currently estimating its losses at 4 
billion sheets said in the past we have found that total losses 
get close to two to three times the insurance loss he told the 
senate committee on commerce science and transportation 
ive never seen such massive damage as with hurricane hugo 
said sheets who has toured the damaged regions including south 
carolinas coastal zones 
sheets said the nation was somewhat lucky with hugo because the 
storm struck in such a way that the most powerful wind and waves 
slammed into the francis marion national forest an area with few 
human residents 
if it had struck a major metropolitan area the destruction 
would have been much greater he said 
sheets comments came at a hearing on modernization of the 
national weather service and he pointed out that improved weather 
radars planned for the future will make hurricane forecasting 
easier and more accurate 
sens albert gore jr dtenn and ted stevens ralaska 
questioned the proposed cuts in weather service offices planned 
over the next decade under the modernization 
the improved technology will mean that the national weather 
service will be able to give the same or better service with fewer 
offices contended john knauss director of the national oceanic 
and atmospheric administration 
the whole point is top provide better service he said 
we guarantee we will not provide any less service in any 
location if we cant do that we will not close the station 
knauss said 
stevens indicated disbelief saying that cutting from 10 weather 
stations to three in alaska could have serious results in a state 
where aviation and fishing are major activities 
elbert w friday director of the national weather service said 
new radar systems will dramatically improve forecasting of storms 
in tests at norman okla the radars improved prediction of severe 
weather from 58 percent to 91 percent he said 
the installation of new radars will provide improved coverage of 
alaska he said especially along the coastline 
weve proven the technology so far weve proven the science 
so far said friday

the us economy shrugged off hurricane hugo 
and the poorest trade performance in six years to grow at a 
moderate 25 percent annual rate from july through september the 
commerce department reported thursday 
the department said that the increase in the gross national 
product the countrys total output of goods and services was 
accompanied by a dramatic slowing of the inflation rate a price 
index tied to the gnp rose at an annual rate of 29 percent the 
slowest in three years as both energy and food costs moderated 
the combination of moderate growth and lower inflation was 
hailed by the bush administration but many private economists said 
the big deterioration in the trade deficit and a buildup of unsold 
business inventories posed significant threats to the economy in 
coming months 
the stock market reacting to the negative aspects of the gnp 
report turned down the dow jones industrial average of 30 stocks 
lost 3955 point 
most of the economys momentum in the third quarter came from a 
boom in consumer spending reflecting a rush to take advantage of 
endofmodelyear price discounts purchases shot ahead at an 
annual rate of 58 percent in the third quarter the fastest 
advance since the early part of 1988 
car sales in the first part of october have taken a nosedive and 
because of this analysts believe that consumer spending which 
accounts for twothirds of the overall economy will be 
substantially weaker in the final three months of the year 
allen sinai chief economist of the boston co said he was 
looking for the economy to grow at an anemic 1 percent annual rate 
in the octoberdecember period and he forecast that this would be 
followed in 1990 with two consecutive small declines in the gnp 
indicating a mild recession 
i think we are in for something harder than a soft landing 
sinai said businesses are facing a profits squeeze residential 
construction is weak and there is a major slowdown in exports we 
are flirting with a recession 
the bush administration rejected the recession talk 
on capitol hill treasury secretary nicholas brady testifying 
about the friday the 13th stock market plunge said he continued to 
believe that the markets tailspin was not signaling that anything 
was fundamentally wrong with the us economy 
talking to reporters brady said we have good solid growth in 
this country and inflation is lower than what people expected 
it to be 
he said that growth could slow in the fourth quarter but the 
country would not dip into a recession 
in his testimony brady came out in support of additional 
reforms in the way financial markets are regulated saying the 
securities and exchange commission should be able to halt trading 
in times of emergencies a power that now rests solely with the 
president 
in other economic news thursday the labor department said that 
major collective bargaining contracts negotiated through the first 
nine months of this year provided for annual wage increases of 31 
percent 
in a second report the labor department said the cost of 
imported goods dropped a sharp 13 percent in the third quarter 
reflecting the stronger dollar which makes imports less expensive 
for american consumers and lower foreign oil costs 
the stronger dollar was also cited as a major factor in the 
deterioration of the countrys trade deficit as measured by the 
gnp a figure that widened by a sharp 229 billion in the third 
quarter it was the worst trade number since the second quarter of 
1983 
imports shot up by 151 percent while exports which had been 
one of the economys brightest spots showed no gain at all 
analysts said this trade weakness was likely to continue for some 
time given the runup in the dollars value in the past year 
the 25 percent overall gnp increase was identical to the 
advance from april through june and followed a 37 percent 
januarymarch increase for the first nine months of the year the 
economy has been growing at an annual rate of 29 percent 
one factor acting as a drag on third quarter growth was a 4 
billion loss in personal incomes resulting from hurricane hugo 
which struck the carolinas in september 
some economists said that hugo and the october 19 california 
earthquake could actually end up boosting gnp growth in the fourth 
quarter as construction spending is increased to repair the 
devastation from both calamities 
while some analysts saw dangers of a recession others said they 
believed the country would escape an outright downturn because the 
federal reserve will act in time to lower interest rates as a spur 
to growth especially in view of signs that inflation is moderating 
the 29 percent rate of increase in the gnp deflator which 
reflects a changing marketbasket of goods was down sharply from a 
46 percent inflation rate in the second quarter 
the various changes left the economy after adjusting for 
inflation running at a total output of goods and services of an 
annual rate of 4158 trillion in the third quarter up 256 
billion from the secondquarter pace

quarter totaled 260 million up from 244 million 
operating income for the quarter declined by more than 44 
percent from 372 million to 208 million but the drop was more 
than offset by the sale of assets to finance an ad campaign for 
maalox 
gains from the assets sales totaled 233 million primarily 
from the sale of asilone an overthecounter antacid sold in 
britain and thrombinar a topical hemostatic product sold in the 
united states 
our strategic initiative seems to be working said robert e 
cawthorn rorers chairman and chief executive officer for the 
first time quarterly sales of maalox in the us were higher than 
in 1988 
we chose to fund the maalox moments campaign by selling 
minor products whose proceeds will deliver a higher return invested 
in maalox

congress passed and sent legislation to 
president bush on thursday to give a break to farmers who are 
growing substitute crops on land where drought destroyed or damaged 
earlier plantings 
the bill eases restrictions on a federal disaster aid package 
enacted earlier this year 
it is intended to protect winter wheat and cotton farmers who 
might receive no disaster payments for their lost crops under an 
agriculture department plan even though the producers expect to 
earn little or no profit on replacement crops such as grain sorghum 
or soybeans 
the legislation was approved wednesday by the senate and passed 
the house on a voice vote thursday with technical amendments it 
returned to the senate later in the day and was approved easily 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan said he was confident 
that bush would sign the legislation 
the agriculture department trying to prevent farmers from 
reaping double benefits has been planning to deduct 75 percent of 
the gross value of any replacement crop from the disaster payment a 
farmer would have otherwise received for losses on his first crop 
under the bill that system would be modified 
farmers would have no payment deductions if the replacement 
crops failed to produce more than 50 percent of the county average 
yield for the second crop 
but if the yield exceeded 50 percent of average yield the 
agriculture departments formula for deductions would kick in and 
be applied only to the portion of the crop that exceeded the 50 
percent mark 
under the agriculture departments initial plan even farmers 
who had replanted only a few acres would have to wait until 
harvesting their second crop before obtaining disaster benefits for 
damage to the first crop 
that provision would be canceled under the legislation
