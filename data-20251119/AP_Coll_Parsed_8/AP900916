at one time ray liotta would have been perfectly 
happy to just stay home 
his mother was the movie fan of the family liotta preferred 
sports he went out for the senior play in high school only after 
quitting the basketball team because of a fight with his coach 
and when liotta decided to study acting at the university of 
miami he wasnt doing it out of a compulsion to entertain or a 
need for artistic expression he simply had nothing better to do 
my parents wanted me to go to college and i didnt want to 
go said liotta who stars with robert de niro and joe pesci in 
goodfellas 
my parents then suggested i take a year off and find out what 
lifes all about i decided to go to the university of miami and 
take drama so i wouldnt have to take a math class and when i got 
there i didnt want to do anything 
but he changed not right away liotta had no great desire to 
act immediately after graduating but by 1986 when he hustled his 
way into a small but memorable role in something wild the 
actor was hungry for work 
now after dominic and eugene and field of dreams the 
offers come to him liotta didnt have to beg for the starring role 
of goodfellas he wanted the part and director martin scorsese 
wanted him even de niro put in a good word 
the movie runs more than two hours and covers four decades 
liotta is in virtually every scene 
you have to have a certain amount of confidence to be an 
actor liotta said in an interview in this film i had to show 
jealousy rage happiness anger everything was there you 
want to take that challenge as an actor it was pretty intense 
i had 80 costume changes one days in the 50s the next 
days in the 80s emotionally it was all different things one 
day im sweet then the next day im coked out of my mind wed 
span 20 years at one location 
goodfellas is based on nicholas pileggis bestselling 
novel wiseguy liotta plays henry hill a halfirish 
halfsicilian brooklyn kid drawn to the fastpaced gangster life 
who eventually hooks up with mobsters de niro and pesci 
off screen liotta had to fit in as well de niro and scorsese 
have worked many times before notably in raging bull and 
taxi driver liotta knowing this was his chance to establish 
himself as a major star did his best to treat the film like just 
another job 
these guys have made major major movies theyre considered 
geniuses and brilliant and all that i just approached it as a 
game just telling a story no big deal i read the book about five 
years ago and thought geez i could do this 
liotta began acting in soaps shortly after graduating from 
college he worked for three years on another world 
appreciating the steady work and learning how to feel comfortable 
in front of a camera but after appearing in the shortlived tv 
series casablanca and our family honor he struggled to 
find work 
having nothing to do wasnt much fun anymore when liotta 
learned there was an opening for a violent excon in something 
wild he pushed hard trying unsuccessfully to get an audition 
and finally calling on his friend melanie griffith the films 
star 
i said let me phone melanie she was already cast 
director jonathan demme was down to three guys and it was the 
final week of casting she said great idea ill do that i wish 
she had thought of that before i was just so angry about trying to 
get in and the part called for an angry guy i went in angry and 
luckily it worked out 
he played nice for dominic and eugene starring as a quiet 
medical student who takes care of his retarded brother and was a 
good guy in field of dreams appearing as the ghost of baseball 
great shoeless joe jackson 
all his characters are motivated by passion the actor says for 
goodfellas it was the drive for money and power there was his 
wife griffith in something wild his brother in dominic and 
eugene and baseball in field of dreams 
liottas own passion came during those frustrating times before 
something wild when he and fellow unemployed actors kevin 
costner and andy garcia would hang out and try to keep their 
spirits up like frustrated minor leaguers just begging for the 
manager to hand them the ball 
i didnt have any doubts about my ability liotta said i 
wasnt wondering when i was going to get a break im not being 
cocky it was tough no question about it you see these people 
and think i cant do that i can at least do it as well and 
with more commitment

purple and red bougainvillea are 
back in bloom seaside resorts are open and cruise ships call again 
at most of the dozen caribbean islands battered by hurricane hugo 
st croix in the us virgin islands and the british colony of 
montserrat still are rebuilding but elsewhere there is little 
remaining evidence of the worst storm in a decade which killed at 
least 56 people and caused more than 2 billion in damage on sept 
1718 1989 
i think weve recovered better than expected said carl 
mitchell director of the economic secretariat of the sevenmember 
organization of eastern caribbean states in st johns antigua 
initially we had looked at the possible longterm effects and 
had indicated it was going to take three years before there would 
be full recovery he said but i think this may apply just to 
montserrat the recovery in the other islands has been quite 
startling 
nevertheless mitchell said the hurricane caused a drop in 
economic growth rates and a sharp rise in the cost of living in 
montserrat and the neighboring islands of antigua dominica and st 
kittsnevis 
on st croix where onethird of the homes were demolished or 
heavily damaged by winds of up to 200 mph life is returning to 
normal gradually 
two insurance companies went out of business leaving more than 
55 million in claims to 1000 homeowners and 200 businesses 
unpaid the territorial government has agreed to cover policyholder 
losses of up to 100000 each but hundreds of families are still 
waiting to have their homes rebuilt 
one million cubic yards of debris has been cleared from the 
island and restaurants and stores in christiansted the main town 
are operating the landscape once brown from defoliation is 
greener now 
the education department said all but one of the islands 10 
schools were reopening for the fall term after repairs made with a 
43 million federal grant 
thirtythree cruise ships are to resume port calls in october 
betty sperber president of the hotel and tourism association on 
st croix said 10 of the 15 major hotels would be open by then 
but the other five were closing permanently 
st croixs image as an american paradise suffered both from the 
hurricanes destruction and four days of looting that followed 
president bush sent 1100 military police to restore order they 
stayed for two months and the island was under curfew 
residents still have angry memories of news reports at the time 
about marauding gangs of blacks attacking wealthy whites with 
machetes 
police chief delroy richards says more than 100 people 
including some prominent residents were arrested on theft charges 
but none of the cases can i say were racially motivated 
i feel the looting is behind us he said people have 
condemned those persons who took items that were not needed 
st croix population 56000 was by far the hardest hit of the 
three main us virgin islands it has received the bulk of 750 
million provided to the territory by the federal emergency 
management agency known as fema 
hugo also heavily damaged st thomas whose population is about 
the same sparsely populated st john and the neighboring british 
virgin islands but all of them recuperated quickly 
puerto rico a us commonwealth of 36 million people 70 miles 
west of st croix returned to normal within weeks of the hurricane 
despite an estimated 13 billion in damage and lost production 
jose bravo the fema coordinator in san juan said 900 families 
still were living in temporary modular housing mostly in 
northeastern puerto rico and on the offshore islands of culebra and 
vieques 
he said fema provided 72 million to the commonwealth government 
for new housing but construction has been delayed by permits 
contracts and land development 
only 11 million of 142 million raised for hurricane victims 
by a 12hour simultaneous telethon in san juan new york and miami 
had been distributed by the end of august 11 months later 
luis davila administrator of the telethon fund said all 
applicants should have their money within three months she said 
the fund also would build 330 homes all expected to be ready by 
christmas 
montserrat a small pearshaped island with only 12500 
residents 200 miles south of puerto rico was all but flattened by 
the hurricane and remains far from completely recovered 
reuben meade the governments director of development said 
about 90 percent of the islands 4000 homes had been rebuilt and 
businesses had reopened in plymouth the capital 
electricity water and telephone services have been restored and 
the two major hotels have reopened he said but roads need 
repairs the port still uses a barge as its main jetty and little 
work has been done on government buildings 
in guadeloupe which has 340000 inhabitants and was the first 
island in hugos path wood and corrugated iron is heaped in places 
and schools and houses still are being rebuilt 
franklin mcdonald director of the pancaribbean disaster 
preparedness and prevention project in antigua said the french 
government responded quickly 
there are still housing repairs being done but to a great 
extent guadeloupe is back to normal he said

ap military writer susanne schafer recently 
traveled to fort hood with general carl vuono the armys chief of 
staff where elements of the 1st cavalry and 2nd armored divisions 
are preparing to ship out to saudi arabia this is the second of 
three reports 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
staff sgt connie martens barked out the 
chemical weapons drill to her twodozen charges sweaty young army 
soldiers swathed head to toe in thick green and black protective 
gear 
blister agent usually not fatal possibility of liquid 
use we have the m258a1 hold your breath grab your 
m258a1 at that time you will start decontaminating your skin 
once you decontaminate your skin no problem martens told her 
troops in ratatat style 
some 15000 soldiers from two armored divisions at this 
sprawling texas fort will soon trade its rolling hills for the 
sands of saudi arabia and iraqs saddam hussein might be their 
next instructor in the dangers of chemical warfare 
so the soldiers from the 1st cavalry division listened intently 
to the petite sergeant with the booming voice a chemical weapons 
expert with 15 years of service as they got themselves and their 
gear ready to deploy 
blisters may begin to appear on your skin dont pop the 
blisters if you break the blisters you have the secondary problem 
of infection you dont want infections out there so just keep em 
covered like youve always been trained like a normal burn 
casualty and you wont have a problem any questions she asked 
yeah ive got a question a voice sounded from the side of 
the huddle whats the standard for putting on a protective 
mask 
backs stiffened and eyes widened as a bigshouldered fourstar 
general in jungle green and brown fatigues worked his way to the 
front of the group 
gen carl vuono the armys chief of staff had come to see 
whether his troops were getting the proper training before being 
sent in harms way 
who knows vuono shouted at the group soldiers whod rarely 
been quizzed by a multistar general let alone the armys top 
commander 
nine seconds came a chorused reply 
so whats the signal vuono asked without waiting for a 
response he then boomed out gas gas gas 
ripping their black headgear from their belts the soldiers 
squeezed their eyes shut add held their breath as they struggled to 
place the heavy goggles and plastic cover over their heads 
a few wouldnt have made it in time most did 
not bad not bad vuono said checking his watch lets 
try it again put em back 
as a few men started to remove their clumsy headgear the 
muffled sound of negative negative emerged from the under the 
darth vaderlike hoods 
vuono beamed with delight the soldiers had refused his order 
because hed not given the proper command all clear 
well done well done i tell you tilleli im proud of these 
guys vuono shouted to their commander maj gen john tilleli 
jr who stood nearby 
leaning on his brown and green cane the general had recently 
undergone hip surgery so his staff had covered his hospitalissued 
yellow cane with camouflage tape vuono told the soldiers they 
were going a long way from fort hood to a place much hotter than 
texas 
and they also might have to go up against an opponent who has 
used chemical weapons before 
all hoods and goggles were still trained on the general 
i dont know whether hell use them i dont know whether 
well fight him all i do know is i dont want any soldier going 
to saudi arabia that isnt well trained the general said 
were damn proud of each and every one of you and we wish you 
all the best and godspeed as you deploy on desert shield vuono 
said saluting good luck good job 
tethup came the command as vuono strode away the 
rubberized soldiers stood at attention under shade of the scrub 
oak 
then with the speed of a bullet sgt martens was spouting her 
commands again getting her charges ready to move through the 
training booth that simulates a chemical weapons attack 
all right men move to the next area move to the cs area if 
you have any contacts make sure you get em out we dont want to 
make you cry just a safety precaution get em out

democratic sen j bennett johnson is 
billing himself as a washington insider who delivers for louisiana 
in his bid to avert a november runoff against former ku klux klan 
leader david duke 
on the campaign trail johnston paints a dark picture of a 
freshman duke in washington he warns that electing the exklansman 
to the us senate could cost louisiana military bases and other 
government projects 
were not talking about a debating contest in washington 
johnston said at a recent campaign rally were talking about the 
future of central louisiana we dont need to be growing hate here 
in louisiana 
at stake he says is the future of england air force base and 
fort polk two major military installations in central louisiana 
as well as the red river navigation project a proposal that has 
been pending since the 1970s 
johnston who chairs the senate energy committee and sits on the 
budget committee says he has the congressional clout that comes 
from seniority 
the threeterm senator is in no danger of losing his seat but 
still in question is whether the incumbent will win another term 
outright in the states open primary on oct 6 if no candidate 
wins 50 percent the top two votegetters face off in a november 
runoff 
in one recent poll 48 percent of the voters favored johnston 
and 28 percent backed the maverick republican duke eleven percent 
supported state sen ben bagert according to the survey by 
masondixon opinion research bagert is the gops endorsed 
candidate but he has lagged far behind johnston and duke throughout 
the campaign 
the poll showed duke and johnston running even among white 
voters but gave johnston a commanding lead among blacks 
johnston said duke garners support because it gives people a 
way to vote against every jesse jackson and every black on a town 
council 
he warns that a monthlong runoff campaign would further 
embarrass louisiana and erode the states chances for attracting 
industry and saving its federal projects 
can you imagine that were going to keep england air force 
base if david duke is elected to the us senate johnston asks 
on the campaign trail when you dont have much seniority you 
dont have much clout 
johnston takes credit for keeping alive the red river project 
despite opposition from presidents carter and reagan and so far 
during the bush administration 
thats what seniority can do for you i can get it done he 
said 
both democratic and republican opponents have debated how best 
to handle duke when duke ran for a vacant seat in the louisiana 
house in 1989 his opponent john treen drew the endorsement of 
president reagan and the republican party amid high media 
attention duke won the seat 
when johnston began a recent campaign swing in baton rouge he 
said he was on as a crusade but did not mention duke by name 
within a week however johnston was waging counterattacks 
against duke who delights in calling the incumbent j benedict 
johnston 
johnston says duke is hollywood handsome he is a good 
persuader as most con men are 
duke meanwhile maintains he has put his klan and neonazi past 
behind him 
i was intolerant im ashamed of that duke has said 
he is the head of the national association for the advancement 
of white people in campaign appearances he rails against welfare 
cheats and affirmative action 
duke accuses johnston of using scare tactics and says the 
senators claim that louisiana could lose federal projects if he is 
electd is ridiculous 
we have a better chance of keeping military bases with a 
republican senator than with a liberal democrat who has been 
voting against the president duke says 
johnston has resorted to cowardly personal attacks because he 
doesnt have the guts to stand up and debate me face to face he 
said last week 
johnston says duke celebrates adolf hitlers birthday the 
senator emphasizes that duke has been involved in writing books 
advising blacks on how to defend themselves against whitey and 
how women can please their men sexually 
if i had done oneone hundredth of what hed done they would 
have run me out of town on a rail johnston said 
the message once a klansman always a klansman 
this is serious business this is no boy scout this is 
louisianas reputation at stake johnston said 
weve had some real success in attracting industry not 
rapidly but clearly johnston said in an interview between 
campaign stops duke could stop it dead in its tracks if 
louisiana becomes known as the state of david duke and the ku klux 
klan 
this election is about the legitimacy of david duke no one 
gives him a chance of winning the question is whether he will be 
identified as a spokesman for louisiana he is a clear and 
present danger to coin a phrase

people stare at the scars on his throat as he 
waits in grocery store checkout lines sometimes they ask if he 
has a cold sometimes they ask if he fought in vietnam 
he never served in vietnam but he tells people he did because 
he knows from experience that they wont want the truth 
the truth is eight years ago a stranger jammed a knife into his 
gut spilling the intestines out of his slight frame then slit his 
throat as he lay calling for help its those details people dont 
want to hear details that still rattle him causing his hands to 
shake uncontrollably calling attention to nails bitten down to 
nothing 
the sandyhaired young father is just one of several million 
people victimized by aggravated assault in the past decade 
the attack swept away his optimism and trust his devilmaycare 
fearlessness taking its place is fear fear so real that after 
telling his story he asked that his real name and hometown be kept 
secret 
we live with the realization that it doesnt happen to 
somebody else said the boyish 33yearold well call larry 
roberts we know that people will hurt you 
murders may steal the headlines but the number of serious 
assaults dwarfs the number of killings assault victims survive 
but often are changed forever 
the trauma of having looked at the jaws of death is something 
that is very rough to deal with said john stein deputy director 
of the national organization for victims assistance 
some 559270 people roughly the population of columbus ohio 
were injured in aggravated assaults last year alone according to 
the national crime survey which annually interviews members of 
some 49000 households and extrapolates from that to the entire 
nation 
the survey found that 11 million others were victims of an 
attempted aggravated assault with a weapon a gunshot flew by 
them for example 
on the night of june 6 1982 roberts was on leave from the navy 
and interested mainly in getting in a last day of scuba diving 
before his aircraft carrier departed in two days 
he was pitching a tent in a park when two strangers struck up a 
conversation they seemed friendly enough 
then without warning one of them stabbed roberts in the abdomen 
and ran off with his scuba gear wedding ring and 4 in cash 
when i thought he was gone i started to holler for help 
roberts said a catch in his nowraspy voice he came back 
through the woods and he tilted my head back and slit my throat 
twice and then he tied my feet together and my hands back to two 
trees 
roberts eventually worked free dragged himself 250 feet to a 
dirt road holding in his intestines and pressing his chin toward 
his chest to keep the blood from spurting out help finally arrived 
the next morning 
he spent 10 months in the hospital undergoing at least 10 
operations 
the fear took over when he emerged from the hospital april 18 
1983 
i used to take a gun with me wherever i went he said i 
was scared to death 
in the next two years roberts moved his family six times 
something would happen something would trigger me and wed be 
gone he said 
they stopped running five years ago in rural maryland so their 
elder daughter could start school and enjoy a semblance of a normal 
life four years ago roberts and his wife had a second daughter 
in the meantime his attacker pleaded guilty to attempted murder 
and served six years of a 10year sentence before being freed as a 
model prisoner 
roberts still fears him even though he believes his fear is 
irrational he also insisted that the assailants name not be used 
in part because he doesnt want to antagonize him 
even now roberts home is guarded by a large loud dog 
nicknamed norad after the nations early warning system for 
nuclear attacks at night their home is awash in light two 
sheriffs deputies live across the street 
roberts and his wife never employ babysitters because they 
dont trust strangers 
the attack destroyed roberts career plans the navy discharged 
him involuntarily because he could no longer perform his job 
desperate to catch up for time lost roberts pushed himself too 
far he has had a drinking problem he spent two months in a 
psychiatric hospital last year 
today he takes things more slowly teaching scuba diving only 
part time while attending college 
and after years of shying away from the world he now tells his 
story to police groups hoping to sensitize officers to victims 
needs 
the victim is a piece of evidence said andrew turner a 
criminal justice instructor at wor wic tech community college and a 
former maryland police officer who has arranged some of roberts 
talks 
if the guy survived you had a good case he could come and 
testify against the perpetrator turner said police dont see 
a guy healed up but still needing emotional support 
roberts finds the speeches therapeutic despite the toll they 
take and he has established a network of people who will help him 
when he cracks from the strain 
it is important to roberts that he controls the impact of the 
attack and not the other way around but he conceded it has 
given my life a different direction 
now theres yet another fear aids 
roberts had numerous blood transfusions in 1982 before blood 
was tested for the deadly disease and he refuses to be tested now 
if im going to die of it he said with a grimace i dont 
want to know about it

what is an aggravated assault it depends on 
who is talking what one police officer calls aggravated assault 
may be only a simple assault to another and an encounter not even 
worth reporting to a third 
in each state the definition of aggravated assault varies 
widely said richard r bennett a professor of justice at 
american university 
in some states its any threat with a weapon other than a 
fist he said elsewhere its a fist in some states it has 
to be an injury visible on the outside internal bleeding wont 
do 
even the justice departments two major measures of national 
crime dont quite agree 
the fbis uniform crime reports defines it as an unlawful 
attack for the purpose of inflicting severe or aggravated 
bodily injury the assault usually involves a weapon or means 
likely to produce death or great bodily harm the fbi also throws 
in attempted assault 
the national crime survey meanwhile defines it as attack 
with a weapon irrespective of whether or not there was injury and 
attack without a weapon resulting either in serious injury for 
example broken bones loss of teeth internal injuries or loss of 
consciousness or an undetermined injury requiring two or more days 
of hospitalization also includes attempted assault with a 
weapon 
the fbi report includes only crimes reported to police the 
national crime survey which annually interviews people who live in 
about 49000 homes and apartments learns of many more crimes that 
police never hear about 
and in part because of they are put together differently the 
two surveys disagree about whether more americans have been 
assaulted in the last decade 
the fbi report says the rate of aggravated assault and attempted 
aggravated assault zoomed up 284 percent during the decade to a 
new high of 383 for every 100000 people 
the national crime survey however says the rate dropped 86 
percent to 850 per 100000

this years seniors at fort zumwalt high 
schools will be armed with more than just diplomas when they 
graduate theyll also each be backed by a threeyear warranty 
in a small but growing number of schools educators are adding 
an extra stamp of approval to their products satisfaction 
guaranteed 
the diploma used to be the guarantee said fort zumwalt 
superintendent bernard dubray but now we need to go above and 
beyond 
warranties such as fort zumwalts typically guarantee that a 
graduate has learned the basic skills necessary to perform an 
entrylevel job if not the school promises to provide additional 
training free of charge 
its accountability said bernard sidman superintendent of 
the plymouthcarver regional school district in massachusetts 
which first included a threeyear warranty with graduates diplomas 
last spring and so far has had no students sent back 
you hear an awful lot about the quality of public education 
and about public institutions of education not meeting their 
responsibilities in preparing students for entry into public 
life sidman said 
we felt that if we were going to be asking the community to 
support us maybe we should put ourselves on the line 
but let the buyer beware the amount of training received by 
guaranteed graduates may vary some schools simply warranty all 
their graduates in others the warranty program is designed mainly 
for students who want jobs straight out of high school 
at prince georges county school district in maryland students 
who want to be under warranty take a semester class focusing on job 
skills the class has been developed with input from area business 
and industry leaders 
in missouris blue springs school district the states largest 
the graduate guarantee is printed on the back of a laminated 
walletsize diploma 
weve got some tremendous young people coming out of our 
system said superintendent charles mcgraw the nations 
educational system is getting a bad rap and we wanted to make a 
point that our graduates had the skills to be good employees 
but its not enough just to warranty students if theres no 
recognition of what entrylevel jobs in todays business world 
require said fritz edelstein senior fellow at the national 
alliance for business in washington dc 
entrylevel jobs are much more complex today and school studies 
should reflect that edelstein said 
mcgraw agreed 
i think we went through a time when the curriculum was out of 
date he said the curriculum has been slow changing it 
hasnt kept up with the progress of technology that the business 
world required so this is an attempt to be up to date 
for instance mcgraw said mechanical drawing is out 
computerassisted drafting is in at the junior high level a new 
exploratory course called industrial technology is being offered to 
introduce students to robotics broadcasting electronics and 
computer science he said 
educators say skill guarantees have helped create a line of 
communication between schools and businesses 
its a feedback system said gary marx associate executive 
director of the american association of school administrators in 
arlington va its a way for the schools to say to an employer 
its all right to come back and let us know if theres something 
missing here 
in the harlem consolidated school district outside rockford 
ill this years seniors will be able to earn a certificate of 
employability 
the idea came about through meetings between school 
administrators and corporate leaders from the community assistant 
superintendent wayne musholt said 
during discussions company executives expressed concerns about 
the employability of some of the students graduating today 
particularly those who were not collegebound 
their concern was that some of the students didnt always have 
the best work habits and attitudes and we decided there ought to be 
a way of certifying them musholt said 
to gain the certificate students will have to earn the required 
number of high school credits and be absent no more than six days a 
year in addition their work attitudes will be rated by their 
teachers 
the program at prince georges county schools has received high 
marks from business and industry leaders said bonnie jenkins 
director of public affairs 
the response has been overwhelmingly positive so far she 
said 
employers prefer the students who have completed the special 
semester course which emphasizes such areas as work habits and 
attitudes reasoning and problem solving and oral communication 
skills 
so its giving them an edge she said 
last year was the first for the project and no students have 
been referred back for more training jenkins said 
guarantees rekindle employers interest in high school graduates 
and encourage potential dropouts to stay in school said thomas 
shannon executive director of the national school boards 
association in alexandria va 
this is adding a new dimension to the diploma he said 
its a gimmick its right out of madison avenue but secondly 
it also sends a powerful message to the school staff that your work 
is really on the line

the prospect of iraq firing ballistic missiles 
at us forces in the arabian desert is stirring congressional 
interest in an obscure star wars spinoff effort to build defenses 
against closerange missile attacks 
the united states has only a rudimentary defense against iraqs 
missile arsenal which us intelligence agencies say is rapidly 
growing more sophisticated and is capable of carrying chemical 
warheads to targets inside saudi arabia 
even some of congress harshest critics of the strategic defense 
initiative more commonly called star wars or sdi say the iraqi 
missile threat might call for spending more on what the pentagon 
calls theater missile defense 
maybe theres some justification for increasing that 
particular aspect of sdi sen edward kennedy dmass said last 
week at a senate armed services committee hearing on the us 
military buildup in the persian gulf region 
kennedys comment doesnt suggest a surge of support for the 
overall sdi program which is aimed mainly at building a 
spacebased defense against soviet intercontinental ballistic 
missiles those capable of reaching american soil 
congress is expected to slash at least 1 billion from president 
bushs request for 46 billion in sdi funding for the 1991 budget 
year starting oct 1 
the iraqi crisis however has revived interest in sdi 
technologies that could be applied against shortrange missiles 
that are proliferating in the middle east 
two days after the aug 2 iraqi invasion the senate approved a 
measure forcing the pentagon to slow down work on strategic 
antimissile defenses while putting more emphasis on theater 
defense the measure called for spending 180 million on theater 
defense in 1991 48 million more than bush requested and 55 
million more than in this years budget 
people are much more focused now on the threat posed by 
shortrange missiles sen jeff bingaman dnm a cosponsor of 
the senate measure said in an interview friday what makes it 
more immediate is the aggression that saddam hussein visited on 
kuwait 
one of the most promising theater missile defense projects is 
called the extended range intercept technology or erint ltv 
corp which runs the project under an sdi contract is developing 
a lightweight missile to ram incoming ballistic missiles at five 
times the speed of sound causing them to vaporize 
money for erint was cut back from planned levels this year 
causing a severalmonth delay in its development schedule the 
missiles first flight tests are set for 1992 according to jess 
granone of the strategic defense command in hunstville ala 
also in development is the arrow system for defense against 
theater missiles this highly secretive program is a joint effort 
between the strategic defense command and israeli aircraft 
industries it is being developed to handle longerrange missiles 
than those that could be hit by the erint system 
currently the only us defense against shortrange missiles is 
the armys patriot air defense system which was designed to shoot 
down aircraft not missiles the patriot is being modified to knock 
down missiles but the technology is rudimentary and the system has 
never been battle tested 
batteries of patriot missiles are deployed with army units in 
saudi arabia 
only about 3 percent of the total sdi budget of 36 billion 
this year was spent on developing missile systems to intercept and 
destroy shortrange ballistic missiles the main focus of sdi is to 
build a combination of ground and spacebased weapons and 
satellites to detect track and destroy longrange missiles the 
united states has spent 20 billion on this effort since 1983 
at the senate armed services hearing defense secretary dick 
cheney jumped at the opportunity to emphasize us vulnerability to 
nonsoviet missiles an argument that carried little weight before 
bush dispatched tens of thousands of gis to saudi arabia after iraq 
invaded kuwait aug 2 
we see now as we contemplate the possibility of hostilities 
with iraq that were faced with a country that has ballistic 
missiles shortrange systems cheney said sdi is that portion 
of our budget where we currently have ensconced the programs that 
would allow us to deal with a shortrange tactical ballistic 
missile threat

a toddler fell to the bottom of a 12foot narrow 
construction hole saturday afternoon and firefighters hampered by 
the danger of a cavein worked into the night trying to rescue 
him 
firemen broke through a layer of hard clay shortly after 9 pm 
in their efforts to dig a parallel shaft to rescue 20monthold 
kevin davis from the hole at his familys home in southeast denver 
the shaft kevin fell into is about 18inches wide at the top and 
was to be filled with reinforced concrete for a remodeling project 
denver policeman wc hoffman said the threat of a cavein 
diminished after diggers finally broke through the clay that had 
slowed digging efforts throughout the night 
were letting him sleep for now hes been sleeping off and 
on weve had to play around with the oxygen tube to the boy 
because he doesnt like the sound hissing of the oxygen every 
time he wakes up he cries hoffman said 
rescuers were ready should there be a cavein on the little boy 
who is too young to grab a rope that could be lowered to him 
weve got a pole with a snare in the hole if it caves in 
well grab him with that and pull him up said hoffman 
however he said the snare would break any limb they might pull 
on 
the boys parents tom and lisa davis were talking to kevin 
trying to soothe him during the rescue effort oxygen was being 
pumped into the shaft 
kevin fell into the shaft about 4 pm

at least 1000 refugees from kuwait 
streamed into saudi arabia on saturday after iraqi border guards 
opened at least one frontier crossing 
scores of newly arrived kuwaitis were lined up early sunday to 
be processed at a saudi government office in this border town and 
waiting to use pay phones to call relatives who had fled kuwait 
earlier 
a saudi government source who had spoken to an official at the 
border said he was told that about 1000 kuwaitis had crossed into 
khafji on the saudi side and each was being registered by the saudi 
government 
the source who spoke on condition of anonymity said most 
government officials had been instructed to say publicly that there 
had been no abnormal activity at the crossing point 
iraqs motives for opening the border were not immediately 
clear 
several of the kuwaiti refugees said the border had been 
abruptly opened friday but most of those who left did so on 
saturday 
a kuwait city lawyer who gave his name only as shaheen said he 
didnt know why the frontier had been opened but said iraqi 
president saddam hussein is asking the kuwaitis to leave kuwait 
and go out across the border 
he said that in the last three days about 25 young kuwaitis 
ranging in age from 15 to 25 had been taken away by iraqi soldiers 
for unknown reasons 
shaheen added that he had heard rumors of several americans and 
other westerners hiding in kuwait 
if you help a westerner in your home you will be hanged but 
some people are still hiding them he said referring to iraqi 
threats that persons caught sheltering westerners would be put to 
death 
a group of 11 kuwaiti families 88 people in all arrived in 
dhahran 200 miles south of the border saturday night and told of 
traveling in a convoy of cars from kuwait city 
they said they made the trip because iraqi president saddam 
hussein had stated two days ago that all vehicles with kuwaiti 
registry would be permitted to cross into saudi arabia 
speaking through an interpreter at a local hotel several 
members of the group said they were stopped by iraqi troops six 
times and were robbed of belongings including passports drivers 
licenses cassettes and even wedding invitations 
a hotel clerk at khafji on the saudi side of the border said 
refugees of all nationalities including westerners indians and 
others began streaming across about 10 am and at midnight 
they are still coming little by little 
the clerk at the hotel saad alorasi who identified himself as 
hosaria kumara said the refugees were coming by car and most 
apparently were heading south toward dhahran 
one of the refugees in khafji affa abdullah said she had left 
her home with 15 family members after learning from a friend that 
the border was open 
she said the iraqis took their passports and drivers licenses at 
a checkpoint before they reached the border most of the kuwaitis 
at the processing center did not appear to have passports 
when we got to the border the iraqis told us to go but i 
dont know why she said 
she said food supplies were running low and stores were limiting 
customers to single purchases of various items 
the shortages were even affecting the iraqi occupation troops 
she said that during the past month iraqi soldiers would come to 
her home and take food and water 
one soldier asked me whether i liked saddam hussein or 
jaber if i told him i liked kuwait and jaber i would be killed 
the emir of kuwait sheik jaber elahmed alsabah heads the 
kuwaiti governmentinexile based in the southwestern saudi city of 
taif 
another kuwaiti who gave his name only as adel said the border 
was open friday and saturday but today maybe it will be 
closed 
adel said kuwaitis had heard saddams call for an islamic holy 
war against the united states but he said the iraqis dont have 
even a little islam in their hearts or in their minds 
israel is better than saddam he said the israelis take 
from the palestinians but without killing them or stealing their 
food and water saddam is killing kuwait 
another man who identified himself only by his first name 
manfour said the iraqi soldiers were stealing everything 
including the loudspeakers from mosques used to call the faithful 
to their daily prayers 
refugees mostly kuwaitis have been trickling into saudi arabia 
since aug 2 when iraq invaded kuwait the flow has depended 
largely on iraqi security which has been tight at times and loose 
at others

the united auto workers and general motors corp 
froze the clock and continued negotiations saturday toward a new 
threeyear agreement coverng 300000 gm workers nationwide 
meanwhile 12800 canadian auto workers union members struck 
ford of canada early saturday after talks there broke off no 
plants involved operate on weekends so any strike impact wont be 
felt until monday 
we still have a very significant distance between the two 
positions fords chief negotiator don mackenzie said after 
talks broke off the strike is the first against ford of canada 
since 1976 
both sides have refused to disclose details of their proposals 
and demands talks resumed saturday in detroit and continued past 
midnight into sunday morning bargaining also resumed saturday in 
toronto 
spokesmen for both sides said talks would continue through the 
night and no announcement would be made before 9 am sunday 
the 1987 gmuaw contract covering workers in 29 states expired 
at midnight friday because all but one of gms plants are idle on 
weekends a strike would be only symbolic until monday 
no new deadline for an agreement has been set in the gm talks 
but the union called a meeting monday for its 300member gm 
national bargaining council 
that session could be used to review details of the agreement or 
brief local leaders on the talks it also could be used to gauge 
leaders feelings on a strike authorization made a week ago 
a gm strike monday even at just one critical parts plant could 
quickly disrupt vehicle production by the worlds largest 
automaker thats because it uses a system that delivers parts to 
its assembly plants just before they are needed for installation in 
a vehicle 
both sides have refused to disclose the progress of the 
negotiations but aspects of job security and benefits for gm 
workers remained unresolved saturday 
talks initially stalled over gms insistence that a nolayoff 
pledge be limited to workers with 20 or more years of seniority 
the uaw wanted all workers covered 
gm countered with an offer to protect workers with 15 years of 
seniority in exchange for more flexibility to move workers within 
and between plants and an increase in the average number of minutes 
worked per hour from 46 to 55 the detroit free press reported 
saturday 
other bargaining issues include a uaw proposal to limit to three 
weeks a year the amount of time a worker can be laid off because of 
falling sales and a gm proposal to eliminate a plan to hire one 
new worker for every two who quit die or retire eliminating the 
plan could allow gm to trim its work force by 100000 
less than two hours before fridays deadline top union leaders 
told local leaders both sides had agreed to keep talking and extend 
the existing contracts provisions negotiations began in july 
i think well have a settlement by the end of the weekend 
president jerry schmidt of uaw local 1005 in parma ohio said 
after learning of the extension i think most of the members are 
happy with the decision to extend the talks 
the uaw in 1970 hit gm with a 69day strike the longest against 
the automaker except for the 193637 sitdown strikes in flint that 
gave birth to the union 
the negotiations could ultimately affect employees of gm ford 
and chrysler corp whose uaw national contracts expired at 
midnight friday 
the union froze negotiations at ford and chrysler pending the 
outcome of the gm talks the uaw plans to use an agreement ratified 
by gm workers as a pattern for contracts with ford and chrysler

france retaliated saturday for iraqs raid on its official 
residence in kuwait expelling dozens of iraqi diplomats and 
civilians and pledging to send warplanes tanks helicopters and 
4000 troops to saudi arabia 
refugees from kuwait crossed into saudi arabia by the hundreds 
after iraqi border guards opened the frontier 
the un security council early sunday unanimously condemned 
iraqs raids against french and other embassy compounds in kuwait 
and warned further sanctions against baghdad were likely 
us diplomats said an aerial blockade and secondary sanctions 
against nations flouting the un trade embargo would be considered 
urgently beginning sunday 
the washington post reported in its sunday editions that the 
us joint chiefs of staff have concluded that american air power 
including a massive bombing campaign against baghdad that 
specifically targets iraqi president saddam hussein and his family 
is the only effective option to force iraqi forces from kuwait if 
war breaks out 
air force chief of staff michael j dugan said air power is 
the only answer thats available to our country to avoid a bloody 
ground war the newspaper said 
the french moves came in response to raids by iraqi troops on 
the missions or diplomatic residences of france canada and belgium 
friday four french citizens including the military attache and 
the consuls of five nations including the united states were 
detained in the raids 
the french attache and the consuls were released but france said 
the three other french nationals still were being held saturday 
iraq at first denied the raids on the diplomatic compounds 
occurred and threatened reciprocal measures later while not 
admitting to the raids saddam sought to cool french anger by 
announcing he would allow elderly and ailing frenchmen to leave 
iraq and kuwait on monday 
saddams offer followed a plea from former algerian president 
ahmed ben bella who met saddam in baghdad on saturday the iraqi 
news agency reported 
it quoted saddam as saying he hoped his decision would provide 
the fairminded among the french people with the opportunity to 
reconsider their actions away from american and zionist 
pressures 
french president francois mitterrand urged widening the un 
economic sanctions on iraq to include air traffic and punishment of 
parties who broke sanctions although the french request for the 
security council meeting didnt mention either proposal 
we will do what must be done mitterrand told reporters 
after an emergency cabinet meeting but we wont be taking 
hostages 
iraqs ambassador to france abdelrazzek alhachimi said iraq 
will take reciprocal measures at a diplomatic level in response 
to the expulsion of iraqi diplomats he did not elaborate 
a spokesman quoted by the iraqi news agency denied the raid took 
place and said a french counselor had been escorted back to the 
french compound after he was found in the private home of a 
female member of kuwaits former ruling family 
the spokesman said france shoulders full responsibility for 
any reaction this intentional escalation of the situation will lead 
to 
frances actions represented the strongest move yet by france 
against iraq a country it long considered a friend and supplied 
weapons 
the foreign ministry summoned alhachimi satuday to hear the 
expulsion order against 11 embassy personnel ministry spokesman 
daniel bernard said 
france also will expel 26 iraqi civilian and military personnel 
taking training courses in france and 10 other iraqis whom 
mitterrand labeled secret agents afp reported citing 
unidentified sources 
remaining iraqi diplomats will be confined to the paris city 
limits mitterrand said 
iraq on aug 24 ordered the 60 embassies in kuwait to shut and 
move their representation to baghdad power and water was cut to 
missions that remained open and many were surrounded by iraqi 
troops 
but 17 missions remained open to show they still recognized 
kuwait as a sovereign nation and to keep in touch with the 
foreigners who remain trapped in the emirate 
about 1550 americans are captive in kuwait and iraq and many 
men are being held at strategic iraqi installations to deter any 
attack by usled forces president saddam hussein has allowed 
many western women and children to leave 
a saudi government source who had spoken to an official at the 
saudikuwaiti border said he was told that about 1000 people 
crossed over saturday there were no details on iraqs motives for 
opening the border 
members of one kuwaiti family that crossed the border and then 
traveled 200 miles south to dhahran said they made the trip because 
iraqi president saddam hussein had stated two days ago that all 
vehicles with kuwaiti registry would be permitted to cross into 
saudi arabia 
on saturday an iraqi airways jetliner left londons gatwick 
airport for baltimore carrying more than 350 evacuees mostly 
american women and children 
another uschartered iraqi airways jetliner carrying 165 
evacuees flew from baghdad to london the us embassy in london 
said the passengers included 73 americans but most of the others 
on board had american relatives or were dual passport holders and 
were headed for the united states according to a gatwick airport 
official 
they were spending the night at a hotel and were to depart 
sunday afternoon on a chartered flight to baltimore a us embassy 
official said 
recent escapees from kuwait have said that the emirate once a 
showcase of stability and wealth has been ravaged beyond 
recognition by saddams marauding soldiers and by civilian iraqi 
looters 
they said however tha the most critical problem facing 
kuwaitis was finding enough food to eat the un embargo has 
stopped shipments of food and other supplies into kuwait and iraq 
the times of london quoted victor watkins an official of the 
world society for the protection of animals as saying iraqi 
soldiers in kuwait have eaten 70 percent of the edible animals in 
kuwaits zoo the newspaper did not specify how watkins got his 
information or how many animals were in the zoo 
secretary of state james a baker iii met saturday with west 
german chancellor helmut kohl in his latest effort to gain 
financial and military support for the usled multinational force 
in the gulf 
after the meeting kohl announced west germany had promised 2 
billion to the military effort west germany along with japan had 
been criticized for not doing enough in the campaign against iraq 
japan has promised 4 billion in aid 
the west german constitution prohibits bonn from sending forces 
outside the nato area and the japanese charter prohibits 
deployment outside japanese territory both nations however are 
heavily dependent on imported oil 
the deployment of 150000 us troops in saudi arabia and about 
30 warships in the gulf area is costing the united states 1 
billion monthly the soldiers face about 265000 iraqi troops along 
kuwaits border with saudi arabia 
on friday canada belgium italy and britain promised to 
bolster their forces in the gulf with tanks combat troops fighter 
planes and more ships

the security council early sunday 
unanimously condemned iraqs raids on french and other embassy 
compounds in kuwait and warned that further sanctions against 
baghdad were likely 
us diplomats said an aerial blockade and secondary sanctions 
against nations flouting the un trade embargo would be considered 
urgently beginning sunday 
the vote was 150 in the emergency session sought by france 
by singling out diplomatic missions for attack iraq confirms 
its preference for instruments of force to instruments of diplomacy 
and negotiation said us ambassador thomas r pickering 
as early as possible we must take concrete steps under 
chapter 7 of the un charter to deal with iraqs continued 
violations of council resolutions the un charter and 
international law 
the resolution was the seventh adopted overwhelmingly by the 
council since iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 the council has 
condemned the occupation demanded release of all foreign hostages 
imposed a trade embargo and approved the use of maritime force to 
implement the embargo 
numerous speakers said that iraq had violated international law 
on protection of diplomatic missions by cutting off water power 
food and other resources to foreign missions in kuwait city 
numerous speakers said that iraq had violated international law 
on protection of diplomatic missions by cutting off water power 
food and other resources to foreign missions in kuwait city 
the council expressed outrage at iraqs violation friday of the 
french belgian and canadian embassy compounds the detention of 
diplomats and kidnapping of three french nationals 
the vote came about 3 am edt sunday after hours of informal 
consultations by members of the 15nation council 
the resolution strongly condemns aggressive acts perpetrated 
by iraq against diplomatic premises and personnel in kuwait as well 
as the abduction of foreign nationals who were present in those 
premises the resolution expresses outrage and demands the 
immediate release of all foreign nationals 
in a warning of further action the resolution says it would 
pursue its consultations urgently in order to take further 
concrete measures as soon as possible 
president francois mitterrand said saturday that his government 
would ask that the un trade embargo be widened to include air 
traffic to iraq and punishment of countries violating the blockade 
the iraqi government denied it raided any diplomatic homes or 
buildings in kuwait iraq has annexed kuwait and withdrawn the 
diplomatic privileges and immunity of embassies there ordering 
them to move to baghdad 
an iraqi spokesman said there were strict instructions against 
entering foreign missions although they had not been regarded as 
diplomatic territory since aug 24 according to the iraqi news 
agency 
the iraqi government now calls kuwait a province of iraq and 
says the 1961 vienna conventions on diplomatic and consular 
relations do not apply 
the council already has said that force may be used to implement 
the sweeping un trade embargo against iraq in terms of maritime 
shipping but an air embargo although included in the general un 
sanctions is difficult to implement because forcing planes down 
involves military risk and could mean attack diplomats said 
an air embargo also would require cooperation of all of iraqs 
neighbors 
in addition the diplomats said drafting the language for such 
a blockade would be timeconsuming and was unlikely to be supported 
by the soviet union china and some third world nations 
iraq has rejected all six previous security council resolutions 
condemning iraqs aug 2 invasion and occupation of kuwait 
the members of the security council are britain canada china 
colombia cuba ethiopia finland france ivory coast malaysia 
romania the soviet union the united states yemen and zaire

diplomatic compounds of france canada and belgium in occupied 
kuwait city the troops briefly detained five western consuls 
including an american and captured four french citizens only one

situation will lead to 
but it reported later that iraqi president saddam hussein would 
allow elderly and ailing frenchmen banned from leaving kuwait and 
iraq to depart on monday

algerian president ahmed ben bella who met the iraqi leader 
saturday in baghdad ina said 
french officials said they had no official confirmation of the 
report

a 20monthold boy was removed safely from a 
narrow 12footdeep foundation hole in a remodeling project at his 
parents home sunday morning ending a 14hour ordeal 
oxygen was pumped into the narrow shaft during the overnight 
operation to rescue kevin davis while teams from four metropolitan 
fire departments dug a parallel rescue shaft and then tunneled some 
five feet to the trapped child 
kevin son of tom and lisa davis was asleep when denver fireman 
joe cipri finally broke through and saw his face 
when i went and grabbed his hand he actually helped himself 
out of the hole the smiling cipri said shortly after the 6 am 
rescue 
the youngster was admitted to denver general hospital in fair 
condition dr jack row said he was alert and responded very 
well and normally to his parents row said 
firefighter kevin duncan was in the rescue tunnel with cipri and 
did the final delicate cutting away of the dirt to avoid a 
cavein he said kevin was in pretty good shape he fell asleep 
he was pretty much out of it still in a daze 
firemen strapped kevin into a splintlike device that cradled 
the childs head neck and upper body as they extricated him from 
the narrow shaft 
the rescuers hooted and yelled with joy as the boy emerged 
the little blonde boy with a dirtsmudged face was blinking and 
calm when placed on a gurney and wheeled to a waiting ambulance a 
police motorcycle escort then led the ambulance to the hospital 
the toddler fell into the 18inch wide hole about 4 pm 
saturday at an addition being built at his parents home 
policeman wc hoffman said shortly before 1 am that heavy 
equipment called a vachoe which works off compressed air and 
vacuums out the loose dirt had finished the rescue vertical shaft 
some 5 feet from the exhausted toddler and was drilling across to 
the child 
the excavating machine worked until about eight inches from the 
boy the final breakthrough was done slowly by hand trowels 
the incident was reminiscent of the october 1987 ordeal of 
jessica mcclure the toddler who spent 58 hours in a well in 
midland texas the arduous effort to free her gripped the nation 
and her final emergence safe in the arms of rescue workers was 
televised nationally

david h souter described by one senator 
early in his supreme court confirmation hearings as the stealth 
nominee is not the same mystery man he may have been to many 
americans just days ago 
his two days of nationally televised testimony before the senate 
judiciary committee yielded significant insights into souter the 
man and souter the judge 
everyone was not satisfied with his answers especially his 
reluctance to detail his views on abortion but at least something 
was learned of this new hampshire judge who was virtually unknown 
outside his home state when he was tapped by president bush in 
july 
perhaps more will be learned monday souters 51st birthday 
when he returns for a third day of answering senators questions 
heres some of what has been learned so far 
souter says he gave the bush administration no assurances about 
how he would vote on any case including one involving abortion 
rights and he says he has not made up his mind about how he might 
vote if the court were asked to overturn its 1973 decision in roe 
vs wade legalizing abortion 
he believes the constitution provides a general right of 
privacy even though such a right is not specifically mentioned and 
that the right extends to married womens use of contraceptives 
he thinks constitutional provisions should not be interpreted 
to mean only what their framers intended but what they mean in 
todays world that separates him from those conservatives who 
espouse an original intent approach 
he disagrees with justice antonin scalia the high courts most 
conservative member about how judges should search out american 
tradition in determining some forms of constitutional protection 
in a recent decision scalia said the father of a child born out 
of wedlock is not entitled to certain parental rights because those 
rights previously had been recognized only for married people 
souter said he found that reasoning too confining 
he never heard his parents refer to another human being in 
racial or ethnic terms i am glad i am conditioned by my 
beginnings and i am glad i do not have to overcome them souter 
told the committee 
he is not unflappable questioned by sen edward kennedy 
dmass near the end of fridays session souter for the first 
time began answering before his interrogator had finished speaking 
and he gave an answer that could have been interpreted as 
callous when asked about a quote attributed to him that letting 
illiterate people vote dilutes the votes of those people who can 
read he answered kennedy by stating thats kind of a 
statement of math 
he doesnt think the supreme court should stick its nose into 
matters where it has no constitutional responsibility to act but 
believes the court sometimes is left to act alone when the 
political branches do not act beforehand 
he applauds one such example the courts 1954 decision 
outlawing the racial segregation of americas public schools 
he does not object when called a conservative judge and thinks 
judges have to guard against using their positions of power to 
impose purely personal viewpoints 
he is aware that in these televised hearings he is speaking 
to the american public as well as to 14 committee members souter 
at one point told joseph biden the delaware democrat who chairs 
the committee that an explanation was intended for those not as 
familiar with the subject at hand 
souter is a wellprepared attentive and respectful witness who 
on occasion shows flashes of a dry wit his oftenlengthy oral 
answers delivered in a yankee accent that makes miranda 
mirander and law lawr are well organized and impeccably 
grammatical 
a lifelong bachelor he has tried hard to tell the committee of 
the various life experiences that have shaped his view of the 
world the message he and his white house helpers want sent i am 
not a hermit or an isolated scholar 
it appears the judiciary committee has conceded the point and 
may be on the verge of conceding souters confirmation 
 
editors note richard carelli has covered the supreme court 
for the associated press since 1976

incomes decreased in third world countries 
last year but in places that did report increases the rise was 
smaller than the year before the world bank reported 
the banks annual report made public sunday also complained 
that military spending in the third world has risen more than twice 
as fast as peoples incomes and offered to help governments to curb 
it no figures were given on military expenditures 
the bank concentraes on what it calls low and middleincome 
countries that includes most of the world 92 countries with 39 
billion people ranging in prosperity from oman where citizens had 
an average income of 5070 in 1988 to ethiopia with an average of 
only 120 it gave the average us income for the year as 19780 
the bank found incomes a little lower last year in 19 heavily 
indebted countries from poland to the philippines 1 of 1 
percent in latin america and the caribbean the decline was 6 of 1 
percent and 7 of 1 percent in a mixed bag of 22 countries in 
europe the middle east and north africa 
africa south of the sahara showed a small improvement 3 of 1 
percent after a steady decline through the 1980s there were 
larger increases in south asia 25 percent and in east asia 
32 percent but these increases had been considerably greater 
earlier in the decade 
to help the bank management headed by president barber b 
conable is hoping to lend 21 billion to 24 billion in the 12 
months to june 30 1991 he has promised new emphasis on loans to 
reduce poverty and to improve the environment 
the report did not accuse any specific country of spending too 
much on its military forces but it contained some specific advice 
on military matters its leaders once considered the subject taboo 
the old line was that the 151 governments who own the bank had to 
decide on military matters themselves 
this report said spending on the military could be considered 
unproductive in general and was sometimes especially expensive for 
poor countries 
many countries with very low individual incomes devote a 
sizeable share of their government budget to defense despite the 
fact that there are many pressing needs in other sectors of the 
economy it said 
military expenditure has increased more than twice as fast 
as income in the developing world since 1960 the report 
concluded 
it said that as the world situation changes governments will 
have to take a new look at their spending to improve the welfare of 
their citizens that will include making it clear how much they 
have been spending on the military and how effective the spending 
has been compared with investment in education and health it 
suggested 
as the worlds biggest lending agency and the biggest single 
source of aid money the bank has great influence with borrowing 
governments last year it lent money to 79 of them from algeria to 
zimbabwe of those 47 got loans that pay almost no interest and 
requires small installments over 40 years 
conable submitted the report aug 7 five days after iraqi 
troops went into kuwait it covered events only up to june 30 and 
did not mention the invasion 
but at a news conference last week alex shakow the banks 
director of external affairs said the gulf crisis should not be 
used as an excuse for military spending and that the bank was not 
giving up on the principle 
the united states owns the biggest block of shares in the bank 
the banks management approved 20702 billion in loans and made 
1046 billion in profit over the 12 months up to last july 1 in 
the previous year 214 billion worth of loans were approved

bush pulled a paper from his pocket and quoted the iraqi 
presidents own words in a nov 28 1988 speech saying an arab 
country does not have the right to occupy another arab country 
if iraq invaded another arab nation we would want arabs to 
send their armies to put things right if iraq should become 
intoxicated by its power and move to overwhelm another arab state 
the arabs would be right to deploy their armies to check it bush 
said 
bush taped his eightminute address last wednesday after an 
iraqi information minister suggested he would be given time on the 
countrys television network as saddam hussein has been by 
american television 
the tape including a voiceover translation and captions in 
arabic was ferried by a state department courier to baghdad and 
turned over to the government there by the us charges daffaires 
the iraqi ambassador in washington had declined to take 
possession of it on thursday but assured deputy secretary of state 
lawrence eagleburger it would be shown in full on iraqi television 
once it reached baghdad 
the bush broadcast was followed immediately by an even longer 
response read by saddams spokesman calling it full of lies the 
iraqi spokesman said bush was trying to become the dictator of 
the whole world 
in his tape bush said he did not want to trade accusations but 
explain to iraqs people why the world was united in opposition to 
iraqs aug 2 invasion and occupation of kuwait 
he portrayed the invasion as yet another mistake by the same 
leaders who plunged iraq into war with iran in 1980 
youve borne untold suffering and hardship during eight long 
years of war with iran bush said

when sgt maj william weston joined the 
alabama national guard more than 27 years ago it seemed as natural 
as waving the american flag 
i lived in a small town that was very much guardoriented 
said weston a native of brundidge population 3200 at the time 
i joined my uncle was the company commander it was the thing to 
do back then 
as the nations guard and reserves play a major role in 
americas military response to the mideast crisis the callup is 
hitting home 
alabama with a population of about 4 million has the largest 
army national guard of any state with 21700 members sgt norman 
arnold a guard spokesman said the next largest state force is 
texas with 21400 followed by california with 21200 the two 
states both trail alabama even though texas has more than four 
times as many residents and california more than seven times 
according to preliminary 1990 census figures 
there also are 3200 members of the alabama air national guard 
making the total strength almost 25000 men and women arnold said 
about 900 members from several alabama army guard and air guard 
units have been activated since iraq invaded kuwait aug 2 but the 
only alabama guardsmen sent to saudi arabia so far are about 90 
members of the 1241st postal ag company from montgomery 
weston who has been a member of the 31st area support group in 
montgomery since 1972 recalls how prominent the guard was and 
still is in small towns like brundidge about 60 miles south of 
alabamas capital city 
in many cases the national guard armory is the center of 
town he said where dances reunions and proms are held in 
the small towns were the only military 
guardsmen usually sign up for sixyear hitches and many 
reenlist weston estimated that at least half of the soldiers in 
the 31st group have more than 20 years of service 
the day i joined up there was six of us we were all 
schoolmates we joined and went off to basic training together 
he said of the six who joined with me i know at least three of 
them are still in the guard 
they go through basic training along with regular soldiers then 
join the unit of their choice perhaps in their hometown or one 
that specializes in a skill that will be useful in the civilian 
world after that guardsmen are required to participate in a 
15day training session each year in addition to one weekend of 
duty each month 
its more tradition than anything else said col kenneth a 
blackmon commander of the 31st we have a lot of fathers and 
sons ive got two sons in the national guard as soon as they were 
of age they joined up 
in blackmons case the guard helped pay for his sons to attend 
college a luxury for many families in a state that ranks 43rd in 
per capita income also the guard provide job training in 
everything from electronics to truck driving 
this is the first mobilization of the alabama guard for military 
duty since 1968 but guardsmen are more than just fighting men and 
women they provided security and cleanup assistance after 
floodwaters ravaged the south alabama town of elba in march and 
they were there when a killer tornado plowed through huntsville in 
december 
during the 1960s guardsmen also were used to quell racial 
disturbances that erupted in many locales despite the outspoken 
segregationist stand of thengov george c wallace president 
kennedy called up the alabama guard in 1963 to protect two blacks 
who broke the color line at the previously allwhite university of 
alabama 
lt cindy eskridge who graduated from officer candidate school 
in august said she and others support president bushs decision to 
send troops to the middle east after iraqi dictator saddam hussein 
ordered the takeover of neighboring kuwait 
we wouldnt want someone to do to us what he did to kuwait 
she said 
other southern states also have large guard contingents 
alabamas neighbors florida mississippi georgia and tennessee 
are at 100 percent or more of their assigned strength arnold said 
if you look at those states that have done well in their 
recruiting efforts for guard units it will run on a line from 
virginia through the carolinas right along the deep south arnold 
said patriotism is still alive and well in alabama and all 
across the deep south 
in ms eskridges case she was bouncing around not knowing 
what i wanted to do when she signed up four years ago but her 
decision ran deeper than that 
it was a patriotic thing a love of country that had a lot to 
do with it too said ms eskridge its not just a paycheck 
its part of serving your country

the suez canal one of egypts main sources 
of badly needed hard currency is expected to lose 10 percent of 
its revenues this year as a result of the un blockade of iraq an 
official said sunday 
mohammed izzat adel chairman of the suez canal authority told 
the stateowned middleeast news agency that before the embargo was 
imposed in august iraq and kuwait accounted for the annual export 
of seven million tons of oil through the canal 
their imports through the international waterway were also 
halted as a result of the embargo imposed after iraq invaded 
kuwait aug 2 
adel said the expected decline in revenue was also due to the 
dwindling volume of trade between other persian gulf countries and 
western europe due to the crisis he said that volume of trade 
about 40 million tons annually may fall by 25 percent

a man visiting a retirement expo spotted 
what looked like a tray of free samples of potato chips so he took 
one and started to chew and nearly broke myrtle youngs heart 
young 66 started a collection of potato chips that resemble 
famous people animals and objects when she was a chip inspector at 
seyferts foods inc she and her chips have appeared on late 
night with david letterman and the tonight show 
on saturday she had about 75 chips on display including one 
that looked like a perfect sand dollar 
there were quite a few people standing around and i was 
telling them about my chip collection she said this one man 
reached through quickly and took one 
i saw chips laying there as samples so i picked one up 
recalled gregory hough of fort wayne 
hough was quickly collared by a salesperson for seyferts and 
ordered to spit out what remained of the sand dollar chip 
he said the chip tasted stale young estimated it was 2 years 
old 
people will say its only a potato chip young said but 
mother nature makes these designs we go through 250000 pounds of 
potatoes in eight hours to find something like this is so rare 
her favorite chip resembles a certain skijumpnosed comedian 
boy i was so glad he did not grab bob hope said young i 
keep him in a box if he had grabbed him id probably be in the 
hospital 
as for the sand dollar it cannot be repaired she said but i 
still have the poor broken chip in a million pieces 
but at least young figures she got a story out of her loss 
i told him that on my tv appearances the next time they ask 
me if someone has ever eaten one of my chips im going to say yes 
and tell this story she said every time he sees a potato 
chip he is going to get a sinking feeling

theyve spent months defending 
nasas honor reassuring worried family members and waiting for 
space shuttles to fly again 
the men and women most affected by the summers shuttle delays 
the astronauts are disappointed and unhappy with the recurring 
fuel leaks but theyre confident nasa is handling the situation 
well another try at a shuttle launch is set for this week 
the folks in the office understand that nothing is 100 percent 
and that theres a risk involved since the challenger accident i 
think weve made great strides in reducing the risk said dan 
brandenstein 47 chief of the astronaut office 
the mood around astronaut headquarters at johnson space center 
in houston comes nowhere close to matching the despair that 
followed the challenger explosion on jan 28 1986 which killed 
all seven on board twelve astronauts left that year an 
unprecedented number 
still its the toughest time for the 82member corps since 
flights resumed two years ago this month two of nasas three 
shuttles are grounded by hydrogen leaks and the flight schedule is 
in disarray a shuttle has not flown since april 
its one thing if you have one mission that you had to delay 
or cancel because of a leak but weve got several problems stacked 
up on top of each other said bruce melnick 40 he is scheduled 
to fly next month on discovery the only shuttle in which fuel 
leaks had not been found 
the national aeronautics and space administration hopes to 
prevent further schedule havoc by launching columbia on tuesday 
the countdown got under way saturday and was proceeding normally 
sunday nasa said 
it will be the fourth launch attempt for the astronomy mission 
considered by many astronauts to be snakebitten and part of 
nasas bout of bad luck 
at the same time nasa has endured a searing stream of criticism 
from congress and the rest of america for sending up a flawed 
hubble space telescope in april on the last shuttle flight 
for the astronauts the verbal assaults hurt 
nobody likes to work for an agency that you give your heart 
for and then wake up with all this negative publicity said dick 
richards 44 commander of discoverys upcoming mission 
there are some things that are screwups and there are some 
things that you might call an act of god said astronaut story 
musgrave 55 its the space business and its the technology 
that technology as it involves leaking hydrogen has been a 
main topic of conversation at the astronauts regular monday 
morning meetings since the leaks first were detected in late may 
columbias sevenman crew in particular has been teased about 
the flight delays astronaut superstition holds that having an 
astronomer on board is an open invitation to scrubbed launches 
this crew has four astronomers 
see it all fits brandenstein said laughing 
the standdown has been especially frustrating for the younger 
astronauts not yet assigned flights the longer the delays the 
longer it will be before they fly 
were all trained and were ready to go but we need to get 
the missions flying for us to get the opportunity to go said 
andy allen 35 a member of the class of 1987 
the astronauts concern goes beyond missed flights hydrogen is 
highly combustible and if it leaked during liftoff could cause an 
explosion 
when it comes down to tminuszero and the engines are running 
and the solid rockets are burning and youre inside that thing you 
want to make sure everythings in perfect condition said bruce 
mccandless 53 who is retiring after 24 years as an astronaut 
so far no one has complained to brandenstein about the delays 
or demanded explanations id have a lot of people in my office 
if we had this leak and they said well its not a big leak go 
launch it he said 
before the challenger accident that well may have happened 
richards said now the conservatism is there he said 
still being an astronaut means accepting risks and the fact 
that somewhere down the road theres probably another 
accident brandenstein said 
obviously were working our fannies off trying to prevent 
that and make sure it doesnt happen he said but youve got 
to be a realist theres probably one out there somewhere

iraqi president saddam hussein is having a 
hard time persuading most of his arab brothers that they should 
unite under his leadership in a holy war against foreign invaders 
only in jordan the israelioccupied territories and to a 
lesser degree algeria and yemen has saddam found receptive 
audiences 
elsewhere the distaste for us and other foreign troops facing 
saddams forces along saudi arabias northern border with kuwait is 
offset by an almost universal aversion to iraq 
saddam so far has been unable to touch the arab nerve that would 
bring into play the egyptian proverb my brother and me against 
my cousin my cousin and me against the stranger 
in a supreme insult countries of the gulf cooperation council 
who saw member kuwait fall to iraqi tanks are treating iraq as 
they do israel its radio and television broadcasts are jammed 
on aug 2 president hosni mubarak turned overnight from one of 
saddams closest friends into his toughest arab enemy now it is 
difficult to hear a kind word for saddam anywhere in cairo 
last week authorities invoked regulations requiring iraqi 
citizens as well as palestinians jordanians and yemenis to 
obtain visas before coming to egypt 
the restrictions also apply to kuwaitis but a senior security 
officer said that was only to ensure iraq would not sneak in agents 
posing as kuwaitis 
also last week egypts 20man diplomatic staff left kuwait for 
baghdad but never made it back to cairo authorities at cairo 
international airport then briefly detained seven iraqi embassy 
employees and their families trying to make their way home 
and on saturday egyptian authorities refused to let a leading 
leftwing politician and two leftist journalists go to jordan to 
attend a prosaddam conference 
unity should never be achieved by force said mohamed said 
saeed of cairos alahram center for political and strategic 
studies we all know that the strength of arabs should lie in 
their unity but no one i think would accept as leader someone 
who uses mustard gas against the kurds in iraq 
if he treats them this way how would he treat us he said 
although no one in cairo has expressed support for the iraqi 
takeover of its oilwealthy neighbor many are opposed to the 
presence of foreign troops in the gulf region 
on the day the leftist politician ibrahim shukry of the labor 
party was barred from leaving adel hussein editor of the party 
newspaper alshaab wrote 
the deployment of foreign forces was essentially an american 
decision even if saudi arabia had refused to let these forces 
come they would have come anyway killing whoever stood in the 
way 
havent you learned a lesson from former president anwar 
sadats experience with us aid the first time they gave us aid 
to make peace with israel today they offer aid to strike iraq 
that was as close as any egyptians have come to publicly 
supporting the iraqis it is often coupled with anger that the 
united states opposes iraqs occupation of kuwait but acquiesces in 
israels occupation of the west bank and gaza 
but it comes sidebyside with denunciations of saddam 
saddams act is shameful and immoral said saad eldin 
ibrahim sociology professor at the american university in cairo 
nevertheless he said there is a deep sense of anger and 
frustration among the arabs toward the americans they have double 
standards in their relationship with the arabs and israel

a notsofunny thing happened to bill 
richardson on the way to reelection he was jeered at a parade in 
his new mexico district 
the incident occurred a few weeks ago during a procession in 
taos normally the democratic congressman said he gets thunderous 
cheers at such events this time i got some catcalls on the 
savings and loan issue he recalled people were not as warm 
and as positive just in general 
for richardson whose reelection is not in doubt the incident 
was a concrete example of what pollsters and political analysts say 
is a widespread disaffection among american voters this election 
season 
for now the malaise has been pushed into the background by a 
preoccupation with the persian gulf crisis on the part of 
politicians the news media and the public but it has not gone 
away according to political professionals 
the feeling sweeps across the entire political landscape they 
say reflecting a general cynicism about the ability of government 
local state or federal to confront and solve the countrys 
problems 
were it not for the distraction of the gulf crisis that would 
bode ill for incumbents at all levels in the nov 6 elections at 
best the situation makes for a volatility and unpredictability not 
seen in years the analysts said 
house incumbents whose reelection rates have been as high as 
98 percent recently still have a formidable advantage over 
challengers members of congress have at their disposal 
taxpayerfinanced mail privileges a staff to help solve 
constituents problems ready access to news coverage and an 
overwhelming advantage in raising money 
but at the national republican congressional committee the 
partys washingtonbased house campaign apparatus polls show a 
steady erosion over the past two years in the job approval ratings 
of democratic and republican incumbents said spokesman gary koops 
and lawmakers who have been home recently are feeling the heat 
in a much less academic way 
the american people are mad as hell says rep mickey 
edwards rokla 
it is real people are angry that congress isnt doing 
anything he said noting the savings and loan crisis the 
failure to oversee housing programs that helped lead to the hud 
scandal and the rampant federal budget deficit 
go to any town meeting republicans are mad democrats are 
mad edwards said 
to edwards list of issues political analyst charles cook adds 
a litany of additional sore points the congressional pay raise 
the proliferation of specialinterest money in politics and the 
procession of ethics cases on capitol hill 
the frustration voters have is we have some serious 
problems we elected you to do something and youre not doing 
anything it goes beyond just washington said nrcc chief ed 
rollins but he said it is too early to say whether the malaise 
will build to the level of 1980 when several prominent incumbent 
senators were defeated 
so far this year only one incumbent house member has been 
defeated in the primary elections and that was ohio republican 
donald buz lukens who ran for reelection after being 
convicted of having sex with a teenage girl 
but one indication of voter discontent is what promoters claim 
is the increased popularity of moves to limit the terms of state 
and national lawmakers three states oklahoma colorado and 
california have ballot initiatives this year to curb the length 
of time legislators can serve 
terry considine a colorado state senator who is pushing the 
initiative in his state said the disgust with government is 
helping his campaign 
theres a great sense that american government doesnt work 
very well he said johnny carson can get a laugh by saying 
well just let the post office handle that 
political operatives in 16 other states have contacted him to 
ask how to mount termlimitation initiatives of their own 
considine said 
people are saying it doesnt matter who we elect we cant 
change what happens the system is broke 
a nationwide poll in late august by market opinion research a 
gop polling firm found that perceptions and expectations of the 
economy had plummeted and that fortunes of incumbents had fallen 
as well amounting to an antiincumbent undertow 
in 1000 interviews with registered voters 44 percent said 
their representative was more concerned about getting reelected 
than about solving the countrys problems compared with 41 percent 
who said their lawmaker was working seriously to solve problems 
the margin of error was plus or minus 32 percentage points 
richardson said the crisis in the middle east has even had a 
negative effect among voters who believe the government hasnt done 
enough to insulate them from higher fuel prices now i think you 
will find a high turnout of mad voters at the polls he said 
added considine i dont think disenchantment with incumbency 
is a shortterm or temporary phenomenon

planners at washingtons national airport are 
saddled with what could be a multimilliondollar blind spot in 
their designs for a new terminal building 
the master plan for the 200 million terminal it was recently 
revealed contains a fundamental flaw one of the terminals wings 
will block the control towers line of sight to part of a runway 
airport codes require that the tower must have an unobstructed 
view of all runways 
james a wilding general manager of the metropolitan washington 
airports authority said his office has been aware of the problem 
for several years and believed it could be handled with minimal 
adjustments 
he said the ruckus only began in recent months when people 
seized on the design defect to urge major alterations in the master 
plan that would add up to 100 million to the cost of the project 
wilding acknowledges however that some members of the 
authoritys board of directors were unaware until recently of the 
obscured runway issue obviously there was a communication 
problem 
after several weeks of discussions the authority is leaning 
toward relocating the control tower a solution that will boost the 
price tag for the 735 million renovation project by only 15 
million or 20 million and not seriously affect the scheduled 1994 
completion date 
authority spokesman david hess said focus turned to the blind 
spot this spring when the design team led by wellknown architect 
cesar pelli started working out details for the 35gate terminal 
wilding thought the dilemma was solvable by repositioning or 
lowering the height of the most northerly finger of the terminal 
but some members of the board reportedly were concerned the low 
ceilings would be aesthetically unacceptable and the airlines 
balked at changes in carefully workedout gate assignments 
the carriers were not in favor of that option because it 
doesnt provide equal accessibility to all said dick deitos 
executive director of the metropolitan washington airlines 
committee deitos said his organization which represents the 
airlines at national airport learned of the lineofsight problem 
about a year ago 
that was far earlier than for some members of the authoritys 
board 
i do not recall it being raised said carrington williams 
one of 11 board members and chairman of the authoritys planning 
committee i was surprised at the magnitude of the problem when 
it was brought to our attention three or four months ago 
one outgrowth of that revelation was a proposal that the entire 
terminal be relocated farther to the west away from the runways 
an advantage would be that the existing metro railway station 
could then be included in the terminal building rather than 
connected by an enclosed pedestrian walkway as planned 
on the debit side such a move would mean a twotothreeyear 
delay in completion and an extra 100 million in cost the 
airlines would bear the brunt of it deitos said with much of 
the expense eventually passed on to consumers 
the board in late august killed the new terminal idea 
national one of the capitols two main airports along with 
dulles has been operating out of the same terminal for 49 years 
with nearly 16 million passengers a year and an average 37 flights 
landing or taking off every hour during the day no one questions 
the need for major renovation 
there was also general sympathy for the authoritys difficulty 
in trying to squeeze a new and larger terminal into only 90 acres 
of usable land between a highway and the potomac river 
in an airport as restricted as national youve got to expect 
some glitches and there probably will be more said the boards 
williams 
theres not much room to wiggle deitos said 
wilding said redesign of the northern finger and relocation of a 
taxiway on the affected runway are still being considered but the 
final decision expected in two or three months appears moving 
solidly toward either relocating the control tower or raising the 
height of the existing tower on the old terminal 
even that would have to gain the approval of the federal 
aviation administration and the national capital planning 
commission which oversees any alteration of washingtons

you might expect comedians to 
make jokes about lawyers but would you believe a us supreme 
court justice even if he was partly serious 
the problem with lawyers is they tend to make law far more 
serious and somber and unintelligible than it really is said 
supreme court justice antonin scalia he was in town friday to 
speak to the 92nd annual convention of the colorado bar 
association 
scalia lectured them on the art of writing legal briefs 
briefs he said are a subject full of paradoxes not the 
least of which is in the name brief these things are 50 
pages long 
the legal term for the written arguments he said has its 
origin in the ancient saxon word braf and another ancient 
word with the same letters arranged slightly differently that 
means roughly translated to go on and on at great length until it 
makes you sick 
a brief he said has two parts a summary of arguments and 
the arguments judges read the summaries he said so they should 
be written in english the rest can be in legal english 
normal english will not do he said 
he said it is essential to legal english that one write as 
pompously as possible using words and phrases that have long since 
disappeared from normal english discourse

president bushs message to the iraqi 
people was full of lies and contradictions and a thundering 
rage is building up against the united states in the arab world 
an iraqi tv commentator said sunday 
mikdad morad the announcer who normally reads statements from 
president saddam hussein also warned bush that a showdown in the 
gulf will end in a catastrophe for us forces 
bushs message is full of lies and contradictions morad 
said he spoke immediately after bushs taped message was broadcast 
on iraqi tv 
bush in his message told the iraqis iraq stands isolated 
and alone 
saddam hussein tells you that this crisis is a struggle 
between iraq and america in fact it is iraq against the world 
said bush standing in front of his oval office desk with a us 
flag behind him iraq finds itself on the brink of war 
but he said war is not inevitable it is still possible to 
bring this crisis to a peaceful end 
morad reading from a prepared text responded 
should war be imposed on us the iraqi people will not 
hesitate in joining to teach the aggressor an important leasson 
which neither they nor their allies and agents will ever forget 
your aggression morad told bush will end in a 
catastrophe for your forces 
morad a familiar face on iraqi television who was the only 
spokesman authorized to release military communiques during the 
eight years of war with iran ridiculed bushs references to human 
rights and international law 
contemporary history has not witnessed worse violations of 
international law than those committed by the united states and its 
ally israel he said 
it is enough to recall that the united states has used more 
than 60 times the veto to knock down resolutions against israel at 
the un security council he said reapeating arab criticism 
that the united states applies double standards in dealing with the 
invasion of kuwait and the israeli occupation of arab territories 
morad said bush was shedding crocodile tears for foreigners 
banned from traveling out of iraq and kuwait after saddams aug 2 
invasion and subsequent annexation of kuwait 
they want to leave because of the embargo imposed by the 
united states morad said 
he said bush went crazy after iraq entered kuwait because 
he feared his oil interests were jeopardized and not out of 
concern for the former kuwaiti leaders because he knows from what 
rotten background these croesuses were molded 
croesus was a 6thcentury bc king famous for his great wealth 
and his debauchery 
morad said bush was naive when he tried to separate the people 
of iraq from their leader 
our leader is the peoples son morad said this attempt 
reflects bushs despair 
he said the conflict is not at all as bush says one between 
iraq and the united states it is one between the united states and 
the iraqis arabs moslems and all the sincere people of the world 
it is a conflict between right and injustice between obscene 
wealth and oppressed people between imperialismzionism and the 
deprived people 
it is thundering rage in the moslem and islamic world against 
the united states he said

ramon salcido admits he shot stabbed and 
slashed his wife two young daughters and four other people to 
death in a rampage that terrified the peaceful northern california 
wine country 
prosecutors say salcido should die for his crimes but the 
defense says the 29yearold winery worker was in a psychotic 
depression high on drugs and alcohol and legally incapable of 
firstdegree murder 
opening statements in salcidos trial are set for monday 17 
months after the grisly slayings touched off a frantic search that 
ended with his arrest in his native mexico 
two survivors are among the witnesses expected to testify in the 
case in san mateo county superior court because of intensive news 
coverage the case was transferred from sonoma county where the 
crimes occurred 
i think that we have a straightforward case of seven counts of 
firstdegree murder that a man set out to and did kill seven 
people and tried to kill three others peter bumerts chief 
deputy district attorney in sonoma county said in a telephone 
interview 
the prosecution will rely chiefly on salcido himself bumerts 
said the jury will hear his taped confession to detectives in 
which he describes the april 14 1989 killings in detail 
i think that statement indicates his premeditation and 
deliberation and that these were coldly calculated crimes he 
says 
defense lawyer marteen miller said he will concede salcido 
killed seven people but the slayings he insists were not 
firstdegree murder because salcido could not have planned and 
willfully carried out the crimes 
his whole world had fallen completely apart miller said 
salcido infected with pride of almost psychotic proportions 
was about to lose his job and his wife who had found out about a 
previous marriage he never bothered to end or tell her about 
he just went into a psychotic depression and on top of 
that he became intoxicated and was using cocaine all this was 
manifest in this crazy bizarre and terrible tragedy miller 
says 
salcido is charged with fatally shooting his wife angela 24 
in the couples boyes hot springs duplex and cutting the throats of 
their three daughters and leaving them for dead at a county dump 
sofia 4 and teresa 22 months died carmina then 2 survived 
telling detectives dad hurt me 
he also is accused of fatally stabbing his motherinlaw marian 
richards 47 and her 12yearold daughter ruth in their cotati 
home killing another richards daughter 8yearold marie by 
cutting her throat and shooting to death tracey toovey 35 a 
coworker at the grand cru winery in glen ellen 
in addition to being charged with seven murders salcido is 
being tried for attempted murder in the the attack on carmina the 
shooting of coworker kenneth butti who was wounded in the 
shoulder and the alleged attempt to shoot buttis wife terri the 
buttis are among the prosecutions witnesses carmina will not 
appear bumerts said 
salcido told investigators who brought him back from mexico 
within a week of the slayings that angela salcido told him their 
oldest daughter was not his he also said that on the night before 
the killings the couple quarreled because he had been ordered to 
pay child support to a daughter of his first wife mrs salcido 
left the house after the argument 
he said he then snorted three grams of cocaine and drank 
champagne before driving his daughters around looking for his wife 
and deciding to kill his family 
a note in spanish was found in salcidos abandoned car saying 
forgive me god but this law made me do it we could live better 
me and my children but what can i do

jury selection is expected to begin 
monday in the case of a paroled child killer charged with the 
serial slayings of 11 women over the past 2 years 
arthur j shawcross 45 is charged with murdering 10 women in 
monroe county in western new york he faces a later trial in 
neighboring wayne county on an 11th murder charge 
the victims mostly prostitutes or heavy drug users were found 
dead from march 1988 to january 1990 most had been strangled or 
suffocated and their bodies dumped near water 
authorities have said shawcross confessed to the slayings 
following his arreest jan 4 after state police spotted him sitting 
near a frozen body 
at the time of the killings shawcross was on parole from an 
earlier conviction he had served 15 years in prison for the 1972 
strangling of an 8yearold girl and had confessed to killing a 
10yearold boy 
shawcross was never tried for the boys death and was allowed 
to plead guilty to a manslaughter charge in the girls slaying 
although shawcross had nearly completed his sentence when he was 
paroled his capture set off a heated debate over the effectiveness 
of new yorks parole system 
defense attorneys david murante and thomas j cocuzzi have said

tens of thousands of demonstrators marched to the 
kremlin sunday demanding that president mikhail s gorbachev and 
his prime minister resign to take responsibility for the countrys 
deepening economic crisis 
the economy is a disaster read banners carried by the 
crowd which gathered under heavy rain at gorky park crossed the 
moscow river and then headed for central moscow where they 
listened to speeches just outside red square 
the crowd of about 50000 followed the same path taken by 
demonstrators earlier this year many marchers carried white blue 
and red russian flags from the prebolshevik era and they shouted 
gorbachev resign ryzhkov resign 
participants in rallies in may and july called for the removal 
of prime minister nikolai ryzhkov and the leadership in general 
but the demand that gorbachev step down was new 
ryzhkov and gorbachev support different economic programs the 
prime minister favors a more conservative approach to reform while 
gorbachev has thrown his support behind much of a radical blueprint 
for swift and dramatic reform supported by legislators from the 
russian republic 
gorbachev however has been criticized for not implementing 
market reforms sooner soviets face shortages of food and many 
other products store shelves are bare 
sundays rally came a day after a leading reformer moscow mayor 
gavriil popov said on national television that ryzhkovs cabinet 
should step aside for a government trusted by the people the 15 
soviet republics and foreign nations 
popov said ryzhkov had no real plan for reforming the economy 
ryzhkov who appeared in a separate tv program saturday night 
defended his plan for moderate economic reform and said we will 
stop at nothing to implement it 
ryzhkov and popov were interviewed briefly on the evening news 
program vremya with longer versions played later on separate 
channels 
popov who quit the communist party in july and favors the plan 
for radical economic reform drawn up by economist stanislav 
shatalin said the government did not have does not have and 
does not want to have any real plan for a transition to the genuine 
market 
he said ryzkhovs government was responsible for the deplorable 
state of the soviet economy the lack of consumer goods and a 
growing deficit 
we are sick and tired of empty shops and devalued money we 
want no more crises popov said 
shatalins plan approved by russian legislators calls for 
transferring most economic authority from the national government 
to the republics who then could move independently toward market 
economies 
ryzhkovs plan calls for keeping central control over the 
economy through 1991 and a much slower transition to a 
marketbased economy 
the rally also came two days after a constitutional committee 
ruled against a decree to give the soviet government rather than 
the moscow government headed by popov the authority to allow or 
ban rallies in the center of the soviet capital gobachev issued 
the decree in april 
the official tass news agency said the constitutional compliance 
committee ruled gorbachevs decree unconstitutional because it 
narrowed the powers of the russian republic of which moscow 
is the capital and the city council headed by popov 
the may and july rallies were slightly larger than sundays 
protest

a senior iranian delegation arrived in 
iraq sunday a sign of the growing rapprochement between the two 
longtime foes that could help baghdad get around un sanctions 
the iranian delegation was led by manushahr mutaqi the deputy 
foreign minister for international relations the official iraqi 
news agency reported 
the agency monitored in nicosia cyprus quoted mutaqi as 
saying issues including prisonerofwar exchanges border matters 
and the reopening of embassies would be discussed 
the iranian visit follows last sundays groundbreaking visit to 
tehran by iraqs foreign minister and deputy prime minister tariq 
aziz the first highranking iraqi official to visit iran in more 
than a decade 
he was believed to have sought irans cooperation in 
circumventing the economic embargo imposed by the un security 
council 
in the wake of the aziz visit a source in the iranian capital 
said iran agreed to ship consignments of food and medicine to iraq 
as humanitarian aid in return for 200000 barrels of refined 
oil a day 
the tehran times daily newspaper which is close to the iranian 
government denied that last week but western and arab oil experts 
have said they believed such a deal had been made 
azizs visit was also aimed at negotating a formal treaty to end 
the iraniraq war a unsponsored ceasefire took hold in august 
1988 
the iraqi official also said after his visit that the two 
countries had agreed to revive full diplomatic ties essentially 
reopening the embassies in their capitals that were closed during 
the war 
irans relations with iraq have improved dramatically since 
iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 
iraqi president saddam hussein withdrew his troops from 
territory occupied in the closing stages of the iraniraq war the 
move freed up tens of thousands of iraqi troops for the 
confrontation with the us military buildup in saudi arabia 
the two sides have already repatriated thousands of prisoners of 
war and iraq agreed to share soverignty of the shattalarab 
waterway the southern border between the two states 
iran has criticized the invasion of kuwait but has also become 
increasingly vocal in its attacks on the us military deployment 
in saudi arabia 
by nature the presence of the united states in any part of 
the world will automatically create tension tehrans radical 
abrar daily said sunday the us presence in islamic lands will 
bring nothing for moslems but corruption and destruction 
also sunday 168 of the 270 members of irans majlis or 
parliament signed a document supporting ayatollah ali khameneis 
call last week for a holy war against the united states irans 
official islamic republic news agency said 
president hashemi rafsanjani also said any permanent stationing 
of us forces in the persian gulf region would be in no way 
acceptable the agency said

president bush warned the iraqi people in a 
television broadcast sunday they stand on the brink of war 
because saddam hussein misled his countrymen into invading kuwait 
bush in a taped message from the oval office said iraq 
stands isolated and alone 
saddam hussein tells you that this crisis is a struggle 
between iraq and america in fact it is iraq against the world 
said bush standing in front of his desk with the american flag 
behind him 
iraqi television broadcast the bush message sunday evening 
around 7 pm local time 11 am edt 
the white house had expressed skepticism beforehand that saddam 
would let his people hear bushs words but the iraqi president 
kept a promise to broadcast the taped message in prime time 
our embassy in iraq monitored this and it appears that it ran 
in its entirety said a white house spokesman sean walsh 
the eightminute broadcast was followed immediately by an even 
longer rejoinder from saddam read by a spokesman that met bushs 
words of warning with a mixture of ridicule disdain and defiance 
iraq finds itself on the brink of war bush said but war 
is not inevitable it is still possible to bring this crisis to a 
peaceful end 
bush pulled a paper from his pocket and quoted the iraqi 
presidents own words in a nov 28 1988 speech saying an arab 
country does not have the right to occupy another arab country 
if iraq invaded another arab nation we would want arabs to 
send their armies to put things right if iraq should become 
intoxicated by its power and move to overwhelm another arab state 
the arabs would be right to deploy their armies to check it bush 
quoted saddam 
iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 prompting the usled military 
buildup in the middle east and a united nationssanctioned economic 
embargo bush told the iraqi people saddam had misled them 
saddam hussein has told you that iraqi troops were invited 
into kuwait thats not true bush said your own returning 
soldiers will tell you the kuwaitis are fighting valiantly in any 
way they can 
bush taped his address last wednesday after an iraqi information 
minister suggested bush would be given time on the countrys 
television network as saddam hussein has been by american 
television 
the tape including a voiceover translation and captions in 
arabic was ferried by a state department courier to baghdad and 
turned over to the government there 
the iraqi ambassador in washington had declined to take 
possession of it thursday but assured deputy secretary of state 
lawrence eagleburger it would be shown in full on iraqi television 
once it reached baghdad 
the iraqi rebuttal called bushs remarks full of lies citing 
bushs call in a recent speech for a new world order the 
statement said bush fancied himself the dictator of the whole 
world 
bush was trying to fool the iraqi people with certain words 
it said 
it offered no reply to what bush called iraqs barbaric 
holding of foreign hostages in iraq and kuwait but it scoffed at 
bushs words about the shameful plight of foreign workers 
stranded as refugees on iraqs borders 
these workers left kuwait because of the us threats of 
war saddam said through the spokesman 
to bushs argument that the world was united against iraq the 
iraqi leader called it a dispute between right and wrong the 
struggle pits the united states and its allies against iraq 
and all arabs and all muslims and all believers in the whole 
world 
and it said bush was naive to think he could drive a wedge 
between the iraqi people and their president 
in his tape bush said he did not want to trade accusations but 
explain to iraqs people why the world was united in opposition to 
iraqs invasion 
he portrayed the invasion as yet another mistake by the same 
leaders who plunged iraq into war with iran in 1980 
youve borne untold suffering and hardship during eight long 
years of war with iran bush said once again the same iraqi 
leadership has miscalculated once again the iraqi people face 
tragedy 
the united nations sanctions against iraq are meant not to 
punish the iraqi people but as a peaceful means to convince your 
leadership to withdraw rom kuwait the decision is in the hands of 
saddam hussein 
no one not the american people not this president wants 
war but there are times when a country when all countries 
must stand against aggression bush said

the usled naval blockade of iraq is 
squeezing saddam hussein but the iraqi leader has shown no sign he 
intends to take on the western armada and shipping executives say 
he can survive without doing so 
there are almost as many warships in the persian gulf as the 60 
merchant ships that on average plow the strategic waterway each 
day and more warships are on their way 
since the un embargo was clamped on iraq aug 6 four days 
after it invaded kuwait the us navy has challenged nearly 1000 
vessels and boarded more than 40 
a merchant vessel is challenged every 1015 minutes either by 
warships naval helicopters or the three british nimrod maritime 
reconnaissance jets based in oman naval officials said 
shipping monitors report being overwhelmed by roundtheclock 
radio challenges to tankers and freighters 
only a handful of iraqi ships have sailed from umm qasr iraqs 
main port in the northern gulf since the embargo was imposed 
when challenged the iraqi vessels have backed down 
saddam hussein is smart said a gulfbased foreign shipping 
executive why should he risk provoking all that naval might and 
risk a military strike in which he loses kuwait when he can 
survive with kuwait in his hands hell sit tight 
earlier this month rear adm jerry l unruh commander of the 
us battle group led by the aircraft carrier independence 
patrolling the gulf of oman also said iraqi vessels were making no 
attempt to challenge the blockade 
baghdad he said seemed to be trying to wait out the crisis 
avoiding anything that could provoke us forces to take military 
action 
the un embargo has blocked all oil exports from iraq and 
occupied kuwait cutting off an estimated 4 million barrels a day 
saddam has introduced rationing on some foodstuffs baghdads 
trade ministry has halved monthly allowances of rice sugar and 
cooking oil 
but some experts believe iraq has food stocks that could last 
several months and neighboring iran is reported to have agreed to 
allow humanitarian food and medicine shipments across the 
border in return for 200000 barrels of free refined oil a day 
three loaded iraqi oil tankers the hittin and alqadissiyah 
both 150000 tons and the 35000ton rumaila are reported to be 
moored at umm qasr 
to get to the open sea they would first have to sneak past 
british and possibly french warships that patrol the northern end 
of the gulf american ships patrol the southern end around the 
strait of hormuz the only way in and out of the gulf 
this arrangement decided upon by western naval officers last 
week was apparently aimed at putting nonus warships in a 
position to challenge vessels leaving iraq thus stressing the 
multinational makeup of the armada 
the warships have been authorized by the united nations to use 
minimal force if iraqi ships resist challenges us officials have 
indicated their ships may shoot off the steering gear of any vessel 
that refuses to be inspected

about 500 environmentalists rallied at the 
capitol on sunday to protest congressional proposals they say would 
further eliminate the shrinking supply of the nations oldest 
forests 
the main group save americas forests voiced support for a 
proposal by rep jim jontz dind that would prohibit logging in 
a forest preserve covering as much as 8 million acres of oldgrowth 
and some secondgrowth forests 
the group opposes a more moderate forest protection bill by rep 
bruce vento dminn which last week passed the house interior 
subcommittee 
we are at a crossroads said mark winstein a spokesman for 
the group the timber industry lobby has a national agenda as 
they grab the wealth of public lands operating from a national 
power base in congress 
winstein said he spoke for more than 30 organizations 
representing nearly 150000 members in 18 states 
the demonstrators sang songs chanted slogans and toted banners 
calling for the preservation of forests and an end to clear 
cutting a practice used to harvest all the trees in a given area 
leaders also criticized mainstream environmental groups such as 
the sierra club and the national wildlife federation for failing 
to take strong enough stands in political fights over the 
northwests oldgrowth trees and the northern spotted owl 
they have a lot of muscle we are asking them to flex it 
winstein said 
loggers and industry officials from the pacific northwest 
scheduled their own rally for capitol hill on monday to voice 
opposition to proenvironmental legislation that would restrict 
logging and lock up huge tracts of oldgrowth forests to help save 
the spotted owl from extinction 
jackie lang state coordinator of the oregon lands coalition 
said about 200 industry workers and community leaders made the trip 
to help put faces on the unemployment figures used when 
discussing the cost of banning logging in northwest forests 
were here now because our backs are really against the 
wall lang said sunday while we have been out working for a 
living the radical environmentalists have been out working the 
system 
save americas forests advocates an end to logging all 
oldgrowth forests as well as a ban on clear cutting and road 
construction in national forests it also wants to include private 
lands in a new federal prohibition on exports of unprocessed logs 
from most public lands 
andy mahler president of indianas protect our woods said 
national environmental groups must do more to educate the public 
about logging on us forest service lands 
most people still dont realize there is logging going on in 
national forests he said 
tim hermach president of the native forest council based in 
eugene ore said the world is united in a call to stop cutting 
the trees of the brazilian rain forests 
but the united states has logged 90 percent of its timber and 
brazil has only logged 15 percent of its timber it is hypocritical 
for americans to tell brazil to stop all logging he said

israeli defense minister moshe arens 
said sunday he would ask the administration to provide his country 
with the means to match a massive arms deal being prepared for 
saudi arabia 
arens said israel has not yet been consulted about the saudi 
package estimated to contain 20 billion worth of sophisticated 
arms which state and defense department officials are preparing to 
submit for approval to congress 
we hope therell be a discussion with us arens said in a 
speech to a conference of the washington institute for near east 
studies there is no one in washington who believes this the 
saudi sale could have a positive effect on israel 
arens is meeting monday in washington with defense secretary 
dick cheney the united states is israels largest arms supplier 
giving israel 18 billion worth of weapons annually 
if the united states goes through with the saudi sale arens 
said we would have to see what could be done to provide the 
necessary equilibrium for israel 
arens did not elaborate but israeli sources say arens intends 
to ask the united states for money to help israels own defense 
industry develop modern weaponry in addition to usmade weapons 
such as f15 and f16 fighter planes 
arens also wants the united states to provide israel with access 
to its spy satellite photographs of iraq and other arab states the 
sources said 
israel would like direct access to raw satellite photos but has 
received indications that the united states would not be willing to 
supply it the sources said 
israel will ask for processed satellite photos or any other 
intelligence information the united states is willing to provide 
the sources said 
arens said there was no way israel could afford to pay for the 
amounts of weapons oilrich saudi arabia is buying here 
instead israel will have to rely increasingly on its own 
defense industries he said 
israel has already begun doing that in order to maintain its 
qualitative edge over the far larger arab armies that surround it 
he said 
the need to boost the israeli defense industries has become 
particularly acute in recent years because the united states has 
been supplying the arab states with the same weapons they sell 
israel arens said 
arens warned that the aug 2 iraqi invasion of kuwait and the 
resultant arms sales to the saudis and other us allies were 
escalating the arms race in the mideast and destabilizing the 
region 
he said israel would be willing to discuss a cessation of the 
arms flow into the area if its arab enemies did the same 
the united states has asked israel to refrain from intervening 
in the gulf crisis and has praised israeli officials for keeping a 
low profile 
israel is maintaining a high level of readiness in case iraqi 
president saddam hussein decides to fulfill his threat to attack 
the jewish state as a means of uniting the arab world behind him 
arens said 
he praised president bush for his remarkable success in 
uniting much of the world against iraq including syria and egypt 
arens said he hoped the rapprochement between syria and the 
united states leads to peace with israel although he expressed 
doubts it would 
arens also plans to meet with bushs national security adviser 
brent scowcroft and congressional leaders during his twoday visit 
to washington 
there were no plans for him to meet with bush

senate republican leader bob dole said sunday 
that financial contributions by other nations in support of the 
usled drive against iraq was welcome news for budget negotiators 
struggling to assemble a deficitreduction package 
were going to score it one way or the other dole said of 
the contributions from such nations as saudi arabia west germany 
and japan secretary of state james a baker iii returned home from 
a 11day trip early sunday his pockets bulging with 14 billion in 
new aid pledges 
i dont know who gets the check but we understand that it 
will have an impact on what we finally do in the budget summit 
in another development sunday president bush warned the iraqi 
people in a television broadcast that they stand on the brink of 
war because saddam hussein invaded kuwait 
but bush in a taped message from the oval office said war is 
not inevitable it is still possible to bring this crisis to a 
peaceful end 
bushs eightminute talk was broadcast on iraqi television 
apparently in its entirety 
the white house meanwhile applauded the united nations 
security councils unanimous condemnation sunday of iraqs raids on 
the embassy compounds of france and other nations in kuwait 
we fully support the actions taken by the united nations 
administration spokesman sean walsh said 
us diplomats at the united nations said the security council 
now would consider an aerial blockade against iraq and secondary 
sanctions against nations flouting the untrade embargo 
dole and house speaker thomas foley dwash appearing on the 
nbctvs meet the press program said there was widespread 
agreement in congress and across the country generally that the 
united states should not have to shoulder all of the costs of 
deterring saddam hussein 
there is no question that theres a feeling in the country and 
in the congress that we shouldnt bear these burdens alone either 
the military side of it or the financial side of it foley said 
but dole describing the initial response as certainly good 
news questioned whether support will remain strong if it becomes 
necessary to keep us military forces in the persian gulf region 
for an extended period 
during his trip baker received pledges of 12 billion from 
three oilrich arab nations saudi arabia the united arab emirates 
and the kuwaiti rulers overthrown and exiled by hussein 
west germany extended nearly 2 billion for military aid and 
economic assistance to countries affected by the economic embargo 
on iraq egypt and syria said they would send more troops italy 
volunteered 145 million and a squadron of tornados britain and 
france said they will send troops 
the us end of the military buildup is costing an estimated 1 
billion a month this enormous outlay is taking place as 
congressional and white house negotiators try to reach agreement on 
paring the federal deficit by 50 billion this year 500 billion 
over five years 
bushs national security adviser brent scowcroft interviewed 
sunday on the cbstv program face the nation made clear that 
the military wbuildup in the gulf is aimed at impressing saddam 
we want him to know we are serious scowcroft said 
but he distanced the administration from comments by gen 
michael j dugan the air force chief of staff who was quoted in 
sunday editions of the washington post as saying us military 
planners believed that if war breaks out the only effective tactic 
was to hit baghdad with massive air trikes that target saddam 
personally 
i would just point out that general dugan is not in the chain 
of command and he does not speak for the administration 
scowcroft said 
but he said contingency planning was developing for anything 
that might happen 
scowcroft hailed the recent increase in concrete support by us 
allies for the drive against iraq 
i think its a very heartwarming example of united action 
against aggression scowcroft said 
foley meanwhile disagreed with former president jimmy carter 
who said the united states may have to drive iraq from kuwait with 
military force 
i think the time is way too early to make a decision of that 
kind foley said the strong support the presidents had in the 
middle east is based on the fact that hes been deliberate hes 
been careful hes been focused on the goals 
carter appearing on cnns newsmaker sunday program said 
iraq should be pushed out of kuwait militarily if the punitive 
effect of economic sanctions do not succeed 
but my hope is he will withdraw and accept a compromise 
worked out by the arab community that will be easier for him to 
accept than a solution enforced on him by the united states and 
other western powers carter said

the national academy of sciences is fighting a 
500000 lawsuit that claims it plagiarized the writings of a 
nutrition researcher that it earlier had rejected 
victor herbert a lawyer and physician who filed the suit in 
us district court charged that the academy copied figures 
verbatim on work he had done to update published recommended 
dietary allowances rdas after earlier trying to discredit the 
work 
dr herbert is a great promoter of nutrition science 
herberts attorney michael botts said in a telephone interview 
sunday from kansas city mo it isnt just a moral point at all 
the academy took his work and then went out and sold it the 
academy made in the neighborhood of a half million dollars off of 
this work 
rdas form the foundation for determining the nutritional needs 
of schoolchildren food stamp recipients and other federally funded 
supplemental programs the academy sells lists of the standards to 
libraries medical schools doctors dietitians and nutritionists 
to update the rdas in the mid1980s the science academy an 
independent federal agency chartered by congress selected herbert 
and nine other prominent nutrition scientists 
using a 650000 grant from the national institutes of health 
the committees produced a document that discussed the sciences of 
each 18 essential vitamins and minerals that each person is 
encouraged to eat each day 
botts claimed the academy tinkered with the rdas document before 
publishing it in october 1989 damaging the integrity of the 
authors work and destroying the quality 
the document included copyrighted material herbert wrote on iron 
and on the vitamins b12 and folate or folic acid botts said 
lawyers for the academy filed a motion for dismissal last week 
and a hearing on the motion has been scheduled for oct 17 the 
academy contends that if there is copyright infringement the 
federal government should be the defendant in the suit which was 
filed in february 
botts said the committee completed its work and passed peer 
review and a september 1985 publication date was scheduled the 
panel was prepared to recommend lower levels of vitamins a and c 
than what had been suggested earlier 
but according to botts the academy gave the panel an ultimatum 
keep the rdas for vitamins a and c the same while adding a 
footnote to the table at the end of the book 
when the academy and committee disagreed over the wording of the 
footnote the academy refused to publish the work and disbanded the 
group botts said 
botts described the disagreement as a conflict in nutrition 
between those who promote pop nutrition such as those who call 
for high doses of fiber and vitamin c versus those who say there is 
harm in ingesting too much fiber and vitamin c 
thats nonsense calvin h cobb jr a lawyer representing 
the academy was quoted as saying in saturday editions of the 
washington post the complaint has no merit 
the national institutes of health in 1986 told the academy it 
must fulfill the terms of the contract or return the money botts 
said nih officials reviewed the committees report and wanted it to 
be published but the academy said it needed 160000 to select a 
subcommittee to update the earlier work 
meanwhile botts said herberts work appeared in a nutrition 
education journal in 1987 
the academy published a 10th edition revision in october 1989 
botts said the subcommittee was listed as author although the work 
included herberts writings

the king of the zulus urged 
thousands of armed supporters sunday to curb the factional fighting 
that has caused almost 800 deaths in black townships around 
johannesburg 
everybody must lay down their arms and take their brothers 
hand in friendship zulu king goodwill zwelithini told fellow 
tribesmen in soweto and tokoza two townships that have been hard 
hit by the fighting which began in early august 
zwelithini shared the stage at the peace rallies with president 
tutor ndamase of the transkei the tribal homeland of the xhosas 
the xhosas have joined fellow african national congress supporters 
in clashes against zulus loyal to the conservative inkatha 
movement 
both sides blame the other for the fighting 
but on friday anc leader nelson mandela said south african 
president fw de klerk now believes some of the violence may be 
instigated by a hidden hand an apparent reference to 
rightwing whites and others opposed to de klerks efforts to 
attain powersharing between blacks and whites 
i have come to this place to put out the flames of violence 
said zwelithini at the two rallies attended by more than 30000

arrived sunday to begin a threeday visit to celebrate the collapse 
of communism and discuss the merits of private enterprise 
mrs thatcher on a threenation tour that also includes hungary 
and switzerland is the first british leader to visit 
czechoslovakia in more than 50 years 
she was greeted at prague airport by czechoslovak premier marian

chat with alexander dubcek whose prague spring reforms in 1968 
were crushed by soviet tanks 
after receiving a military cannon salute mrs thatcher drove 
off to the center of the capital 
she was thronged on the 11th century old town square by 
thousands of wellwishers some chanting maggie maggie or 
hello maggie 
she had scheduled several private meetings sunday before talks 
with president vaclav havel on monday 
the visits to czechoslovakia and hungary are rather by way of 
celebration and encouragement for the future said a british 
government spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity 
czechoslovakia has a particular flavor because the people now 
running the country were all dissidents and people that we did our 
best to encourage we did our best to maintain contacts he said 
a british privatization team arrived in czechslovakia this 
month to help officials sell off dozens of stateowned enterprises 
the thatcher government has privatized most of britains former 
stateowned industries in the last decade including its steel 
industry and british airways

and hold talks with dubeck the head of the assembly 
she is to leave tuesday for hungary which she last visited in 
1984 britain last year set up technical aid funds for hungary and 
poland 
mrs thatcher and her husband denis also plan two days of 
official engagements in zurich and bern in switzerland 
last week french president francois mitterrand also visited 
prague 
both visits havel said were intended to put the final full 
stop to controversy over the 1938 munich treaty signed by france 
and britain which preceded nazi leader adolph hitlers invasion of 
czechoslovakia 
the treaty recognized hitlers claims to the sudetenland region 
of northern czechoslovakia 
czechoslovakia was not represented at the treaty signing and 
the countrys diplomats were arrested after being summoned to hear 
the results of the conference the territory was returned to 
czechoslovakia in 1945

multiparty elections in 22 years were rigged in favor of president 
omar bongo

forced the closing of the main voting station in the capital city 
of libreville 
sunday was the first of two rounds of voting to elect 120 
legislators from 520 candidates in the oilrich west african nation 
of 12 million people

following a wave of protests earlier this year bongo had permitted 
only his democratic party to operate since shortly after taking 
power in late 1967 
violence began after voters at the largest balloting station 
librevilles hotel de ville said they discovered stuffed ballot 
boxes before voting began they smashed the boxes and assaulted 
officials witnesses said 
at several voting stations in the capital particularly in the 
populous suburbs of lalala and venezvoir election officials asked

enough ballots and some of the 37 opposition parties claimed their 
tickets had been removed from voting booths the station reported 
the government did not immediately respond to the charges of 
fraud it also was not clear if ballots would be counted or whether 
future voting will be held

hundreds of customers of a department store 
chain are are tearing up their credit cards and threatening a 
christmas season boycott in a revolt over the retailers 
uncharacteristic snub of planned parenthood 
i dont think they expected any big outcry said toni 
tschann of the minnesota womens political caucus and frankly i 
never thought id hear from this many but people arent standing 
for it 
shredded credit cards began arriving by mail at dayton hudson 
corps downtown headquarters after the companys charitable 
foundation confirmed on labor day weekend that it was halting 
20000 education grants to planned parenthood of minnesota ending 
a 22year association 
the decision to end the grant came about the time the christian 
action council of falls church va said it would boycott daytons 
and other corporations for supporting planned parenthood 
dayton hudson spokeswoman ann barkelew said the decision had 
nothing to do with pressure from special interest groups but arose 
from confusion about the donations which some misconstrued as 
support for abortion 
now the public response has prompted trustees of the dayton 
hudson foundation to reconsider their decision and enter talks with 
planned parenthood that are set to continue this week 
barkelew said several hundred customers have returned their 
credit cards on saturday about 500 people rallied outside a 
daytons store in suburban edina and repeated their vow to boycott 
all dayton hudson stores beginning the day after thanksgiving 
unless funding is restored 
dayton hudson with 1989 sales of 136 billion owns daytons 
target marshall fields hudsons and mervyns department stores 
in 33 states 
daytons has always stood with women said gloria griffin of 
the minnesota womens consortium women are their customers i 
strongly feel this is only a momentary mistake 
weighing in behind the irate shoppers is at least one big 
investor new york city pension funds and bryn mawr college 
president mary patterson mcpherson who sits on the dayton hudson 
board of directors but is not a trustee of the foundation 
i am pleased they are reconsidering said mcpherson who 
declined to elaborate 
dayton hudson pioneered in 1946 a policy of giving 5 percent of 
profits for charitable causes in 1989 the company gave away 22 
million and received the americas corporate conscience award from 
the council on economic priorities in addition dayton hudson is 
on businessweek magazines top list of companies with 
womenfriendly cultures 
when a company of the prestige and importance in the 
philanthropic community says no to planned parenthood of 
minnesota that is a devastating message to corporate america 
said thomas webber executive director of planned parenthood of 
minnesota he said the 20000 grant is financially insignificant 
compared to its symbolic importance 
elin ohlsson 35 of edina is one of many shoppers who believe 
daytons withdrew support from planned parenthood because of the 
threatened boycott by the christian action council 
when i was 18 i was raped and i needed planned parenthood for 
counseling ohlsson said i feel betrayed by daytons 
barkelew said foundation trustees for years had considered 
ending financial support to planned parenthood because many people 
misconstrue the aid as support for abortion 
now the possibility of a boycott from either side looms just as 
the company enters the holiday shopping season which generates 
more than 50 percent of annual sales 
our worst fears have been realized said new york city 
comptroller elizabeth holtzman a trustee of city pension funds 
holding 319 million of dayton hudson stock were longterm 
investors and its quite clear that when people get angry with a 
company that can affect the bottom line 
in a letter to dayton hudson chairman and chief executive 
officer kenneth macke holtzman and other city officials said that 
denying the funding places dayton hudson squarely in the camp of 
the antichoice forces and in opposition to the overwhelming 
majority of americans who support accessible birth control

separate seats for moslems and nonmoslems 
the lawsuit was filed against ms bhutto saturday in lyari a 
sprawling slum in central karachi that ms bhutto won in the 
november 1988 election

teachings of islam and should not damage the freedom of the 
judiciary defame the armed forces or be involved in corruption 
the former prime minister they said did not fulfill these 
conditions and should be disqualified they noted ms bhutto had 
made statements in the national and international media against the 
teachings of islam a reference to statements that she opposed 
cutting off hands as punishment for crimes like theft 
they asked the court to summon ms bhutto and ask her to recite 
the koran the moslem holy book and answer questions about islam

owners of six winning tickets will 
split a record florida lotto jackpot of an estimated 105 million 
lottery officials said sunday 
each of the tickets bearing the numbers 5621343545 is 
worth an estimated 175 million said lottery secretary rebecca 
paul 
the numbers were drawn at 11 pm saturday ending a week of 
lottomania in which more than 100 million 1 tickets were sold 
sometimes at the rate of some 44500 tickets a minute 
the week followed four weeks in which there had been no lotto 
jackpot winner pushing the grand prize to its nearrecord height 
in the history of state lotteries in the unitd states only a 115 
million lotto jackpot in pennsylvania last year has been higher in 
that drawing 14 winning tickets were sold 
with no single ticket holder taking home the 105 million this 
time the us record holder for a single winning lottery ticket 
remains sheelah ryan of winter springs she bought the only lucky 
ticket in a 5516 million florida lottery drawing two years ago 
winning ticket holders in saturdays drawing had to wait until 
lottery offices opened monday to validate the tickets and begin the 
process of claiming their winnings which will be paid off over 20 
years 
some of the umpteen million losers had plenty to say though 
i just lost miserably said victor morgan who said he 
bought two tickets but ive wasted my money on worse things 
he watched the drawing at sharkeys shrimp bar in downtown miami 
jennifer kram who matched just three numbers on one of her 20 
tickets im very depressed three isnt good enough for me i 
wanted at least 500000 the threenumber match will bring her a 
grand total of 550 
mrs paul hinted at the exhaustion the week had brought lottery 
officials 
i think were happy she said at a midday news conference 
i think were glad its over but its been fun and exciting 
she said the estimated jackpot of 105 million give or take 
a dollar or two was based on last weeks interest rates and 
total sales of more than 109 million tickets earlier the jackpot 
was predicted to total 100 million 
the six tickets were sold in new smyrna beach coconut creek 
venice miami winter haven and longwood 
she said there were nearly 2 million winners overall including 
1581 tickets with five out of the six numbers those players will 
get 4488 each the 96036 tickets with four of the six numbers 
are worth 108 each some 18 million who picked three of the six 
numbers will take home 550 each 
the most popular combination was the simplest 123456 more 
than 52000 tickets had those six numbers mrs paul said 
had those turned out to be the winners the perticket payout 
would have been about 1000 paid out in a lump sum rather than 
over 20 years 
the jackpot for this weeks game to be decided saturday night 
was estimated at 9 million lottery officials said 
by law half of every 1 spent on a florida lottery ticket is 
returned to the players in the form of prizes at least 38 percent 
goes to education and the rest is spent on retailers and 
administration

resigned sunday to end more than six decades of family control in 
city hall 
endurance has its limits and ive just reached the end of 
mine read a letter by jacques medecin 62 accused of improperly 
shifting funds to cover city debts and criticized for ties with 
extremeright national front politicians 
medecins father jean held the mayoral post for 38 years 
except for a brief break during world war ii medecin succeeded his 
father in 1966 forging a power base on the traditional right of

a state law intended to protect children 
may hamper prosecution of a dead girls parents for child abuse 
because of an exemption for parents who employ certain types of 
prayer healing 
angela sweet died of a ruptured appendix on june 26 after her 
parents members of a small religious sect called the general 
assembly church of the first born apparently decided to attempt to 
heal her with prayer instead of taking her to a doctor 
david and barbara sweet of olathe in westcentral colorado each 
face one count of felony child abuse their initial court 
appearance is set for monday 
the 1989 law calls for prosecution of parents who refuse to get 
medical treatment for a child when ordered to do so by a court but 
no court order was obtained in angelas case 
results of such prosecutions in colorado and across the nation 
have been mixed 
when a 14yearold grand junction boy died in 1982 a week after 
his ppendix ruptured thendistrict attorney terry farina called a 
coroners inquest no charges were filed against the boys parents 
also members of the church of the first born 
contrary to most crimes which are intentional with obvious 
motives you often find loving parents who were parties to the 
death of their child farina said 
in boston earlier this year the christian science parents of 
robyn twitchell 2 who died of a bowel obstruction were convicted 
of involuntary manslaughter 
in fort collins district attorney stuart van meveren is still 
battling a nineyearold case in which the 5weekold daughter of 
john lybarger of estes park died of pneumonia while her parents 
prayed over her van meveren won a conviction of child abuse saw 
it overturned on procedural grounds and then reconvicted lybarger 
after a second jury trial the case has been appealed again 
in montrose district attorney mike stern agonized over the 
sweet case for six weeks after angelas death before filing child 
abuse charges against her parents 
complicating the issue are four visits made to the sweet home by 
a social worker at the request of school officials the social 
worker did not request a court order mandating medical treatment 
there was a gap they last saw her june 14 and she died june 
26 said stern he did not know the reason for the gap 
montrose county attorney greg moxley is not allowing any social 
service representatives to discuss the case with anyone 
john mitchell the sweets attorney wouldnt comment on the 
case nor would his clients 
the 1989 law whose chief lobbyists were christian scientists 
was intended by its sponsors to guarantee a right to medical care 
for children said state rep dick bond the house sponsor of the 
measure 
the bill had a criminal penalty in it originally because our 
intent was to stop something like this sweet case bond said 
but it came out at the insistence of sen terry considine 
the senate sponsor bill owens said considine championing 
parents religious rights weakened the bill considerably in 
conference committee 
the bill says school officials law enforcement officers or 
others can ask county social service workers to visit a child they 
believe to be seriously ill the social worker can then seek a 
court order mandating medical treatment 
but a threetier criteria designed by christian science 
lobbyists provides a loophole for some parents said owens 
the bill recognizes faith healing as a legitimate medical 
treatment if fees are allowed to be deducted as medical expenses by 
the irs if fees are recognized as reimbursable by health insurance 
companies and if the treatment has a success rate equal to that of 
standard medical treatment 
stern said there is still some question whether the church of 
the first born meets the exemption criteria 
considine who says he is a believer in religious liberty 
believes the social workervisitor mechanism is adequate to protect 
children 
im an episcopalian not a christian scientist considine 
said i believe the state has a legitimate interest in protecting 
children but what we didnt do is criminalize the behavior of the 
parents if they are operating under a religious belief 
since the sweets were charged elders of the church of the first 
born have been reluctant to comment but last month they told the 
grand junction daily sentinel that members can seek medical care 
and repent later on they also say children have a choice in the 
matter 
she angela believed and thats what she wanted said elder

than 30000 convenience store employees after they were questioned 
by company security for alleged theft according to a published 
report 
the philadelphia inquirer reported sunday that records it 
obtained and corroborated in interviews with former employees 
showed that cumberland farms attempted to question 30903 cashiers 
as part of a systematic effort to recover inventory losses by 
demanding money from employees accused of theft 
virtually all were fired the newspaper reported 
fourteen former cumberland farms employees have filed a lawsuit 
saying the company has a policy of falsely accusing cashiers of 
stealing and then threatening and coercing them into signing 
confessions 
the company based in canton mass denies the allegations 
cumberland farms kept at least two sets of records on each 
employee questioned from at least 1976 to 1989 according to the 
inquirer one set of records assigned a serial number to identify 
the employee accused and listed the reason for questioning his or 
her employment status and whether the accused paid any money to the 
firm 
each person fired was given a number edward f breau a 
former cumberland farms security official told the newspaper 
breau said he left the company after refusing to question an 
employee without evidence

cumberland farms employees have said they were falsely accused of 
theft they said that company security officials would take them 
into a back room of the store and threaten them until they signed

malicious prosecution and wire and mail fraud

more than 1000 coal miners gather 
monday to chart the future for the united mine workers a 
oncepowerful union facing legal troubles and declining membership 
as it marks its 100th anniversary 
delegates attending the convention at the opulent fontainebleau 
hotel will be asked to give the umws governing body the 
international executive committee new powers to combine some of 
the 21 districts and to use interest earnings from a strike fund to 
finance collective bargaining 
those appear to be the two largest issues union spokesman 
john duray said but if youre looking at the big picture the 
convention has to decide how the union will respond to changes in 
the industry 
aflcio president lane kirkland is scheduled to address the 
opening session of the convention the umws first since a special 
oneday gathering in atlanta in 1986 the umw rejoined the aflcio 
last year four decades after legendary umw president john l lewis 
pulled his union out of the organization 
other speakers scheduled to address the delegates include the 
rev jesse jackson and labor secretary elizabeth dole 
the umw formed in 1890 by a merger of competing mine unions 
once enjoyed tremendous power in a country dependent upon coal to 
fuel its factories and heat its homes with its 400000 members 
controlling 80 percent of the nations coal output as late as the 
1940s 
but as the nation turned to natural gas nuclear power and other 
sources of energy and mines became more mechanized the unions 
domination of coal began to lapse 
layoffs and an increase in nonunion mines have reduced the 
umws working membership to 70000 down from 120000 a decade ago 
an effort to merge the organization with the oil chemical and 
atomic workers to create a national energy union fell apart in 1988 
when the ocaw rejected the deal at the last minute 
the union faces other problems although it won most of the 
concessions it sought during the 10month pittston coal group 
strike the walkout helped cut the umws net worth by 45 million 
in 1989 down to 126 million 
the union also faces 52 million in fines levied by a virginia 
circuit judge because of the strike plus more than 1 billion in 
lawsuits filed by coal companies idled by last summers fiveweek 
wildcat strike in sympathy with the pittston workers 
one proposal union leaders expect to be put up for a vote would 
allow the 24member international executive board to use interest 
from its strike fund toward the expenses of maintaining a strike 
including legal fees and negotiating costs when the 1983 
convention approved the strike fund it limited the money to paying 
benefits to striking miners 
its incredibly expensive to win a good contract duray 
said the days when you could win a strike on the picket line are 
over 
another proposal would give the international executive board 
authority to merge districts change their boundaries or dissolve 
them several districts have encountered financial problems because 
of coal industry layoffs

thousands of iraqis took to the streets 
sunday shouting death to bush death to america after 
president bush said in a televised message that iraq was isolated 
and on the brink of war 
the demonstration came soon after an iraqi tv announcer 
delivered a stinging response to bushs statement saying it was 
full of lies and contradictions and warning that a thundering 
rage against the united states is building in the arab world 
the rally first gathered a few hundred men as they marched 
through residential neighborhoods thousands of others including 
women and children joined them 
raising their clenched fists in the air the demonstrators 
cried death to bush death to america they also called 
egyptian president hosni mubarak and king fahd of saudi arabia 
traitors of the arab world for backing the usled 
multinational troop buildup against iraq 
in bushs message on staterun iraqi television he warned that 
iraq stands isolated and alone following its aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait 
saddam hussein tells you that this crisis is a struggle 
between iraq and america in fact it is iraq against the world 
said bush standing in front of his white house desk with the 
american flag behind him 
bush portrayed the invasion as yet another mistake by the same 
leaders who plunged iraq into war with iran in 1980 
youve borne untold suffering and hardship during eight long 
years of war with iran bush said once again the same iraqi 
leadership has miscalculated once again the iraqi people face 
tragedy 
the un economic embargo against iraq is meant not to punish 
the iraqi people but as a peaceful means to convince your 
leadership to withdraw rom kuwait he said the decision is in 
the hands of saddam hussein 
no one not the american people not this president wants 
war but there are times when a country when all countries 
must stand against aggression bush said 
his eightminute speech was followed by a 25minute denunciation 
from mikdad morad the announcer who usually reads statements from 
president saddam hussein the statement though an official 
commentary was not read in saddams name as some past messages 
have been 
should war be imposed on us the iraqi people will not 
hesitate in joining to teach the aggressor an important leasson 
which neither they nor their allies and agents will ever forget 
morad said 
the united states has tens of thousands of troops arrayed 
against iraq in saudi arabia and elsewhere in the persian gulf 
region the deployment began after iraqs invasion of kuwait and 
other nations have since joined the military buildup 
your aggression will end in a catastrophe for your forces 
the iraqi statement warned 
as have past iraqi statements sundays response to bushs 
message sought to tie the persian gulf crisis to other disputes in 
the mideast it repeated arab criticism that the united states 
applies double standards in dealing with the invasion of kuwait and 
the israeli occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
it said the us president was shedding crocodile tears for 
foreigners prevented from leaving iraq and kuwait some of whom 
are being used as human shields to protect iraqi installations 
against potential us attack 
they want to leave because of the embargo imposed by the 
united states the iraqi statement said 
bush went crazy after iraq entered kuwait because he 
feared his oil interests were jeopardized and not out of concern 
for the former kuwaiti leaders it said 
the iraqi announcer said the conflict is not at all as bush 
says one between iraq and the united states it is one between the 
united states and the iraqis arabs moslems and all the sincere 
people of the world 
it is thundering rage in the moslem and islamic world against 
the united states it added 
bush taped his address last wednesday after an iraqi information 
minister suggested the us president would be given time on the 
countrys television network as saddam has been by american 
television 
the white house had reportedly been irked by the amount of us 
air time saddams views were getting 
the bush tape including a voiceover translation and captions 
in arabic was ferried by a state department courier to baghdad and 
turned over to the government there by the us charges daffaires

a request from east german 
parliament deputies that their salaries continue to be paid after 
the two germanys unify on oct 3 has upset west german political 
leaders a newspaper said sunday 
some west germans interpreted the request as a veiled threat by 
the deputies to vote against the unification treaty unless their 
demands were met 
the deputies are demanding that they continue receiving their 
salaries and benefits after east germanys first democratically 
elected legislature is dissolved with unification on oct 3 
the request came in a letter by east german parliament speaker 
sabine bergmannpohl to west german leaders including chancellor 
helmut kohl 
the east german deputies want to be paid at least until 
allgerman elections are held on dec 2 
they receive a monthly salary of 3750 and such a move would 
cost west german taxpayers already worried about the soaring cost 
of unification about 19 million 
mrs bergmannpohls letter was published on sunday by the west 
german newspaper bild am sonntag east german deputies blackmail 
kohl the newspapers frontpage headline said 
after unification 144 deputies from the 400member east german 
parliament or volkskammer will be integrated into the west german 
bundestag until the elections for a united parliament are held the 
other 256 deputies will lose their seats 
this different treatment is causing strong unrest in the 
volkskammer mrs bergmannpohls letter said the resulting 
anger is leading to uncertainty about the vote on the unification 
treaty 
the volkskammer is scheduled to vote on thursday and a 
twothirds majority is needed 
bild am sonntag said kohl and interior minister wolfgang 
schaeuble were angered by the request and would reject it 
officials of other political parties also criticized mrs 
bergmannpohls letter 
she said on sunday that her letter had been misunderstood and 
that she had only asked that deputies not going to the bundestag 
keep their status until dec 2 
in an interview with the newspaper bild released in advance of 
its publication monday she said deputies who may not have jobs to 
return to should receive severance pay for their service in the 
volkskammer 
an interior ministry spokesman in bonn said sunday that it was 
legally impossible for volkskammer members not going to the 
bundestag to retain their deputys status after oct 3 but he said 
officials from the two states would discuss on monday possibilities 
for giving the outgoing deputies severance pay

a toddler trapped for 14 hours in a shaft dug for 
a remodeling project busied himself making mud balls and listening 
to his mothers repertoire of nursery songs before rescuers reached 
him at dawn 
it was really difficult i could hear him crying but i 
couldnt touch him and i couldnt help him lisa davis the 
mother of 20monthold kevin said while fighting back tears at a 
news conference at denver general hospital on sunday 
the team of rescuers cheered when the boy was brought to the 
surface shortly after 6 am sunday 
when he clinched my fingers i felt a tingle in my heart 
said firefighter joe cipri who pulled him out its still 
there 
kevin was treated for dehydration at the hospital and released 
sunday afternoon spokeswoman mary lee chin said 
his bruises were minimal chin said there was no need to 
keep him in because he was doing great as a matter of fact i 
caught him jumping up and down on his bed this afternoon so hes 
doing fine 
the ordeal started about 4 pm saturday when the toddler fell 
into a hole 18 inches wide and 12 feet deep dug for a remodeling 
project in a house the family was renovating in an upscale 
neighborhood in southeastern denver 
he wasnt playing in the room he just came to visit for a 
second because its not a safe place for a kid to be said 
kevins father tom he managed to slip under a piece of wood and 
fell into the hole i heard him bouncing around in the hole 
firefighters from four metropolitan departments worked through 
the night to keep the boy warm and dry pumping oxygen into the 
hole and shining the lights to keep the temperature at about 70 
degrees 
mrs davis 32 said kevin kept himself amused by rolling mud 
into balls with his fingers and spinning himself around in the 
hole 
rescue workers dug a vertical shaft using a vachoe a huge 
digger that excavates with a stream of compressed air and then 
vacuums out the loose dirt they then delicately dug a horizontal 
tunnel across the five feet of earth where kevin was 
mrs davis said she didnt say anything to her dirty 
blondhaired son when he was brought up from the shaft cradled in 
a splintlike device that protected his head neck and upper body 
i just wanted to hold him she said hes a pretty 
incredible boy the couple said kevin their only child was 
talkative and asked for a toy as soon as he arrived at the 
hospital 
the incident was reminiscent of the october 1987 ordeal of 
jessica mcclure the 18monthold toddler who spent 58 hours in a 
well in midland texas the arduous effort to free her gripped the 
nation and her final emergence safe in the arms of rescue workers 
was televised nationally 
hearing about kevins predicament saturday evening jessicas 
father chip mcclure said i know every hour seems like a day 
you have to have faith in the lord im sure their little boy will 
be all right

a tanker carrying about 1 million gallons 
of gasoline exploded and burned sunday on the saginaw river 
injuring most of the 18 people aboard and spilling fuel in the 
water 
the fire was too hot for firefighters to douse and officials 
waited for it to burn itself out said coast guard lt tom koontz 
one person from the ship was missing said coast guard petty 
officer gerald backus gov james blanchard visited the site and 
declared the blaze an emergency freeing state aid and assistance 
the fire was reported at 845 am while the tanker was 
unloading at the total refinery dock facility and was still 
burning sunday evening 
authorities warned spectators to clear the area in case of 
multiple explosions 
a few people blew right off the boat and slammed ashore 
said bay city police officer kenneth adcock the sky is covered 
with black smoke if it blows again its going to be a big one 
witnesses said the black smoke blocked out the sun throughout 
the afternoon 
the tanker owned by cleveland tankers inc of cleveland was 
carrying about 20000 barrels of gasoline or about 1 million 
gallons said koontz it has a capacity of about 54000 barrels 
thats the estimate thats a lot of gas koontz said 
the state department of natural resources was conducting water 
and air pollution tests sunday to check for environmental 
contamination spokeswoman susan henry said 
a gasoline spill is less damaging than an oil spill because 
its volatile and it evaporates she said adding that two 
booms were strung downstream from the ship to contain any spilled 
fuel 
ronald stopyak had returned home 15 minutes before the blast 
from working at the bay chemicals co directly across the river 
from the tanker he said he raced back to work after hearing the 
explosion 
i thought the plant exploded and when i got out there i saw 
black smoke everywhere he said i saw the employees on the 
ship go overboard 
it was really hot i could feel the heat from across the 
river 
his wife cheryl said their house is less than two blocks from 
the explosion and was shaken 
it was like a slow rumbling it got louder and louder like 
thunder she said 
two coast guard helicopters sprayed firefighting foam while 
they rescued crew members from the tanker said lt dennis secor 
coast guard crews secured the tanker with cables to prevent it 
from drifting into a nearby bridge he said 
bay medical center spokesman curt miller said three of the 17 
crew members treated there were admitted two had head injuries a 
third suffered chest pains police initially reported that one 
victim had suffered a heart attack 
bay city is a town of 40000 on lake hurons saginaw bay about 
100 miles northwest of detroit

discovered what appeared to be a halfsubmerged life raft in the 
north atlantic near where a jetliner with 16 aboard was believed to 
have ditched last week

submerged said bob norburn a private radio operator monitoring 
transmissions between aircraft and the nipigon which was 
coordinating the sea search

white house and congressional budget 
negotiators are finding that when it comes to an impregnable 
sanctuary andrews air force base is no fort knox 
after a yearlong budget stalemate negotiators decided that the 
maryland airfield just outside the capital would be a good 
place for them to quickly piece together a package of tax increases 
and spending cuts for next year 
there would be no competing meetings to attend it would provide 
a chance to spend long uninterrupted hours together to develop a 
camaraderie that could speed the way to a deal and perhaps best of 
all no meddling reporters or lobbyists who could pry out 
embarrassing proposals 
it hasnt quite worked out that way 
the bargaining which began sept 7 and was supposed to last 
three or four days resumed late sunday for a ninth day with no 
end in sight two officials demanding anonymity said the meeting 
was contentious as democrats backed away from about 30 billion in 
cuts the two sides had been discussing in medicare agriculture and 
other benefit programs 
it doesnt look good right now one official said the talks 
subsequently broke up the evening shortly before 10 pm and were 
to resume monday at 10 am 
on nbctvs meet the press program sunday senate minority 
leader bob dole rkan and house speaker thomas s foley 
dwash said they hoped a deal could be arranged by monday night 
its tough going but i think tomorrow night we may well see 
an agreement foley said 
in addition important details of offers counteroffers and 
agreements have been routinely reported in the press causing 
bickering among negotiators over how the information was disclosed 
the cloak of secrecy the participants have sought has been 
pierced so badly that the unlisted phone number of the republican 
staffs fax machine at andrews had to be changed last week because 
it was being flooded by messages from lobbyists 
in other instances congressional aides have asked reporters for 
information about the talks 
frustration by many bargainers with the leaks reached a peak 
friday that was the day news articles reported on a gop tax 
proposal made at the negotiations the articles noted that 
according to the nonpartisan joint tax committee of congress the 
republican plan would boost taxes for low and middleincome people 
and lower them for the better off 
dont burden an already difficult ship with this kind of thing 
or it will sink sen pete domenici rnm one of several 
negotiators who took to the senate floor to complain warned his 
democratic counterparts 
just three days earlier domenici had kinder things to say about 
the andrews talks 
i dont think we could do it if we werent somewhere like 
that the senator said tuesday when asked if the selection of 
andrews was working out 
not only is information getting out but pressure from interest 
groups is getting in 
the negotiators last week were considering a plan to raise 
revenues by increasing the monthly medicare premium for medical 
coverage now 2860 monthly for people with higher incomes 
but as the powerful senior citizens lobby geared up democrats 
by weeks end were said to have backed away from the idea 
according to officials speaking only on condition of anonymity 
the bargainers had wished that by meeting in seclusion the two 
sides would be willing to propose dramatic tax boosts or spending 
slashes that they would be reluctant to offer publicly they still 
hope that if a deal is reached democrats and republicans alike 
would claim authorship and thus provide each other with political 
cover 
but in some instances the system has broken down 
last week for example it was reported that the negotiators 
were considering boosting the 16centperpack cigarette tax 
perhaps doubling it 
one official said the idea had come from rep bill archer 
rtexas one of the negotiators archer vehemently denied that and 
said the proposal had been advanced by a democrat whom he would not 
name 
at the negotiations the next day archer angrily accused another 
bargainer sen james sasser dtenn of telling reporters that 
the tobacco levy was archers idea which sasser denied said 
another official who also demanded anonymity 
to prevent incidents like that the negotiators have taken 
extraordinary steps to keep reporters at arms length 
with the talks being held in the andrews officers club 
reporters have been confined to a press center on the base about 
two miles away they have been warned to not go near the officers 
club and on many occasions have not been allowed onto the base or 
out of the press center without an armed military escort 
many journalists are simply covering the talks from their 
offices in the capital about 10 miles away

hundreds of ethiopian jews many of them 
crying demonstrated outside prime minister yitzhak shamirs office 
on sunday to demand that the government help bring out family 
members stranded in addis ababa 
we want our families we want our parents mother father 
where is my mother where is my father the crowd chanted we 
ask you please save our families 
many in the crowd broke into tears as they shouted bitterly for 
relatives left behind in ethiopia 
the protest lasted for about three hours and the demonstrators 
briefly blocked a major road near shamirs office israel 
television said police did not intervene 
officials said the government was doing all it could to bring 
ethiopian jews to israel 
ethiopian jews have sought to escape from their land stricken 
by war and famine to a better life in israel more than 17000 
ethiopian jews live here 
some 15000 to 18000 jews remain in ethiopia after about 8000 
were airlifted to israel in 1984 through the sudan 
the secret usbacked campaign known as operation moses was 
called off after three months when news of its existence leaked to 
the press embarrassing the ethiopian and sudanese governments 
the majority of those left behind have abandoned their homes and 
made their way to the capital addis ababa hoping they can escape 
on the direct flights to israel initiated when the two nations 
resumed diplomatic relations in october 1989 after a 16year break 
but only about 500 immigrants a month have arrived since 
october and israeli officials have announced there have been no 
arrivals since july 
ethiopian jewish activists in israel say about 250 jews have 
died since then of disease and hunger in addis ababa they say 
their stranded relatives need medical help and blame the israeli 
government for its lack of action 
according to us congressmen ethiopias marxist government is 
trying to force israel to sell it advanced weapons for use against 
the rebels in the african countrys civil war israeli officials 
deny these reports 
the government of israel and all the jewish organizations that 
deal with the ethiopian jewry do everything in their power in order 
to bring ethiopian jews to israel as soon as possible said 
absorption minister yitzhak peretz who later appeared at the 
rally 
the foreign ministry issued a special statement saying that some 
2500 ethiopian jews have arrived in israel this year 
it said efforts were being made to transfer the rest of them to 
israel with the help of jewish organizations and many friendly 
governments in spite of what the ministry called objective 
difficulties 
but addisu masala a spokesman for the protesters disputed 
these figures on israel television saying that only 1000 people 
have come this year and that the ministrys numbers were 
unreasonable

israels chief of staff expressed concern 
sunday that the bush administrations proposed multibilliondollar 
weapons sales to saudi arabia could destabilize the military 
balance in the middle east 
chief of staff lt gen dan shomron also said israel was worried 
about events in neighboring jordan especially the recent visit of 
radical palestinian guerrilla leaders george habash and nayef 
hawatmeh 
the bush administration reportedly is preparing to submit to 
congress a request to sell saudi arabia at least 18 billion worth 
of weapons including f15 fighter planes helicopters tanks and 
other sophisticated arms to bolster the desert kingdoms defenses 
against iraq 
the administration has already proposed selling saudi arabia 3 
billion in new weapons including f15s m60 tanks 15000 rounds 
of armorpiercing antitank ammunition and 200 stinger 
antiaircraft missiles 
speaking on israel radio shomron said the arms deal would give 
the saudis a large quantity of weapons which are also of the 
highest quality 
from our point of view giving such weapons to countries 
that are still formally at war with us is certainly not a recipe 
for stability shomron said 
i hope this situation will be balanced in order to guarantee 
in the future our technological superiority and deterrent 
capability he said 
according to israeli sources defense minister moshe arens who 
is now in the united states plans to ask washington for money to 
help israels defense industry develop weaponry as well as for 
usmade weaponry such as f15 and f16 fighter planes 
turning to the gulf crisis shomron predicted that iraq might be 
able to withstand the lack of food and other goods caused by the 
un trade embargo but not a shortage of spare parts for the army 
it is easier to convince people that for the cause of a just 
important war they should be content with less food or services 
shomron said 
if this problem of spare parts for weapons systems mostly 
advanced systems does not exist today it will soon become a 
serious issue 
shomron said israel was concerned about developments in jordan 
because of its strong support for iraq and the reappearance of 
radical palestinian leaders in the kingdom 
habash and hawatmeh have been supported by syria but are now 
reportedly moving their headquarters to iraq 
securing the border between us and jordan is mostly under the 
responsibility of the jordanian army and there are many 
palestinians in it too shomron noted this situation carries 
many dangers we are watching and we are alert to any possibility 
of a change 
he reiterated israels longstanding policy that the entrance of 
iraqi forces into jordan would trigger a military response from 
israel but qualified it saying i propose to remember that 
this is subject to consideration to carefully determining what has 
entered and for what purpose but in principle this is a red 
line 
we are preparing our forces for every eventuality from the 
point of view of training weapons and logistics shomron said

threequarters of us midsized manufacturing 
companies contacted in a survey said they plan to spend as much or 
more on plant and equipment in 1991 as they did this year 
four out of 10 manufacturers with annual sales of 10 million to 
200 million said they will invest the same amount next year an 
additional third said they will increase such spending 
only one in five plans to cut capital spending next year 
according to the survey by grant thornton an accounting and 
management consulting firm 
replacing plant and equipment was the most prevalent reason 
given for increased spending followed by spending to boost 
productivity grant thornton said 
those who said they will decrease spending say they either 
believe they have invested enough or that they cannot afford more 
investments due to poor earnings or insufficient funds 
the telephone survey was conducted in late june by the research 
organization wirthlin group which randomly contacted 250 midsized 
manufacturers grant thornton said the sampling margin of error was 
plus or minus 6 percentage points
