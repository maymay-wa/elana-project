the uscanada border on lake champlain ap the water in lake 
champlain knowing no national boundaries flows freely between 
canada and the united states so do hundreds of boaters to the 
chagrin of customs agents 
a border is a border whether it is the land the air or the 
lake said jean paul barriere who runs the canadian port of entry 
without a summer cruising permit those leaving the cottagelined 
beaches on missisquoi bay in venice en quebec are supposed to stop 
at the us customs service house in alburg springs which is all 
but impossible to reach by water 
it was slightly easier to get to canadian customs boaters could 
stop at a dock just over the border and call officials in nearby 
phillipsburg 
until this year boaters going in and out of the bay jutting into 
quebec from vermont missed or ignored the notch in the trees that 
marks the line last year all but five were forgetting about 
reporting said barriere laughing 
to encourage respect for the border canada set up a floating 
immigration station a 20by40foot blue and orange barge officials 
say is a first 
on a sunny day in the middle of the week canadian customs 
officer jean pierre fortin logged 11 boats crossing by early 
afternoon he has counted more than 1000 since he took up his post 
in a boat near the barge june 21 
fortin isnt necessarily looking for drug runners or illegal 
aliens though hes prepared for both he also keeps watch for 
people trying to escape paying canadian taxes on boats by buying 
them in the united states and taking them through the bay instead of 
hauling them by land through customs stations 
his main reason for floating in the bay is to make an afternoon 
outing more pleasant by giving cruisers an easy way to report to 
customs canadian officers are on the barge between 11 am and 7 
pm until midseptember 
but for those who want to escape the bay for the open lake on the 
vermont side getting to us customs remains a trial and sometimes 
a game of chicken 
two power boats with canadians aboard stop at fortins post 
though technically they need only report at the us station one 
couple already has a summer permit to take their boat as far south 
as st albans bay without a stop on each trip but their son and a 
friend in the second boat dont 
are the police down there the father asks fortin doesnt 
tell 
the us customs house is within sight but the shallow water and 
rocky beach pose a greater risk than the agents both boats whizz 
past 
fortin shrugs he knows the boaters and he isnt surprised they 
took a chance for an afternoons spin on the lake 
but taking the chance and perhaps being confronted by imposing 
agents in uniform is just the situation thomas ducharme owner of 
the growing champlain marina and a boat dealership wants his 
customers to avoid us officials are hard on canadians he says 
and difficulty reporting has cost him customers 
when ducharme opened his marina three years ago he renewed a 
local push for a dock at the us house but the bay was too shallow 
and the idea grew for the floating station and fortins boat which 
is docked at ducharmes marina 
i did it for my pocket i want my customers to cross the border 
without any trouble ducharme said adding that to go by the book 
he must take his customers overland to the us station before 
sending them off for the day 
tim moran assistant district director of the us customs 
service in st albans acknowleges that the honest traveler would 
be less apprehensive about crossing the border if they had a place 
to check in 
an invitation to share the barge came too late for this year but 
us officials want to see how it works the crossings logged by the 
canadians are more than moran had expected but numbers alone wont 
justify a us presence 
it would be a balancing between the numbers and the perceived 
threat he said adding that there is some smuggling activity on 
the lake 
earlier this month the us coast guard and customs officials 
tied up at the barge to search boats under the bush administrations 
zero tolerance drug policy the sixhour duty brought the first 
arrest of the season a quebec man on whose boat inspectors 
allegedly found eight grams of marijuana 
fortin taps a pen on his log eleven boats have passed and hell 
radio alburg springs with an update its a big favor were doing 
them he said 
it is a big favor agreed noel induni of the us 
immigration and naturalization service in st albans the minute 
you put someone there it doesnt matter if it is a canadian 
officer you get compliance

women around the country see a new femalemajority 
government in west berlin as a sign of a new age in west germany and 
a test case that could influence their political fortunes in the 
future 
women hold eight of the 13 seats in the west berlin senate the 
citys governing body 
while the coalition of leftist social democrats and 
environmentalists has held together better than many had predicted 
when it took office in march it has been tainted by controversy 
anne klein the state minister for youth affairs has been 
accused of taking part in illegal gambling activities 
culture minister anke martiny has come under fire in the press 
following allegations that one of her women staffers misused office 
contacts and mailing privileges to secure an apartment 
but women defenders respond that what happened to the women is 
nothing more than the kind of trouble men get into 
i wouldnt want to understate the seriousness of such matters 
but its fair to say that they are not problems specific to women 
politicians said ingrid hesse a spokeswoman for the social 
democratic womens organization an arm of the social democratic 
party which governs in coalition with an environmentalist group 
the fact that a woman is discovered to have taken part in 
something questionable doesnt detract from the undeniable 
importance of this huge step forward for women ms hesse added 
peter rudolph a taxi driver in his 50s tended to agree 
people are always looking for excuses to complain about the 
government especially now with all those women he said they 
arent doing anything the male politicians werent doing but 
everyone notices now 
the eight women senators caucus over croissants and coffee each 
tuesday morning in a ritual that has been called the witches 
breakfast 
it is really quite productive and it lets all these women blow 
off steam so that it doesnt interfere with the whole senates 
business said alice uebe chief adviser to ms martiny and an 
active the social democrat 
the women are credited with pressing for changes aimed at 
improving living conditions in this city of 2 million people tightly 
ringed by communist east germany 
they have introduced measures to reduce air and noise pollution 
improve housing availability and to expand daycare opportunities 
for the increasing numbers of west german women who work outside the 
home 
while many berliners attribute the atmospheric changes to the 
womens influence they likewise are blamed for decisions and edicts 
that dont sit well with the public 
west berlins interior minister erich paetzold decided in july 
to require that official correspondence be genderneutral for 
example a male resident is a berliner and a female is a 
berlinerin the unisex term is berlinerin with the second i 
capitalized 
what has become known as the big i decision has been widely 
ridiculed as silliness resulting from the female majority in the 
senate hannarenate laurien a former senator of the outofpower 
christian democratic union called it perverse 
monika herrmann one of the founding members of the womenonly 
artemisia hotel and art gallery in west berlin says the new 
government has awakened the west german womens movement 
but she and others also maintained that it has left some men 
feeling defensive and threatened 
for a long time many people have confused emancipation with 
sexual alternativism ms herrmann said in an interview women 
are doing things for themselves and men fear their power is being 
reduced 
a member of the city governments 35women advisory council on 
family and social affairs ms herrmann said the women in positions 
of authority now recognize that they have to move carefully to 
achieve what they want without undermiing their electoral support 
meanwhile women politicians in other parts of the country keep a 
close eye on west berlin to gauge their own standing with voters 
the berliners have given the situation for political women a 
step up but we are seeing this in other areas of the country as 
well in smaller cities observed ingrid sehrbrock director of 
the womens union of the christian democatic union what kind of 
example the berlin coalition poses remains to be seen but it has 
certainly raised everyones consciousness

rival us archaeological teams are 
unearthing a major romanera city near jesus boyhood town of 
nazareth but scholars are bitterly divided over how it may have 
influenced his life and teachings 
james f strange professor of religious studies at the 
university of south florida in tampa said six seasons of digging 
show the ancient hilltop city of sepphoris was a bustling urban 
center of 35000 with colonnaded streets a roman garrison and a 
theater 
the city he says is certain to have had a major influence on 
jesus who grew up only six miles away even though the new 
testament makes no specific mention of jesus visiting sepphoris 
the question is not so much whether he was here but how many 
times said strange 51 as he rested under a fig tree near the 
ruins of an ancient jewish villa that he had recently excavated by 
his 85member expedition 
the conclusion he has drawn is that jesus was influenced at an 
early age by a sophisticated roman town with a signficant pagan 
presence as a consequence he believes jesus teachings were as 
attuned to urban audiences as to country folk 
does he presuppose an urban audience as much as a rural one 
the answer seems to be yes i think we have to give up the 
concept of a peasant jesus he said 
jesus exposure to a multicultural society also was likely to 
have had an impact on later teachings it helps us understand how 
it is that the ideas of jesus took root so quickly in both gentile 
and jewish cultures he said 
strange dates the 4600seat theater to the start of the first 
century ad and says it may well be the reference point of some of 
jesus sayings 
for example the bible says jesus cautioned against acting like 
hypocrites by publicizing ones help to the needy and disfiguring 
ones face while fasting so as to look somber 
strange said the references were puzzling until his team 
determined that in ancient greek hypocrites were actors and jesus 
had access to a theater 
most of stranges conclusions were disputed by eric meyers an 
archaeologist from duke university who heads a joint 5yearold 
expedition with hebrew university of jerusalem his excavations are 
often near but in different areas than where strange is digging 
meyers argues sepphoris located 75 miles north of jerusalem was 
a smaller city of about 15000 to 20000 at the time of jesus he 
also contends there is no evidence of wide colonnaded streets that 
the theater was not built until the end of the first century ad 
and there is no sign of roman legionnaires or signficant numbers of 
pagans until much later 
meyers said the signficance of sepphoris lay primarily in its 
history as a center of jewish learning from the first to fourth 
century ad during this period jewish scholars in sepphoris 
including rabbi judah hanasi produced a major portion of the 
mishna a codification of jewish law and oral tradition 
there is no way we can ever answer definitely whether jesus 
came here or not said meyers but if there is an inference to 
be gleaned on the life of jesus it is his acquaintance with the 
edcucated and learned classes of jewish people who lived here 
twentythree biblical scholars who toured the site during a 
recent international conference on galilean studies differed in 
their views of sepphoris 
sean freyne a new testament scholar from trinity college 
dublin said he believes jesus purposely avoided big cities like 
sephhoris and directed his ministry in the galilee to simple 
country people 
my theory is that jesus avoided herodian centers such as 
sepphoris i think it would have been mentioned if jesus had 
ministered here or if the jesus movement took root here he said 
adding jesus primarily evoked rural images 
i think jesus message is addressed more to the people of the 
land said freyne 
antonio saldarini a bible scholar from boston college said he 
believed jesus had visited the city 
it would have been a big city with cosmpolitan life some 
romans and gaps between the poor in the village and the rich in the 
city but i dont think any of this would have been weird to jesus 
or beyond his experience it wouldnt have been like visiting rome 
it was still a palestinian city said saldarini

two chinese dancers and a member of a 
soviet troupe apparently defected to the united states after 
appearing in a utah folk festival police said tuesday 
the three women two from the peoples republic of china and one 
from the ukraine left their american host families homes at 
separate times but later telephoned the families to inform them they 
had defected and were safe said springville police sgt dave caron 
himself a host for two soviet dancers 
both cases were being handled by the fbi and the us immigration 
and naturalization service and the dancers whereabouts were 
unknown he said 
the chinese women identified as chen li 24 and zhe qian 27 
both from guizhou province in southeast china disappeared friday 
the soviet woman svetlana kirenko 32 of the donetsk region 
just north of the black sea refused to join her troupe which was 
boarding a bus for salt lake international airport early tuesday 
caron said 
early this morning when it was time to go she told the host 
family that she did not intend to return to the soviet union and she 
wanted to defect she refused to get in the car or put her suitcase 
in the car to go where the bus was picking up the dancers he said 
kirenko would not leave the house he said and when the host 
family and other soviet dancers went inside a short time later to 
talk to her they found her gone 
tour organizers were upset but its not like they were angry 
they were concerned caron said they realized the impact of a 
choice like that this lady has basically decided to give up her 
entire life to come to america they were concerned about her 
wellbeing 
they were primarily concerned that the lady made the decision 
on her own and that is really what she wanted to do he added 
the women were among several hundred dancers from various foreign 
countries appearing in the world folk fest in springville about 60 
miles south of here which began aug 12 and ended monday 
springville police turned the matter over to federal authorities 
caron said fbi spokesman tim screen said he could not comment on 
the matter ins administrators whose office was closed tuesday 
night could not be reached 
caron said it wasnt immediately known how the women fled or if 
they had help

when gov john r mckernans mother walked 
into a popular capital deli and insisted a sandwich be named after 
her son the owner obliged 
but sandwich man michael burns first made sure the menu entry a 
turkey sandwich didnt offend the chief executive 
weve got other turkeys weve got a turkey named after veteran 
legislator dan hickey a good legislator but i sent a messenger 
over to the governors office to ask he thought it was fine said 
burns from behind the orange counter at burnsies lunch 
his spokesman willis lyford said mckernan was delighted with 
the honor 
as long as its not baloney lyford added 
about a block from the statehouse complex and gubernatorial 
mansion the lunch shop has a back wall covered with comic 
illustrations of the many choices customers need only point burns 
said some are named after past and present politicians who are 
caricatured by walter winchester of augusta 
joe brennan was governor when i came here of course we became 
friendly said burns recalling a visit by the twoterm governor 
we talked for a while then i said weve got to have a sandwich 
named after you 
the big governor joe a popular item at burnsies is 
prominently advertised 
well mrs mckernan came in one day and saw that and said 
wheres my sons sandwich 
i told her next time she came in shed see the sign right up 
there said burns 
the dukes special named after a capital barber famous for his 
informal but usually accurate political polls led to a 
situation that burns characterized as really quite comical 
this lady came in she had all these dukakis buttons on her 
she jumped up and down at that sandwich she said she wanted to kiss 
me he said i didnt tell her it was for a hardworking local

engineers professors and a fortune 
500 company have been assembled to flush out malfunctioning toilets 
in south florida 
the problem in part is an 80cent rubber seal that 
deteriorates causing toilets to run or stop flushing a leading 
manufacturer of the seal hoping to solve the mystery has given a 
4000 grant to a waterquality researcher at florida international 
university 
the university is as puzzled as we are on the exact problem 
said mitchell kleppe florida representative for fluidmaster co of 
anaheim calif it has not been able to pin anything down on the 
exact cause 
for three years the leaky and malfunctioning toilets have 
affected nearly 95 percent of the homes in palm beach broward and 
dade counties said kleppe 
he said the company is the worlds largest manufacturer of the 
seal 
the quartersize seals fail about every six months in south 
florida but in most parts of the country they last up to five 
years he said 
the seal is part of a valve that triggers the toilet to fill or 
empty the tank when the seal malfunctions it swells and prevents 
the valve from working often leaving the noise of water running in 
the tank 
besides the university study the manufacturer is conducting 
tests at fort lauderdales water plants and is teaming up with 
california engineers and makers of rubber products such as the 
fortune 500s du pont he said

the tourism industry at this seaside 
resort the summer playground of chinas leaders is struggling to 
recover from the spring military crackdown on students 
the violent june 34 suppression of students protesting for 
democratic reform in beijing not only scared away foreign tourists 
but has kept many chinese from traveling 
in addition an economic austerity program that began last fall 
has meant chinese have less money for vacations many government 
employees have canceled their vacations this year 
the tourists who came to frolic on the beaches of the bohai sea 
about 180 miles northeast of beijing have had plenty of room this 
summer 
even chinas top leaders who usually spend all of august here 
have made only brief visits senior leader deng xiaoping reportedly 
is the only one who has stayed on 
party chief jiang zemin who normally would be here with 
government leaders plotting the nations course is campaigning to 
boost the partys image traveling to the provinces visiting 
factories and eating in workers cafeterias 
usually these places are filled said a taxi driver 
gesturing to private guesthouses in a deserted area of town several 
miles from the center 
in past years the clear water and fresh seabreezes of beidaihe 
drew visitors from all over the country 
work units from northeastern china have hostels in beidaihe for 
selected employees to relax for a week or more 
usually its a sea of people said a tanned junior high 
school student 
a few spots along beidaihes 37milelong beachfront were 
crowded especially the public beach near downtown 
but even in the crowded areas stacks of unrented red and blue 
air mattresses indicated there were fewer people than normal 
along the beidaihe coastline sunbathers dotted the beach the 
men in surprisingly skimpy briefs and women in modest onepiece 
suits 
older beachgoers crouched under umbrellas hiding from the sun 
but the younger ones played in the sand and water 
perceptions of how bad the situation is vary 
the taxi driver said on condition of anonymity that tourism this 
summer was down by twothirds 
sun dali an employee at the jinshan hotel beidaihes fanciest 
said there were so few guests in june that some temporary hotel 
employees were let go but occupancy in august has been 100 percent 
beidaihes tourism office said it didnt have statistics on the 
number of visitors this year but official reports in midjuly said 
there were 1 million fewer tourists than last year when 5 million 
people visited 
the loss is felt by both the government and the smalltime 
private entrepreneurs who run guest houses that charge 135 a night 
for a bed or sell ice cream bars for a few cents on the roadside 
last year 60 percent of the areas tax revenues came from 
tourism and the income of many town residents comes from the summer 
tourism trade 
an elderly man renting air mattresses inner tubes and a rubber 
raft on the beach said he made less than 100 in june compared to 
thousands in past junes 
at the comein restaurant a man serving at the counter said 
there will be only about 20 days of good business in august before 
cooler temperatures and the start of the school year sends the 
tourists home

two prochoice candidates 
outdistanced an antiabortion candidate in a republican primary 
tuesday to fill a vacant state assembly seat putting them in a 
runoff next month 
the primary was south carolinas first election since the us 
supreme court last month gave states more latitude to restrict 
abortion 
according to unofficial results former legislative aide holly 
cork led with 2654 votes to 2226 for developer david ames and 
1805 for robert graves a businessman who opposes abortion said 
beaufort county republican party chairman frank gibson 
the result was expected to be finalized thursday when any 
questionable votes could be challenged if the vote stands as 
expected a runoff will be held sept 5 between miss cork and ames 
gibson said 
miss cork who was bidding to succeed her father the late rep 
william n cork favors a womans right to abortion as does ames 
graves opposes abortion 
miss cork said after the election that the national attention 
focused on abortion made the voters here think about it more 
but said she wasnt sure if it played a role in the primary 
ames said the issue was important but said it would probably be 
less of a factor in the runoff because both he and miss cork are 
prochoice he said such issues as realestate taxes uncontrolled 
growth and traffic and drugs would become more important 
graves said his stand on abortion may have cost him votes 
the issue had dominated the campaign transcending the 
environment education taxes and crime the general assembly is 
expected to decide whether it will place more restrictions on 
abortions when it reconvenes in january 
about 30 percent of voters turned out gibson said compared to 
50 percent to 65 percent in previous primaries he said it was 
really hard to tell whether the abortion issue was the deciding 
factor in the race 
miss cork 23 a former legislative aide to us rep arthur 
ravenel rsc said voters overwhelmingly favor abortion rights 
she said her position was based on personal beliefs not 
political expediency 
ames 45 said he favors legalized abortion and would not support 
legislation to restrict a womans right to abortion but i feel 
that through education we have to reduce the need for abortions 
he said 
graves 51 opposes abortion but favors exceptions for rape 
incest and to save the life of a mother 
cork who was elected to the house of representatives in 1982 
died in june of a heart attack

a smalltown ohio judge isnt getting anywhere 
with his nationally publicized bid to reduce drunken driving by 
imposing stiff sentences on offenders researchers say 
one problem is that although new philadelphia judge edward 
ofarrell routinely orders firsttime offenders to jail the local 
facility is so full they dont have to serve their time for at least 
a year said the study by the aaa foundation for traffic safety 
i think ive known that all along ofarrell said in a 
telephone interview tuesday you cant do it alone 
the study compared drunken driving statistics and interviews with 
motorists in new philadelphia against those of nearby cambridge 
ohio where the sentencing is not as stiff 
researchers said their surveys failed to show less drinking and 
driving in new philadelphia 
even a determined judge like edward ofarrell is incapable of 
creating the needed certainty of punishment on his own the report 
said limited jail space remains an important constraint on the 
ofarrell policies 
farrells antidrunken driving campaign has received publicity on 
numerous national television programs and in newspapers and 
magazines 
in drunken driving cases since 1982 the judge has routinely 
handed out 15day jail sentences to firsttime offenders imposed a 
standard 750 fine rejected plea bargains and required the 
vehicles of restricted drivers to be tagged with a distinctive 
redonyellow license plate 
in cambridge 40 miles south of new philadelphia drunken drivers 
usually get sentences of three days or less in special education 
camps 
the report showed motorists in the two towns had a good sense of 
their relative chances of being sentenced to jail if caught driving 
under the influence but similar numbers of drunken drivers were 
found in both communities during anonymous spotchecks that included 
breath tests 
before changing their driving habits drinkers have to be 
convinced theres a strong likelihood of getting caught and going to 
jail the report said 
a judge ofarrell to be fully effective needs a similarly 
committed community willing to deploy the resources necessary to 
support the struggle to reduce drunk driving the report said 
new philadelphia has just begun work on a new 100bed jail but 
in the meantime theres a 12 to 18month waiting list to get into 
the existing 19bed facility 
the shortage of jail space tends to counteract ofarrells tough 
sentences once sentenced drunken drivers must wait to serve their 
time and if they wait long enough the sentence gets suspended the 
study said 
on a first offender now i am simply unable to get anybody into 
the jails ofarrell said if i dont have a jail to put

television shows are avoiding the blatant 
racial stereotypes of the past but most blacks portrayed still are 
atypical rich happy and living lives free of bias says a study 
of network entertainment 
poverty is invisible on network shows concluded wider 
opportunities for women today in its 12th in a series of reports on 
the way women and minorities are portrayed in the media 
tv denies the reality of racism in america said sally 
steenland who wrote the report racial tension is commonplace in 
the real world but virtually invisible among white and minority 
characters on entertainment television 
wider opportunities for women is a nonprofit group working to 
promote equality in the workplace the study was financed by the 
ford foundation 
an analysis of more than 150 episodes from 30 network 
entertainment series shown last spring found many more blacks 
portrayed and a greater diversity in their characters in the years 
since the kerner report written following the riots of 1968 
faulted television as almost totally white in appearance and 
attitude 
now almost a third of all primetime programs have minority 
characters the study found most are blacks hispanics asians and 
indians still are only sporadically featured 
blacks on the screen do not live lives comparable to blacks in 
the real world the study said 
on tv it said nine out of 10 minority characters are rich or at 
least solidly middle class whereas in reality more than 40 percent 
of minority men and 60 percent of minority women live on less than 
10000 a year 
the report said 93 percent of the producers of the 30 shows were 
white it cited that as the reason for what it called the 
unrealistic portrayals on television 
if televisions integrated world is a happy one if racism does 
not intrude into tvs workplace or neighborhood if minority 
characters are nearly identical to their white buddies the reason 
might be because white producers and writers are creating characters 
and developing plots out of their own experience and mindset it 
said 
all viewers are the losers when minority characters are created 
almost exclusively by white writers and producers the report argued 
white viewers lose because they rarely see their reflection 
from someone elses eyes it said in addition they are 
absorbing images of others which lack dimension and authenticity 
black hispanic asian and native american viewers suffer 
because the complexity and reality of their lives are distorted into 
something that is unrecognizable 
also minority characters created by white producers and writers 
lose their uniqueness the report said 
the overall impression the viewer receives from most of these 
minority characters who mix so easily with their white colleagues is 
that they might as well be white themselves it said 
almost nowhere can the viewer detect any distinct racial 
identity in fact it sometimes seems as if the characters are 
actually white and are merely unconventionally cast with minority 
actors playing the parts 
that is not always the case though it said citing shows like 
la law miami vice 21 jump street tour of duty and 
china beach as among those in which racial differences are 
acknowledged and greater ethnic diversity does appear 
the report also found some value in black situation comedies 
which show a friendly world where problems are manageable and 
negativity can be turned around 
it could be argued that such a harmonious picture of black life 
showing people striving and succeeding without having to overcome 
racial barriers paints the world the way it should be and 
offers relief from the way the world really is it said

the 50 billion savings and loan bailout signed 
by president bush this month probably isnt large enough federal 
regulators are indicating after a look at new figures on the 
industrys health 
the nations 2934 sampls lost 37 billion in the apriljune 
quarter up from 35 billion in the first three months of the year 
the office of thrift supervision said tuesday it was the biggest 
loss since the record 41 billion loss in the second quarter of 
1988 
the latest discouraging report came just two weeks after 
president bush signed legislation authorizing 50 billion to close 
or sell failed institutions over the next 26 months 
during the six months leading up to the bills approval 
administration officials repeatedly said they believed 50 billion 
would be adequate although they couldnt guarantee it 
now regulators statements indicate that private analysts 
probably are right in predicting the administration will have to 
come back to congress for more money 
david c cooke executive director of the resolution trust corp 
the new agency charged with the cleanup said tuesday the 50 
billion wont cover much more than 500 failed sampls the agency now 
has 264 insolvent sampls in its control after closing seven this month 
if it gets up to 500 it will probably be awfully tight i can 
tell you that cooke told reporters at a luncheon our best hope 
is it will be a little more than 400 
meanwhile james r barth chief economist of the office of 
thrift supervision which regulates the industry said at a news 
conference that he expects upwards of 600 failed sampls will 
eventually be transferred from his jurisdiction to cookes agency 
barth said 401 institutions already were insolvent at the end of 
june up from 394 three months earlier 
he estimated another 1200 sampls dont meet stricter standards in 
the bill requiring institutions to have more capital as a buffer 
between losses and the sampl insurance fund many of those will 
survive by shrinking retaining profits or attracting outside 
investors but others wont 
are there circumstances under which the 50 billion is 
enough barth asked in a telephone interview its possible 
under very favorable circumstances but any sort of adverse 
circumstances make it increasingly likely that additional funds will 
have to be found to deal with insolvent institutions 
for the first half of this year losses were mounting at a rate 
that could make 1989 the worst year for the savings industry since 
the depression topping 1988s record of 134 billion 
most of the loss this year is attributed to recognition of 
problems with loans that started going sour long ago but private 
analysts point out that for the first time since last years 
januarymarch quarter the thrift industry is failing to make a 
profit on current operations 
the second quarter operating loss was 400 million down from a 
400 million profit in the first quarter a swing attributed to 
rising interest rates earlier this year 
rising interest rates help push sampls into the red because they 
have to pay more to attract deposits even though earnings on 
mortgages already in their portfolio remain flat 
the operating loss figures show the extent to which this 
industry is still very vulnerable to interest rate fluctuations 
said bert ely a financial institutions analyst in alexandria va 
the resolution trust corp is trying to bring down the cost of 
deposits by injecting 15 billion to 16 billion in government funds 
into ailing thrifts before sept 30 cooke said the agency 
estimates that will cut losses by about 500 million a year 
in the second quarter as in the past losses were concentrated 
in texas but for the first time california and arizona rivaled the 
oilproducing states which have been plagued for several years by 
bank and sampl failures 
texas losses totaled 13 billion a little more than a third of 
the 35 billion in red ink recorded in the state during the same 
period a year ago 
california thrifts lost 950 million the secondworst total in 
the nation and a sharp turnaround from profits of 127 million a 
year ago sampls from arizona which is suffering a real estate 
downturn lost 515 million a marked deterioration from the 58 
million loss a year ago 
barth said the california loss was heavily influenced by two 
large institutions which were taken over by regulators and forced to 
recognize losses from sour loans 
lincoln savings and loan association in los angeles posted a 788 
million loss while gibraltar savings of beverly hills lost 332 
million he said

environmentalists are criticizing a government 
plan calling for all studies on damage caused by the exxon valdez 
oil spill off the alaskan coast to be completed by february 
this plan could lead to a serious underestimation of harm to 
the environment and a limited recovery of damages from exxon 
sarah chasis a lawyer for the natural resources defense council 
said tuesday 
by february ms chasis said there still will be oil on alaska 
beaches causing additional damage 
the extent of damage on species such as the bald eagle and salmon 
may not be known for years she said because the young born this 
year and exposed to the oil wont return to the region for three or 
four years 
only then will the extent of the damage begin to be known 
she said 
the timetable for completion of the studies was included tuesday 
in a 258page government outline on how it will proceed with the 
staggering task of determining how much exxon corp should pay to 
restore the alaska environment following damage from the march 24 
tanker spill that dumped 11 million gallons of oil into pristine 
prince william sound 
the document released by the interior department made no dollar 
assessment of damages and suggested in only broad terms what studies 
should be made to determine the effect of the spill on wildlife 
birds fish and other natural resources 
however the report directs that all environmental studies to be 
used in determining damage should be completed over the next six 
months 
no further studies will be conducted after feb 28 1990 
unless a government trustee council and scientific and legal review 
groups determine they are needed the report said 
interior spokesman bob walker acknowledged there were discussions 
on whether to allow longer environmental studies but that there was 
a concern such studies would drag out the process 
the trustees wanted to get to restoration as fast as possible 
and not take a leisurely approach to studying whatever needs to be 
studied walker said 
the proposed timetable and blueprint for determining damages was 
prepared by government trustees representatives of three federal 
agencies and the state of alaska who are charged with making the 
longterm damage assessments 
interested parties were asked to comment before the end of 
september after which the blueprint becomes final a narrowing of 
the assessment to include damage estimates in dollars and the cost 
of restoration is not expected until late next year 
ms chasis said there also is concern that the plan does not make 
clear the role of exxon in the assessment plan 
exxon executives have said they want to participate in the 
determination of damage to wildlife and natural resources as a 
result of spill the government document said a decision on whether 
to allow exxon to participate and if so to what extent has not 
been made

a sharp increase in 1989 output of corn and 
other feed grains will lower livestock feeding costs and stimulate 
domestic use but the agriculture department says foreign 
competition also is picking up 
on a tonnage basis total us feed grains output corn 
sorghum barley and oats is estimated at 2176 million metric 
tons based on aug 1 production estimates announced earlier this 
month 
thats up 46 percent from last years droughtreduced harvest of 
1492 million tons part of the increase is due to a 14 percent 
boost in harvested acreage 
but total feed use in 198990 is expected to be about 226 million 
tons up 5 million tons from the 198889 forecast domestic feeding 
is forecast to increase by almost 9 million tons but export may 
drop because of greater foreign competition 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn the usda uses metric tons to measure overall feed supplies 
and use and bushels when referring to specific grains 
with use likely to exceed production us stocks in 198990 
may drop more than a tenth the departments economic research 
service said tuesday however prices are also expected to decline 
because of lower loan rates and reduced drought psychology in the 
market 
world production of coarse grains such as corn is projected at 
800 million tons up 10 percent from 198889 the report said that 
includes us output 
while total foreign production may be nearly unchanged 
significant increases are expected in the major competing exporters 
except for the european economic community and south africa it 
said a tightening in the world coarse grain supplyuse situation 
appears likely in 198990 
the report said world feed grains consumption is expected to 
increase in 198990 exceeding production for the third straight 
year 
in a related government report the joint agricultural weather 
facility said its weekly survey for aug 1420 showed that the 
nations corn crop was in good to fair condition and that 68 
percent of the acreage was in the dough stage of kernel development 
or beyond 
an estimated 26 percent of the corn was in the final dent stage 
of kernel development 
both the dough and dent stages are lagging the usual pace for 
corn development in most of the major production states the report 
said 
the facility operated by the agriculture and commerce 
departments reports on weather and crop conditions during the 
season the usda will issue the next production estimate sept 12 
soybeans were said to be in mostly fair to good condition 
with about 92 percent of the crops bloom completed 2 percentage 
points behind the average seed pods were set on 76 percent of the 
acreage 5 percentage points behind the usual pace 
the report also said 
cotton was generally fair to good with 90 percent of the 
acreage setting bolls 6 percentage points behind normal bolls were 
opening on 10 percent of the acres 5 percentage points behind the 
average 
sorghum was in mostly good to fair condition with 70 percent of 
the acreage headed 11 points behind normal 29 percent was turning 
color an indication of ripening 5 percentage points later than 
normal 
rice was in mostly good to fair condition with 77 percent of 
the acreage headed 4 percentage points behind the usual pace 
peanuts were mostly good in alabama georgia and the carolinas 
with digging starting in early georgia fields 
tobacco was fair to good in kentucky with 23 percent of the 
burley cut compared with an average of 18 percent at this time 
north carolina tobacco was fair to good with fluecured harvest at 
47 percent 5 percentage points ahead of normal 
pastures and livestock remained in mostly good to excellent 
condition in the delta and southeast and were generally fair at 
best elsewhere cattle were moved to late summer ranges in idaho 
and nebraska producers are supplementing pastures or moving cattle 
elsewhere for better feed

disbarred lawyer william borders will go to 
jail friday unless he answers questions from senators gathering 
evidence in the alcee hastings impeachment case a federal judge 
says 
this court confines him to the custody of the us marshal 
until he purges himself district judge thomas penfield jackson 
said tuesday after holding borders in civil contempt of court at the 
request of the senate 
the order came hours after borders refused to answer 10 questions 
from sen arlen specter rpa about impeachment charges against 
hastings a 52yearold us district judge from florida 
we do not have any interest in putting you in jail specter 
told borders but that is the established procedure 
borders has been granted immunity from prosecution for what he 
might tell the committee and ordered by a federal court to testify 
but he still balked saying the questions violated his 
constitutional rights including the fifth amendment right against 
selfincrimination 
the husky graybearded borders a washington power broker in the 
1970s arrived in court with two hefty paperback books apparently 
bought over the lunch hour jackson however gave him until 10 am 
friday to put his affairs in order before surrendering to us 
marshals 
specter posed his questions to borders at a session of the senate 
committee gathering evidence in the hastings case 
hastings is accused of plotting with borders in 1981 to obtain a 
150000 payoff and lying about it to a jury that acquitted him in 
1981 borders was convicted in a separate trial disbarred and 
served 33 months in prison 
despite the jury acquittal the house in august 1988 approved 17 
articles of impeachment against hastings charging him with the 
payoff conspiracy perjury and improper disclosure of information 
obtained from a courtapproved wiretap 
the committee will produce a report on the evidence against 
hastings and the senate then will vote on whether to remove him 
from the bench 
under jacksons order borders could purge himself of contempt 
and get out of jail by answering the committees questions 
otherwise he most likely would remain behind bars until the senate 
votes on impeaching hastings that vote is expected before 
midoctober 
the questions posed by specter on tuesday ranged from whether 
hastings received any payoff money to the alleged relationship 
between borders and the late florida mafia boss santo trafficante 
borders replied to each question by citing a statement he made 
july 27 when he also refused to testify before the committee the 
statement said the questions violated his rights 
borders also objected on the grounds that with specter the only 
senator on hand for the session a quorum of the committee was not 
present 
specter however reminded him of a resolution providing that one 
senator constitutes a quorum for purposes of hearing testimony from 
borders the measure was approved before lawmakers left for their 
august recess

nelson bunker hunt says he signed so many 
papers after the 1980 silver collapse began consuming his legendary 
fortune that he cant recall much about documents at the center of a 
155 million dispute with the internal revenue service 
it seems incredible that a person who signed documents 
contemplating and covering vast amounts of money and large amounts 
of activities states he has no idea what im talking about 
irs lawyer deborah butler told us tax court judge jules g korner 
iii 
miss butler hunt responded tuesday from the witness stand 
if you had signed as many thousands of documents as i have you 
might be as vague as i am 
at issue are documents hunt signed to form a 1980 partnership and 
to dissolve it two years later 
hunt and his younger brothers william herbert and lamar formed 
the partnership with their familys placid oil co to repay debts 
from the silver price collapse totaling as much as 2 billion 
the brothers whose fortunes have fallen since their investments 
in the silver market soured are contesting more than 300 million 
in 1982 taxes the irs says are due from the dissolution of the 
partnership 
the irs contends that nelson bunker hunt owes about 155 million 
in 1982 taxes and that william herbert and lamar owe more than 158 
million and 505377 respectively 
the irs contends the partnership was an elaborate sham to provide 
financial relief to the brothers when they didnt have cash to repay 
their silver debts after it was dissolved the irs says the result 
was taxable income to the brothers 
lawyers for the hunts however contend the partnership was a 
legitimate business and dispute that 300 million in taxes was owed 
nelson bunker hunt subpoenaed by the government testified 
tuesday that the partnership agreement tied up all his assets 
including furniture in his home and made it impossible to do 
business 
under the agreement a consortium of banks loaned placid 11 
billion of which 824 million was contributed to the partnership to 
repay the silver debts the brothers in turn contributed north 
dakota coal properties silver and gold stocks 
i was glad to have it dissolved because it was a very 
unworkable situation hunt testified 
according to testimony the banks couldnt lend the brothers 
money directly because of a federal reserve ban on loans for silver 
investments imposed about the time silver prices collapsed 
the judge has ruled that testimony in the lengthy nonjury trial 
in its fourth week must conclude by sept 1

a barrage of lawsuits claiming unsafe handling 
of cancercausing asbestos in buildings across the country may 
represent only a fraction of the violations occurring every day 
federal officials say 
one of the 13 lawsuits filed tuesday said the new york city board 
of education and seven demolition contractors didnt give the 
environmental protection agency a chance to see if asbestos was 
removed properly from 130 school buildings 
the epa has filed this action because we were precluded from 
inspecting this work said john f dolinar an epa lawyer we 
cannot say whether it was removed properly or improperly we have no 
way of knowing 
the suit accused the city education department of failing to tell 
epa officials that it had contracted with a number of companies to 
remove asbestos from the schools seven companies also were cited 
for not reporting their work 
the lawsuits filed by the justice department seek unspecified 
damages against 45 companies individuals and some local officials 
alleging that federal health requirements werent followed when 
asbestos was removed from buildings 
epa officials say those cited are believed to represent only a 
fraction of similar violations that occur daily across the country 
the justice department said it has filed more than 100 similar 
lawsuits over the last five years involving 25 million in 
penalties 
the epa estimated that up to half the asbestosconnected 
demolitions and renovations conducted nationwide may violate 
procedures required by federal air pollution laws the agency last 
year was notified of more than 50000 asbestosrelated projects 
todays coasttocoast effort to punish violators is a message 
to those who ignore the law said henry habicht epa deputy 
administrator asbestos is a known cause of cancer in humans and 
it can be a killer companies which think business as usual means 
ignoring the laws which protect public health will be prosecuted 
the federal clean air act and other laws require that asbestos be 
removed before demolition begins that the cancercausing material 
be wetted down and enclosed in bags and that it be transported in 
covered trucks to approved disposal areas so microscopic fibers 
arent spread through the air 
the inhalation of asbestos fibers can cause lung cancer 
asbestosis a scarring of the lung and mesothelioma a cancer of 
the chest and abdomen 
asbestos was used before the mid1970s as insulation in many 
buildings and the government says more than 730000 buildings still 
contain some of the material 
penalties for violating asbestosremoval requirements could range 
up to 25000 per day of work for each violation epa officials said 
more than 250000 in civil fines may be sought in some cases 
the suits involved renovation o demolition projects on buildings 
in new york pennsylvania virginia florida ohio illinois 
missouri kansas california nevada and washington 
among the projects cited were renovations at public schools in 
woodinville and kent wash a high school in kansas city mo a 
junior high school in holyrood kan and colleges in pittsburg 
kan and berea ohio 
in a separate lawsuit tuesday the asbestos industry complained 
that while there may be concerns about how asbestos is being removed 
from older buildings the epa has failed to demonstrate that 
virtually all asbestos products should be banned 
the epa last month announced a phaseout of most asbestos 
products such as asbestos brake pads and linings and asbestos 
cement water pipes the asbestos information association said it has 
asked the us court of appeals in richmond va to overturn the 
order 
bj pigg president of the industry group called the epa action 
an unfounded politically convenient attack he said modern 
asbestos products pose no significant health risks 
epa spokesman chris rice said the industry lawsuit raises no 
arguments that have not already been considered by the epa

conservationists who fear thousands of 
endangered sea turtles will drown in nets unless gulf coast 
shrimpers are required to use turtle excluder devices are taking 
their case to a federal appeals court 
a us district court judge tuesday denied the national wildlife 
federations request that shrimpers be required to use the devices 
known as teds 
wildlife federation lawyer robert irvin said he would appeal the 
decision by us district court judge stanley harris to the us 
court of appeals for the district of columbia 
on monday five conservation groups filed suit against commerce 
secretary robert mosbacher alleging his actions on behalf of 
shrimpers have virtually assured the drowning of thousands of 
endangered sea turtles 
the lawsuit alleges mosbacher acted unlawfully when he suspended 
regulations requiring shrimpers to use teds which prevent sea 
turtles from becoming ensnarled in the nets and drowning 
mosbacher suspended the regulations after shrimpers angry about 
having to use devices they say reduce their catch by as much as 
onethird blocked shipping channels along the texas gulf coast 
under a court order to protect endangered sea turtles in a 
separate lawsuit by the wildlife federation mosbacher then ordered 
shrimpers who dont use teds to limit their trawling times to 105 
minutes at prescribed intervals 
michael j bean a lawyer for the environmental defense fund 
said there has been no sign that shrimpers are complying with the 
limited trawl times

a man charged in a bizarre plan to kidnap 
a young boy and videotape his murder spent 7 years in a big brother 
program officials say 
dean a lambey of richmond passed all of the agencys screening 
procedures to become a volunteer michael raisig executive 
director of big brothers and big sisters of richmond inc said 
tuesday 
lambey 34 and daniel t depew 28 of alexandria were charged 
monday after a sixmonth undercover police operation with conspiring 
to videotape the abuse and murder of a child 
raisig said a boy matched with lambey for 18 months was assigned 
to another big brother in june 
the fbi came to us when they had reason to believe he was 
involved in illegal activity raisig said we immediately took 
steps that there be no further contact between he and the little 
brother he was assigned to 
raisig said there was no evidence that the child who was not 
identified has been molested 
lambey had been assigned to three boys during his 7year 
affiliation with the organization and raisig said the investigation 
turned up no evidence any of the boys had been molested 
the investigation began after lambey contacted an undercover 
police officer through a computer bulletin board system and 
asked about young boys for a pornographic snuff film according 
to a court document 
i want to strangle the kid i want to hang the kid i want to 
suffocate the kid a court affidavit quoted depew as saying about 
his plans for the child 
more than 100 fbi agents and san jose calif police were 
involved in the investigation us attorney henry hudson said 
tuesday 
fbi agents from richmond and washington followed the suspects 
24 hours a day to make sure no child or citizen was placed in 
danger hudson said 
the investigation began in february when a california police 
officer connected to a computer bulletin board system designed to 
assist people seeking contact with others interested in diverse 
sexual pursuits the court papers said 
over the course of numerous contacts lambey told the undercover 
officer he liked boys between the ages of 8 and 13 and that he was 
interested in making a sexually explicit movie with children 
according to the affidavit filed in richmond 
during one telephone conversation with his police officer 
contact according to the affidavit lambey said i think the 
pleasure of doin it would be worth it 
later in the computer correspondence lambey described a friend 
whom he later identified as depew as being heavily into 
sadomasochism who was interested in taking part 
depew lambey said liked to burn young sex partners with 
cigarettes and partially strangle them 
lambey and depew are charged with conspiracy to kidnap and are 
being held pending grand jury action 
meanwhile a search warrant executed last week at lambeys home 
turned up toys sex aids childrens books mace handcuffs a 
semiautomatic pistol and ammunition according to papers filed in 
us district court in richmond 
muriatic acid which authorities said was to be used to wash away 
identifying marks of the victim was also reportedly found in 
lambeys tool shed 
court papers said authorities found bondage and torture devices 
laughing gas and a white supremacy flag at depews home

one year after iran and iraq agreed to a 
ceasefire in their eightyear war they have failed to sign a peace 
treaty and are rearming 
peace talks that began five days after the ceasefire went into 
effect aug 20 1988 have stalled representatives of the nations 
have not met face to face and there has been no progress in four 
rounds of negotiations through un representatives 
there have been moves to resume the talks in october but 
diplomats say there is little prospect of a breakthrough 
the talks have reached a standstill in disputes over the 
shattalarab waterway the southern border between the two 
countries and iraqs occupation of 1000 square miles of iranian 
territory even though the un ceasefire resolution specified a 
return to prewar borders 
the iraqis have claimed that political divisions in tehran 
blocked progress 
the june 3 death of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini and the election 
of president hashemi rafsanjani on july 28 raised hopes that talks 
would move ahead 
rafsanjani was instrumental in convincing khomeini to accept the 
un security councils ceasefire resolution following a series of 
battlefield defeats 
if rafsanjanis views prevail it could lead to some advance in 
the peace process but theres a lot of skepticism as to whether any 
formal peace treaty will ever be signed said philip robbins an 
analyst with londons royal institute for international affairs 
rafsanjani leader of irans socalled pragmatists declared when 
he was sworn in thursday that iran must try to stop the outbreak 
of war so it can concentrate on the massive task of postwar 
reconstruction 
but he has said iran will not make concessions in peace talks 
unless iraq withdraws from iranian territory 
iraq says there can be no progress until iran allows the 
shattalarab its main outlet to the persian gulf to be reopened 
baghdad says that shortly before it invaded iran on sept 22 
1980 it abrogated a 1975 agreement that drew the border down the 
middle of the waterway 
until then the border had run down the eastern iranian bank 
tehran says the agreement is still valid 
because the peace talks have stalled both nations continue to 
hold an estimated 100000 prisoners of war only a few hundred sick 
and disabled pows have been exchanged 
meanwhile iran and iraq are working hard to replenish their 
arsenals 
the iraqis retain the technological edge they had during the war 
and are likely to maintain it for at least five years as they 
upgrade their soviet and french weapons 
the iranians are replacing their increasingly deteriorating 
ussupplied arsenal with sovietdesigned systems a move analysts 
say will take years to complete 
robbins said that a key factor in whether both sides work toward 
a peace settlement will be the quality of weapons iran acquires 
the iraqis will be very nervous if the qualitative military gap 
is narrowed by the iranians if not accompanied by a formal peace 
settlement he said in a telephone interview 
iran and iraq want advanced technology to develop their own arms 
industries and lessen their dependence on other countries 
iran is believed to have a 20 billion military shopping list and 
is looking to the soviet bloc china and north korea for purchases 
a spate of ceasefire violations mainly by the iranians have 
further poisoned the atmosphere 
the iranians have flooded a large area held by the iraqis in the 
south seeking to force them back across the border 
that tactic has touched off several serious artillery clashes 
along the truce line where opposing forces are only yards apart in 
some places 
a un force has contained these confrontations but observers in 
baghdad have reported a recent increase in violations 
about 1 million people were killed in the eight years of fighting 
and un observers do not believe either side wants a fullscale 
resumption of the war however the observers fear skirmishes could 
easily escalate 
iran and iraq are rebuilding their ravaged cities and towns along 
the border repairing damaged oil installations and constructing new 
factories 
iran desperately needs stability to revitalize its sagging 
economy and carry out reconstruction 
political analysts believe rafsanjani may face challenges from 
irans radicals many of whom opposed the ceasefire and cannot 
afford to move too quickly on any issue that could antagonize them 
president saddam hussein of iraq on the other hand emerged from 
the war firmly entrenched in power his grip strengthened by the 
lightning offensives of early 1988 that drove the demoralized 
iranians out of the iraqi territory they held

photographs of a family vacation dont necessarily 
prove a suspect in the green river slayings was on the east coast 
when the serial killings began the cases chief investigator says 
the proof that they say is conclusive and the proof police 
investigators need involve two different standards king county 
police capt robert evans said 
the family of william jay stevens ii produced photographs and 
credit card receipts last week in an effort to prove stevens was not 
in seattle when the first four victims were killed 
the green river killings involve the deaths of at least 40 young 
women who disappeared from the seattle and portland ore areas 
from 1982 to 1984 
another eight missing women are believed to be victims in the 
case which takes its name from the river where the first victims 
were found 
stevens 38 has not been arrested or charged 
on tuesday the associated press quoted evans as saying the 
familys records appeared to clear stevens of suspicion in the first 
four killings 
but later evans said the records have neither cleared nor 
intensified police interest in stevens 
for example one photo shows this guy with his mother in front 
of a building thats all it is he said 
evans said he had a personal hangup with the familys 
description of the trip as a family vacation 
he was a fugitive from justice at the time how can that be 
called a vacation he asked 
stevens a former gonzaga law school student is serving time in 
the king county jail in seattle for a 1981 escape from a work 
release program after a conviction for possessing stolen property 
he was arrested in january in spokane and is scheduled for 
release sept 25 
stevens was identified as a viable suspect in the affidavit 
used last month to obtain a search warrant of two spokane residences 
where he lived that search yielded 1800 videotapes police 
uniforms and extensive credit card records 
among other theories investigators have speculated that someone 
posing as a police officer was responsible for the killings

the parents of a 4yearold girl whose brain 
was damaged when her brother accidentally shot her have relented and 
will move her to delaware for recommended therapy a hospital 
spokeswoman said 
surgeons at orlando regional medical center said evie hagan has 
regained some movement after partial paralysis but needs extensive 
therapy 
evies shooting by her 6yearold brother was one of several in 
florida this summer that prompted legislators to pass a law making 
it a crime for gun owners to leave loaded weapons where children can 
reach them 
betty and david hagan had abruptly canceled plans to send their 
daughter to the alfred dupont institue in wilmington del saying 
they dont want to be separated from her 
everybody knows that evie is going to walk next month anyway 
and we want god to get the credit not man hagan said monday 
its trying our faith were not fanatical were just using 
wisdom 
the hagans however decided tuesday to send the child to the 
delaware facility said teresa l heavens institute spokeswoman 
earlier tuesday joseph chiaro one of the childs three 
physicians said at a news conference that doctors were considering 
asking the courts to intervene 
to deny her the opportunity to maximize her potential does 
raise a lot of sadness and anger in me chiaro said i would 
like to see everything done for her because evie is going to live 
with this decision 
mrs hagan had said she didnt believe god would let down 
hundreds of their friends and supporters who had been assured that 
god is going to heal evie god has told them and theyve told 
us and encouraged us to stick to your guns 
surgeons removed a bullet fragment from evies brain stem she 
emerged from a coma and remains on a respirator at the hospital 
john tilelli another pediatric surgeon at ormc said a doctor at 
the delaware center felt very optimistic that with proper treating 
and skill she would ultimately walk again

the curator of illinois abraham lincoln 
collection rejected criticism that the documents arent being cared 
for properly saying theres nothing amiss that a little money 
wouldnt fix 
if someone wants to imply that theyre in danger of being 
stolen thats clearly wrong or that these materials are 
threatened in any way thats also wrong curator thomas schwartz 
said tuesday 
the report released monday said the state historical library 
had not properly tagged cataloged and periodically inventoried 
significant parts of its lincoln collection which experts say is 
second only to that of the library of congress 
at issue are about 800 portraits cartoons and prints of lincoln 
and a 46volume collection of the papers of robert todd lincoln the 
16th presidents eldest son who served as secretary of war and 
ambassador to great britain 
schwartz blamed a shortage of funds for the librarys failure to 
complete the project expected to cost less than 20000 
though the state frequently trumpets lincolns ties to illinois 
in tourism promotions some lincoln buffs say the state has 
shortchanged efforts to preserve that heritage 
there have been times at auction where i would buy lincoln 
things and hold them until the state could afford to buy them 
said ralph g newman a chicago manuscript dealer and lincoln 
expert i didnt want to see them get away 
the auditor general issued a similar report in 1986 citing more 
widespread neglect of lincoln documents and artifacts including the 
gown mary todd lincoln wore to her husbands second inauguration and 
a silk tablecloth used on their wedding day 
schwartz said an inventory of the lincolns manuscript letters 
has been completed and that most of the other shortcomings cited in 
the 1986 report have since been corrected 
weve made a conscious effort to identify the most valuable 
items and deal with those first schwartz said we have been 
making progress but the auditor general wont remove the finding 
until we have completed the entire process 
the inventory of the estimated 22000 robert lincoln items has 
proceeded slowly in part because schwartz is the only fulltime 
employee assigned to the lincoln collection and his work is 
interrupted by research demands 
if all i did was to catalog that collection without 
interruption it would probably take me a year a year and a half 
schwartz said but lifes not that simple 
he acknowledged that the lack of a complete inventory means 
library officials wouldnt know if items were stolen or misplaced 
for that reason the papers are locked in a vault and access is 
strictly limited he said 
only two scholars have been allowed to use the robert lincoln 
papers and their work was carefully supervised he said similar 
precautions will remain in place until the long task of cataloging 
the collection is completed 
when you go at it one item one card at a time it just takes a 
long time to do it schwartz said

the ronald reagan birthplace museum is 
having a little law and order problem and is closing its doors until 
its solved 
on monday night vandals broke a skylight during a rainstorm and 
furniture donated by relatives of the former president was badly 
damaged 
vandalism has been constant said paul nicely a 70yearold 
retired schoolteacher he and his wife helen put together the 
museum in the secondfloor apartment where reagan was born on feb 
6 1911 
well be closed until the problem is solved he said in a 
telephone interview tuesday 
the kids in town have become a real problem nicely said 
we cant keep an american flag out they keep bending the pole 
or swinging on the pole theyve been breaking windows they throw 
eggs on the place last week they destroyed our tv disc 
nicely opened the museum in 1976 in this dusty farming town in 
northwestern illinois it was timed to coincide with the launch 
there of reagans campaign for the republican presidential 
nomination reagan lost the nomination to gerald ford but met with 
greater success four years later 
some local folks figured the small town of 900 residents might 
become a tourist attraction so the usual gift shops antique stores 
and restaurants sprang up only to wither when the boom failed to 
materialize 
but nicely kept his privately financed museum going he said that 
over the years perhaps 60000 visitors have come to view memorabilia 
from the reagan family friends and relatives and the general store 
where reagans father worked 
weve had more visitors this year than we ever had nicely 
said adding that the museum is coming off a loss of 12000 in 1988 
nicelys fee schedule is a little whimsical a lot of people pay 
1 but senior citizens school kids and adults in groups pay 50 
cents ministers secondtime visitors and others for various 
reasons pay nothing 
so theres not a lot of money to pay for the estimated 10000 in 
repairs necessitated by vandalism 
we had 10 people from florida when we opened up nicely said 
you can imagine how embarrassing it was with the broken skylights 
and water damage thats when we decided to close it up until we get 
this thing under control

a man who says he was the lover of us 
rep stewart b mckinney who died two years ago of aids said he 
has decided to speak publicly about the relationship to protect his 
inheritance 
im about broke arnold r denson said promises were made 
and they werent kept 
mckinney 56 a liberal republican who died during his ninth term 
in congress left a car and a 40 percent share of his washington 
house to denson according to documents on file in probate court 
densons share of the estate is worth at least 59200 but he 
hasnt received it because mckinneys widow lucie filed a 
conflicting claim mrs mckinney who administers the estate lived 
in connecticut while her husband spent weekdays at a house in 
washington where denson had what her lawyer said was an attached 
apartment 
stewart was my lover we lived together for five years 
denson said he displayed photographs bills and other documents to 
support his claim in an interview monday after a probate hearing in 
which the judge gave no indication of when he will rule 
mrs mckinney an heir to the procter amp gamble fortune and to an 
oil and railroad fortune testified monday that her husband borrowed 
432552 from her trust fund and promised to pay her back if the 
court upholds that debt mckinneys 284953 estate will have no 
money left for denson 
denson a 34yearold real estate agent said he and mckinney 
kept their relationship secret from the congressmans family until 
he was on his death bed at that time he said mckinneys family 
assured him he would receive the property willed to him if he kept 
silent about the relationship 
i kept the press off their backs denson said honestly 
when stewart died i didnt know a will existed 
vic basil former executive director of the human rights campaign 
fund the major washingtonbased political action committee for 
gaylesbian issues corroborated densons claim 
i was never in their bedroom but they had every appearance of 
a gay couple basil said 
after mckinney died his doctor issued a statement saying the 
congressman had contracted aids from a blood transfusion he received 
after heart bypass surgery in 1979 that was before blood was 
screened for the aids virus 
denson said he has recently tested negative for exposure to the 
virus but that two previous lovers of mckinney have died of aids 
when informed of densons statement mrs mckinney on monday 
again denied that her husband was homosexual 
you caught me at a loss she said i guess it follows the 
little blackmail letters weve been receiving she refused to 
elaborate 
her attorney lawrence j halloran of new britain said she was 
referring to a call she received several weeks ago in which a man 
claiming to be denson told her to pay him or he would go public with 
his story 
denson denied any contact with mrs mckinney since her husbands 
death denson said he has been living in georgia in a gay community 
that he does not want to identify because he doesnt want his 
neighbors harassed

a music schools requirement that graduates 
sightread music discriminated against the blind the us 
department of educations office of civil rights ruled 
the berklee college of music one of the largest independent 
music schools in the nation has for years required its students to 
show they can sightread sheet music as part of the core curriculum 
the school warned blind applicants that they could never fulfill 
core requirements and therefore would not graduate most were 
discouraged and did not apply the boston globe reported today 
thomas j burns regional director of the new england division of 
the office of civil rights said qualified blind students should not 
be held back based on their inability to perform a single test 
i think its a very important right thats been clarified he 
said the case was unique and certainly the first weve come 
across 
berklee changed its curriculum and graduation requirements before 
the ruling to deemphasize sight reading said lawrence bethune 
dean of the 2900 students at the school 
this is certainly noteworthy said kenneth jernigan 
executive director of the national federation of the blind this 
case recognizes that we are really dealing with a civil rights 
matter and thats a refreshing change 
the case began two years ago when a visually impaired woman 
decided to apply to berklee and was told she would not graduate her 
mother filed a complaint with the office of civil rights the office 
ruled against the school last month 
a curriculum committee at berklee had been looking at the core 
requirements and decided to change the sight reading requirement 
irrespective of the discrimination case bethune said 
the problem we had was that at the time we felt the standard 
could not be modified he said but we have no bone to pick with 
blind students we accept them and were happy to have them

the communist party strongly condemned a 
secret sovietgerman agreement that divided poland at the start of 
world war ii 
in a statement released tuesday the eve of the 50th anniversary 
of the agreement the partys politburo said the pact flagrantly 
violated international law 
the secret protocol to the pact defined spheres of influence and 
allowed for the occupation of eastern poland by the soviet union and 
western poland by nazi german troops 
party spokesman jan bisztyga responding to questions at a news 
conference said the statement did not mean that poland would seek 
to regain territory in present day byelorussia lithuania and the 
ukraine that remained in soviet hands after world war ii 
he also said there were no plans to seek any war damages from the 
soviets 
the soviet union had long denied the existence of the secret 
protocol agreed to on aug 23 1939 by soviet foreign minister 
vyacheslav molotov and german foreign minister joachim von 
ribbentrop 
the agreement also led to the soviet annexation of lithuania and 
the baltic states of latvia and estonia 
eight days after the pact was signed germany declared war on 
poland to start world war ii on sept 17 1939 soviet troops 
occupied poland from the east claiming that the polish government 
had collapsed and that they were coming to protect byelorussian and 
ukrainian nationalities in poland 
the politburo branded the secret protocol and a subsequent sept 
28 1939 germansoviet agreement that adjusted their border through 
occupied poland as nonexistent and invalid from the very 
beginning 
this leaves no doubt about the political legal and moral 
assessment of those treaties foreign ministry spokesman wladyslaw 
klaczynski later told the state pap news agency 
however the politburo said its statement was intended to have no 
bearing on the borders decided after the war and existing in 
europe 
after the war poland lost about 71300 square miles of its 
prewar eastern territories to the soviet union it was compensated 
with a smaller amount of german territory in the west

fiery rhetoric leftist ideology an arsenal of guns and the 
threat of violence brought the young members of the black panther 
party international prominence from the groups founding in 1966 
through the early 1970s 
huey p newton an eloquent speaker cofounded the panthers with 
bobby seale in the offices of the old north oakland neighborhood 
poverty program and served as its defense minister and chief 
ideologue 
at their peak the panthers were a national organization that ran 
food programs and schools for ghetto youths taught defense against 
violent attacks by drug dealers and police and served as a 
counterpoint to the pacifistic side of the civil rights movement 
newtons numerous arrests and legal battles kept him in the news 
until his death tuesday other panthers died young or went to jail 
and some went on to careers with lower profiles 
here are some of the figures who made the black panthers a voice 
of hope for some a cry of anguish for others and a source of fear 
for many 
bobby seale 52 served as panther chairman and is now a 
graduate student in political science at temple university and works 
as a community liaison in philadelphia among the most enduring 
images of the 1960s is that of seale bound and gagged in the chicago 
courtroom where he was charged with conspiracy to incite violence at 
the 1968 democratic national convention his conviction for contempt 
of court was later overturned he also was acquitted of killing 
another panther he returned to oakland in 1973 and came close to 
being elected mayor later he was purged from the party by newton 
eldridge cleaver 53 who was panther information minister and 
author of soul on ice one of the seminal works of the black 
power movement cleaver who ran for president in 1968 on the peace 
and freedom party ticket later fled the country following a 
shootout between panthers and the police he split with newton in 
the early 1970s and was purged from the party he spent time in 
china algeria and north vietnam and later said his experience with 
communist governments contributed to a profound political 
conversion returning to the united states cleaver became a 
bornagain christian and republican he unsuccessfully sought the 
gop nomination for the us senate in california in 1986 cleaver 
was placed on probation last year after separate convictions for 
burglary and cocaine possession he recently told ebony magazine 
that he lectures to conservative groups and makes and sells ceramic 
objects 
bobby rush 42 panther deputy defense minister and head of the 
groups chicago chapter rush left the panthers after a 1969 police 
raid on a chicago apartment in which fred hampton 20 and mark 
clark 21 were shot to death after being jailed in 1971 on a 
weapons conviction rush said he realized that political power would 
come only through the electoral system he was elected to the 
chicago city council in 1982 and continues to serve as an alderman 
a father of five rush also runs his own financial consulting firm 
elaine brown panther chairwoman from 1974 to 1977 when newton 
was in cuba under brown the panthers concentrated on community 
projects in oakland calif including school breakfast programs 
health clinics and legal aid to the poor she ran unsuccessfully for 
oakland city council in 1973 and 1975 and served as a delegate for 
former california gov jerry brown at the democratic national 
convention in 1976 she now works for a los angeles attorney 
raymond masai hewitt the panthers education minister from 
1969 to 1971 hewitt died of a heart attack in los angeles last year

a life sentence at san quentin prison 
johnny spain 40 joined the panthers while at san quentin 
serving time for a 1966 robberymurder he taught a course on the 
criminal justice system at stanford university last year and hopes 
to teach a similar course at the university of california at 
berkeley next term he also has been working as an electrician a 
federal appeals court ruled tuesday that spain is entitled to a new 
trial in the 1971 killings of two prison guards saying his trial

illinois

percent said kt sullivan membership director for the groups

relentlessly attacked his democratic opponent massachusetts gov 
michael dukakis for being a member 
the attacks on the organization during the presidential 
campaign and recent anticivil liberties decisions by the us 
supreme court have combined to arouse public support ms sullivan 
said tuesday 
the groups illinois membership which totals about 14000 and is 
concentrated in the chicago area was also boosted by interest in 
the fight to keep abortion legal she said

huey p newton the guntoting 
rhetoricspewing revolutionary who cofounded the black panther 
party fought white authority from an early age refusing to submit 
to racism in school or in the streets 
the son of a baptist minister newton never could abide by his 
parents admonition to learn to take a little more from whites 
rather than fight back 
instead newton turned to militant poses and angry words calling 
the police pigs and taking up arms with the panthers the group 
which for a time did grassroots political organizing and fed 
breakfast to poor children in black ghettos was about much more 
than guns but guns were always part of their image and newtons 
life 
on a shabby street in a poor neighborhood where drug deals and 
gun battles are common a gun was the instrument of newtons death 
early tuesday 
to tom orloff a prosecutor whose efforts to convict newton of 
the slaying of a 16yearold prostitute were twice stymied by 
deadlocked juries newton was a gangster i didnt see anything 
political about him at all orloff said 
to his friend and lawyer fred hiestand newton by the time he 
died was a scarred survivor with a powerful intellect who didnt 
seem to be able to find a role for himself 
newton went through five murder trials and several other legal 
battles in 1980 he earned a doctor of philosophy degree from the 
university of california at santa cruz his dissertation was titled 
war against the panthers a study of repression in america 
born in monroe la on feb 17 1942 huey percy newton was the 
youngest of seven children his father a minister in new orleans 
moved the family to california a year later and took a job with the 
oakland streets department 
newton said in a 1968 interview that he became aware as a public 
school pupil of white teacher prejudices 
to compensate for this lack of ability we saw in ourselves we 
would say that whites were smarter but we were stronger he said 
we didnt understand that the white boys had gotten a head start 
from their families because many of them were middle class and 
through the experience of hearing their families exchange ideas over 
the dinner table they learned to cope with ideas 
newton said he avoided his home as much as possible and spent 
time at school courting trouble by challenging the school 
administration he said he was suspended 20 to 30 times and that 
such challenges by black students led to confrontations with the 
police who were very brutal to us even at that age 
newton attended merritt college on the edge of an oakland black 
ghetto he was exposed to ideas of black nationalism but also to 
the streets he was arrested for theft and burglary and in 1964 
sentenced to a year in jail for assault with a deadly weapon 
after his release he and a friend from merritt bobby seale 
talked of the need for blacks to have a revolutionary political 
party that would deal mainly with the problems of ghetto youths 
the only logical response to police brutality they thought was 
an armed black panther party for selfdefense the name was taken 
from the lowndes county freedom organization in alabama which 
adopted the black panther as a symbol 
the panthers armed themselves with shotguns law books and tape 
recorders and monitored police as they patrolled the ghetto 
in 1967 newton was arrested on charges of killing a police 
officer only a few blocks from the scene of his own death he 
later was convicted of manslaughter but released in 1970 when the 
verdict was overturned because of errors by the trial judge 
in 1974 he was charged with the prostitute slaying and the 
pistolwhipping of a tailor who angered him by calling him baby 
newton went into selfexile in cuba where he worked in a cement 
factory until returning to the united states in 1977 
newton is survived by his wife fredrika slaughternewton a son 
two daughters three brothers and three sisters

from tahitian tree snails to arabian antelopes 
international wildlife conservationists say they are succeeding in 
saving some of the worlds endangered species 
about 200 specialists of the world conservation unions species 
survival commission met in rome this week to discuss ways of 
protecting animals threatened by poaching destruction of habitat 
and encroachment by man 
the union based in gland switzerland groups governments 
government agencies and nongovernmental organizations such as the 
sierra club 
the threeday rome meeting which ended tuesday examined the 
wellknown plight of the african elephant whose numbers have 
dropped from 13 million to 700000 in the past 10 years because of 
poaching 
but the experts also discussed the prospects for saving 
lesserknown species such as the mediterranean monk seal himalayan 
snow leopard florida panther javan rhinoceros and liberian 
mongoose 
in many cases the answer is breeding animals in captivity and 
releasing them in the wild 
its only in the past few years that captive breeding has 
become an integral part of conservation said ulysses s seal a 
professor at the university of minnesota who is chairman of the 
unions captive breeding group we project that 1500 animals 
birds and reptiles will need captive breeding in the next 50 years 
right now we have more than 125 species on our plate 
those include the arabian oryx a large antelope that became 
extinct in the wild but was saved by breeding in zoos in london 
phoenix and elsewhere wild herds now roam oman jordan and saudi 
arabia 
this is the flagship example of a dramatic species saved from 
extinction by captive breeding seal said in an interview 
another success story involves the blackfooted ferret a member 
of the wyoming weasel family only 17 were left in the wild in 1985 
but captive breeding has brought the population up to 124 
we predict that in two years the population will expand to more 
than 500 and in 1991 we plan to start releasing them back into the 
wild seal said 
he also cited efforts to save the partula a species of tiny tree 
snails found on the tahitian island of moorea the species was 
virtually wiped out by carniverous snails imported from florida but 
the surviving partula have been taken to a dozen zoos in four 
countries for breeding seal said 
the next target is the javan rhino the lumbering beasts once 
roamed across much of indochina but today only 50 are left on the 
island of java seal said the union is working with the indonesian 
government to begin a captive breeding program next year 
captive breeding is not the answer for all animals however 
especially members of the cat species 
there is some captive breeding but there are a lot of problems 
in reintroducing a large predator that is captive bred said peter 
jackson chairman of the conservation unions cat specialist group 
for one thing people are afraid of them also a cat has to learn 
how to hunt from its parents it doesnt come naturally 
nevertheless conservationists have succeeded in saving the the 
lynx which was extinct in western europe at the turn of the 
century more than a dozen were caught in the wild in czechoslovakia 
and released in the swiss and french alps in the early 1970s sixty 
to 80 lynx survive in the wild today jackson said 
conservation has taken a unique twist in india where maneating 
tigers have killed more than 500 people in the sunderbans mangove 
forests of west bengal since 1975 
it seems that tigers only attack their prey from behind so three 
years ago wildlife officials began issuing rubber face masks for 
sunderbans workers to wear on the backs of their heads 
since then no one wearing a mask has been attacked jackson said 
some were attacked after they had just taken off the mask for 
lunch he said tigers have been seen following those wearing 
the masks but they have not pressed home the attack 
for all the attention devoted to tigers elephants rhinos and 
others animals it is some of the worlds smaller species that are 
most at risk specialists said 
people focus on the larger species that they are going to 
miss said george rabb president of the chicago zoological park 
and chairman of the species survival commission but for every one 
of these at least 5000 species disappear every year mainly small 
insects living in rain forests 
you could almost bet that the most endangered species in the 
world is not known to science added martin holdgate director 
general of the union it is living somewhere in the canopy of a 
rain forest one of these unknown inconspicuous insects no 
scientist will miss it except as a statistic

if youve got that the rest really follows from it

renta and model lauren hutton among other people and trends 
she was and remains the only genius fashion editor

fashion world for over four decades described as an elegant crane 
picking her way out of a swamp by english designer sir cecil 
beaton vreeland was known for her lacquered black hair rouged 
cheeks and ear lobes and red lips and nails 
vreeland discovered hutton in 1966 when other fashion 
impresarios considered the gaptoothed beauty too unusuallooking to 
be a model 
mrs vreeland was a genius for understanding that society 
expressed itself visually whether it was through fashion whether 
it was through photography whether it was through the way that 
people lived said john ross a spokesman at the metropolitan 
museum of art she always understood the cutting edge and she was 
usually a little ahead of it 
in 1972 vreeland became special consultant to the costume 
institute of the metropolitan where she was noted for revolutionary 
exhibitions like a retrospective of the work of spanish designer 
balenciaga and a survey called the 10s the 20s the 30s 
an exploration of a group of leading paris designers

banker and yale graduate vreeland died in 1966 they had two 
children thomas reed vreeland now an architect and frederick d

the school which has educated many of the arab worlds most 
prominent figures was forced to suspend classes in march when heavy 
shelling erupted between syrians in west beirut and the largely 
christian army of gen michel aoun in east beirut 
since then 70 shells have hit the campus located in west 
beirut salti said 
he said most of the damage was superficial however and that 
none of the staff or 5300 students had been killed largely because 
classes had been suspended 
he said the universitys 421bed hospital and medical school have 
continued to operate although a shortage of nurses has cut 
operations by a third the american university hospital is by far 
lebanons largest and most sophisticated medical center 
before the nations civil war began in 1975 the hospital was the 
most popular in the middle east with people arriving from all over 
the region for treatment 
salti said the school had become used to battles and ceasefires 
during the past 14 years but that the current round of fighting 
which began in march was probably the most cruel the most 
protracted of the war 
scores of westerners have been kidnapped or assassinated in 
beirut in recent years 
there currently are 16 westerners held hostage in lebanon eight 
are americans 
three of the hostages were employed by american university 
thomas sutherland 58 scottishborn acting dean of agriculture was 
kidnapped june 9 1985 american joseph cicippio 58 acting 
comptroller has been held since sept 12 1986 brian keenan 32 of 
britishruled northern ireland an english language teacher has 
been held since april 11 1986 
longest held is terry anderson 41 chief middle east 
correspondent of the associated press who was kidnapped march 16 
1985 
salti said if the university can meet its sept 11 target date 
for reopening classes or even one in october it should be able to 
make up for the lost time by holding classes through scheduled 
vacation breaks 
if a ceasefire is declared tommorrow in a few days the campus 
will be a beehive of activity again he said 
salti said the war has driven away nearly all of the foreign 
staff who once made up 30 percent of the faculty and has reduced 
nonlebanese students to about 10 percent of enrollment 
but he said interest from nonlebanese students remains strong 
partly because of the schools standards location and low cost 
and despite all the problems facing american university its 
premed students recently scored above the us average on the 
standard american test used to rate qualifications for medical 
school salti said

an 11yearold boy who collapsed last month during 
a rollercoaster ride at six flags over georgia died from a 
seizurelike disorder a medical examiner concluded 
after a monthlong investigation cobb county associate medical 
examiner wayne ross said tuesday that the twominute ride apparently 
aggravated a previously undiagnosed condition in william brett 
pope of talladega ala 
somehow i feel that the ride through the acceleration or the 
gforces lowered his seizure threshold ross said 
he said the results do not mean the ride is dangerous for people 
in good health 
ross said his office learned about two incidents involving brett 
that might constitute a pattern of similar episodes one was a 
neardrowning last year 
ronald pope bretts father on tuesday said he accepted the 
medical examiners conclusions but rejected assertions that the past 
incidents are connected to his sons death 
when he got on that ride he was a healthy boy pope said

earthquakes this week spawned 
landslides that killed two people and hundreds of livestock 
destroyed a halfdozen bridges and left a major highway impassable 
the ethiopian news agency reported 
eight people also were injured in the four temblors that hit 
northeastern ethiopia sunday through tuesday the quakes registered 
as high as 65 on the richter scale the agency reported tuesday 
the fatalities occurred when landslides overturned four trucks 
and badly damaged a 19mile stretch of highway leading to the red 
sea port of assab the agency said 
the port handles 70 percent of ethiopias trade as well as much 
of the relief food needed by refugees and drought victims in this 
impoverished east african nation ethiopias only oil refinery also 
is at the port 
the agency said six bridges also were destroyed in the earthquake 
assab officials said the landslides killed 250 camels and goats 
and covered many of the water wells in the arid region 
much of the regions seminomadic population had fled the area 
seeking shelter and food from nearby villages the news agency said 
the earthquakes epicenter was described as 320 miles northeast 
of the capital addis ababa between the towns of dubti and serdo 
earthquakes of similar severity hit the same region in 1961 causing 
several buildings to collapse 
the richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a 
seismograph every increase of one number means the ground motion is 
10 times greater a quake of magnitude 65 can cause severe damage

huey p newton the charismatic cofounder 
of the black panther party was adrift without a battle to fight in 
his final days a close friend said 
newtons bulletriddled body was found before dawn tuesday in a 
neighborhood known for drug violence police had no suspects and no 
motive for the slaying said lt mike sims 
newton 47 was killed in the neighborhood where he began 
organizing blacks more than 20 years ago several miles from his 
present home about 200 mourners marched tuesday night at the scene 
of the shooting some chanting cheering carrying candles and 
holding their fists in the black power salute 
there are those who are going to try and make him look like 
gangster but we know he was a brother we know he was a fighter 
said the rev cecil williams of san francisco one of the 
participants 
fred hiestand a sacramento lawyer who was newtons attorney and 
close friend said newton was struggling to find a niche for himself 
after earning a doctorate overcoming alcohol and drug abuse 
problems and facing life with no criminal charges for the first time 
in 15 years 
he was just trying to figure out where he fit what he was 
going to do trying to shake some alcohol and chemical dependency 
that he acquired but he was doing it all on his own without 
anyones help said hiestand 
hiestand said he saw newton on friday and the former panther 
leader seemed to be ok there was nothing bothering him that he 
talked about hiestand said he believed newton had been drugfree 
for at least six months 
newton was arrested earlier this year for possession of drug 
paraphernalia but police said they had no indication the slaying 
was drugrelated 
he didnt seem to be able to find a role for himself said 
hiestand i think he was like a lot of people who went through 
that period he lived it intensely and it left its scars 
with bobby seale newton founded the black panther party armed 
panther members followed police cars to monitor their activities in 
the black community 
under the slogan all power to the people the panthers also 
operated a school a health clinic and programs for ghetto 
youngsters 
the party drifted into violence and gradually disintegrated as 
members were killed and the fbi infiltrated and disrupted the 
organization 
tuesdays shooting occurred in a neighborhood of rundown 
victorianstyle homes and abandoned buildings 
to us huey newton was a hero said resident fred depalm 
the black panthers were a thing to identify with along with 
malcolm x and martin luther king 
over the years however newton was accused of two slayings and 
stood trial five times his conviction in the 1967 killing of an 
oakland police officer was overturned and two trials in the 1974 
death of a young prostitute resulted in deadlocked juries 
newton went into selfexile in cuba shortly thereafter returning 
to the united states in 1977 
this year he served a 90day sentence in san quentin prison for a 
parole violation and a concurrent term for his plea of no contest to 
misappropriating 15000 in public funds earmarked for a community 
school the party ran 
he was a person who contributed an awful lot to the 
consciousness of this country in the early years of his 
participation in the black panther party said former panther 
johnny spain in the last few years of his life unfortunately he 
wasnt able to contribute 
charles garry who was newtons lawyer for many years said he 
never saw a violent side to newton 
i saw a very sweet side a humane side a dignified side a man 
who was theoretically in favor of a better world but garry said 
newton became paranoid and his personality changed years ago when he 
was targeted by the fbi 
they destroyed him over 10 years ago garry said to me 
huey died 10 years ago 
newton earned a doctorate in philosophy at age 38 from the 
university of california at santa cruz where he wrote a 
dissertation titled war against the panthers a study of 
repression in america 
law enforcement authorities had a different view 
tom orloff who prosecuted newton in an assault case called him 
a man who lived by violence and outside the law orloff said 
when i dealt with him in the late 70s for the crimes he committed 
in 1974 he certainly was nothing but a gangster 
as newton was recalled alternately as a hero and a scoundrel 
hiestand said there was hidden significance to the contrary 
descriptions 
i tell you huey said that contradiction was the ruling 
philosophy of the universe he said

more than 2000 east germans have 
escaped to the west through hungary the past four days and sought 
refuge in west germany a foreign ministry source said today 
the source speaking on condition of anonymity said that so far 
this month about 3300 east germans had illegally escaped from their 
country the refugees have overwhelmed west germanys embassies 
abroad and threatened its relations with communist east berlin 
the source said 2000 east germans who had escaped between 
saturday and tuesday had applied to the west german embassy in 
vienna for travel documents 
he said bonns embassy in prague czechoslovakia was sheltering 
nearly 140 east germans the foreign ministry said that mission was 
closed this morning because its ability to house or help the 
refugees was totally exhausted a handful of the east germans 
could be seen through the fence of the embassys large garden 
sipping coffee and smoking cigarettes early today czechoslovaks 
seeking visas lined up outside 
bonn has also temporarily shut down its missions in east berlin 
where 116 east germans are holed up and in budapest hungary where 
171 had sought refuge there also was one east german at the west 
german embassy in warsaw poland 
the east german government of erich honecker has accused west 
germany of instigating the escapes and warned that relations between 
the two germanies will suffer if bonn continues to harbor the 
refugees 
chancellor helmut kohl said tuesday that he was willing to meet 
with honecker to try to resolve the issue but he also said the 
escapes would not stop unless east berlin gives in to demands from 
its public for social reforms 
while poland and hungary have loosened the communist partys grip 
on power honecker has held fast to policies that severely restrict 
travel and free expression 
many refugees have said they fled across hungarys border with 
austria because they had lost hope for change 
although the closure of the budapest embassy had locked out 
hundreds of east german arrivals west german envoys have been 
quietly issuing passports outside the mission grounds 
that has allowed east germans willing to sneak across the 
hungarian border at night to go directly to west germany instead of 
having to seek travel documents from bonns embassy in vienna 
foreign ministry officials said last week that more than 1000 
passports had been issueed to east germans in budapest after the 
embassy closed 
spokesman peter rothen said today that the ministry would not 
disclose the latest total because of the sensitivity surrounding the 
refugee issue 
tensions between east germany and west germany have been 
exacerbated by the shooting death late monday of an east german 
trying to flee across the hungaryaustria border with his wife and 
child 
hungarys mti news agency said the man kurtwerner schulz 
struggled with a hungarian border guard who tried to stop his flight 
and was fatally wounded when he guards handgun accidentally fired 
the west german foreign ministry has demanded an explanation and 
assurances from budapest that armed force will not be used against 
east german escapees 
bonns ministry for intergerman affairs reported earlier this 
week that more than 65000 east germans have arrived here so far 
this year in the largest migration since the berlin wall was erected 
in 1961 at that time east germans were fleeing at a rate of 2000 
per day 
west germany expects more than 100000 east germans by the end of 
the year

white house physician lawrence mohr 
says its almost as if president bush has invented a new sport 
aerobic golf 
mohr whose job it is to stay within hailing distance of the 
president shook his head in disbelief the other day as he raced 
black doctors satchel in hand to keep up with the president and 
his party as they dashed from green to green 
bush has been spending much of his vacation at the cape arundel 
golf club where the other day he and his party zipped through 18 
holes of golf in one hour and 52 minutes something of a local 
record 
asked this morning about his golf game and why he plays so fast 
bush acknowledged he doesnt like to waste time on the links he 
told reporters he likes to get finished so he has time to do other 
things 
all right the crowd is hushed they sense mr smooth is 
back bush said to no one in particular as he teed off one recent 
day 
its not clear why the president keeps referring to himself as 
mr smooth especially since his golf game remains he admits a 
little ragged but thats what he calls himself and he is after 
all the president 
excuse me mr smooth his principal golfing partner eldest 
son george w bush called out recently 
the president told him to keep quiet that mr smooth did not 
like a lot of talking 
the son and father appear to enjoy goading each other on the golf 
course and its a relationship played out in front of the reporters 
who follow the president from hole to hole 
when bush missed a threefoot putt another ball magically 
appeared in front of him he missed that too another ball suddenly 
was provided he missed again finally on the fourth try bush sank 
the ball 
one of the advantages of being president is you get to putt 
until you make it said bushs son to reporters and photographers 
it was george w bush after all who dared the president to jump 
into the chilly atlantic with his trousers on for 11 and the 
president took him up on it 
for a guy your age you hit pretty good is a common 
observation from bush 42 on the performance of bush 65 
the constant backandforth reveals a closeness between father 
and son that is apparent even to the most cynical observers his son 
sometimes calls the president mr smooth on the golf course and 
sometimes refers to him as mr president and when he seems to 
forget the cameras are rolling its the more straightforward 
dad 
and so it goes following bush and company at a neardaily ritual 
as the president enjoys a vacation scheduled to last until labor day 
he boats he jogs he plays tennis but most of all the president 
is using his free time to brush up on his golf 
just trying to come back after years of not playing bush 
says 
bush has steadfastly waved off serious questions by reporters on 
the golf course 
hey listen bush said the other day vacation i never take 
questions on the golf course it gets you in real trouble very 
serious trouble i cant do it it violates all kinds of rules 
bush almost always drives his own golf cart around the course as 
does his son they are followed by carts containing playing 
partners the white house physician military attache secret 
service agents and a variety of aides 
in addition to his running banter with reporters bush also 
frequently addresses the golf ball 
cmon to the left the nations chief executive directed the 
ball to no effect on another occasion golly get up there 
and sometimes the president does joking dedications such as 
when he was playing with two of his sons george w and jeb im 
dedicating this shot to my wife barbara whos been such a 
wonderful father to these boys here and who couldnt make it up here 
today to the course 
in addition to being allowed to retake putts bush enjoys another 
advantage of being president his final scores are never revealed by 
the white house

the show goes on in the killer whale tank where 
an aggressive orca bled to death after ramming her performing 
partner before thousands of spectators 
sea world officials say they are continuing the shows to maintain 
the routine for the parks other whales including the orphaned 
11monthold calf baby shamu but environmentalists say the death 
of the 6000pound kandu points up that the giant creatures should 
not be in captivity 
killer whales live out in the wild to be 50 to 70 years old but 
only seven to eight years following their capture and this is one of 
the reasons why greenpeace has a longstanding opposition to their 
captivity said ben deeble with greenpeace in seattle 
but sea world veterinarian jim mcbain and other whale experts 
said the altercation between the whales was neither unusual nor 
unprecedented 
ken norris professor at the university of california santa 
cruz who has studied whales for 35 years said killer whales and 
other marine mammals often fight ram chase and nip each other as 
part of maintaining a social hierarchy 
a necropsy on the 14yearold kandu revealed that she suffered an 
upper jaw fracture after striking corky a 25yearold 8000pound 
female killer whale the fractured jaw triggered a hemorrhage into 
her nasal passages 
kandu died monday about 45 minutes after the collision 
this is a difficult time for us whale trainer mike scarpuzzi 
told the audience at a shortened show tuesday 
the best thing to do is to get back into the daily routine with 
normal exercise and activity that these whales so desperately 
need he said what were hoping is to get the baby back into a 
sequence she is accustomed to 
the baby was showing a little confusion and then acts as if 
shes expecting mom to show up at any time mcbain said she was 
agitated monday night but shes much more relaxed now 
baby shamu was nearly weaned at the time of her mothers death 
getting 90 percent of her diet from the 4045 pounds of fish she 
eats daily mcbain said he was optimistic that baby shamu was 
sufficiently independent to survive the loss of her mother 
deeble wasnt so optimistic 
killer whales in captivity have a poor history of success and 
having calves and the chances of having them live to adults is 
poor he said now in this case where the mother is dead its 
going to cut baby shamus chances of survival

tainted drinking water has been linked to the 
cancer deaths of two children and the health problems of six others 
according to two experts cited in a lawsuit against a defense 
contractor and the denver water board 
the lawsuit filed in us district court on behalf of several 
families in the friendly hills subdivision claims that pollutants 
from martin marietta corps aerospace plant at waterton 
contaminated their water supply 
the families say the water board knew about the contaminated 
water long before it closed its kassler treatment facility located 
downstream from the aerospace plant it was closed in december 1985 
because of tainted water 
martin marietta and the water board deny the allegations the 
environmental protection agency and the state health department say 
there is no evidence to link the deaths and disease with martin 
marietta or the kassler plant 
dr janette d sherman former adviser to the epa on toxic 
substances said she had examined six friendly hills children with 
health problems including cancer seizure disorders and a heart 
birth defect as well as the medical records of two children who 
died of cancer 
sherman concluded the deaths and diseases of the children were 
caused by exposure to contaminated kassler water 
dr david ozonoff chief of the environmental health section of 
the boston university school of public health said the childrens 
conditions were caused by exposure to water contaminated by one or 
more toxic chemicals 
among the chemicals he mentioned was hydrazine which is used as 
a rocket fuel at the martin marietta plant 
neither sherman nor ozonoff said whether the aerospace plant was 
to blame for the contaminated water 
the plaintiffs are hoping to convince a federal judge they have 
enough evidence to go to trial 
martin marietta officials on tuesday disputed the physicians 
findings 
we continue to believe that none of the plaintiffs have 
suffered injuries from anything that martin marietta has done 
said judy stowell a company spokeswoman

the chairman of the university of maryland board 
of regents has resigned in a swirl of controversy over his role in 
causing the resignation of the new president of the systems 
baltimore campus 
peter f omalley resigned tuesday following an admission last 
week that he made a mistake in proposing to move two professional 
schools from the jurisdiction of the university of maryland at 
baltimore that proposal caused the abrupt resgination aug 14 of 
umab president augustus a white iii 
the resignation of white a prominent harvard surgeon whose 
hiring was seen by the faculty as a beacon of leadership for their 
campus into the 1990s infuriated the 32member faculty senate the 
senate voted monday to condemn omalleys call to transfer the 
schools of social work and community planning and law from baltimore 
to prince georges county where omalley a lawyer is politically 
powerful 
i am a realist my profession is to solve problems i have gone 
from being part of the solution side of the equation to being on the 
problem side omalley said in resigning the alarming number of 
distractions and the inability to focus on the issues cause me to 
take this step 
white was upset that neither he nor faculty members were 
consulted about the move which he said omalley presented to him as 
a done deal 
omalley admitted his blunder last week and apologized for his 
serious and significant mistake that prompted white to quit 
before he had even started work 
mr omalley has done the right thing i hope his decision will 
make it more likely well be able to get gus white to reconsider 
coming here or at least help us get another candidate of equal 
quality to become president of our campus said robert bennett 
president of the umab faculty senate 
white said through a spokeswoman tuesday that omalleys 
departure did not change his feelings about resigning the umab 
presidency 
his only comment on reconsidering the job is the new 
development does not change his position said the assistant 
suzanne hunerwadeo 
the faculty senates resolution said omalleys resignation was 
the best way for the new university of maryland system to recapture 
its high standards and credibility in national academic circles 
in light of mr omalleys resignation i expect to become more 
involved with plans for higher education in maryland gov william 
donald schaefer said 
schaefer said last week he supported omalley despite the 
controversy over white 
omalley had been chairman of the board of regents since july 
1979

relatives of people killed in the dec 
21 bombing of a boeing 747 held a memorial today in the scottish 
town where the plane crashed and demanded stricter control of 
airline safety 
bert ammerman us president of the victims of pan am flight 
103 also paid homage to the people of lockerbie he said the town 
will always be sacred and have a special place in our hearts 
speaking at a memorial service in lockerbie town hall which 
became a temporary mortuary following the disaster ammerman said 
it is right and proper that from this building where so many of 
our loved ones lay that we pay public tribute to the many people 
from lockerbie and surrounding area from all walks of life who 
enfolded us in a cloak of love prayer and compassion and have in so 
many ways helped us day by day in our mourning and our struggle to 
comprehend this insanity 
all 259 people on the plane died along with 11 people on the 
ground investigators said the aircraft was downed by plastic 
explosives planted inside a radiocassette player 
relatives of disaster victims are pushing for an inquiry into 
airplane safety and say they are not satisfied with the british 
governments responses since the bombing 
flight 103 originated in frankfurt west germany but switched to 
a larger airplane and took on more passengers and baggage in london 
the flight was bound for new york 
we have a duty to the memory of those lost and to travelers of 
the future to demand positive ongoing action to change dramatically 
the current totally unacceptable thinking on air security and 
responses to international terrorism rather than outraged 
condemnation of the culprits said ammerman whose brother tom 
was among the passengers killed 
he criticized the security at heathrow airport saying the 
smugness of the security people that they are doing an effective job 
came through loud and clear 
the feeling we got from them was that their system was fine

voters gave two prochoice 
candidates the nod over an abortion opponent in a primary for a 
state house seat but no ones sure what effect abortion had on the 
election 
neither holly cork a former legislative aide nor david ames a 
developer received 50 percent of the vote so they will compete in a 
runoff election sept 5 to become the republican candidate for the 
seat left vacant by the the death of miss corks father state rep 
william cork 
democrats have not fielded a candidate for the oct 10 general 
election 
unofficial results from tuesdays primary showed miss cork with 
2654 votes ames with 2226 votes and robert graves a 
businessman who opposes abortion with 1805 votes said frank 
gibson chairman of the beaufort county republican party turnout 
was about 30 percent compared with 50 percent to 65 percent in 
previous primaries 
it was south carolinas first election since the us supreme 
courts recent decision giving states more latitude to restrict 
abortion 
the race was watched closely by legislators for signs of public 
sentiment on the issue the general assembly is expected to tackle 
the question of whether the state should restrict a womans right to 
abortion when it reconvenes in january 
leading up to the election the candidates and party leaders said 
abortion would be a pivotal issue in the race 
but tony denny executive director of the state republican party 
said tuesday that hard work may have had just as much effect 
holly cork led the ticket but she also was a very hardworking 
candidate and knocked on more doors than the other two whether she 
led the ticket because of her stand on abortion is hard to say all 
three were strong candidates he said 
as to whether or not this is a referendum on abortion i think 
has yet to be determined 
he said that at the candidates last stump meeting monday night 
two questions were asked about abortion questions also were raised 
on taxes tourism and beachfront management 
ames 45 said the abortion issue was very important in the race 
but it will probably not be as important in the runoff because 
both my opponent and i have views that are much closer than the 
other candidate in the primary race 
miss cork 23 said the national attention on the abortion issue 
made the voters here think about it more 
the abortion issue has magnified in the last couple of weeks 
and thats been the result of the attention that weve gotten 
through the media she said but she added im not sure if 
people were voting for the other candidates for their abortion 
positions

a panamanian opposition leader said today than 
an organization of american states effort to bring about a 
democratic transfer of power in panama has failed because gen 
manuel antonio noriega refused to step down as the nations military 
commander 
ricardo arias calderon a vice presidential candidate in the 
abortive election process last may told a news conference that oas 
mediators made an 11thhour effort over the past few days to achieve 
a solution 
the basic result was to prove beyond any doubt that the one 
issue that remained unresolved from beginning to end of the 
negotiation was essentially general noriega arias calderon said 
at no point did the representatives of the regime consider any 
formula under which general noriega would retire from his position 
as commander in chief 
he now holds the panamanian people as hostage arias calderon 
said comparing the plight of his countrymen to that of the foreign 
hostages being held in lebanon 
the opposition figure spoke hours before oas foreign ministers 
prepared to meet here today for the fourth and perhaps final time to 
discuss panamas political crisis which began in may when 
authorities voided the countrys national election results 
panamas constitution requires a new president to take office by 
sept 1 
us officials asking not to be identified said tuesday it 
appears likely that noriega will arrange for the incumbent 
president manuel solis palma a noriega loyalist to be replaced by 
an equally reliable successor noriega would retain 
behindthescenes control in defiance of bush administration wishes 
ecuadoran foreign minister diego cordovez a member of the 
mediating team indicated in panama the group lacks time to fulfill 
the oas call for a democratic transfer of power in panama 
im rather pessimistic panamanian ambassador juan b sosa a 
leader of the antinoriega forces in washington said tuesday in a 
telephone interview the oas will lose an opportunity to speak 
loudly in support of democracy and freedom i dont see within the 
oas the will to act in defense of the selfdetermination of the 
people of panama 
after a weeklong visit to panama that ended tuesday the 
mediating team was to present a report on their efforts to the oas 
foreign ministers 
since may the oas deadline to achieve a democratic power 
transfer has been extended twice us officials said tuesday that 
it is doubtful a further deadline will be set 
panamas election results were voided amid widespread allegations 
of fraud independent observers said the antinoriega candidate 
guillermo endara appeared to have won by a large margin 
the bush administration noriegas principle antagonist in the 
hemisphere has been pressing for a solution by the time the new 
president is required to take office 
weve supported the oas mission state department deputy 
spokesman richard boucher said tuesday 
weve supported the mandate they have to achieve a transfer of 
power weve stated very clearly that for that to occur noriega must 
go weve stated very clearly our policy that there will be no 
accommodation with the noriega regime 
sosa said tuesday that he will close panamas embassy here aug 
31 that is the eve of the date on which eric arturo delvalle the 
ousted president whom the united states still recognizes as the 
countrys legitimate authority was scheduled to leave office 
delvalle was forced out by noriegas allies 18 months ago but 
sosa with us government support has refused to relinquish 
control of the embassy 
he said it would be inappropriate for him to remain at the 
embassy after delvalles term expires 
we have always maintained we are fighting for a constitutional 
principle sosa said adding that he and his family will move to 
an apartment in washington he intends to continue his struggle 
against noriega he said

billionaire hoteliers harry and leona helmsley 
evaded both personal and business taxes by contriving a clever 
plan to charge millions in personal expenses to their businesses 
a prosecutor said today 
every dollar they spent in this scheme enabled them to save on 
their own taxes and their businesses said assistant us attorney 
cathy seibel they got twice the bang of the buck 
the prosecutor made her closing argument after seven weeks of 
testimony in mrs helmsleys trial harry helmsley 80 was 
separated from the case because of failing mental competence 
mrs helmsley 69 is accused of evading more than 1 million in 
federal taxes by charging personal expenses to her businesses 
former aides frank turco and joseph licari are charged with 
assisting in the scheme 
mrs helmsleys lawyers called only four witnesses two of them 
were tax experts who told the jury that mrs helmsley and her 
husband actually overpaid taxes during 198385 the period covered 
by the indictment 
jurors are expected to begin deliberations friday 
ms seibel today called turco and licari two trusted 
lieutenants who willingly undertook the job of executing the 
scheme 
the prosecutor listed expenses allegedly mischarged by the 
helmsleys including 1 million to enclose a pool at their 
connecticut estate dunnellen hall 500000 for jade art 45000 
for a clock in the shape of the helmsley building in manhattan and 
purchases as minor as milk from a grocery 
it was really a clever plan she said 
ms seibel responded to complaints from the defense that mrs 
helmsley who faces 41 counts including tax evasion mail fraud and 
conspiracy was overcharged it is not an attack on mrs helmsley 
but a fulfillment of our obligation to enforce the law fully and 
fairly she said 
mrs helmsley and turco also are charged with conspiracy to 
extort payoffs from vendors doing business with helmsley businesses 
the prosecution called 44 witnesses a number of whom depicted 
mrs helmsley as arrogant and greedy they described how she 
disputed bills for renovations at her estate and then charged many 
of them to her hotel empire 
three liquor salesmen testified that they were forced to pay 
kickbacks to keep their accounts at helmsley hotels

environmentalists have won a 
victory with a judge ordering los angeles to temporarily stop 
diverting water from streams feeding mono lake a haven for birds 
that has been steadily shrinking 
los angeles officials said the ruling could mean depletion of 
water reserves 
el dorado county superior court judge terrence finney granted a 
preliminary injunction tuesday for the audubon society and the mono 
lake committee which are trying to protect the mono lake nesting 
grounds of california gulls 
finney said diversions from four of the seven streams that feed 
the environmentally sensitive lake surrounded by bizarre formations 
of salt and minerals from the evaporating lake must stop until 
march 30 1990 to allow the lakes water level to rise about two 
feet 
the judge ruled that the gulls would be threatened by coyotes 
that could cross land bridges to island nesting grounds if the lake 
dropped below a level of 6377 feet above sea level 
finney also said mineral deposits exposed as the lake recedes 
could be a source of dust hazardous to people living near the lake 
located on the arid eastern slope of the sierra nevada some 200 
miles east of san francisco 
the diversions provide los angeles with hydroelectric power and 
17 percent of its water but combined with evaporation to lower 
monos shoreline 43 feet between 1941 and 1981 although wet winters 
have periodically raised the level a few feet 
the citys critics have argued for years that unchecked 
diversions eventually will cut the lake to a third its natural size 
raise the lakes salinity and threaten brine shrimp and birds that 
eat the shrimp 
the lakes negit island and twain island are nesting grounds for 
california gulls finney said that when the lake drops to 6376 feet 
a land bridge forms to negit and at 6373 feet theres a bridge to 
twain 
both of these islands were exposed to coyote predation earlier 
in the decade as a result of land bridging and the consequent 
decline in the nesting population is still being repaired he said 
city officials say the ruling means about 15 million will have 
to be allotted to purchase water and energy 
mitch kodama southern district engineer for the los angeles 
department of water and power and manager of mono basin issues said 
the city will have to purchase an additional 50000 acrefeet of 
water the amount needed to cover 50000 acres one foot deep 
because of current drought conditions kodama said the city is 
already buying about four times the normal amount of water from the 
metropolitan water district an agency that serves as a water broker 
for the city and other communities in southern california 
what we see here is a fivefold increase in the amount of water 
we have to purchase from mwd this year kodama said certainly 
the ruling doesnt help us during this drought year in order to 
sell us the water it means mwd will basically be dipping into next 
years storage 
we are extremely disappointed with this ruling because we feel 
there would be no significant impact to the lakes ecosystem this 
year by continuing planned diversions from four mono basin 
streams said james f wickser the dwps assistant chief engineer 
for water 
betsy reifsnider associate director of the mono lake committee 
hailed the judges decision 
i feel this is really a victory for the people of los angeles 
because over 60 percent of those who visit mono lake each year are 
from southern california its their lake too ms reifsnider said

nationalist and moslem forces do not want a clash with france but 
we have to defend our dignity and homeland berri said

reportedly demanded that an international conference on lebanon be 
held

agency 
a threemember arab league committee made up of officials from 
saudi arabia algeria and morocco has been unable to find a 
settlement in the battle between christian troops and syrian and 
allied moslem forces 
in paris european community foreign ministers today issued an 
urgent call for an immediate ceasefire in lebanon and announced 
that a factfinding mission would be sent to beirut within days 
the ministers said the situation in lebanon is fraught with 
danger and urgently appealed to all parties to cease all gunfire 
and bombing on land and sea and all forms of blockade and to 
implement a total ceasefire 
syrian and christian artillery exchanged fire sporadically in and 
around beirut during the night violating a 6dayold ceasefire 
police reported one person was killed and 11 wounded 
that raised the casualty toll since the latest civil war fighting 
broke out march 8 to 790 killed and 2201 wounded 
there were renewed fears that france would join the fray in 
beirut the prosyrian ashsharq daily declared in a frontpage

the threat of a large explosion 
most of the eightship french task force led by the aircraft 
carrier foch carrying nearly 2000 marines was expected off lebanon 
later today 
french officials have said the flotilla was dispatched to 
evacuate 7000 french nationals mostly lebanese with dual 
nationality if the 5monthold battle between christian leader gen 
michel aoun and the syrian army worsens 
but the mission has been threatened by syrianbacked moslem 
forces who claim the warships were sent to support aoun 
aouns estimated 20000 troops outnumbered about 31 by the 
syrians and their moslem allies are besieged in the christian 
enclave north of beirut 
berri said his 6000strong militia which has heavy artillery 
and tanks has ordered all its men in south lebanon to carry arms 
and join other moslem and nationalist forces in confronting the new 
crusaders 
berri said in a statement published by beirut newspapers that 
france will be held responsible for the consequences resulting from 
any military intervention by its warships in lebanon 
the iranianbacked shiite hezbollah or party of god has 
threatened suicide bombings the revolutionary justice organization 
a faction allied to hezbollah has warned that two american 
hostages joseph cicippio 58 and edward tracy 58 are in danger 
if the french force intervenes in lebanon 
aoun was quoted as saying in an interview with paris francesoir 
daily that he had received military supplies from france as well as 
his primary backer iraq despite a syrian blockade iraq is syrias 
main arab rival 
aoun said of course i wish for french military intervention

ringo starr says he drank 16 bottles of wine a day 
at one point during his bout with alcoholism and was frequently 
drunk while recording an album he doesnt want released according 
to court documents 
the former beatles drummer detailed his drinking problems in a 
deposition filed with fulton county superior court judge clarence 
cooper who is considering starrs lawsuit to stop release of the 
album a 30day order blocking release expires thursday 
in his lawsuit against crs records of college park ga and 
producer chips moman starr contends his performance on the album 
recorded in 1987 but never released is below his standards moman 
has said the record could earn 35 million if it is released now 
while starr is on his first us concert tour since 1966 
starr recently underwent a muchpublicized treatment for 
alcoholism 
six or seven years ago i felt i had a real problem he said 
in the deposition filed earlier this week but i couldnt seem to 
deal with it 
i went through a lot of the different stages where i thought 
ill only drink wine and i certainly did that for a while but i 
mean 16 bottles of wine a day was as bad as drinking hard liquor 
starr said that during the recording sessions with moman he and 
the other musicians sometimes were all under the influence he 
also said marijuana was smoked 
moman has testified that he did not allow liquor in his memphis 
tenn studio

president bush today said that soviet 
president mikhail gorbachevs reported counsel to polands 
communists to take part in the new government there was very 
positive 
bush in a questionandanswer session with reporters at his 
vacation home said that although many changes are taking place in 
poland there will be bumps in the road as these countries move 
toward more democracy 
i thought the comment i saw attributed to mr gorbachev was 
very positive in this regard he said 
the president was referring to reports that gorbachev had called 
polands communist leaders and apparently urged them to back away 
from their hard line against participating in a government led by 
the solidarity independent trade movement 
asked about the situation in colombia where president virgilio 
barco is engaged in a crackdown on drug lords who have carried a 
wave of assassinations bush said i have great respect for what 
president barco is trying to do i am convinced he is determined to 
whip the problem to beat it 
and he also said the process of extraditing drugtrafficking 
suspects to the united states for trial should go forward 
regarding the possibility of sending us troops to help colombia 
fight drug cartels bush said that whole question of troop 
speculation i think got out of whack officials have said there 
are no plans to send troops and barco does not want them 
white house spokeswoman alixe glen said tuesday that the us 
government was awaiting a request from the colombian government for 
nonmilitary help she said the united states stands ready to 
provide a variety of assistance including antiterrorist training 
to colombian judges if requested 
bush also said he has no problem with the french sending warships 
to the mediterranean although proiranian militants holding 
american hostages in lebanon have reacted threateningly to that move 
the french have had a longstanding history in lebanon they 
have tried to be a catalyst for peace in lebanoni am not about 
to criticize the french for what they are doing bush said 
on the turmoil in lebanon he said i feel a certain 
frustration about lebanon because we have not been able to be a 
catalyst for peace he said the united states remains available to 
consult with individual parties in the middle east to try to 
resolve the nations civil war 
bush said he had no details of todays hijacking of an air france 
plane other than that the white house situation room had informed 
him it had occurred the plane subsequently landed in algiers and an 
unarmed algerian emigre who had commandeered the airliner 
surrendered 
the president covered a wide range of subjects in his interview 
with maine reporters and a small group of national traveling press 
corps 
he said first lady barbara bush was fine following her eye 
examination in washington on tuesday after the news conference he 
took the reporters and camera crews to the tennis court on his 
property to see his wife playing a game of doubles tennis 
shell kill us the president said as he led the entourage to 
the court 
mrs bush grumbling about her tennis game was asked how she 
felt at first she blurted out jokingly that she was just sick 
about her game she interrupted herself with a laugh and said 
no i feel wonderful 
the first lady posed for the cameras crosseyed in a gesture 
mocking the eye irritation that accompanies her graves disease a 
thyroid imbalance bush ran on to the court laughingly and told her 
dont do that as he put his hand over her eyes 
doctors at walter reed army medical center prescribed prednisone 
a cortisone derivative to help combat symptoms of the disease 
which include eye tearing and some doublevision according to a 
statement issued by the first ladys office 
on other matters the president said 
vice president dan quayle accurately stated us policy when he 
said this week that humanitarian aid to the contras rebels should 
continue even after nicaraguas elections in february if the contras 
do not find the internal conditions satisfactory to permit their 
return to their homeland 
the controversial seabrook nuclear power plant in new hampshire 
should be allowed to go on line as long as safety considerations and 
evacuation plans are assured 
he is disappointed he hasnt caught a single fish despite daily 
attempts since he arrived in maine on vacation a week ago but im 
going to get them today 
regarding his reflections on eight months in office i try not 
to measure by presidency by personal wins or personal losses whos 
up or whos down 
although polls show high public approval for his presidency bush 
said he couldnt take those indicators too seriously because these 
things change so i dont make too much of these polls 
as to why he is apparently so popular he said some of it is 
my wife some of it is the fact that people see were trying hard 
some of it is fundamental values

the defense nuclear agency plans to decide 
within 10 days whether a texas ranch still will be considered as a 
possible test site to simulate underground effects of nuclear 
explosions congressional aides said today 
officials from the agency met with aides to sens lloyd bentsen 
dtexas and phil gramm rtexas this morning and said an 
announcement on the future of the site near del rio would likely be 
made next week according to spokesmen for the senators 
the proposed test site about 25 miles from del rio has drawn 
opposition from area residents who are worried about the possible 
effects the nonnuclear explosions could have on the water supply 
and environment 
gramm plans to meet with officials and residents of the west 
texas city of 40000 on monday to discuss the tests and simply 
give them a chance to tell him directly how they feel said larry 
neal a spokesman for gramm 
the agency has spent two years chosing a site for the series of 
graduated explosions which would culminate in november 1992 with a 
470ton blast using conventional explosives the tests are to 
simulate the effects of nuclear explosions on underground missile 
silos 
the agency says the explosions are designed to have no 
significant environmental impact

winona minn daily news on poland 
in a very short period of time solidarity a political alliance 
that was outlawed until a few months ago is taking control of the 
government 
now polands leaders have agreed to allow a solidarity member to 
serve as prime minister 
this shocking change in poland a revolution of sorts reflects 
the serious problems eastern europe has suffered under communist 
control the drawbacks of communism have been magnified in poland 
because of strict military control and harsh enforcement of martial 
law 
after walesa and solidarity have their government in place the 
pressure for change will be incredible the polish people have 
called for political reforms but these reforms will only last if 
the economic and social qualities of life improve 
solidaritys achievements to date are historic but bigger jobs 
await walesa and his coalition they now have to answer to the 
people who brought them to power

the herald everett wash on poland 
the apparent restraint of the soviet union in the face of rapid 
political change in poland represents a hopeful sign of growing 
russian political maturity 
for those in the west who have watched the progress of the 
democratic movement in poland the possibility of a solidarityled 
coalition government is an exciting prospect but the excitement 
must be tempered with a certain amount of caution for both the 
reaction of the soviet union and the prospects of the government in 
changing polands economic conditions 
the soviet unions top political officials and its press are 
sending carefully weighed signals of what news reports call 
deliberate equanimity that is the proper attitude of a 
superpower toward peaceful political change even when that change 
is dramatic and right on its own borders 
if soviet president mikhail gorbachev and his allies continue 
on their steady reasonable path in regard to poland both nations 
can ultimately devote more of their energies to dealing with their 
own problems and the west can have a little more faith in the 
sincerity of mr gorbachevs reform efforts 
but for now the west can only hope that things between the 
soviet union and poland continue on the same intelligent path

the albuquerque nm tribune on sending us troops to colombia 
colombia declared war on the mighty drug cartels with 10000 
arrests last weekend the united states must be colombias 
staunchest ally in that war lending all appropriate assistance 
short of sending troops 
as the largest market for narcotics in the world this 
country has an immediate interest in stopping the production and 
distribution of cocaine the united states also has an interest in 
stability and democracy in this hemisphere both of which are under 
attack from druginspired corruption and violence 
yet the frontline fighters against the colombian cartels must be

the fayetteville nc times on oliver north 
a new analysis of oliver norths case shows that north would have 
gone to prison for the three crimes for which he was indicted and 
convicted had federal sentencing standards been in effect at the 
time he committed those crimes 
according to those standards adopted in november 1987 north 
would have served at least 21 months for aiding and abetting 
obstruction of congress destroying government documents and 
accepting an unlawful gratuity 
thats interesting but we already know that the judge could have 
done that standards or no standards but instead bought norths 
explanation that he was just a pawn in a chess game played by 
giants all the study does is tell us what we already know that 
the sentence was not proportionate to the crime 
this is not to begrudge north his freedom only to 
reemphasize the point that hes had his break if president 
bush should give him another break a full pardon that can 
logically be taken not as an act of compassion but as a gesture of 
approval of norths admitted attempt to do an end run around the 
american people who opposed the contra war around their elected 
representatives in congress and around the president he nominally 
served

watertown wis daily times on college sports 
the womens movement has been handed fresh evidence to bolster 
its contention that women are equal to men in most ways and 
superior in some henceforth they can cite a study which makes some 
pointed comparisons between male and female basketball players at 
colleges with major programs 
the studys findings scuttle the common notion that women players 
are not as serious about the game as the men the fact is that 
womens basketball is highly competitive which is reflected in the 
discovery that female players spend as much time at the sport as the 
men do 
but while they go at the game just as hard as their male 
counterparts do the women outplay them academically they attend 
classes more regularly study more and get higher grades 
robert rossi a research scientist involved in the study 
project for the national collegiate athletic association asked the 
right question how can you make the men do it not an easy 
task especially since a high percentage of male athletes have their 
sights set on a professional sports career 
it seems unlikely that well see a rush of male players stung by 
the report striving to match the womens academic performance yet 
some may take this as a challenge they should be encouraged by 
college administrators and others to go for it

the westerly ri sun on israel 
it is expected of americans now to join the universal 
condemnation of south africa for its continuing oppression of people 
of color through its system of apartheid but it is still american 
to consider israel our most important ally that can do no wrong in 
the middle east it is time for that to change israel must continue 
to be an ally but not without severe criticism for its human rights 
violations 
for too many years now israel has been conducting as systematic 
a persecution of palestinians as the white minority has thrust on 
blacks in south africa indeed the human rights abuses in the gaza 
occupied territory lately rival those in any of the black townships 
as painful as it may be politically or personally america must 
begin to condemn israels military occupation and crimes against 
humanity in the gaza strip

the watertown sd public opinion on whistleblowers 
even as you read this officials somewhere in the depths of the 
federal government may be selling this countrys interests down the 
river 
if we lived in a perfect world the higherups would ferret 
out the wrongdoing announce it at a press conference and mend their 
errant ways sometimes they do 
unfortunately as the watergate and irancontra scandals 
demonstrated government officials are less than candid when the 
mischief is politically embarrassing to an incumbent president 
enter the whistleblowers government employees outraged enough by 
the shenanigans to tip off the media 
they deserve public service awards apparently the us justice 
department would rather throw them in jail deputy assistant 
attorney general john keeney informed congress recently that the 
justice department would resume prosecuting government employees who 
leak information about its criminal investigations 
the policys vagueness would allow the justice department to 
prosecute the whistleblowers selectively thats almost certain to 
lead to politically motivated witchhunts for those who made somebody 
important look bad 
we simply cant afford to muzzle the whistleblowers and the media 
watchdogs

the posttribune of gary ind on stockades in arkansas 
its easy to understand the frustration of officials in the 
arkansas community of dermott who recently decided to deal with 
lawbreaking minors by throwing their parents into a public stockade 
if anything has characterized the last three decades of american 
society it is the deterioration of discipline among youth both at 
home and in school 
in most schools teachers are no longer allowed to hand out 
corporal punishment at home fewer and fewer youth grow up in 
stable twoparent families in households with two parents often 
both work 
the result is many parents seem not to have the time nor the 
inclination to discipline their children properly they then 
complain when school authorities try to do the job 
dermott officials hope the humiliation of parents being put on 
public display in a stockade will spur them to discipline their 
children 
pressure on parents through public humiliation however is 
unlikely to achieve the desired effect what its more apt to do is 
clog up the courts with challenges to the ordinances legality that 
will teach youth another important lesson if you dont like 
something sue

prime ministerdesignate tadeusz 
mazowiecki under pressure from polish communists and the soviet 
union promised today to give the party a bigger role in the 
solidarityled government he is forming 
mazowiecki told solidarity lawmakers that he would give the party 
more than the two ministry posts defense and interior that had 
been previously promised the two ministries control the police and 
the army 
mazowiecki speaking to the solidarity caucus in the national 
assembly said that with the communists retaining control of those 
powerful ministries it would be foolish to try to exclude them from 
the rest of the government 
the speech by mazowiecki followed a 40minute telephone talk 
tuesday between party chief mieczyslaw f rakowski and soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev in which it was agreed that it was 
impossible to have a government without the communists a party 
spokesman said 
it was highly unusual for the party to publicize such a telephone 
conversation announcing it at a news conference 
the announcement appeared designed to stress the soviet unions 
interest in having a strong communist presence in the next 
government but still reflected moscows acceptance of the idea that 
the party should reach an accommodation with the solidarityled 
coalition 
president bush today described gorbachevs reported counsel to 
polands communists to take part in the new government as very 
positive speaking with reporters at his vacation home in maine 
bush told americans they should expect bumps in the road as these 
countries move toward more democracy 
there were signs today that solidarity and the polish communist 
party were nearing an understanding 
solidarity which last week was chosen by president wojciech 
jaruzelski to lead the next government had only promised that the 
communists would retain control of the defense and interior 
ministries 
but mazowiecki warned solidarity deputies today that such a limit 
could backfire the communist party in total negation would be a 
trap for the country he said 
hinting that the party would eventually take back power by force 
unless a compromise was reached he said no opposition in the 
world which has the army and security services remains the 
opposition 
our new partners must not feel like secondary partners 
the lower house of the national assembly the sejm is to vote 
thursday on mazowieckis nomination ratification is expected 
because solidarity leader lech walesa has put together a 
solidarityled majority by wooing two minor parties formerly allied 
with the communists 
mazowiecki did not say how many government ministries would be 
apportioned he said he plans to present a government within a week 
party spokesman jan bisztyga said that mazowieckis envoy 
jaroslaw kaczynski had his first preliminary coalition talks on 
tuesday with party central committee secretary leszek miller 
bisztyga refused comment on the partys coalition demands 
mazowiecki said there are no specific decisions but it must be a 
broad coalition 
on cannot today form a government in poland other than a broad 
coalition having the support of all forces sitting at the sejm he 
said 
mazowiecki told the solidarity lawmakers that he had jaruzelskis 
assurance the army and security forces would cooperate with a 
government led by the opposition movement they had long sought to 
repress 
he said there is a feeling of danger within those forces that 
must not be aggravated if the democratization of poland is to be 
successful 
this is political wisdom not to increase this feeling of danger 
in order not to create a feeling of aggression he said 
he also took a mild stance toward the removal of party loyalists 
from state jobs he said he plans no witch hunts when he takes 
over his only criteria for employment would be competence and 
loyalty to the new government he said 
the communist party has been pressing for maximum representation 
in the new cabinet as mazowiecki holds intensive negotiations on the 
delicate task of balancing competing political interests 
the communist politburo met tuesday to fashion its position 
afterward party spokesman bisztyga reported the 
rakowskigorbachev telephone conversation where he said it was 
agreed that solving polands problems is impossible without the 
communist party 
bisztyga said the two men held a friendly conversation and 
that gorbachev expressed confidence that the polish party would 
successfully solve the social and economic problems in the interest 
of socialism and voiced the conviction that solving these problems 
is impossible without the party 
he said the soviet union was interested in a significant 
communist participation in shaping the social and economic and 
political situation to assure the appropriate development of 
poland 
mazowiecki reiterated today that he understands polands 
geographic place and that it belongs to the warsaw pact military 
alliance 
as the unprecedented jousting for power continues mazowiecki 
faces tackling polands tremendous economic problems a 39 billion 
foreign debt chronic shortages of even basic foods and declining 
industrial production

police arrested five men suspected in the 
assassination of luis carlos galan the presidential hopeful whose 
slaying caused a government crackdown on colombias notorious drug 
traffickers 
also tuesday police said they had begun proceedings to extradite 
the reputed finance chief of the medellin drug cartel to the united 
states where he faces conspiracy and drug trafficking charges 
colombian newspapers meanwhile reported today the arrest of an 
alleged drug trafficker wanted in the united states on smuggling 
charges the bogota daily el espectador said a us extradition 
request for rafael orlandes gamboa is pending with colombian 
authorities 
a source at the international airport said that a us drug 
enforcement administration aircraft was parked there apparently for 
use in extradition the source spoke on condition he not be 
identified 
attorney general dick thornburgh asked about the aircraft on 
cbs this morning declined specific comment but said you 
can be sure were in a position to take full advantage of the 
developments down there 
the flurry of drug arrests in colombia one of the narcotics 
capitals of the world was spurred by fridays killing of galan 
police say drug traffickers put a 500000 price on galans head 
the arrests tuesday in downtown bogota of five men believed 
directly involved in the killing reflect an unusual efficiency on 
the part of security forces never before in a major drugrelated 
assassination had police announced key arrests with such speed in 
many cases no arrests were ever made 
the five men were presented to reporters at national police 
headquarters where they were under heavy guard police said all 
were colombians 
they stood silently their faces fixed in a blank expression 
they were dressed in casual clothing and four appeared to be in 
their 20s or 30s the fifth was older perhaps in his 50s with 
graying hair 
a police communique gave their names and said they were captured 
earlier tuesday but provided no further details 
the men were not known members of the drug trafficking community 
which authorities say routinely hires killers and helps finance the 
training of shadowy death squads in association with rightwing 
extremists 
several men are believed to have participated in the killing of 
galan friday at a campaign rally in soacha a town outside bogota 
witnesses and police say one man pumped five bullets into galans 
abdomen and legs as he stood on a small stage while at least four 
other men raked the air with automatic weapons fire to spark panic 
and allow the triggermans escape 
galan a 46yearold senator and member of the centerleft 
liberal party was popular and considered the frontrunner in the 
race for president in may 1990 elections he repeatedly called for 
eradication of the countrys powerful cocaine cartels 
his death capped two days of assassinations including those of a 
police colonel and a magistrate that prompted president virgilio 
barco to reestablish an extradition treaty with the united states 
where about 80 colombians are wanted on drug charges 
as part of the emergency crackdown on traffickers police and 
military forces have staged nearly 500 raids seizing hundreds of 
cars trucks small planes and helicopters and entire estates 
allegedly owned by the drug lords 
the medellin cartels alleged finance chief eduardo martinez 
romero was caught up in the sweep and police on tuesday said they 
had started the paperwork for his extradition to the united states 
where he is accused in a billiondollar money laundering scheme 
its going to be a test case when and if we get there a 
us narcotics expert told reporters in bogota 
thornburgh said in washington that the united states was moving 
to extradite martinez even though his name was not on a list of the 
dozen most wanted drug traffickers officials sent tuesday to the 
colombian government the list focused on the leaders of the 
medellin and cali cartels 
the narcotics expert speaking on condition he not be identified 
described martinez as a major figure in the medellin cartel 
martinez was captured sunday at tolu 550 miles north of bogota 
he was being held under tight security at the headquarters of the 
national police departments judicial investigations division 
in an interview with a local reporter martinez said at no 
time have i had links to the medellin cartel and i dont know any of 
its members 
he would be the first alleged trafficker handed over by colombia 
since june 1987 when the supreme court declared the extradition 
treaty with the united states unconstitional barco invoked 
emergency powers under a 4yearold state of seige to reinstate it 
with provisions that eliminate judicial review 
drug traffickers are known to fear extradition to countries where 
their power is limited they have effectively intimidated the 
colombian courts by killing more than 220 judges and other

the government said wednesday it will abolish 
flogging a criminal punishment once widely used in hong kong during 
the heydey of the british empire 
the punishment in which a male offender is beaten a maximum of 
18 times with a cane in the presence of a doctor has declined 
markedly in this british colony hong kong courts ordered only two 
floggings this year compared with 476 floggings in 1952 
the decline in the use of corporal punishment as a sentencing 
option to the point where it is now rarely used indicates clearly 
that it cannot be regarded as an effective deterrent and is clearly 
not seen as such by the courts the government said in a statement 
andrew stables former chairman of the local branch of amnesty 
international described flogging as a remnant from the colonial era 
that has no place in a modern society 
only men can be flogged and the instrument used shall be a 
light cane or rattan of a type approved by the governor the 
statutes say the maximum number of strokes that can be applied are 
18 for offenders aged 17 or older to six for offenders under 14 
years 
offenses that can lead to flogging include indecent assault 
piracy robbery and rape of a female younger than 16 most recent 
floggings have been for weapons possession convictions 
flogging was abolished in britain four decades ago and the 
decision to end it in hong kong was in part because of sensitivity 
to international criticism 
the government noted that retaining flogging would have made 
hong kong vulnerable to criticism from the united nations human 
rights committee because the punishment contravened the 1966 
international covenant on civil and political rights 
although a public opinion survey found a large measure of support 
for the punishment there were more effective sentencing options 
the government said 
the government said all legislation giving courts power to give 
sentences of corporal punishment would be repealed but it did not 
give a timetable

a senior communist party official said corruption 
within the party was largely to blame for the prodemocracy movement 
and that the party should be purged of western influences official 
reports said today 
also today the education commission replaced the president of 
beijing university whose students helped lead the movement that was 
crushed in june 
in another development anna chennault head of the republican 
heritage council met with vice president wang zhen she said she 
would report back to president bush but declined comment on reports 
she brought a message from him bush said today he had not asked her 
to convey a messsage to the chinese 
politburo member song ping said ideological deviations within the 
47 millionmember party were quite severe and called for a purge 
of party leaders with bourgeois liberal or western leanings 
the official peoples daily reported 
song head of the communist partys organization department 
spoke on the opening day of a fourday meeting of the department 
which oversees discipline within the party the meeting ended 
tuesday 
party corruption was a major theme of the prodemocracy protests 
and authorities have combined their suppression of the protest 
movement with attacks on corrupt practices within the party 
the china daily quoted xu qing deputy minister of supervision 
as saying the government is investigating 20 major corruption cases 
and that several highranking officials were involved 
xu said results of the investigations will be reported about the 
time of the 40th anniversary of communist rule on oct 1 
the peoples daily quoted song as saying corruption within party 
ranks was the main reason a small group of thugs could deceive and 
instigate the people he said such wrongdoings had killed the 
confidence the people had in the party 
song also condemned party members who supported student demands 
for democratic reforms 
a small number of party members from several major research 
institutes played a disgusting role by running around on sinister 
errands and stirring up trouble the official xinhua news agency 
quoted song as saying 
song said the party must stand behind the decisions made in june 
during a central committee meeting at which reformist zhao ziyang 
was ousted as party chief for expressing sympathy for the protesters 
the communist party periodically launches campaigns against 
corruption but in the past has had little success in reducing the 
influence peddling extortion bribery hoarding of goods and 
illegal use of public funds rampant among middle and lowerlevel 
party and government officials 
beijing university leader ding shisun was the second university 
president replaced since the protests the official xinhua portrayed 
the move as nonpolitical and said the 62yearold ding had asked as 
early as february to leave for health and other reasons 
however school officials within the past month said repeatedly 
that ding had no plans to leave when contacted by telephone as 
recently as monday they said ding remained president and made no 
mention of a planned change 
ding was replaced with 56yearold wu shuqing wu had been vice 
president of peoples university whose students also took part in 
the protests 
students from beijing university considered chinas most 
prestigious school took the lead in the protests as they 
traditionally have in past political movements 
ding maintained a low profile during the protests speaking out 
only to urge a speedy solution to the problem but he also did 
nothing to stop his students while other schools put heavy pressure 
on their students to stop protesting and some even locked their 
campus gates before major marches 
xinhua claimed that mrs chennault today told wang that the 
military crackdown on the prodemocracy movement was chinas 
internal affair and no foreign country should interefere 
mrs chennault contacted by telephone laughed when the xinhua 
dispatch was read to her however she declined to say if it was 
accurate 
hundreds perhaps thousands of unarmed civilians were killed 
when troops swept across the city on june 34 bush and many other 
foreign leaders condemned chinese authorities for the crackdown 
mrs chennault widow of world war ii flying tiger founder 
gen claire lee channault arrived in beijing on thursday 
she was tightlipped about her visit saying only that she had 
met important people and had constructive discussion with 
leaders 
asked about her visit bush today told reporters in maine where 
he is vacationing i did not ask her to convey any message to the 
chinese we have our own diplomatic avenues through which to do 
that

general said the court would be hearing information relating to 
national security 
timothy dyk an attorney for several media outlets objected to 
the closing on constitutional grounds however the court ruled that

assistance to oliver norths contra network he is charged with two 
counts of obstruction and two counts of making false statements to 
the cia inspector generals office and the tower commission in 1987

has standing to intervene in the case over the objections of 
independent counsel lawrence walsh however no decision was 
immediately made on that issue 
walshs office has objected to the justice department taking 
legal questions concerning classified information in the fernandez 
case to the appeals court the independent counsel says the justice 
departments action in effect would take control of the case from 
walshs office 
us district court judge claude hilton in alexandria va ruled

thousands of baltic residents linked 
hands in a giant human chain and lighted candles at the dusk today 
to mourn their loss of independence a halfcentury ago to josef 
stalins tanks 
lithuanians latvians and estonians took up spots on a 370mile 
route from the gulf of finland to the lithuanian capital vilnius 
to demand that moscow recognize it forcibly annexed their countries 
and grant them greater independence 
in vilnius 5000 people gathered in cathedral square singing 
the national anthem of independent lithuania and holding candles to 
commemmorate stalins victims 
grazina staniute a 15yearold student from kaunas said the 
candles symbolize those who died in exile when we light the 
candles they will be with us 
brone surzilate 58 who was one of those exiled by stalin held 
a card with the number 1222660 written on it that is the number 
of lithuanians that activists say have suffered repression in 50 
years of soviet rule 
organizers said they expected 15 million people to link hands 
along the route in a show of solidarity there was no way to 
determine immediately whether there were gaps in the line or how 
many people took part 
the chain was to climax a series of protests marking the 
anniversary of the aug 23 1939 nonaggression treaty between the 
soviet union and nazi germany which led to the soviet annexation of 
the baltic republics the next year 
eight days after the signing adolf hitler attacked poland and 
started world war ii 
about 50000 people gathered tuesday in vilnius to mourn the 
soviet takeover hundreds gathered again today with signs denouncing 
the soviet union as imperialist and paraded effigies of hitler and 
stalin 
leaders of the lithuanian peoples front activist group in 
vilnius today approved their most explicit demand for independence 
about 170 leaders of the group voted to call for the creation of 
an independent democratic lithuanian republic not under the power of 
the soviet union 
the vote followed criticism today in the communist party daily 
pravda which accused peoples front leaders of distorting history 
and seeking full secession from the soviet union 
activists tuesday in riga latvia demanded that moscow and the 
world recognize the absorption of the baltic lands by the soviet 
union was a crime carried out by stalin and hitler 
in the estonian capital tallinn announcements today on the 
official radio told participants how to get to their spots on the 
human chain and organizers scheduled news conferences meetings and 
concerts 
the estonian people are very united and the mood is very 
good said ulo kaevats a member of the estonian peoples front 
one of the grassroots groups that organized the event the protests 
are dedicated to victory over the evil that the pact and the 
soviet occupation begat he said 
events marking the pact also were scheduled in other regions of 
the western soviet union that were absorbed under the secret pact 
yuri rozhgo a spokesman for the peoples front of moldavia said a 
rally would be held to condemn the agreement 
moldavia was part of romania before world war ii but soviet 
soldiers occupied it in 1940 and it became one of the 15 soviet 
republics 
in a secret protocol to the treaty hitler and stalin divided 
eastern europe into spheres of influence the small independent 
baltic republics fell into soviet hands and were a battleground 
before germanys defeat in the war 
thousands of baltic residents were shot or deported for their 
antisoviet sympathies and after the war others were similarly 
punished for real or alleged collaboration with the nazis 
the soviet union has done everything to remove the republics of 
estonia latvia and lithuania from the memory and the map of europe 
from your libraries and textbooks your sense of justice your grief 
and your minds the peoples front organizations in the three 
republics said tuesday in a statement 
a commission of lithuanias supreme soviet or legislature said 
in a report published tuesday that the soviet unions annexation of 
lithuania was an international crime 
elimination of the consequences is not only an internal matter 
of the ussr but a matter for europe and the entire society of 
world governments it said 
a twoday conference of eastern european activists in riga called 
for the united nations to take up the baltic republics status

denmarks shaky minority government 
wednesday presented its draft budget for 1990 signaling a likely 
confrontation with the socialist opposition 
the centerright cabinet headed by prime minister poul schlueter 
commands only 67 of the 179 seats in parliament and needs to find 
shifting majorities to pass legislation moreover the coalition 
comprising schlueters conservatives the liberals and social 
liberals shows signs of internal strife 
finance minister palle simonsen said the budget proposal 
reflected a major economic plan the government hopes to enact this 
year 
the plan unveiled in may called for a cut in the corporate 
income tax rate from 50 percent to 35 percent the top marginal 
income tax from 68 percent to 52 percent and capital gains from 57 
percent to 40 percent 
it also proposed gradual reductions in public spending and 
employment 
the tax reforms would be financed by introducing user charges for 
the states largely free social services and by shifting a greater 
share of the unemployment benefit system onto employers and labor 
organizations 
the social democrats denmarks biggest political party with 55 
seats in parliament put forward a tax reform of their own 
it also called for big tax cuts but not at the expense of 
welfare benefits and employment instead the social democrats 
proposed an obligatory pension savings plan the proceeds of which 
would be reinvested in industry through unionrun investment funds 
the government has begun negotiations with the social democrats 
to reach a compromise and avoid a showdown that could mean an early 
election 
in a recent opinion poll published in the financial daily 
newspaper boersen the social democrats and their allies the 
socialist peoples party would have a slight majority if elections 
were called now 
the ruling conservatives did poorly both in the 1988 election and 
in a recent direct vote for the european parliament they face a 
real political test in local elections scheduled in november 
danes have gone to the polls twice since 1987 but each time the 
result was no clear majority in parliament 
in his proposal simonsen forecast total net state expenditures 
of 373 billion in 1990 with a budget deficit of 3733 million 
the partys reaction to the budget which included a 106 
billion cut in public spending was to reject it unless the 
government dropped the proposed welfare cuts 
but schlueter demanded the social democrats accept the budget as 
a condition for the governments continuing to bargain with the 
opposition on tax and economic reforms 
parliament will vote on the budget in december and the 
government hopes to have made a deal with the social democrats by 
then otherwise schlueter might be forced to seek support from the 
rightist progress party and other minor nonsocialist parties or to 
call an election that he likely would lose

the justice department eager to bring 
colombian drug dealers to trial in the united states is issuing a 
most wanted list of the top 12 and president bush today said 
such extraditions should go forward 
a us government plane has been in colombia since the weekend 
an administration source said today but theres no indication that 
it will be used to transport anybody who might be extradited to the 
united states 
the list released tuesday includes a dozen alleged top drug 
traffickers including leaders of the two major colombian cocaine 
cartels and a former colombian police officer who officials say 
tried to kill two us agents 
we dont know the whereabouts of any of these individuals 
attorney general dick thornburgh said noting that the government is 
enlisting the aid of the colombian government and interpol to bring 
them to justice here 
the interpol network of worldwide law enforcement agencies was 
alerted in recognition of the possibility that the suspects may 
have already fled colombia because of the recent crackdown on drug 
traffickers there thornburgh said 
asked today on cbs this morning why the colombian drug lords 
should not be tried in their own country thornburgh said 
in an ideal world they would be but as weve seen the tragic 
events there that have involved the assassination of judges law 
enforcement officials even a presidential candidate over the 
weekend have really robbed colombian officials of the ability to 
enforce their own laws 
about 80 alleged colombian drug traffickers have been indicted in 
the united states but their cases have languished since the 
colombian supreme court overturned its extradition treaty with the 
united states in 1987 
colombian president virgilio barco prompted by last weeks 
assassination of presidential candidate luis carlos galan 
instituted emergency measures to allow the immediate resumption of 
extraditions 
galan was an outspoken foe of drug traffickers 
bush at a news conferenece in kennebunkport maine where he is 
on vacation praised barcos efforts saying i have great respect 
for what president barco is trying to do i am convinced he is 
determined to whip the problem to beat it 
the process of extraditing drug trafficking suspects to the 
united states should go forward bush said 
the most wanted list does not include the one alleged 
medellin cartel moneylaunderer who was arrested over the weekend in 
colombia eduardo martinez romero 
we are taking steps to provide the necessary documentation to 
secure his extradition to the united states thornburgh said 
an administration source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said today that a us government plane has been in colombia since 
last weekend but its purpose there was unclear 
it could be used to transport martinez back to the united states 
the source said but there is no indication that it will be used for 
that purpose 
a source at the international airport in bogota identified the 
plane as belonging to the us drug enforcement administration but 
dea officials in washington declined comment 
the marshals service usually transports those being extradited to 
the united states and it has its own fleet of two 727s and a 
dozen or more smaller aircraft that can be used for such work 
said service spokesman bill dempsey 
we havent been brought into the picture yet on the martinez 
case dempsey said 
on tuesday thornburghs chief of staff robert ross said it was 
not clear how long the extradition of martinez might take 
the quickest thing that could happen is they could put somebody 
on a plane and deliver him to the united states or they could 
engage in some other process which could well involve us supplying 
different kinds of documentation which traditionally is what happens 
under extradition treaties ross said whether theyre going to 
operate that way or not we dont know 
the attorney general said the united states should not bow to 
fears that it might become targeted by the violence that has plagued 
colombia where dozens of judges and hundreds of law enforcement 
officers have been killed by drug traffickers 
we cant succumb in this country to what has already brought 
the criminal justice system to its knees in colombia he said 
they are rising from their knees they are standing up to these 
drug traffickers and they deserve every bit of support that we can 
give them and that support will be forthcoming 
those on the dozen most wanted are 
the three reputed medellin cartel leaders pablo emilio escobar 
gaviria 39 jorge luis ochoa vasquez 40 and jose gonzalo 
rodriguez gacha 42 
two of ochoa vasquezs brothers fabio 32 and juan david 41 
along with gustavo de jesus gaviria rivero 42 and gerardo moncada 
42 all are alleged members of the medellin cartel 
jose ivan duarte acero 37 a former police officer alleged to 
work with the medellin cartel drug enforcement administration 
spokesman con dougherty said acero was the gunman responsible for 
the attempted murder of two of our agents down there 
the reputed leaders of the cali cartel gilberto jose rodriguez 
orjuela 50 miguel angel rodriguez orjuela 45 and jose santacruz 
londono 45 also on the list is alleged cali cartel member jamie 
raul orjuela caballero 46

the media won 40 percent of the libel cases tried 
to conclusion in 1987 and 1988 the libel defense resource center 
reported 
that compares to a 24 percent win rate in 1985 and 1986 said the 
center a nonprofit information clearinghouse organized by media 
groups 
but henry r kaufman the centers general counsel said it was 
important not to overstate the trend 
despite the recent slight improvement in trial success the 
medias overall trial win rate during the eight years since 1980 
remains at only 28 percent still an unacceptably poor showing 
kaufman said in the report released tuesday 
the center also found that large libel awards against the media 
dropped in 1987 and 1988 the average amount of damages initially 
awarded was 431730 in that period down from 1167 million in 
the previous period 
although lower in relative terms an average damage award 
approaching 500000 in cases that rarely involve significant 
outofpocket loss remains in absolute terms an unacceptably high 
tariff on free expression said kaufman 
there were no awards of more than 10 million during the latest 
twoyear period in comparison from 1980 through 1986 each of the 
twoyear periods had one or two eightfigure awards 
the absence of any outrageously inflated eightfigure 
megaawards during this period is a most welcome development said 
kaufman but he said it was impossible to predict whether fewer huge 
awards is an aberration or whether it will become a trend 
in addition 14 percent of the damage awards in 1987 and 1988 
exceeded 1 million in the prior two years 27 percent did from 
1980 through 1986 25 percent of all awards against the media were 
more than 1 million 
and considering cases where the initial award was under 1 
million about threequarters of the total the average award was 
250518 in 1987 and 1988 thats 11589 more than in the previous 
period and the highest of any period studied since 1980

stillfuzzy triton picture is an impact crater 
engineers prepared to send voyager the computer program this 
afternoon to control how the spacecraft aims itself its cameras and 
other sensors during its flight past neptune and triton said doug 
griffith deputy mission manager at nasas jet propulsion laboratory 
the latest navigation information shows that after a 12year 
44billionmile flight voyager will be within one second and 22 
miles of where it is supposed to be for the neptune flyby he said 
the spacecraft is working marvelously with no problems at 
all griffith said 
he said the new computer program smaller than that contained in 
many popular computer games is crucial to experiments in which 
voyager will study the makeup of the atmospheres of neptune and 
triton by sending radio waves through their atmospheres to earth 
griffith said the new navigation data shows voyager will make its 
closest approach by flying 3000 miles above neptunes cloudtops at 
18 seconds before 856 pm pdt thursday 
until todays search for more moons suspects have been seen 
here and there said bradford smith a university of arizona 
planetary scientist who heads voyagers photographic imaging team 
i would expect several more satellites 
so far voyager has found four small moons besides nereid and 
backwardorbiting triton which were first seen years ago from earth 
after voyager makes its closest approach to neptune the probe 
may find a sheet of ring material encircling the planet similar to 
the broad band of dust it discovered around uranus in 1986 
laboratory astronomer rich terrile said 
smith announced tuesday the spacecraft found at least one 
complete ring of diffuse debris orbiting neptune he said a partial 
ring discovered by the spacecraft almost two weeks ago also may 
prove to be a second complete ring it has parts that are thicker 
than other parts 
tuesdays find the latest in a string of discoveries by the 
probe during passes by jupiter in 1979 saturn in 1981 and uranus 
elated scientists 
i like the idea voyager is going out with a bang its going to 
blow our minds said carolyn porco a planetary scientist with the 
university of arizona tucson 
pictures taken by voyager on aug 11 revealed two partial rings 
or ring arcs extending around neptune one of them couldnt be 
found in later images and was dubbed the lost arc until voyager 
relocated it tuesday and found it goes all the way around the planet 
finding a complete ring was surprising voyager project scientist 
edward stone said two months ago the planet might be orbited by 50 
to 100 ring arcs but he backed away from that tuesday 
about 9 oclock pdt tonight voyager will cross within 1 million 
miles of neptune speeding toward the giant gaseous planet at 38047 
mph it will be about 275 billion miles from earth having traveled 
a curving path of 44 billion miles since it was launched in 1977 
at 210 am friday voyager will zip within 24000 miles of the 
moon triton 
vice president dan quayle is scheduled to visit the jet 
propulsion laboratory several hours later to congratulate voyager 
scientists and engineers 
voyager was programmed to search today for more rings and arcs 
including any that might be in or near tritons orbit and to look 
for shepherd moons rings get their shape from the pull of 
gravity between a planet and its moons so moons that corral rings 
are called shepherd moons 
todays picturesnapping schedule also included 30 images of 
triton four photos of one of the moons voyager discovered and 22 
pictures of neptune and its surprisingly turbulent weather with 
racing clouds and an earthsized cyclone 
because of its bluish color and bright clouds neptune looks 
earthlike porco said with clouds floating in the atmosphere 
it looks homey 
the space probe also was to measure temperatures at various 
altitudes in neptunes atmosphere 
some scientists have said arcs and rings could be the remnants of 
moons torn apart by gravitational forces but porco said it was more 
likely some of them form when moons collide 
weve now seen four different ring systems at four different 
planets terrile said citing saturns vast system of broad rings 
jupiters single narrow ring and uranus 10 thin rings and one 
broad sheet of dust that seems to contain dozens of rings 
i find it intriguing to think that in coming to all these 
planets were seeing ring systems at different stages of 
evolution porco said they have complexity in common each 
planet is so damn different than the next 
the existence of moons and rings around planets in our solar 
system suggests the processes that formed the earth are common 
bolstering the belief that planets orbit stars other than the sun 
terrile said

israeli soldiers forced their way into a gaza 
city hospital wednesday while pursuing stonethrowing palestinians 
and a hospital official said troops abused medical staff and 
terrorized patients 
about 30 soldiers seized four palestinians at the hospital but 
subsequently released them the official said hospital workers 
staged a sitdown strike to protest the raid she said 
the army said soldiers entered the hospital because they were 
pelted with stones from the facilitys grounds 
also wednesday police rounded up 170 arab laborers from the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip who were caught spending the night 
in israel a violation of rules requiring them to return home after 
work israel radio said 
the laborers later were released the radio said most of the 
arrests took place in the galilee region in the north and the 
coastal towns of akko and nahariya police said 
many arabs customarily ignore the rule to avoid the long daily 
commutes back to the occupied territories or to avoid participating 
in strikes called by underground leaders of the palestinian uprising 
the arrests follows regulations instituted friday that require 
palestinians to have special computerized identity cards to enter 
israel from the gaza strip 
palestinians say the cards are aimed at trying to defuse the 
20monthold uprising against israeli rule but government officials 
maintain the system is meant to block potential offenders from 
entering israel following attacks on jewish civilians 
thirtyeight israelis have been slain during the uprising at 
least 545 palestinians also have been killed by israeli soldiers or 
settlers and 97 others have been killed by fellow arabs often 
after allegations they collaborated with security forces 
on wednesday a scottish doctor performed an autopsy on the body 
of 14yearold amjad jibril tawil a palestinianamerican whose body 
was found with a single bullet wound last week in the west bank town 
of elbireh 
the independent autopsy by dr derick pounder was requested by 
the family which alleged the boy was in army custody before his 
death pounder represents the bostonbased physicians for human 
rights tawil was born in denver 
the army said the governments own autopsy cleared soldiers of 
involvement 
the incident at ahli arab hospital began when soldiers forced 
their way onto the hospital grounds behind an ambulance said a 
hospital official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
they the soldiers treated our staff in a bad way especially 
in the emergency room hitting people with their rifle butts and 
pushing them with their hands the official said 
she said soldiers ran through the wards including the childrens 
wing scaring them terribly 
the official said soldiers detained four palestinians who had 
been doing construction work with stones and cement at the adjacent 
nursing school run by the american baptist mission the four later 
were freed she said 
the army said in a statement that after people threw stones 
from the yard of the hospital israeli forces entered the hospital 
to catch the stone throwers and caught four it gave no other 
details 
hospital officials denied stones were thrown from the hospital 
grounds 
hospital staff staged a threehour sitdown strike to protest the 
raid the hospital official said the anglican church which runs the 
hospital was notified and complaints were filed with us british 
and danish embassies 
we are aware of the incident and we are checking with the 
proper authorities said a us embassy official who asked not to 
be identified

an unarmed algerian emigre took control 
of an air france airliner flying from paris to algiers with 115 
people aboard today but he was arrested when the plane landed at 
algiers airport officials said 
the pilot said the hijacker had held something under his jacket 
and threatened to blow up the plane but as the hijacker told 
reporters before being led away all he had was a piece of soap and 
a perfume spray bottle 
the pilot said he landed in algiers after other airports in 
algeria and tunisia refused permission to land there it was not 
immediately clear if the hijacker had demanded to be flown to those 
destinations 
the hijacker who apparently surrendered said he commandeered 
the plane to call attention to the need to end violence in lebanon 
and palestine 
news reports in paris said he was being expelled from france to 
his homeland when he hijacked the airbus a300 
an air france spokeswoman speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the hijacking ended at 325 pm 1025 am edt barely an 
hour after the plane landed at houari boumedienne airport east of 
the algerian capital she said the 102 passengers and 13 members of 
the crew were all safe the spokeswoman said she could not give 
details of how the hijacking was ended 
algerian police identified the hijacker as said djamel alias 
bendada and said he was a 30yearold merchant in paris 
the french news agency agence francepresse citing unidentified 
sources in paris said the man was being expelled for violating 
public order and that he displayed great agitation before 
being put on the flight to algiers 
the planes pilot joseph valat said in a brief statement that 
he landed at houari boumedienne airport after airports in tunis 
tunisia and in annaba and constantine in algeria refused permission 
to land there 
the hijacker called for the holding of an international 
conference on lebanon the opening of a dialogue between the plo and 
israel and the liberation of all hostages and prisoners in the 
region 
he showed reporters a small piece of soap and a perfume bottle 
which he identified as his only weapons 
initial reports from french air traffic control sources had said 
the flight of the airbus from paris to algiers had been diverted 
toward tunisia 
earlier incorrect reports had said that 130 and 123 people were 
aboard 
agence francepresse said air france flight 2323 took off from 
orly airport in paris 
the hijacking came amid heightened tensions between france and 
moslem forces fighting in lebanon the syrian forces and their 
allied moslem militias recently said they would shell french 
warships gathering in the eastern mediterranean if they intervened 
militarily in lebanon 
france said the warships were dispatched to evacuate 7000 french 
nationals in lebanon if the 5monthold battle between moslem and 
christian forces worsens but the moslems accuse the french of 
backing the christians

israels minister of religious affairs and 
a roman catholic cardinal did not resolve the dispute over a convent 
at the auschwitz concentration camp the chief israeli diplomat to 
poland said wednesday 
zevulun hammer the first israeli minister to make an official 
visit to poland since diplomatic relations were severed 22 years 
ago on tuesday asked cardinal franciszek macharski of krakow to 
move the convent according to a 1987 agreement 
the cardinal said however there was no immediate plan to 
transfer the nuns said mordechai palzur head of israels interest 
section in poland 
they are not moving for the time being and when it can happen 
is unclear he said he did not say it was a closed matter but 
it is not a matter of days or weeks or even months 
jewish groups and others have protested the convent as a 
intrusion of christian symbols at the place built by the nazis 
mainly to exterminate jews an estimated 4 million people at least 
25 million of them jews were murdered at the death camp complex 
hammer who lost members of his family at auschwitz visited the 
camp for the first time before meeting with macharski in nearby 
krakow 
macharski said this month that the convent housed in a former 
nazi warehouse on the perimeter of the camp would not be moved as 
had been promised in an international accord reached by jewish and 
catholic leaders in geneva 
catholic leaders had agreed to move the carmelite nuns by feb 22 
to an interfaith prayer center farther from the camp protests 
increased after the deadline passed including one july 14 when an 
american rabbi and six students were roughly removed from the 
convent macharski then said the agreement would not be honored in 
an atmosphere of aggressive demands 
the cardinal said the protests had created opposition to moving 
the convent particularly among residents of the town in southern 
poland where the death camp is located 
macharski told the israeli delegation that he had intended to 
move the convent when the agreement was reached but now was not 
in a position to go ahead with the plan palzur said 
palzur said he assured the cardinal he would be available to help 
in any way needed to mediate the situation but noted he had no 
control over those who might protests at the convent

civil war a senior officer was quoting as saying wednesday 
brig dominic kasiano told the armed forces newspaper the 
extension demonstrates the governments good will toward the rebels 
even though the two sides failed to reach an agreement in their 
first round of peace talks over the weekend 
he said the ceasefire was being extended to the end of september 
the countrys military rulers led by lt gen omar hassan 
elbashir deposed a civilian government in a coup in june and 
pledged to promote peace efforts 
kasiano a member of the 15member ruling council said the 
government has shown good intent of seeking to halt the bloodshed 
and find a durable and comprehensive solution to the question of 
southern sudan according to the newspaper 
the rebels of this east african nation took up arms in 1983 
demanding greater autonomy for the southern region 
fighting has ceased almost completely since april when the rebel 
sudan peoples liberation army declared a unilateral ceasefire to 
allow a un relief operation to distribute food to starving 
sudanese in the south the rebels later extended their ceasefire 
until the end of june 
elbashirs government in turn ordered a ceasefire during july 
and then extended it until the end of this month 
the two sides are expected to resume their peace talks but no

president ranasinghe premadasa said 
wednesday he was renewing efforts for a pullout of indian soldiers 
from this island torn by a tamil revolt and a backlash that has 
killed 57 more people in the past two days 
military officials said the new victims were all killed in 
violence stemming from the countrys radical sinhalese backlash the 
radicals are fighting the sinhalesedominated government which they 
accuse of making too many concessions to ethnic tamil militants 
premadasa said he had sent new proposals to new delhi for the 
speedy withdrawal of the 40000 indian soldiers in northeastern sri 
lanka 
i have sought specifically to ensure that our countrys 
sovereignty is recognized safeguarded and maintained while the 
withdrawal of the indian peacekeeping force proceeds on an 
accelerated basis he said 
this will ensure the realization of our objective of safety and 
security for all and an early restoration of peace and normalcy 
he said 
however the statement gave no details of the new proposals 
indian troops were deployed in sri lankas tamilmajority north 
and east to enforce a 1987 peace accord that gave tamil rebels 
limited autonomy in exchange for an arms surrender however the 
indian troops later began fighting a rebel militia that renounced 
the peace plan 
premadasa who was elected to office in december with a mandate 
to negotiate an indian withdrawal had called for a complete pullout 
of the soldiers by july 29 
the demand caused a diplomatic battle with new delhi which said 
a hasty withdrawal could allow violence to escalate on this island 
off its southern coast however both countries agreed to talks and 
india withdrew about 2000 soldiers 
india got involved in sri lankas strife because of the 
sympathies of its own 60 million tamils for the rebel cause 
tamils form 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people 
sinhalese make up 75 percent of the countrys population 
militants tamils launched their separatist war in 1983 claiming 
they were being discriminated against by the sinhalese the war has 
claimed at least 11000 lives including about 4000 people killed 
in the sinhalese uprising 
military officials speaking on condition of anonymity said 57 
of those victims were killed or found dead on tuesday and wednesday 
in scattered violence across the sinhalese south and center of the 
island 
the victims included 18 policemen and soldiers eight suspected 
radicals seven civilians killed in militant attacks and 24 bodies 
found with gunshot wounds they said 
among them were six government soldiers killed when sinhalese 
militants ambushed an army jeep in southern sri lanka the officials 
said 
opposition groups and human rights organizations have claimed 
that bodies found in the sinhalese heartland are those of suspected 
radicals killed by security forces or progovernment vigilante 
groups 
the government has denied the charges but senior officials 
privately admit that members of the security forces have committed 
abuses in their efforts to halt the radicals campaign of 
assassination and terror 
on tuesday officials and independent sources said at least 61 
people had been killed since sunday in the sinhalese violence

herself comfortable at a table on the carpeted floors of the 
librarys general building on copley square 
some slipped off their shoes while they sat at a table reading 
another found one shoe missing after she had padded off to the 
copier machine barefoot 
library security officers said they did not think the crimes were 
the work of a surefooted prankster but rather some kind of 
shoecrazed social deviant 
hes a shoe freak security supervisor lt george butner said 
wednesday you have to tell it like it is hes a sniff freak he 
must have a closetful by now 
butner said the thief has taken high heels and flats of different

consistent descriptions once they think back to who was sitting 
across from them 
butner described the suspect as a 23yearold man with earrings 
in his nose and one ear 
dunphy said the library would not warn patrons to keep their 
shoes like their wallets and pocketbooks on their person

attorneys for former marine sgt clayton 
lonetree on wednesday failed to stop distribution of a book about 
his role in a sexforsecrets scandal at the us embassy in moscow 
us district judge claude hilton refused to grant a preliminary 
restraining order against the publisher henry holt and co inc of 
new york saying lonetree had waited too long to try to stop the 
book sales 
lonetree of st paul minn claims the book the 
courtmartial of clayton lonetree contains confidential 
information obtained by his defense team that could be used against 
him if he wins a new trial on his espionage conviction 
but hilton said it was too late 
these matters have already been in the press the judge said 
its already out 
holt published the book in june and says it has sold about half 
the 13000 copies 
hilton also said lonetree had not proven that publication would 
hurt his chances of reversing his conviction 
lonetree filed suit last week seeking 100000 in punitive 
damages from holt and las vegas private investigator lake headley 
who worked for lonetrees lawyers during the courtmartial and 
helped write the book 
lonetree was convicted in 1987 of passing us embassy floor 
plans and the names of cia agents to the soviet union at the request 
of his soviet lover at the time lonetree was stationed as a 
security guard in moscow and vienna austria 
the book purportedly contains details of lonetrees affair and 
espionage activities that had not been disclosed before 
an attorney for lonetree lee calligaro argued that headley 
disclosed information about the case that lonetree provided in 
confidence to the investigator and his attorneys 
during the hearing wednesday calligaro read a passage of the 
book that described in detail how lonetree considered killing 
himself the information could only have come from lonetrees 
defense team calligaro said 
the public and court system have an abiding and deep concern in 
the sanctity of the attorneyclient privilege calligaro said 
robert callagy an attorney representing holt told the judge 
lonetree has been on notice for at least nine months that holt is 
going forward with this publication 
the publisher claims lonetree waived his right to maintain the 
confidentiality of the information he gave his lawyers lonetree is 
quoted in the book as once having told headley when this is over 
i want you to get my story out to the public 
lonetree is serving a 25year prison sentence at fort 
leavenworth kan an appeal of his conviction is pending with the 
us navymarine corps court of military review in washington

mississippians were urged wednesday to 
protect themselves against mosquito bites following confirmation 
that an 11yearold boy died of the rare eastern equine 
encephalitis or sleeping sickness 
this is the first reported death from this disease in the 
country this year said dr ted tsai of the centers for disease 
control office in ft collins colo we had only two cases 
reported last year and both resulted in death 
tsai said the fatality rate among horses and humans is about 30 
percent he said both deaths last year occurred in the southeast 
the boy who lived in a heavily wooded area of southern 
mississippi died aug 6 at the university medical center in jackson 
and a blood sample was sent to the cdc in atlanta said lisa ruble 
spokeswoman for the state department of health 
it was confirmed last week that the boy died of the encephalitis 
the presence of the virus in the area was confirmed by a 
department entomologist jerome goddard he said the disease is 
carried by birds and is occasionally transmitted to horses and 
humans by mosquitoes cases occur along the eastern seaboard and 
gulf coast of the united states as well as in canada and central and 
south america 
only 46 human cases were reported from 1965 to 1975 in the united 
states ruble said and no record of a case in mississippi in at 
least a decade 
heavy rains earlier this year led to an unusually large mosquito 
population statewide health officials said 
the disease affects all ages but is particularly severe in 
infants and children said ed thompson state epidemiologist 
characteristics of the disease include a sudden onset of high fever 
vomiting drowsiness or coma twitching and severe convulsions

develop the disease die thompson said survivors of the disease 
under 5 years of age often suffer mental retardation or paralysis 
most people over 40 recover completely 
no specific treatment is available but appropriate medical care 
can improve chances of survival health officials said

confirmed in recent months in three mississippi counties and 
suspected cases are being investigated in three others

police fired tear gas wednesday to 
disperse thousands of antiapartheid protesters including 
archbishop desmond tutu and stonethrowing crowds in several 
townships outside cape town 
columns of black smoke from burning street barricades were 
visible across the densely populated cape flats northeast of the 
city center 
the unrest has occurred almost daily for more than three weeks 
coinciding with the launch of a nationwide campaign to defy 
apartheid restrictions 
the cape town area has been the most troubled section in the 
country the area has experienced the most sustained series of 
confrontations between police and activists in two years 
police headquarters said officers encountered stonethrowing 
youths in at least seven black and mixedrace communities near cape 
town on wednesday 
tutu said that if law and order minister adriaan vlok does not 
constrain his security forces and if they behave the way they did 
today then we are on the brink of a major disaster 
tutu leader of the anglican church in southern africa tried to 
mediate between police officials and protesting youths in the black 
township of guguletu 
the archbishop persuaded the youths to call off a planned march 
from a high school to a police station where they intended to 
demand the release of several students and teachers detained in 
recent weeks instead tutu arranged for a small delegation to go to 
the station to present the demands 
but police fired tear gas at tutu other clergymen a white 
opposition member of parliament and hundreds of other people as they 
emerged from a church where the archbishop had been reporting on the 
latest developments 
tutu said the tear gas was fired without warning after he urged 
the protesters to disperse peacefully 
police showed an incredible impatience and eagerness to use the 
whole range of their armory said tutu winner of the 1984 nobel 
peace prize 
he said he was surprised that youths were still listening to 
community leaders who urged nonviolence if i was young i would 
not listen to archbishop tutu 
police also used tear gas on several thousand marchers at the 
university of the western cape a militantly antigovernment school 
where most students are mixedrace 
the marchers including teachers students and workers were 
fired at with tear gas as they reached the main gate of the campus 
leading out to a highway the marchers carried placards supporting 
the defiance campaign and criticizing police action against 
activists 
organizers said further protests were planned to oppose the visit 
to south africa by an international rugby team which activists say 
is undermining the sports boycott imposed to protest apartheid the 
visiting team is scheduled to play south africas national team in 
cape town on saturday 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services

a federal appeals court panel held a hearing 
behind closed doors wednesday to protect secrets during arguments 
about an irancontra criminal case against a former cia official 
edward dennis acting deputy attorney general said the 
threejudge panel of the 4th us circuit court of appeals would 
hear information relating to national security 
judge robert f chapman of columbia sc said federal law 
required him to close the hearing if the attorney generals office 
made that certification 
theres nothing else we can do chapman said the lives of 
people who work for the united states would be endangered by an 
open hearing he said 
timothy dyk an attorney for several media outlets had objected 
to the closing on constitutional grounds the court refused to hear 
his arguments 
the justice department and the office of independent counsel 
lawrence walsh are feuding over how to proceed in the case against 
joseph fernandez a former cia station chief in costa rica 
the justice department wants to appeal a federal judges ruling 
that fernandez may disclose as part of his defense secret 
information that the department says would jeopardize national 
security 
however walshs office says an appeal is a prosecutorial 
function granted specifically to the independent counsels office by 
federal law lawyers for walsh say the justice departments appeal 
in effect would wrest control of the case from the independent 
counsel 
gerard lynch an attorney for the independent counsel told the 
appeals court that the proper procedure for the justice department 
would be to file an affidavit under the classified information 
procedures act barring disclosure of the information 
dennis said such action almost surely would lead to dismissal of 
some or all of the charges against fernandez two counts in the 
irancontra case against oliver north were dropped because 
information vital to the prosecution could not be disclosed for 
national security reasons 
were not trying to prosecute the case dennis said but 
the impact of an affidavit is appropriate for us to consider it 
would risk dismissal of the prosecution 
if that happened lynch said the independent counsels office 
would appeal the dismissal 
its inevitably a twoheaded monster here lynch said the 
question is which head is going to control the decisions 
fernandez is accused of lying to investigators about his 
assistance to norths contra network he is charged with two counts 
of obstruction and two counts of making false statements to the cia 
inspector generals office and the tower commission in 1987 
among the secrets us district judge claude hilton of 
alexandria va ruled chapman has a right to disclose are the 
locations of cia stations in el salvador and honduras and another 
cia facility in a latin american country 
hilton also ruled chapman may reveal details about a 
communications station and other projects in costa rica

more than a halfdozen oil spill cleanup 
workers have reported being burned or suffering other problems from 
fertilizer being spread on alaska beaches to help oileating 
bacteria grow 
six workers on two beaches on the southern end of the kenai 
peninsula apparently suffered minor burns last week from the ammonia 
nitrate fertilizer said industrial hygienist mack davis of the 
state office of safety and health 
there have been at least three more cases since then steve 
provant the state onscene coordinator for the cleanup said 
tuesday the cleanup has been going on since 11 million gallons of 
oil were spilled march 24 by the tanker exxon valdez in prince 
william sound 
the coast guard has begun requiring that workers spreading the 
nutrient on the beaches wear respirators 
exxon has applied ammonia nitrate to 17 miles of beach so far 
seventy more miles of coastline are to be fertilized to help 
encourage microbes to devour some of the remaining oil 
workers suffered blisters and rashes on their hands said health 
aide sandy elvsaas in seldovia when the blisters burst they leave 
large red patches of raw skin 
it looks basically like a burn she said elvsaas said the 
workers she treated appeared to be healing well 
gary hanson foreman of a beach crew working near the head of 
chugach bay said workers saw the fertilizer on the beach and picked 
some of it up he said they were never warned not to 
workers who wear protective clothing issued to cleanup crews 
shouldnt have any problem with the fertilizer state safety and 
health officials said 
but because it is hot on the beaches workers sometime discard 
gear hanson said workers cutting oily logs into firewoodsized 
chunks couldnt survive inside the plastic suits its a 
sweatbox he said 
exxon is doing urine analyses to determine whether workers have 
absorbed unhealthy doses of ammonia nitrate bill rainey exxons 
director of operations for the spill said tuesday 
there should be no health risks from the fertilizer if it is 
washed off with soap and water he said

us officials said wednesday they are taking 
extra security precautions to guard aginst terrorist retributions 
stemming from the extradition of colombian drug figures to stand 
trial in the united states 
the initial focus will be on eduard martinez romero who 
allegedly laundered money for the medellin drug cartel was arrested 
over the weekend and was awaiting extradition to the united states 
officials said 
after that the extent of the precautions will depend on how 
successful colombian authorities are in their efforts to arrest 12 
medellin cartel leaders whose extradition was requested tuesday by 
the justice department 
if they got the top people we would presume that the rest of 
the cartel would be preoccupied in reorganizing and not have too 
much time to worry about revenge said one government expert in 
drug terrorism 
if they got only lower level people the cartel might try some 
kind of retribution but it is not clear whether it would be in the 
united states doing it in this country would be quite a 
challenge said the official who spoke on condition he not be 
named 
us diplomats in colombia and other latin american countries 
where the cartel has staged successful terrorist attacks have been 
operating on a heightened state of alert said state department 
spokesman richard boucher 
i would say that our people in colombia and in other places 
where threat exists have always been on a high state of 
readiness or care in their security procedures that 
continues said boucher 
boucher said us officials expect to meet this week with 
senior colombian government officials to continue our discussion of 
the details of the extradition process but he declined to say 
when where or who would be involved 
were trying to avoid too much focus on specific meetings and 
individuals because of the security situation said boucher 
another state department official asking not to be further 
identified said top colombian officials were traveling to 
washington to meet with us officials 
the major cartel figure arrested so far martinez was to face 
trial in atlanta where he has been indicted on drug charges 
stemming from an investigation called operation polar cap 
although he is not alleged to be the cartels financial chief 
martinez is thought to have detailed information about some aspects 
of the drug ring and us officials said they would take steps to 
guard against attempts to free him 
a spokesman for the us marshals service bill dempsey said it 
was impossible to predict what security measures would be needed to 
handle other alleged drug figures colombia hopes to arrest for 
deportation to the united states 
every effort would be made to provide all the necessary 
security and the resources would be obtained to provide the security 
for the extradition of the individuals dempsey said 
officials declined to specify how martinez and others would be 
protected while in federal custody but said security would be 
similar to that surrounding the trials of colombian drug lord carlos 
lehder rivas convicted in 1987 in jacksonville fla and the trial 
in washington earlier this year of fawaz younis convicted of 
hijacking a jordanian airliner 
for lehders trial marshals are believed to have used a postal 
service vehicle to smuggle him in and out of the federal courthouse 
in jacksonville armed guards wearing bulletproof vest and carrying 
automatic rifles were posted on nearby roofs and bombsniffing dogs 
roamed the corridors 
us attorney robert w merkle was given a guarded safe house in 
jacksonville and us district judge howell w melton was escorted 
to court by marshals 
the marshals service estimated that security at the lehder trial 
cost about 24 million including about 1 million in overtime for 
the 200 marshals brought in on rotation an average of 32 to 39 were 
on duty each day 
when younis was arrested and brought to the united states in 
september 1987 he was kept in the brig at the quantico va marine 
base near washington then moved to a federal prison in otisville 
ny according to sources close to the case federal officials have 
never disclosed where he was being held 
to prosecute younis federal officials moved more than two dozen 
lebanese and jordanian witnesses and their relatives to the united 
states and have provided them with new identities and careers 
according to testimony at the trial federal officials have refused 
to disclose the total cost

a core of overwhelmingly white producers and 
writers are creating characters in their own image producing 
artificial portrayals of blacks and other minorities on tv a 
womens group charged wednesday 
racial tension is commonplace in the real world but virtually 
invisible among white and minority characters on entertainment 
television concluded sally steenland author of a ford 
foundationfinanced study on how minorities are portrayed in the 
media 
the study unequal picture black hispanic asian and native 
american characters on television was released by wider 
opportunities for women a nonprofit group working to promote 
equality in the workplace 
among its major findings 
nine of 10 minority characters are middle class or wealthy where 
in reality more than 40 percent of minority men and 60 percent of 
minority women have incomes below 10000 a year 
most programs reduce injustice to individual conflict denying 
the reality of oppressive social structures except for a very few 
shows which present a multicultural world 
only situation comedies provide minority female characters as 
leading roles almost threequarters of all minority females on 
television are featured in comedies 
workplaces are portrayed as egalitarian with no hint of 
bias even though whites are almost always in charge 
the study examined more than 150 episodes of 30 network 
television series featuring minorities in recurring roles 
of the 78 minority characters on prime time tv the study found 
that the overwhelming majority 65 or 83 percent were blacks 
blacks account for about 55 percent of the nations minority 
population according to census bureau data 
hispanics accounted for only 12 percent of the minority 
characters on tv while they compose about 35 percent of the minority 
population asians about 6 percent of the minority population 
constituted about 4 percent of the minority characters on tv 
native americans indians constituted only 1 percent of the 
minority characters protrayed on in tv in reality native americans 
make up about 2 percent of the minority population 
of the 162 producers working on the 30 shows only 12 were 
blacks hispanics asians or native americans the study said and 
of the 12 minority producers only four were women 
no wonder tvs integrated world is such a happy one said 
steenland no wonder minority characters are nearly identical to 
their white buddies white producers and writers are creating 
characters in their own image 
the study said the token status of minority producers and 
writers in television can be overcome only through more aggressive 
recruiting hiring and promotion

while congress fiddles with defense budget 
cuts soviet president mikhail s gorbachev is building a more 
dangerous strategic arsenal despite his attentiongetting offers 
to slash military spending defense secretary dick cheney said 
wednesday 
the soviet union has been making major improvements to every 
leg of its strategic arsenal cheney said in systems ranging 
from intercontinental missiles and bombers to submarines and 
strategic defense the soviet union is getting stronger while our 
congress debates and our country treads water 
despite some cuts he said the soviets may well be producing a 
leaner and meaner military force and not just a smaller one 
he made the remarks in an address prepared for delivery to the 
veterans of foreign wars national convention in las vegas nev a 
text was made available at the pentagon 
cheney in some of his harshest criticism to date against his 
former colleagues lambasted the house for its budgetslashing 
approach to president bushs pentagon spending plan for the 1990 
fiscal year 
the former wyoming congressman accused the house of gutting the 
administrations military requests and using the defense budget as 
a jobs program 
cheney faulted the houses decision to limit production of the 
b2 stealth bomber carve 18 billion from the strategic defense 
initiative slash the mx rail garrison system and delete 100 
million for the midgetman missile from the budget 
the house and senate will meet in early september to craft a 
final blueprint on 295 billion in pentagon spending cheney warned 
that if the two chambers produce similar decisions in their upcoming 
conference the bill will be veto bait for the president 
he charged that many in the house seem to think there is no 
real threat anymore from the soviets 
they have seen some changes and apparently believe that 
everything now is just fine its as if they decided to give away 
their overcoats on the first sunny day in january he said 
while cheneys tone offered a contrast to the current climate of 
improved ussoviet relations he did note that the recently 
improved ussoviet ties paved the way for the inf treaty banning 
intermediate nuclear weapons in europe talks on slashing the 
superpowers strategic weapons and discussion on cutting 
conventional forces in europe 
but he said he could not say there was a reduced soviet threat 
if anything the united states is facing a more formidable 
offensive strategic arsenal today than before mr gorbachev took 
power thats right i said more formidable not less cheney said 
although there has been talk of a 14 percent cut in its defense 
budget since 1985 soviet defense expenditures have actually 
increased by an average of 3 percent per year in real terms at the 
same time our defense spending has declined in real terms by over 
11 percent cheney said 
as evidence of the heightened threat the pentagon chief pointed 
to the soviets 170 mobile ss25 singlewarhead intercontinental 
nuclear missiles their 58 ss24 missiles each of which carries 10 
independently targetable nuclear warheads and their modernization 
program for their 300 ss18 missiles which also carry 10 warheads 
however friendly mr gorbachev may sound however friendly he 
may in some respects wish to be he cannot explain the deployment of 
the beefedup ss18 as a friendly act cheney said 
the secretary called for a tough us response to the soviet 
program saying we need to modernize our own strategic forces 
because soviet strategic capabilities are becoming more dangerous 
under mr gorbachev despite his popular impression to the 
contrary 
cheney called for restoration of the presidents budget requests 
in order to respond adequately to the soviet threat 
the soviets are moving forward it would be irresponsible for 
the united states to try to get by with aging systems cheney said 
a study by the cia and the pentagons defense intelligence agency 
issued in april reported that soviet defense spending rose 3 percent 
last year despite gorbachevs promises to cut his military budget 
the study added however that it appeared gorbachev was laying 
the groundwork for his proposed 142 percent cut in defense spending

president bush praised soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev on wednesday for urging the polish 
communist party to participate in the new solidarityled government 
saying the intervention was a positive sign 
bush also told reporters at his vacation home that administration 
and colombian officials were discussing what us aid the south 
american nation might need to help fight drug cartels 
and the president said he had no problem with france sending its 
warships into the mediterranean although the action has provoked 
threatening statements from the proiranian terrorists holding 
americans hostage in lebanon 
i am not about to criticize the french for what they are 
doing in sending ships to stand by for possible evacuation of 
french nationals from lebanon he said they have tried to be a 
catalyst for peace in lebanon 
bush standing with his back to the ocean at his scenic seaside 
home took questions on a variety of topics from a group of maine 
reporters and several washington reporters traveling with him 
he then took the group to watch his wife barbara play doubles 
tennis to prove she was feeling fine after being prescribed a new 
medication for eye irritation stemming from her graves disease 
bush was asked if he thought the soviets were playing a helpful 
role in poland in light of gorbachevs 40minute phone call to 
soviet communist party leader mieczyslaw f rakowski after the 
call polish communist leaders announced they would be willing to 
enter a partnership with the evolving solidarityled government 
on sunday the polish communists had demanded more than the two 
ministerial posts promised to them earlier in an agreement with 
solidarity and had said it wanted to be treated as a full governing 
partner in the new government 
the communists in the unusual announcement of gorbachevs call 
indicated anew their insistence on a strong communist presence in 
the government but also reflected moscows acceptance of the idea 
that the party should reach an accommodation with the solidarityled 
coalition 
there are a lot of changes taking place it will be far 
reaching there will be bumps in the road as these countries more 
toward more democracy theres no question about that bush said 
but i feel the statement i saw attributed to mr gorbachev was 
very positive in this regard very 
on another matter bush said that vice president dan quayle had 
ably spelled out our policy when he said that humanitarian aid 
to the nicaraguan contras should continue until safe and 
democratic conditions exist in nicaragua even after the elections 
there in february 
i dont want to see the mandatory demobilization of those 
contras before the elections ive felt that the pressure from 
the contras has been the thing thats led president daniel ortega 
to start moving a little bit on free fair elections bush said 
officials have said the administration supports the ongoing peace 
efforts of the central american presidents who have called for 
demobilization of the contras by years end coupled with democratic 
reforms in nicaragua 
bush reiterated his support for colombias president virgilio 
barco in that nations attempted crackdown on drug lords 
i have great respect for what president barco is trying to do 
its a tough problem that he faces i am convinced he is 
determined to whip the problem to beat it and free his country from 
the grip of drug cartels 
he said speculation that the united states might send troops to 
help barcos antidrug efforts got out of whack in news accounts 
after attorney general dick thornburgh said sunday that would be an 
option if barco asked for it barco has said since that he does not 
want us military personnel and administration officials have said 
there are no plans to send troops 
if such aid were requested bush said of course id take that 
under consideration but that is not whats being considered at 
all 
on other matters bush said 
he does my very best to stay in touch with average peoples 
concerns asked how he can relate to the average maine resident who 
makes just over 15000 a year bush replied 
im very privileged and lucky in that regard but i also dont

an algerian demanding peace in lebanon 
hijacked an air france jetliner wednesday after it left paris but 
he was arrested after landing armed only with a can of shaving cream 
and soap officials said 
the unarmed emigre who had a history of petty crime said he took 
over the passenger flight from paris to algiers to call attention to 
the need to end violence in lebanon and palestine 
the planes pilot joseph valat told algerian radio the hijacker 
had asked to go to tunis tunisia then the algerian cities of 
annaba and constantine but those airports refused landing 
permission and the aircraft landed at its original destination of 
algiers 
valat said the air pirate had used a can of shaving cream as his 
weapon he earlier was reported to have used a bottle of spray 
perfume 
in a statement at algiers houari boumedienne airport he called 
for the holding of an international conference on lebanon the 
opening of a dialogue between the plo and israel and the liberation 
of all hostages and prisoners in the region 
algerian police identified the hijacker as said djamel alias 
bendada and said he was a 30yearold merchant in paris 
the french news agency agence francepresse citing unidentified 
sources in paris said the man was being expelled for violating 
public order and said he displayed great agitation before 
being put on the flight to algiers 
an air france spokeswoman said the hijacking ended at 325 pm 
1025 am edt barely an hour after the plane landed she said 
the 102 passengers and 13 crew members were safe 
the air pirate allowed to make a statement before being taken 
for questioning told reporters he used the toiletry articles as his 
only weapons 
the pilot in a statement at the airport said the hijacker had a 
big object under his jacket to give the appearance of a weapon and 
that he made known he was capable of blowing up the plane in the 
radio interview later he said the air pirate had concealed a can of 
shaving cream 
the hijacking came amid heightened tensions between france and 
moslem forces fighting in lebanon the syrian forces and their 
allied moslem militias recently said they would shell french 
warships gathering in the eastern mediterranean if they intervened 
militarily in lebanon 
france said the warships were dispatched to evacuate 7000 french 
nationals in lebanon if the 5monthold battle between moslem and 
christian forces worsens but the moslems accuse the french of 
backing the christians

increasingly exciting images sent back by 
voyager 2 as it nears neptune show that a partial ring extends over 
twothirds of the planet and is probably a second complete ring 
like weve never seen before scientists said wednesday 
weve got people literally jumping up and down up there where 
scientists are analyzing the latest photos at nasas jet propulsion 
laboratory said bradford smith leader of the imaging team 
the images show triton neptunes curious backwardorbiting moon 
to be a bright pink red and blue marble covered with discolored 
patches of frozen natural gas or methane 
dark areas near the moons equator are in fact a very deep red 
said smith much of the southern portion of the moon is pink with 
what appears to be a blue fringe 
if it is indeed blue its the only thing weve seen blue on 
any satellite since we launched voyager said smith 
concern that tritons surface might be blocked from view by 
clouds has now subsided 
almost certainly were seeing the surface smith said that 
suggests some real excitement here friday morning and again on 
saturday when voyager sends back photographs from its closest 
pass by triton 
partial rings around neptune were first observed by voyager on 
aug 11 on tuesday scientists announced that the fainter of the 
two socalled ring arcs was a complete ring 
as voyager nears its closest pass of neptune thursday at 856 
pm pdt researchers expect it to reveal that the brighter arc 
extends all the way around the pale blue planet 
probably its a ring said smith but its a ring like 
weve never seen before 
researchers also expect to find at least two new moons near 
neptune beyond the two previously known and the four already 
discovered by voyager smith said 
final commands to direct the pointing of voyagers cameras and 
other instruments were transmitted to the spacecraft wednesday 
afternoon incorporating the latest data available on the precise 
locations of neptune triton and associated moons and rings 
researchers spotted the first possibility of a meteorite crater 
on triton i saw a circular feature said smith certainly an 
impact crater is a possibility but confirmation will await more 
detailed images he said 
two days of tracking the spacecraft since the execution of a 
delicate unorthodox course correction monday show that the new 
trajectory is right on target 
after a 12year 44 billionmile flight voyager will be within 
one second and within 20 miles of where it is supposed to be for the 
neptune encounter said douglas griffith deputy mission manager 
the spacecraft will pass 3042 miles from neptunes cloud tops 
and 23888 miles from triton said robert cesarone of the navigation 
team 
because of uncertainties about the size of the two bodies and the 
strength of their gravitational fields there is an uncertainty of 
about 20 miles in the distance to neptune and 120 miles in the 
distance to triton cesarone said 
the course maneuver using two small thrusters instead of the 
spacecrafts main thruster to avoid heating and thereby disrupting a 
sensitive radio receiver had been practiced once but never 
attempted before scientists said 
there are an awful lot of happy scientists with respect to the 
wonderful job the navigation team has done said edward stone 
voyager project scientist this means well have our full ability 
to find out whats there 
the new course will allow the spacecraft to pass behind neptune 
as seen from both the earth and the sun as it passes behind the 
planet it will send radio signals to earth through neptunes 
atmosphere and analyze sunlight passing through the atmosphere 
providing detailed information on the atmospheres makeup said 
norman haynes voyager project manager

the namibian guerrilla movement 
acknowledged wednesday it tortured its political prisoners and it 
invited foreign observers to verify its claim that all such inmates 
now are free 
hidipo hamutenya spokesman for the southwest africa peoples 
organization said the group would allow the international red 
cross amnesty international and the united nations to inspect sites 
in angola and zambian where dissidents and suspected spies were 
detained 
the organizations have for years been denied access to the camps 
despite repeated requests 
hamutenya said the guerrilla group released in may all 201 
prisoners in its custody as part of the unsponsored plan to bring 
independence to namibia next year after 74 years of south african 
rule 
former detainees have said the group still holds as many as 2000 
additional prisoners in underground pits the exprisoners have 
compiled a list with the names of more than 500 people they believe 
still are detained or have been killed by the guerrilla group 
the best way to get to the bottom of this issue is for the 
groups we have mentioned to go to angola and zambia to satisfy 
yourself said theoben gurirab who handles southwest africa 
peoples organizations foreign affairs we will continue to say 
we are not holding any more prisoners 
gurirab said some former prisoners were tortured and officers 
charged with gathering information from prisoners carried out 
brutalities against these persons which we very much regret 
gurirab said however that his group would reject a formal 
international investigation of wartime abuses 
after independence expected early next year church leaders 
tribal chiefs and community groups should conduct a full 
inventory of alleged abuses by both the guerrillas and the south 
africanled security forces gurirab said 
the two sides fought a 23yearbush war in northern namibia and 
the security forces were accused of dozens of abuses against both 
civilians and guerrillas 
many alleged abuses have been blamed on a paramilitary police 
unit known as koevoet the afrikaans word for crowbar the unit 
was disbanded in january but many members were integrated into the 
regular police force 
the guerrilla organization with un backing has said 
exkoevoet members continue to harass civilians and should be 
removed from the force namibias south african administrator louis 
pienaar has refused to dismiss exkoevoet fighters but has 
confined them to base 
gurirab said that unless intimidation of guerrilla supporters 
ends we cannot see how the election can be free and fair 
we are for a clean campaign but it is becoming difficult to 
restrain our members he added 
more than 600000 of an estimated 675000 eligible voters have 
registered for the polls namibia the size of france and west 
germany combined has only 13 million people and more than 50 
percent are illiterate 
gurirab also said that southwest africa peoples organization 
leader sam nujoma has decided not to return to namibia this weekend 
and has set no date for coming back he has been in exile since 1960

vietnams foreign minister said 
wednesday he expects an international peace conference on cambodia 
to reach a settlement in the decadeold war in that country 
i expect there will be a comprehensive solution but at the 
same time i must be prepared for the worst nguyen co thach said 
of prospects for the peace conference in paris where he will head 
friday 
thach was echoing remarks made by cambodian premier hun sen in 
phnom penh on thursday before he left for paris vietnam invaded 
cambodia in 1978 ousting the communist khmer rouge regime and 
installing another regime 
vietnam has pledged to withdraw its estimated 26000 troops from 
cambodia by sept 26 
thach said he expects the main point of disagreement at the 
conference to be the role of the khmer rouge in cambodias future 
the main difficulty is the question of recognition of the 
genocide of pol pot he said 
pol pots khmer rouge killed hundreds of thousands of cambodians 
during its rule between 1975 and 1978 the khmer rouge now controls 
the largest fighting force in the threefaction guerrilla alliance 
the governments of vietnam and cambodia have insisted the khmer 
rouge should not be allowed take part in any future coalition 
government in cambodia while its old leadership remains intact the 
united states has also said the khmer rouge should not be allowed to 
return to power 
the rebel clandestine radio station voice of the khmer on 
thursday quoted the guerrilla coalition leader prince norodom 
sihanouk as ruling out a proposed twoparty powersharing 
arrangement between his faction and hun sen 
the report said sihanouk restated his demand for forming a 
provisional fourparty government of all the cambodian factions 
including the khmer rouge and the hun sen administration 
the paris conference which began at the end of july is being 
attended by representatives of all four factions 
the conference sent a investigation team to cambodia to assess 
the possibility of forming international mechanisms to help bring 
peace to cambodia

the government said wednesday it will shut 
down its railway link with europe to stop ethnic turks from bulgaria 
who are trying to enter turkey illegally 
the single european train that travels daily between munich west 
germany and istanbul goes through austria yugoslavia and bulgaria 
it is turkeys only rail link to those countries 
in his announcement foreign ministry spokesman murat sungar told 
reporters the train service would stop friday he said that until 
then all ethnic turks traveling on the train without visas would be 
turned back 
hundreds of ethnic turks have been arriving daily on the train 
since may about 310000 ethnic turks from bulgaria have flooded 
into turkey in the past three months by train and other means 
the turks say they are fleeing a harsh assimilation campaign that 
has forced them to use slavic rather than moslem names they say 
they have also been fined and beaten for speaking turkish in public 
and for practicing islam 
on tuesday turkey began requiring visas for the refugees 
turkish officials initially tried to turn back a group of 522 
ethnic turks without visas who rode the european train on tuesday 
but authorities allowed the refugees to cross the border after some 
tried to jump out of the train 
sungar said turkey might review its decision to close the railway 
if the bulgarian government guarantees it will not send immigrants 
without visas on the trains 
turkish officials say they are trying to negotiate an immigration 
accord guaranteeing protections for departing bulgarian turks such 
as compensation for property the officials say that meanwhile they 
are trying to gain some control over the crush of refugees 
however opposition parties accuse the government of backing away 
from its pledge to accept any of the estimated 15 million ethnic 
turks who want to leave bulgaria 
a bulgarian immigrant who crossed the border with a valid visa 
said thousands of ethnic turks were waiting on the bulgarian side 
the semiofficial anatolia news agency reported wednesday 
it quoted ahmet durmushev as saying the refugees were living in 
miserable conditions with little water or food

the city planning commission on wednesday 
unanimously rejected a developers plan to transfer the air rights 
above the landmark grand central terminal so he could construct a 
74story building two blocks away 
it is common practice in new york city to transfer the air rights 
from one lot to an adjacent lot for example if a building only has 
five floors in an area where 10story buildings are allowed the 
developer of a building next door can buy the unused rights and 
construct a 15story building 
but air rights can only be used for an adjacent lot or property 
across the street according to the city law department 
the commission said the developers attempt to trace a chain of 
subsurface lots train tunnels going from the terminal to beneath 
the proposed building did not meet the law 
commissioner sylvia deutsch also said the proposed building was 
too big for the neighborhood 
the developer of the proposed 74story building g ware 
travelstead and penn central corp owner of the terminal and the 
air rights did not indicate what action they would take until they 
studied the commissions report

wednesday and bantered with her husband a day after beginning new 
medication for her graves disease then posed crosseyed for 
reporters in mock exaggeration of her condition 
can we inspect your eyeballs please president bush called 
to his wife as she enjoyed a spritely game of doubles at the 
couples seaside vacation home 
she walked to the edge of the court where the president had 
brought a gaggle of reporters and cameras mrs bush stood with her 
hands on her hips and made a bugeyed face crossing her eyes toward 
her nose 
my eyes are just fine she said before the president 
playfully ran onto the court and tried to put his hand over her 
eyes dont do that he said laughing 
asked by reporters how she was feeling she at first said she was 
just sick about her tennis game then added no i feel 
wonderful 
mrs bush on tuesday was ordered by doctors to begin taking 
prednisone a mild steroid for eye irritation and double vision 
triggered by graves disease a thyroid condition she suffers 
the thyroidattacking characteristics of the disease were 
arrested by a radioactive iodine treatment she had a few months ago 
but the eye condition had not improved her office said 
she interupted her vacation with bush to return to the doctors in 
washington on tuesday but was back that evening 
the first lady at first acted annoyed with her husband for 
bringing reporters to watch her play with partner betsy heminway 
against daughterinlaw margaret bush and cousin debbie stapleton 
the president took on a mischievous air when suggesting to white 
house chief of staff john sununu press secretary marlin fitzwater 
and the reporters that they take a stroll over to the court 
following a questionandanswer session in front of the walkers 
point home 
i thought there were some things george bush wouldnt stoop 
to mrs bush joked 
dressed in visor cap and white tennis dress the first lady 
appeared in fine form vigorously hitting and serving the ball 
however the president joshed during serve change between games 
that its like watching grass grow out there 
he said his wifes eyes already had improved and that the doctors 
had said she would get quick relief with the prednisone a form of 
cortisone with fewer side effects

a newly merged denomination the 
evangelical lutheran church in america headed into its first 
national assembly wednesday seeking a sense of family 
it also faced specific issues from proposals for getting rid of 
investments in companies doing business in south africa to 
ecumenical relations 
the 53 millionmember denomination formed last year from three 
lutheran groups is the fourthlargest protestant body in the 
country 
bishop herbert w chilstrom the churchs presiding head said 
the convention should provide a greater sense of identity so 
people will be able to say we belong together in the same family 
of faith 
its amazing how quickly that spirit is developing he said 
in an interview theres very little looking back to what we 
were 
the assembly is the first occasion for churchwide action on 
policy matters since the denomination began functioning at new 
headquarters established here 
about 2000 lutherans including 1050 voting delegates were 
present for the opening festive service of holy communion and a 
robed procession of the churchs 65 bishops who head regional synods 
a huge white panel over the podium carries the theme of this 
assembly many voices one song 
the preacher for the occasion was the rev emilio castro a 
methodist and general secretary of the world council of churches 
whether the new denomination should join that council of most 
major protestant and orthodox denominations and a similarly 
constituted domestic body the national council of churches was an 
issue before the assembly 
different stances about it were taken by the predecessor lutheran 
bodies that however is only one of many matters the new church is 
to settle as it sets its initial course 
in a stateofthechurch report chilstrom said the early phase 
of the churchs life has been a time of incredible adjustment for 
all of us 
demands of getting ourselves organized were so great that we 
found ourselves reacting more often than acting he said 
but we are now nearing the end of this early transition 
period he said and its up to the assembly to make decisions 
that will determine the direction of the church for the years to 
come 
the denomination was created through merger of the lutheran 
church in america the american lutheran church and the association 
of evangelical lutheran churches the first two themselves products 
of earlier mergers 
lutherans in this country once were divided into more than a 
score of different denominations mainly distinguished by the german 
or scandinavian nationalities from which they stemmed 
the new body has set a goal of becoming at least 10 percent 
ethnic minority members by the end of its first decade 
the eightday convention runs through next wednesday with 
financial matters a worrisome concern including a 158 million 
shortfall in anticipated revenues last year for a 993 million 
national budget altogether members contributed 11 billion last 
year most of it used for congregational expenses and local 
charities

the advisory committee on federal pay says 
government workers should be given a pay increase of 10 percent next 
year to help narrow the gap between their salaries and those paid to 
counterparts in the private sector 
the bottom line on federal pay is that the gap has become a 
canyon said martin l duggan the committees chairman in 
releasing its latest annual report 
he pointed to figures issued two weeks ago by the presidents pay 
agent an interagency group involving officials of the labor 
department office of personnel management and office of management 
and budget showing that the pay gap has now grown to 286 percent 
duggan said that we commend the president and congress for 
granting a 36 percent increase to become effective in january 1990 
but the committee believes that an additional 64 percent is 
needed 
this would send a strong and clear message to young people who 
would not consider a public service career that the government is 
serious about recruiting wellqualified people he said in issuing 
the report tuesday 
duggan added that the absence of adequate pay increases over 
the past decade is driving out the capable people who are already in 
the federal government 
in addition to the pay raise recommendation the panels report 
calls for phasing in further increases to remove the pay gap over a 
fouryear period reforming the pay system by making salaries more 
responsive to labor market conditions redesigning the health care 
benefit program to provide more costefficient coverage and 
updating the governments benefits package to better compete for 
skills in the labor market 
carol a bonosaro president of the senior executives 
association representing top career federal executives called the 
advisory committees report right on target in urging the pay 
increase 
she noted that the pay gap tends to be greater at upper levels of 
government service with gs15s falling 367 percent behind their 
private sector counterparts 
this is even more strong evidence that senior federal 
executives above that level are grossly undercompensated ms 
bonosaro said 
john n sturdivant president of the american federation of 
government employees aflcio commented that as a result of the 
continued imposition of pay caps beginning in 1978 the federal 
government has found itself in an untenable position with inferior 
noncompetitive salaries in a nationally tight labor market 
failure to begin to remedy the current pay gap will virtually 
ensure that the nations largest employer will remain the employer 
of last resort sturdivant said 
afge is the largest union for government workers representing 
700000 federal employees in the united states and overseas

until this year blind students who enrolled at one 
of the nations largest independent music schools were told that no 
matter what their academic record they could never graduate 
berklee college of music required students to learn to sightread 
sheet music making it impossible for the 2900student 
undergraduate schools few blind students to get a degree 
the us department of educations office of civil rights 
recently ruled that berklee discriminated against the blind giving 
blind students a chance to get a diploma from the school as well as 
an education 
this means something to all blind people not just the 
musically inclined kenneth jernigan executive director of the 
50000member national federation for the blind in baltimore said 
wednesday every time a chip of prejudice is cut away it helps 
officials at the 44yearold downtown boston school have 
struggled with the issue for years said its dean lawrence bethune 
the sightreading requirement is tailored to berklees reputation 
for training students to be able to undertake any musical 
assignment bethune said other schools such as juilliard in new 
york train students in a more classical mode he said 
berklee is almost like a trade school bethune said the 
hardest thing is to teach people to be able to function as a 
musician to make a living from music for 30 years at juilliard 
if you learn the oboe part for beethovens fifth its never going 
to change itll always be the same piece of music 
students with a berklee degree should be able to walk in any 
studio and lay down a guitar track with madonna or play a cut with 
tony bennett and be capable of improvising from whatever sheet 
music is used he said 
jernigan disagreed the problem is that sight reading is not 
totally relevant to playing music i guess it means that berklee 
wouldnt let stevie wonder in 
bethune said no more than a few blind students have studied at 
berklee in his 20 years there 
the case began two years ago when a visually impaired woman 
decided to apply to berklee and was told she would not graduate her 
mother filed a complaint with the office of civil rights 
the office ruled against the school june 29 concluding that 
qualified blind students should not be held back based on their 
inability to perform a single test 
the woman who has not been identified did not attend berklee 
and has not reapplied bethune said 
a berklee curriculum committee had been looking at the core 
requirements before the ruling and had decided to change the sight 
reading requirement irrespective of the discrimination case bethune 
said 
the ruling was nonbinding but would have put the issue in court

hungarian guards used dogs to tighten 
border control but 250 east germans still reached austria overnight 
in the tide of escape from their repressive communist homeland 
witnesses said wednesday 
border guards thwarted what appeared to be a mass crossing by 
intercepting three buses from budapest near lake neusiedl which 
straddles the border sources said they said 300 east germans were 
in the buses 
austrian officials and witnesses said only about 30 east germans 
arrived wednesday witnesses at the klingenbach crossing in austria 
said they saw hungarian border guards turn back nearly 20 east 
german cars 
arriving east germans said hungarian authorities had begun 
checking groups of east german tourists in areas away from the 
border to try to discourage any who might be contemplating escape 
in bonn a newspaper said that east germany is planning to impose 
strict new travel regulations to hungary to stem the flow of 
refugees 
the die welt newspaper quoting unidentified western diplomatic 
sources in east berlin said east german officials plan to 
drastically restrict travel to hungary by sept 1 
the newspaper said visa applications for hungary are already 
being given strict scrutiny it said only official trips and visits 
by trusted party members are being allowed 
the report given in advance to other news media was to appear 
in the newspapers thursday edition 
flight from east germany through hungary started in may after 
the liberal communist regime in budapest began removing barbed wire 
and other obstacles from its border with austria permission to 
visit the west is rare for east germans but they can travel to 
neighboring hungary with ease 
west germanys foreign ministry said wednesday about 3300 east 
germans had arrived via austria so far this month 2000 of those in 
the past four days 
an associated press reporter watching the frontier near 
moerbisch on the austrian side said hungarian guards were 
patrolling at intervals of about 130 feet some had dogs 
they were covering a stretch of about 2 miles where many east 
germans had crossed 
journalists and other observers at the border said the influx was 
down to a trickle at 6 am wednesday more than 500 east germans 
crossed the previous day 
one young refugee said of his reasons for fleeing food and 
drink is okay in east germany housing is poor and the rest you can 
forget 
another said there is nothing you can decide freely you must 
always ask if you may then they say yes or no but you are never 
told why its no 
a 23yearold man from east berlin said he scaled border fences 
12 times before being certain he was in austria he said the 
meandering frontier and his unfamiliarity with the terrain had 
confused him 
a refugee from freiberg 21 said it took him 27 hours to 
complete his successful escape 
scores of austrian citizens who know the border area and west 
german tourists with detailed maps are known to help east germans 
cross the border 
i dont know their names they dont know my name said a 
west german who helps refugees youve got to help these people 
most volunteer their services but the fees of guides who charge 
range up to nearly 500 in west german marks 
villagers in austria help new arrivals by providing showers food 
and closting 
this assistance comes unsolicited and is spontaneous a 
police official said the local government in austrias burgenland 
border province has not become involved in relief efforts 
shuttle buses provided by west germany take refugees to vienna 
where they are provided with the necessary papers to continue their 
journey 
in budapest the communist party daily newspaper nepszabasag 
published an interview with the border guard involved in the death 
monday of east german refugee kurt werner schulz 36 who was shot 
50 feet inside austria 
the 20yearold border guard said his gun went off during a 
scuffle with schulz

president bush wouldnt say wednesday 
whether hed consider inviting mikhail gorbachev to his vacation 
home but bush was sure the soviet leader would take to the seacoast 
town everybody likes it he declared 
the president took a break from his boating golf and tennis to 
field questions from maine reporters on the lawn of his vacation 
home discussing everything from world events to the price of 
lobster 
but he sidestepped a question on whether he would ever invite 
gorbachev to join him at his maine retreat 
well hed be welcome said bush who is here on a threeweek 
vacation that runs through labor day 
do you think hed like it bush was asked 
who couldnt like it yes everybody likes it 
asked if the average mainer could afford to have a vacation like 
his the president responded i dont think so im very 
privileged and lucky in that regard but i also dont think the 
average mainer begrudges me a vacation of any kind 
the president was stumped when one reporter asked mr 
president what do you think a fair price for a pound of lobster 
is 
i dont know cant give it to you 
bush was also asked to reflect on his first seven months in 
office and to comment on his high acceptance level reflected by 
public opinion polls 
some of it is my wife some of it is the fact i think people 
see that were trying hard its fundamental values some of it is 
that ive tried to calm things down and work with congress 
but these things change you know these polls look youre 
looking at a guy who was standing on this lawn about a year ago at 
this time and the numbers were quite different what goes up 
can come down and im well aware of that 
he admitted the white house trappings that have caused traffic 
headaches for town residents have also made his summer in 
kennebunkport different from years past 
what bothers me a little bit is that you just cant jump in the 
car over there and drive downtown or something of that nature he 
said but that goes with the territory

the national wildlife federation escalating 
the legal fight over protecting endangered sea turtles from the nets 
of gulf coast shrimp fisherman took its case to a federal appeals 
court wednesday 
rebuffed by a us district court judge on tuesday the 
federation asked the us court of appeals to reinstate a law that 
requires shrimpers to use devices that let turtles escape from their 
nets 
the federation sought an emergency injunction to ensure the 
continued survival of the severely endangered kemps ridley sea 
turtle and four other sea turtle species listed as threatened or 
endangered 
the federation is challenging commerce secretary robert 
mosbachers decision allowing shrimpers to limit trawling time to 
105 minutes in lieu of turtle excluder devices or teds 
under the 105minute limit shrimpers can have their nets in the 
water for 90 minutes the length of time some officials claim a sea 
turtle can survive while submerged the regulations give shrimpers 
another 7 minutes to get their nets in the water and 7 minutes to 
remove them 
mosbacher suspended enforcement of the teds regulations july 24 
after a weekend of protests by shrimpers who claim the devices 
reduce their catch and threaten their livelihood 
according to the biological opinion of the secretarys own 
scientists the substitution of a limited tow time for required ted 
use in the midst of the shrimping season will result in the deaths 
of thousands of threatened and endangered sea turtles in the gulf 
and the atlantic the federation said in its appeal 
the temporary regulations drafted under a court order by us 
district judge thomas hogan are in effect through sept 8 when 
mosbacher must issue final rules 
mosbacher issued the temporary regulations after the wildlife 
federation filed suit and hogan ruled the turtles were being left 
totally unprotected 
but federation claims that national marine fisheries service 
scientists have concluded the 105minute plan will jeopardize the 
continued existence of five threatened and endangered species of sea 
turtles 
commerce spokesman brian gorman said the final rules due out 
sept 8 are still under consideration

hundreds of thousands of baltic 
residents linked hands wednesday to form a human chain across their 
tiny homelands a defiant repudiation of soviet rule on the 50th 
anniversary of their lost sovereignty 
lithuanians latvians and estonians took up spots along a 
370mile route from the gulf of finland south to the lithuanian 
capital of vilnius to demand that moscow grant more freedom and 
admit it annexed their republics by force 
organizers said they expected 15 million people about onefifth 
of the baltic republics 8 million residents to link hands initial 
indications were that more than 1 million took part 
the official soviet news agency tass said 300000 people joined 
hands in estonia and nearly 500000 in lithuania in latvia 
peoples front officials said 400000 participated 
after decades of denials soviet officials have admitted that a 
secret deal between josef stalin and adolf hitler deeded control of 
the baltic states to the kremlin but they maintain the nations 
voluntarily joined the soviet union 
in moscow police arrested 75 people demonstrating in support of 
the baltic residents 
in vilnius about 5000 people gathered in cathedral square 
holding candles and singing the song that was lithuanias national 
anthem until stalins tanks rolled into lithuania and the other 
baltic states in 1940 
grazina staniute a 15yearold lithuanian student from kaunas 
said the candles symbolize those who died in exile when we light 
the candles they will be with us 
brone surzilate 58 one of those exiled under stalin as the 
communists set up a soviet regime held a card with the number 
1222660 she said that was the number of lithuanians that 
activists estimate have suffered repression under soviet rule 
in the southern soviet republic of moldavia which also was 
absorbed by the soviet union at the same time 10000 people turned 
out in a heavy rain for a twohour outdoor rally said moldavian 
peoples front spokesman yuri rozhgo 
in this port city on the gulf of finland the human chain began 
at a windwhipped medieval tower where estonian premier indrik toome 
and other leaders headed the line of unity 
we are proclaiming to each other and to the whole world that we 
in the baltic nations have never given up our freedom heinz valk 
a leader of the grassroots estonian peoples front said 
lines of tens of thousands of solemnfaced estonians their hands 
clasped and four deep in places stretched from the tower as far as 
the eye could see vabadus they said passing the estonian word 
for freedom down the line 
the line was to snake southward through several cities including 
the latvian capital of riga and end in the lithuanian capital 
the chain climaxed a series of protests marking the anniversary 
of the aug 23 1939 nonaggression treaty between soviet union and 
nazi germany 
organizers said the human chain would symbolize the baltic 
peoples solidarity in their struggle for more autonomy and 
possibly eventual independence from moscow 
the more liberal political climate introduced by president 
mikhail s gorbachev has allowed baltic residents to voice demands 
that as recently as last year would have meant arrest or exile 
however in moscow police broke up what authorities said was an 
unauthorized demonstration by the democratic union a selfstyled 
opposition to the communist party that activists said was called to 
denounce the hitlerstalin pact 
seventyfive people were detained near pushkin square for 
breaching the peace resisting police and petty hooliganism after 
democratic union leaders climbed on telephone booths and lampposts 
the tass news agency said 
the soviet tv news program vremya in the first comment by 
moscowbased media on the extraordinary baltic protest said it 
would be political naivete to believe europes borders can be 
redrawn now 
the united states and some other western countries do not 
recognize the baltic republics as parts of the soviet union 
maintaining they are captive nations baltic emigre regimes have 
their own embassies in washington 
in washington state department spokesman richard boucher 
reiterated the us policy of not recognizing soviet annexation of 
the baltic republics we firmly support the peaceful efforts of 
the baltic peoples to regain control over their own political and 
economic destiny he said 
earlier in vilnius about 200 members of 17 radical lithuanian 
political groups marched about a halfmile to mountain park where 
they burned a twoheaded effigy of hitler and stalin both the 
dictators mouths dripped with blood 
hitler and stalin drank the blood of lithuania from one glass 
and then started to eat each other jonas mugevicius leader of 
the lithuanian democratic party told about 4000 people who 
attended the rally 
about 170 leaders of the grassroots lithuanian group sajudis who 
also met in vilnius voted to call for the creation of an 
independent democratic lithuanian republic not under the power of 
the soviet union 
that rhetoric showed how far baltic militants have come from last 
fall when their vaguely worded demands of sovereignty were bold 
in a secret protocol to the 1939 treaty signed by their foreign 
ministers joachim von ribbentrop and vyacheslav molotov hitler and 
stalin carved eastern europe into spheres of influence the 
baltic republics fell into the soviet sphere and became a world war 
ii battleground 
a commission of the national soviet parliament the congress of 
peoples deputies recently ruled the authenticity of the secret 
protocol had to be recognized and recommended the legislature 
declare it invalid 
the commissions report published tuesday in estonia marked a 
big step forward from former soviet denials the secret agreement 
ever existed 
however it did not acknowledge that the division of eastern 
europe made by the pact led to the soviet annexation of the baltic 
states the kremlin still maintains the three states voluntarily 
joined the soviet union

fire destroyed the remains of the last 
whaling station in the united states 
the fire at the abandoned wooden warehouse on pilings at point 
san pablo 10 miles inside san francisco bay began tuesday night 
its gone to the waterline richmond fire battalion chief 
james fajardo said wednesday 
the del monte fishing co opened a whaling business in the 
building in the 1950s in 1971 prodded by ecologists the federal 
government silenced the harpoon cannons of del montes three 
103foot vessels by then the last american whaling ships 
the brand name of del montes principal product used mainly for 
poultry and cattle feed was moby dick 100 percent whale meat 
its logo was a blowing grinning whale 
the business stuck in the craw of whale lovers who protested the 
suffering and decimation of the herds of sperms finbacks and seis 
del monte hunted 
del monte killed 109 of the 21500 whales taken worldwide in 
1969 the companys last manager charles caito said when the 
station closed 
in the 1840s the us whaling fleet numbered 750 vessels it was 
a multimillion dollar industry providing oil fuel for lighting and 
cooking in tens of thousands of american homes and inspiring stories 
of great courage like herman melvilles classic 1851 novel moby 
dick 
the surging petroleum industry and the sinking of many whaling 
ships by confederate warships during the civil war sent whaling into 
a decline after the war only 260 whalers were left and by the 
turn of the century the number had dwindled to 40 
american whaling ended in 1971 when us commerce secretary 
maurice stans issued a ban aimed at preserving threatened species

the national transportation safety board on 
wednesday recommended the use of redundant failsafe mechanisms 
on airliner cargo door latches to prevent the doors from popping 
open in flight and assure they are properly closed before takeoffs 
the ntsb said its investigation of an apparent cargo door failure 
last february in which nine people aboard a united airlines flight 
were killed shows that the original design of the doors on boeing 
747 models does not provide for the failsafe features intended 
one single failure can lead to the door being apparently 
closed latched and locked yet it can be unlatched or can become 
unlatched and neither the ground personnel nor the flight crew 
would be aware of its unsafe condition the agency said 
in a sevenpage safety recommendation to the federal aviation 
administration the ntsb said airliners should have redundant 
indicators to directly pinpoint the position of latch cams on the 
cargo doors 
the board also said torquelimiting devices should be installed 
on both the manual and electrical drives for cargo door latchs to 
prevent damage to the lock mechanisms during their operation 
while saying it has not determined the cause of the feb 24 
accident over the pacific ocean the board said the evidence 
strongly suggests that the forward cargo door opened in flight and 
led to the subsequent damage 
passengers were sucked out of a hole in the planes fuselage 
yet to be determined the board said is whether the cargo door 
was not latched or only partially latched before takeoff or if it 
became unlatched for some reason

nearly a million pounds of food for the 
hungry is stacked 18 feet high in a warehouse its distribution to 
outlying parts of the state delayed for lack of money transport 
vehicles and volunteer help some state officials say 
weve gotten the people to give us the food the problem is we 
dont have the means to get it to the people who need it and there 
are people starving out there said state rep alyce clarke of 
jackson a board member of the staterun mississippi food network 
the stored food donated by the us department of agriculture 
includes dried beans instant potatoes canned pork and citrus 
juices perishables including dairy products and frozen meats have 
been delivered before spoiling 
network board members say the agency lacks large transport 
vehicles and enough drivers to deliver the food more than 150 miles 
to poor counties in the mississippi delta and far northern parts of 
the state 
we cant get the food to tunica county and tishomingo county 
where people need it said jo ann gilder alford the food banks 
director of development and public relations 
but the food banks executive director jesse morris disagreed 
with other assessments of the agencys problem 
he said usda food is going on schedule to the networks 150 
member agencies which buy the food for 12 cents a pound but 
distribution would be made easier if the food bank had another 
warehouse in northern mississippi 
the food is going out morris said the problem is we need 
a building in north mississippi 
this year the network distributed 15 million pounds of food or 
about 25 million meals 
but because the agency does not have space in its warehouses for 
the surplus food it has leased private storage at a cost of 1800 
a month 
the burden on the network is increased because many of its member 
agencies lack vehicles and manpower to pick up the food in jackson 
board members said 
were trying to open a branch in north mississippi so we can 
better serve the state said board member rims barber of jackson 
this food all came in in a rush and we are trying to get it out 
in an orderly manner barber said the food is going out to 
member agencies but it is going out slower than we would like it 
to

solidarity and communist lawmakers on 
wednesday condemned as shameful the sovietgerman nonaggression 
pact signed 50 years ago that opened the way for world war ii 
legislators passed the resolution 3490 in the sejm or lower 
house of parliament as several hundred protesters marched through 
the streets of warsaw and three other cities to mark the anniversary 
of the ribbentropmolotov pact 
the pact was not only shameful from the moral point of view but 
also in violation of the basic principles of international law and 
thus from the very beginning null and void said the resolution 
introduced by solidarity lawmakers who comprise 35 percent of the 
chamber 
solidarity deputy janusz onyszkiewicz who introduced the 
resolution said the aug 23 1939 pact opened the way for hitler to 
attack poland just eight days later 
all people in poland know that this pact made it possible and 
helped hitler to carry out his various political plans said 
onyszkiewicz in particular it made it easier for him to invade 
poland 
it also made it easier for stalin to carry out his aspirations 
toward various european countries let me name here only lithuania 
latvia and estonia 
in a reference to the soviet union which for many years denied 
the key secret provisions of the molotovribbentrop pact 
onyszkiewicz said poland wants relations with its neighbors to be 
based on respect and based on truth 
this is the purpose the statement is supposed to serve he 
said 
at the protest march in central warsaw meanwhile a speaker from 
youth solidarity called for the withdrawal of all soviet troops from 
eastern europe a declaration of independence by states swallowed by 
the soviet union and independence for the different ethnic groups in 
that country 
the state news agency pap said there were also demonstrations in 
northern szczecin western pozanan and southern katowice 
youths threw coins and firebombs at police and placed antisoviet 
slogans at a soviet monument in szczecin the agency said 
demonstrators in warsaw held up banners saying soviets go 
home enough of pacts with reds 
police stood at a distance watching the warsaw protest held at 
constitution square on the anniversary of the treaty that resulted 
in loss of sovereignty for the three baltic republics of estonia 
latvia and lithuania 
among the groups present at the demonstration were youth 
solidarity fighting solidarity a splinter faction of the 
trade union and the banned polish socialist party 
the treaty by soviet foreign minister vyacheslav molotov and 
german foreign minister joachim von ribbentrop contained a secret 
protocol that set a friendly border running through what was then 
the polish republic 
on monday the polish communist party politburo condemned the 
protocol saying it represented a flagrant violation of 
international law 
last week a soviet communist party politburo member admitted for 
the first time the secret pact existed but he denied that the it 
bearing on the baltic states current legal status

the federal trade commission has ruled that the 
new england motor rate bureau illegally fixed rates charged by 
carriers hauling goods in massachusetts and new hampshire the 
agency said wednesday 
by a 31 vote the commission made the finding and ordered the 
bostonbased bureau to halt its collective ratemaking activities in 
most states and to cancel within six months all tariffs it has filed 
in those states 
the commission had originally charged nemrb and its member 
carriers in 1983 saying that they hindered competition in 
massachusetts rhode island and new hampshire 
the opinion noted that in massachusetts the state department of 
public utilities did not exercise its supervisory authority over 
rates subjecting the nemrbs collective ratepaying to federal 
antitrust scrutiny 
new hampshire neither reviews rates nor has the authority to 
suspend or reject rates the ftc noted 
in rhode island however the laws met the federal requirements 
for being exempt from federal antitrust regulation 
nemrb offices were closed and no representative could be 
identified to reach after hours for comment

prime ministerdesignate tadeusz mazowiecki 
indicated wednesday he would find more spots in his government for 
the communist party offering compromise the day before he is to be 
elected the east blocs first noncommunist head of government 
at parliamentary caucuses mazowiecki stressed it could be risky 
not to reach agreement with the communists especially when they 
still control the army and security police 
mazowieckis olive branch followed communist demands for a full 
coalition partnership role he made clear that offering the party 
such a role was realistic 
one cannot today form a government in poland other than a broad 
coalition having the support of all forces sitting at the sejm he 
told solidarity lawmakers 
but he also said he could not afford to give the communists too 
much 
we cannot allow the political forces which i represent and 
which nominated me as their candidate to be pushed into being 
merely symbolic things he later told an evening caucus of the 
lawmakers from the united peasant party and the democratic party 
the two minor parties in the solidarity coalition 
the remarks came one day after a 40minute telephone talk between 
polish communist party first secretary mieczyslaw f rakowski and 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev in which the two agreed it was 
impossible to have a government without the communists 
the call by gorbachev also head of the communist party was the 
first direct comment on the events in poland it was highly unusual 
for the polish party to publicize such a telephone conversation 
announcing it at a news conference 
the publicity given the call appeared meant to stress the soviet 
unions interest in having a strong communist presence in polands 
next government but also that the communists should reach an 
accommodation with the solidarityled coalition 
president bush praised gorbachevs position wednesday calling it 
a positive sign 
there will be bumps in the road as these countries move toward 
more democracy bush said but i feel the statement i saw 
attributed to mr gorbachev was very positive in this regard 
very 
there were signs wednesday that both sides in poland are nearing 
an understanding 
mazowiecki said it might be a mistake to offer the communist 
party only the key ministries of defense and interior controlling 
the army and the police that had been promised in the first stages 
of negotiating the historic transition to the east blocs first 
government led by noncommunists 
pushing the communist party into total negation would be a trap 
for the country he said 
hinting the party would eventually take back power by force 
unless a compromise was reached he said no opposition in the 
world which has the army and security services remains the 
opposition 
mazowiecki nominated for prime minister saturday by communist 
president wojciech jaruzelski is to be approved for the office when 
the sejm or lower house meets thursday 
he was proposed by a coalition assembled by lech walesa of 
solidarity and the peasants and democrats the two minor parties 
that have a majority in the chamber even without the communists 
the communists have insisted on a number of places in the 
government to correspond to their state and political potential 
mazowiecki said he could not say how many of the 19 government 
ministries would be offered the communists or to solidarity and the 
two minor parties he said he plans to present a government within a 
week 
aleksander bentkowski parliamentary leader of the peasants said 
the communists want at least one deputy premiership and three 
ministries a solidarity lawmaker artur balazs said the party 
wanted a deputy premiership four ministries and the office that 
controls state radio and television 
communist party spokesman jan bisztyga said that mazowieckis 
envoy jaroslaw kaczynski had his first talks tuesday with party 
central committee secretary leszek miller bisztyga refused to 
comment on the partys demands 
mazowiecki said there are no specific decisions but it must be a 
broad coalition 
mazowiecki told the solidarity lawmakers that he had jaruzelskis 
assurance the army and security forces would cooperate with a 
government led by the opposition movement they had long sought to 
repress 
he also took a mild stance toward the removal of party loyalists 
from state jobs he said he plans no witch hunts and his only 
criteria would be competence and loyalty to the new government

the governments 73 million settlement with 
neighbors of the fernald uranium processing plant snagged wednesday 
in a disagreement over whether the terms would prevent future 
lawsuits involving cleanup costs 
us district judge s arthur spiegel will decide whether to 
approve the settlement 
the judge described the energy departments position as 
inconsistent and said he wanted to hear from energy secretary 
james watkins at that time well find out just whats going 
on spiegel said 
spiegel suggested he could question watkins next week 
the snag surfaced after lawyers for both sides urged spiegel to 
approve the settlement which would end a classaction lawsuit filed 
on behalf of 14000 residents near the feed materials production 
center which is owned by the energy department 
the residents contended they suffered emotional distress and that 
property values were diminished by radioactive pollution from the 
plant about 18 miles northwest of cincinnati 
the two sides agreed to the settlement after a jury in a mock 
trial found in favor of the residents 
the government agreed last month to give the residents 73 
million and perhaps 5 million more to cover costs of regular 
medical testing and a medical study for residents their emotional 
distress and depressed land values 
only one resident objected to the settlement as inadequate but 
three businesses complained it would unfairly prohibit them from 
seeking money from the government to clean their property of any 
contamination from the plant that may be uncovered later 
that resulted in a disagreement between government lawyer henry 
gill jr and stanley chesley representing the residents over 
whether the settlement bars such future claims 
chesley contended the companies wouldnt be prohibited from 
trying to get the government to pay costs from future cleanup gill 
disagreed 
he said the energy department believes any such costs should be 
paid from the 73 million settlement but spiegel noted that the 
energy department has estimated it could take 5 billion to clean up 
the plant site alone 
i have a difficult time understanding your position spiegel 
said 
the judge can either approve the settlement reject it or send 
both sides back to renegotiate spiegel also could clarify the 
language of the settlement 
chesley said during a break in the hearing that he doesnt think 
the disagreement will cause the settlement to unravel

us officials took steps wednesday to 
extradite suspected drug traffickers from colombia and announced a 
2 million program to help that country protect its officials from 
intimidating drug violence 
president bush said top us and colombian officials would meet 
to discuss what kind of help the united states can offer 
violencetorn colombia but he again ruled out the use of us 
troops noting colombian president virgilio barco specifically ruled 
out that option 
they might need certain technical assistance to go after the 
drug traffickers bush said during a news conference with local 
press at his vacation home in kennebunkport maine they can use 
training for some of their forces police for example he said 
after bushs remarks attorney general dick thornburgh announced 
the justice and state departments have agreed to offer colombia a 2 
million program designed to help protect its judges and others 
threatened by narcoterrorist attacks 
under the agreement the justice departments international 
criminal investigative training assistance program will assess 
colombian needs and develop plans to improve colombias ability to 
respond to threatened violence the program would also seek to 
improve investigative and forensic functions the justice department 
said 
the ruthless victimization of judges prosecutors and police by 
drug cartels must be halted thornburgh said 
the discussions later this week between colombian attorney 
general monica de greiff and us officials will focus on 
extradition procedures said white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
extraditions from colombia to the united states were ended 
abruptly in early 1987 after the colombian supreme court under 
attack by drug traffickers threw out the treaty 
barco imposed a state of siege last weekend following the 
assassination friday of leading presidential candidate luis carlos 
galan an outspoken foe of drug traffickers 
more than 11000 people were arrested under the emergency 
measures and barco said extraditions to the united states would be 
resumed 
state department spokesman richard boucher said the us embassy 
in bogota on wednesday was making provisional arrest requests of 
the top 12 fugitives named by thornburgh on tuesday the top 12 
none of whom has been arrested include the leaders of the 
notorious medellin and cali cocaine cartels 
boucher said the us is continuing to prepare formal 
extradition packages including supporting documentation against 
those 12 and against eduardo martinez romero an alleged medellin 
moneylaunderer in colombian custody martinez was indicted in 
atlanta in march 
if martinez is extradited he could be taken swiftly out of 
colombia on a us government plane an administration source said 
has been at the bogota airport since last weekend 
the plane could be used to transport martinez to the united 
states but there was no indication it was at the airport for that 
purpose the source who spoke on condition anonymity said 
another source at the airport speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the plane belonged to the drug enforcement 
administration but dea spokesman frank shults declined comment 
the marshals service usually transports people being extradited 
and it has its own fleet of aircraft that can be used for such work 
said service spokesman bill dempsey 
we havent been brought into the picture yet on the martinez 
case he said 
meanwhile us officials said they were mystified by the 
reported arrest of another alleged drug trafficker in colombia 
identified by newspapers as rafael orlandes gamboa the bogota daily 
el espectador said a us extradition request for him is pending 
with colombian authorities but officials at the justice and state 
departments the marshals service and the dea said they had never 
heard of him 
us officials also said they were unfamiliar with helena beatriz 
rodriguez whom colombian authorities reported arresting wednesday 
in cartagena the colombians said she also was wanted on 
drugrelated charges in the united states 
the discussions with de greiff will help officials of both 
countries determine how extraditions should be handled under the 
stateofsiege rules said source with the bush administration 
if its to go well they have to let us know what they need us 
to do the papers and procedures to make it work the source said 
its not a process thats selfexecuting its complicated and has 
to be done right 
fitzwater said the discussions with de greiff would also focus on 
suggestions for security for colombian judges 
dozens of judges have been killed by drug traffickers in 
colombia and congress last year earmarked 5 million for the state 
department to develop a program to provide more security for them

daughters and granddaughters of confederate 
soldiers ended an era wednesday when they moved from the stately 
57yearold confederate home for women to a new healthcare complex 
seven women left through a back door of the home modeled after 
the white house it will be closed and eventually turned over to the 
adjacent virginia museum of fine arts 
ive got a beautiful room here i hate to give it up bertha 
moore said but i know how conditions are here they need money 
a dwindling endowment was cited by the confederate home board as 
the main reason for the move 
a relocation committee of the board announced in april it would 
cost considerably less to move the women than to pay for repairs at 
the deteriorating confederate home 
the announcement sparked a smattering of protest and a lawsuit by 
a resident of the home lila lee riddell 98 to block the move 
when her effort in richmond circuit court failed she appealed to 
the virginia supreme court 
her lawyers final effort a motion for a temporary injunction 
against the move until the supreme court hearing in september was 
rejected tuesday in us district court 
on wednesday a sole representative of the citizens committee 
for memorial preservation of the confederate home for ladies stood 
across the street from the home holding an american flag the 
committee was formed in may 
two civil war reenactors donned their confederate uniforms and 
greeted each woman as she left we came down here to honor them 
to pay tribute said bob smith 
as she was being wheeled out of the home she lived in for 13 
years mrs moore spotted a tattered discarded doll mrs moore 
88 asked for the doll and clung to it as she was hoisted in her 
wheelchair into a waiting van 
their beds and some of their belongings already had been moved to 
the new residence brandermill woods 
staff members fought back tears as they waved good bye 
holly dejarnette administrator of the confederate home and 
several other staff members will continue to work with the women at 
brandermill woods 
the seven women will move into adjoining rooms at the 
chesterfield an assistedliving center adjacent to the healthcare 
center at brandermill woods 
the home originally called the home for needy confederate women 
was established by the 1898 general assembly to provide care for 
needy female relatives of confederate soldiers upon entry to the 
home residents turned over their estates in exchange for lifelong 
care 
in its heyday the home had more than 70 residents

the government has reinforced border 
patrols to head off colombian drug runners who may be fleeing to 
bolivia to escape colombias offensive against drugs police said 
wednesday 
police helicopters were placed on alert and additional guards 
were sent to bolivias northern border with brazil police said 
gonzalo torrico the official responsible for drug interdiction

areas they have contacts 
there are dozens of cocaine processing labs in northern bolivias 
beni jungle region from there cocaine is flown to colombia then 
distributed to the united states or europe 
this impoverished nation of 7 million people produces the raw 
material for at least onethird of the cocaine that reaches us and 
european markets the us drug enforcement administration said 
the violence and corruption that exists in colombia could be 
transferred to bolivia especially because of the offensive by the 
colombian government said bolivia sen daniel cabezas head of 
the senate committee on drugs 
in june two colombian drug traffickers were captured when police 
raided the town of santa ana de yacuma home to some of bolivias 
top cocaine traffickers there have been several killings in santa 
cruz 450 miles east of la paz involving colombian drug runners 
police have said 
our problem in controlling the flow of traffickers from 
colombia is that we do not have the resources to control our air 
space cabezas said 
police said the border patrols were reinforced and police 
helicopters placed on alert 
at least 350000 bolivians make their livings growing coca 
leaves the leaves are processed into cocaine paste which is

president carlos andres perez has 
proposed that nations of the western hemisphere hold a summit to 
define strategies to combat drug trafficking 
venezuela on wednesday also increased its forces on the colombian 
border to seal off escape routes during a colombian military sweep 
against the drug cartels 
narcotics trafficking has to be fought as the most abominable 
crime of the century said perez speaking at an anniversary 
celebration of a cooperative educational institute late tuesday 
perez said narcotics dealing would have to be considered a crime 
without frontiers in order to combat it effectively 
venezuelan press accounts have warned of a possible wave of drug 
smugglers and their families sweeping into venezuela to escape the 
recent crackdown in colombia 
in bolivia authorities said patrols along that countrys border 
with brazil were also reinforced and police helicopters were placed 
on alert against colombian traffickers 
perez said venezuela had tightened patrols along its 1000 mile 
border with colombia traditionally an area plagued with smuggling 
and guerrilla activity 
warning that the scourge of violence in colombia could also take 
place in venezuela perez said we are collaborating with the 
colombian armed forces so that venezuela does not become a haven for 
those people that are causing so much damage in latin america 
the cooperation was limited to necessary custody of the border 
area and offering our solidarity perez said 
venezuela does not have a history of drug trafficking although 
it is being increasingly used as a transfer point for cocaine and 
other drugs being smuggled to europe and the united states as the 
cartels seek to diversify their routes according to police

the drifter charged with 13 night stalker 
murders shouted out that his trial is a joke and called the 
judge an obscenity as deputies hauled him to his feet and took him 
out of court wednesday 
the outburst came during a hearing from which defendant richard 
ramirez had asked through his attorney to be excluded the judge 
insisted he appear 
hey i dont want to be here dont you understand man whats 
the problem ramirez 29 shouted from his chair as superior court 
judge michael tynan tried to proceed 
i wont come back in here you understand that ramirez 
continued as two sheriffs deputies approached him each taking an 
arm and lifting him to his feet this trial is a joke he 
exclaimed then used obscenities as he was led out to a holding cell 
tynan had told ramirezs lawyers that he believes the defendant 
is a grown man and should be present for proceedings 
if he wants to act like a jerk we can deal with it at that 
time we can restrain him the judge said before ramirez came into 
court 
jurors deliberating the charges were unaware of the disruption 
the defense has filed a motion to question jurors about the 
impact on their deliberations of a colleagues slaying last week 
the panel resumed talks aug 16 with an alternate tynan scheduled a 
hearing on the motion aug 31 the defense suggested that the motion 
was tantamount to seeking a mistrial but the prosecutor said he did 
not interpret it that way 
ramirez is charged with 13 murders and 30 felonies stemming from 
a killing spree that terrorized southern california in 1985 
after ramirezs courtroom outburst tynan met with lawyers then 
summoned ramirez back to court and said he had been informed by 
defense attorneys that the defendant would cause further 
disruptions or a physical altercation if he was forced to come 
to court for the motions hearing next week 
in light of that the court finds good cause that you should be 
absent when a hearing is held on these motions tynan said he 
asked ramirez if he understood his right to be present and if he was 
willing to waive it 
yes he answered in a husky voice 
the judge said he would be held in a lockup room near the 
courtroom listening to arguments over a loudspeaker 
should the jury return with its verdicts ramirez would be 
required to be present a verdict before aug 31 would make the 
scheduled hearing moot 
outside court defense attorney ray clark said ramirez has good 
days and bad days 
he just doesnt like court said clark 
meanwhile tynan announced he was leaving town until monday on a 
vacation scheduled to celebrate his wedding anniversary he said any 
questions that might arise from jurors would be handled monday and 
anything extraordinary would be taken up by another judge he 
did not address the possibility that a verdict could be returned 
while he is away

wednesday after repeated intervention by the hungarian embassy 
and left prague for home on a charter flight of the hungarian state 
airlines malev 
it said two activists of a hungarian youth group still were held

and dutch embassies and lodged a protest complaining that their 
citizens participated in the protests

family and friends of huey p newton the 
slain cofounder of the black panther party portrayed him wednesday 
as a lonely man whod been prepared for years to meet a violent 
death 
he felt that once he decided to be a revolutionary he was in a 
position of suicide anyway newtons older brother melvin said 
at a news conference at his home 
newtons bulletriddled body was found before dawn tuesday in the 
same poor west oakland neighborhood where he began organizing blacks 
more than 20 years ago several miles from his present home 
police had no suspects and no motive in the slaying but said 
neighborhood residents were offering help just about everyone 
weve talked to has been very cooperative said lt mike sims 
about 200 mourners marched during a candlelight vigil tuesday 
night at the place where newton 47 was found chanting cheering 
and holding their fists high in the blackpower salute 
the neighborhood has been plagued by drugdealing gangs but 
authorities have said they had no reason to believe newtons slaying 
was drugrelated 
panther leader eldridge cleavers former wife kathleen cleaver 
said in an interview in new york that while newton was clearly very 
intelligent he also was a very troubled person who was not able 
to overcome his problems with drugs and alcohol 
the los angeles times said he had a history of cocaine abuse and 
had been sentenced earlier this year to 90 days for possession of 
drug paraphernalia a violation of his parole 
the san jose mercury news said that newton was in oakland 
municipal court last week to enter a treatement program resulting 
from a drunken driving charge 
newtons brother declined to comment on the reports and huey 
newtons wife fredrika denied her husband used cocaine 
a coroners report was completed tuesday but authorities refused 
to release preliminary findings results of drug and alcohol tests 
will not be available for two weeks said lt john dealy 
mrs newton said she had been prepared for years for newton to 
die violently and said she recently had a premonition he might die 
soon huey was talking about getting insurance just last week 
she said 
mrs newton said the couple was having financial problems and 
that newton had been recovering from two recent abdominal operations 
she and melvin newton said they were unaware of any other 
problems plaguing newton and refused to speculate about what he was 
doing in the neighborhood early tuesday 
with bobby seale newton founded the black panther party armed 
panther members followed police cars to monitor their activities in 
the black community 
under the slogan all power to the people the panthers also 
operated a school a health clinic and programs for ghetto 
youngsters 
the party drifted into violence and gradually disintegrated as 
members were killed and the fbi infiltrated and disrupted the 
organization 
as a spokesperson for disillusioned and often bitter youth in 
the 1960s huey newton spoke eloquently of their rage and 
impatience he succeeded in his own way in calling attention to 
the many glaring imperfections in an imperfect society we were 
often in disagreement with his views and strategies but one had to 
admire his courage and persistence said naacp executive director 
benjamin l hooks 
newton was a frustrated man who longed for the excitement of the 
1960s said former panther leader david hilliard 
he was certainly a lonely man in that we didnt have any more 
fights any more struggles said hilliard we talked a lot about 
loneliness and our desire to recreate the energy of the 60s 
melvin newton said his brothers latest desire was to produce a 
film on environmental problems which he believed were linked to the 
racism and classism hed fought as a panther leader 
mrs cleaver a recent yale law school graduate practicing 
commercial law said she saw newtons slaying and the recent suicide 
of yippie founder abbie hoffman as epitaphs to the 60s 
eldridge cleaver was deeply saddened by the death but was 
declining interviews political aide susan thompson said in berkeley 
hilliard said newtons death had prompted an outcry around the 
country and he urged blacks to organize around the issues that 
prompted newton and seale to establish the organization 
let hueys death move us to some action he said hueys 
spirit and his program can be picked up 
supporters said a memorial fund had been established in newtons 
name to cover funeral costs and to fund communitybased programs for 
poor children 
funeral services were planned for monday

soldiers and maoist guerrillas in peru have cast a 
pall of violence over the country amnesty international said 
wednesday reporting more and more disappearances torturing and 
killings of civilians 
peruvian officials in lima would not comment on the report 
in seven years 3000 prisoners have disappeared while in 
government custody and government forces have killed thousands more 
in mass executions and assassinations the londonbased human rights 
group said in a report 
most victims amnesty said are indian peasants in remote 
mountain villages who appear to be killed as punishment for 
guerrilla activity 
civic leaders journalists lawyers and others critical of the 
government have been killed received death threats or had homes and 
offices bombed the report said 
many victims were killed soon after being released from short 
detentions or after their homes were searched or military 
authorities publicly denounced them as subversives according to the 
report 
similar tactics have been used to crush labor unrest it said 
trade unionists have disappeared or been killed the report said 
and in february an elite police unit fired on striking farmers in 
ucayali amnesty said dozens of peasants were killed but the exact 
number was not known because police removed the bodies 
official statistics put the death toll at 15000 in the ongoing 
conflict and include civilians caught between government and 
guerilla violence it said these activities have spread a pall 
of violence over much of peru 
military courts are not known to have convicted any soldiers 
implicated in rights abuses and rulings have tended to exonerate the 
armed forces dismiss the charges or prolong proceedings 
indefinitely it said 
amnesty said it sent its findings to the peruvian government in 
may but has not received a reply 
the associated press called president alan garcias press office 
three times wednesday and left messages requesting comment on the 
report but no spokesman called back 
garcia took office in july 1985 and pledged not to use 
barbarity to fight barbarity one of his first acts was to fire 
the commanderinchief of the armed forces after peasants denounced 
a massacre of 69 villagers only weeks after garcia took office 
no largescale killings by army troops were denounced from late 
1985 until may 1988 when residents of cayara village charged that 
troops killed 29 villagers in reprisal for a guerrilla ambush of an 
army convoy on the villages outskirts 
the amnesty report said 11 of some 20 villagers detained in a 
jungle village in may 1989 by soldiers were found dead the next day 
and four others disappeared 
shining path rebels routinely torture mutilate and murder 
captives amnesty said citing widespread executionstyle killings 
since 1982 
in the last several years most of the peasant slaughters 
denounced within peru have been attributed by survivors to the 
maoist guerrilla group which has intensified its violent campaign 
to overthrow the government 
in the biggest massacre of recent date shining path guerrillas 
in late february killed 37 men in a remote mountain village by 
cutting their throats and shot to death a mother and her baby when 
the woman tried to flee the scene

the food and drug administration announced 
wednesday it plans to revoke permission for two generic drug 
companies to manufacture 28 products on grounds that they made false 
statements in their applications 
the fda also announced that it has begun inspections of 20 
leading drug comnpanies that manufacture generic products it said 
the inspections do not result from allegations of wrongdoing 
the inspections were described as a further effort by the fda 
to assure the public of both the safety and the efficacy of the 
generic drug supply in the united states 
the inspections will be in addition to the agencys previously 
announced nationwide sampling of all versions of the 30 
mostprescribed generic drugs on the market 
fda said the inspections are not related to its investigation of 
11 generic drug firms for possible violations of federal safety and 
production regulations 
the agency said it sent formal notices tuesday to two of these 
companies par pharmaceuticals of spring valley ny and vitarine 
inc of springfield gardens ny that it will propose withdrawal 
proceedings for several of their previously approved applications 
the announcement said the action would essentially end their 
permission to make these drugs 
the agency said the action against par involved three 
applications covering orphengesic tablets orphengesic forte tablets 
and hydrochlorothiazie and triamterene tablets it said the notice 
to vitarine involved 25 different drugs 
the action was the most sweeping taken by the fda since the 
targeted investigation began in its only previous revocation 
action on aug 3 the fda revoked permission of par and american 
therapeutics inc of bohemia ny to produce chlorzoxazon tablets 
both companies had previously decided to voluntarily recall or 
suspend production of the products the fda said it said there are 
no known safety or effectiveness problems with the products but 
there were questions as to whether they met the specifications 
approved by the agency 
the companies have a right to appeal within 30 days after the 
notices are published in the federal register 
the fda said it told the two companies that its investigations 
are continuing and it may act against other products 
regarding its investigation of the 20 additional firms the 
agency said they were chosen partly because of their large numbers 
of approved applications for generic drugs 
the agency said it would conduct plant inspections at the firms 
and chemically test their products 
meanwhile the inspector generals office at the department of 
health and human services announced that it will survey generic and 
brand name drug manufacturers to get their views on fdas drug 
approval process 
judy holtz spokeswoman for the inspector general said the 
survey would be conducted by interviewing represesentatives of 15 to 
20 manufacturers both by telephone and in person she said it was 
requested by the fda and is expected to take about four weeks 
she said the survey was basically totally unrelated to audits 
and investigations which the inspector generals office is 
conducting of the generic drug industry 
the fda has been under pressure from capitol hill principally 
from rep john dingell dmich whose energy and commerce 
investigations subcommittee has conducted its own probe of problems 
of the industry 
dingells staff shared information with the us attorneys 
office in baltimore which has obtained guilty pleas from three fda 
officials two drug firms and three drug company executives 
ms holtz said the inspector generals office had been asked by 
top fda officials to take a quick look at what manufacturers think 
about the drug approval process and provide them with feedback 
regarding manufacturers views 
when the study is completed she said fda will be provided with 
a summary of the manufacturers points of view and concerns 
probably including suggestions for improvement

the soviet ambassador to sweden on 
wednesday acknowedged his nations guilt in the case of raoul 
wallenberg the swedish diplomat missing since his 1945 arrest by 
soviet troops 
wallenberg who would be 77 is credited with saving tens of 
thousands of hungarian jews from nazi concentration camps in world 
war ii 
the secretary of the raoul wallenberg association sonja 
sonnenfeld called ambassador boris pankins statement the soviets 
most explicit public statement about the missing diplomat 
it goes farther than anything they have said before in 
accepting guilt she said in a telephone interview it is 
remarkable it must have been dictated by moscow 
pankin insisted wallenberg is dead but mrs sonnenfeld said she 
believes the diplomat still is alive 
moscow has said wallenberg died of natural causes in prison in 
1947 but soviet dissidents claim to have seen him alive as late as 
1986 
pankin did not say why the soviet union is guilty and soviet 
authorities never explained why they arrested wallenberg some 
historians believe he was mistaken for an american spy 
 
the dead cannot be brought back to life pankin said in an 
article written for the moscow news and printed in swedish in the 
expressen daily 
the only thing you can do is to again praise his 
accomplishments and express feelings of compassion and guilt to his 
people and those closest to him pankin wrote 
we are ready to do everything to reinstate and strengthen the 
growing trust between our countries to turn the case of the search 
for raoul wallenberg into a mark of honor for his memory 
he denounced wallenbergs alleged death as an excess of the 
stalin era 
such is this whole terrible story that the ghastly 
pointlessness is typical for that time he wrote 
the ambassador said it is not surprising many people refuse to 
believe wallenberg is dead since soviet authorities initially 
denied he was in custody who believes you if you have lied 
before he said 
wallenberg issued swedish travel documents to 20000 hungarian 
jews slated for nazi concentration camps his intervention with 
german authorities was credited with winning survival for another 
100000 jews from the countrys prewar community of 750000 
 
he was arrested by soviet troops who entered budapest in 1945 
earlier this year soviet authorities invited four people to 
moscow including wallenbergs halfbrother and halfsister to meet 
kgb intelligence officers and foreign ministry officials the group 
plans to go in october 
pankin said they will not be given new information but will see 
the original 1947 document reporting wallenbergs death written by 
the prison doctor to then state security minister viktor abakumov

police said they had caught a pioneer of 
colombian drug smuggling wednesday but those who run the bloody 
billiondollar cocaine trade remained at large 
the government declared its firm decision to extradite 
traffickers to the united states in the crackdown on the drug 
underworld that began after the leading presidential candidate was 
assassinated on orders of the cocaine barons 
police said they arrested bernardo londono quintero about 60 in 
a raid on his daughters apartment in the caribbean coastal city of 
baranquilla on wednesday he offered no resistence but a revolver 
was seized in the raid they said 
he is regarded as a pioneer of the colombian cocaine business 
which began expanding in the late 1960s and was the only to retain 
some of his power when the new more violent generation took over in 
the mid1970s 
police also reported the arrest on wednesday of drug suspect 
helena beatriz rodriquez in the coastal resort city of cartagena 
they said she also was wanted in the united states on drugrelated 
charges but us officials in washington said they were unfamiliar 
with her 
also reported arrested was rafael orlandes gamboa for whom 
bogota newspapers said a us extradition request is pending with 
colombian authorities officials at the us justice and state 
departments the marshals service and the drug enforcement 
administration said they had never heard of him 
eduardo martinez romero an alleged money manager for the 
medellin cartel was picked up during a weekend dragnet police and 
us authorities said they were trying to arrange speedy 
extradition but that the paperwork might take a wewek or more 
the arrests came during an antidrug campaign by police and the 
military prompted by the assassinations last week of a judge a 
national police colonel and sen luis carlos galan an outspoken foe 
of the cocaine lords who was expected to be colombias next 
president 
president virgilio barco established emergency procedures for 
extraditing traffickers wanted in the united states the supreme 
court nullified the extradition treaty with washington in june 1987 
after years of intimidation of the judicary at least 220 judges and 
other officials have been killed 
barco also authorized seizures of traffickers possessions 
police and soldiers continued raids wednesday on mansions farms 
office buildings restaurants and other property belived owned by 
the drug bosses 
carlos lemos simonds the communications minister declared 
wednesday theres a firm decision to extradite suspects but the 
us bureaucracy must act quickly he said barcos emergency 
measures empower police to hold suspected traffickers for up to 
seven days without charges but then they must be freed 
lemos also asked that washington provide more aid for the 
antinarcotics campaign and added the other help we need is to 
lower consumption and demand in the united states 
at his vacation home in kennebunkport maine president bush 
said they might need certain technical assistance they can 
use training for some of their forces police for example 
bush said barco made clear that he was not requesting united 
states troops i know enough about this hemisphere and ive had 
enough experience in dealing with countries in latin america to 
know the constraints in terms of dispatching troops 
five suspects in the galan murder were arrested tuesday 
authorities announced late wednesday that four of the suspects had 
been identified by more than a dozen witnesses who were at the 
rally but no formal charges had yet been filed 
israel said wednesday it was investigating reports that israeli 
mercenaries trained assassination teams for the colombian drug 
cartels israel television said israeli military experts involved in 
training paramilitary forces for the cocaine gangs recently were 
smuggled out of colombia

a section of the historic pontalba apartments 
said to be the first apartments built in the united states 
collapsed wednesday into jackson square in the heart of new orleans 
french quarter 
no one was hurt but the collapse caused inestimable damage to 
one of the nations most prestigious buildings the threestory 
building where the collapse occurred was completed in 1851 and with 
a companion building on the opposite side of jackson square was 
undergoing a 10 million renovation 
scaffolding on the jackson square side of the building collapsed 
about 530 pm witnesses said when the scaffolding fell it 
brought down a small section of the building 
most of the damage was to a 40 to 50foot section of scaffolding 
which stood three stories high emergency crews roped off the area 
and kept spectators away

parliament that allegedly shows athanassopoulos was involved in 
forging harbor logs and customs invoices 
the invoices were changed to show that 9000 tons of yugoslav 
maize sold to the eec in 1986 were greek cheating the european 
community of import duties and making it pay subsidies 
athanassopoulos was defeated in his bid for reelection on a 
panhellenic socialist movement ticket in june 18 balloting

conservativeleftist coalition to pledge to clean up greek political 
life by investigating scandals allegedly involving members of the 
former government

communistled coalition of the left and progress pledged to hold 
new elections no later than november 5

crete scandal and rejected charges that he took kickbacks to procure 
french and american built jet fighters for the air force 
also wednesday the government announced that security files on 
greeks involved in the communist uprising 40 years ago will be 
burned to end a lingering symbol of animosity between rightists and

irans spiritual leader wednesday called 
on parliament to set aside political differences and approve 
president hashemi rafsanjanis proposed cabinet as soon as possible 
ayatollah ali khamenei urged parliamentary deputies to vote on 
competence alone rather than differences of taste or god 
forbid personal matters 
his appeal for a speedy vote of confidence in rafsanjanis 
cabinet at a parliamentary session scheduled sunday indicates 
opposition to rafsanjanis policies and the 22 ministers he has 
chosen to carry them out 
in a speech broadcast by tehran radio which was monitored in 
nicosia khamenei stressed iran cannot afford to have rafsanjanis 
government undercut by noconfidence votes against ministers 
frankly in these times every single day is crucial if one of 
these ministries is left without someone in charge even for a day 
or a week a big part of the peoples affairs will be left undone 
khamenei said 
rafsanjani the 54yearold former parliament speaker emerged as 
irans new leader after the june 3 death of revolutionary leader 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
in a landslide election victory july 28 he won the presidency 
and unprecedented executive powers in constitutional reforms 
designed to streamline irans decision making 
rafsanjani favos ending irans isolation and attracting western 
investment to rebuild iran after its eightyear war with iraq 
he is bitterly opposed by hardliners led by outgoing interior 
minister ali akbar mohtashemi who think his policies deviate from 
khomeinis course 
rafsanjani dumped mohtashemi and other hardliners in his 
proposed cabinet in favor of technocrats though more than half of 
parliament called on him to keep mohtashemi 
in an apparent attempt to pacify his critics rafsanjani told 
iranian diplomats gathered in tehran wednesday that his policies do 
not deviate from khomeinis strategy 
he also denied there is a power struggle 
what exists in our country is the presence of different 
tastes and currents of thought and not a power struggle tehran 
radio quoted him as saying 
the official islamic republic news agency also monitored in 
cyprus quoted mohtashemi as saying wednesday any new plan and 
principle contrary to khomeinis principles is a blatant violation 
of his clear path

angolan rebels violating a ceasefire 
killed 41 people and injured 55 in the past 10 days angolas state 
news agency angop reported wednesday 
according to angop rebels killed 24 government soldiers and 
civilians in clashes around the country including attacks on the 
rebels former central angolan stronghold of huambo 
government forces killed 17 rebels and captured several caches of 
arms said the report monitored in lisbon 
the news agency also reported the death of former philippine air 
force lt col jesus baldonado who was working as a security 
officer at an angolan diamond mine when he was kidnapped aug 12 by 
fighters of the rebel national union for the total independence of 
angola 
the manila foreign ministry also wednesday confirmed baldonados 
death 
usbacked rebels led by jonas savimbi have not confirmed any of 
the clashes 
the reports came as angolan president jose eduardo dos santos 
returned from a meeting on the angolan peace process with seven 
other african leaders in harare zimbabwe 
they asked zairean president mobutu sese seko to revitalize 
angolan peace efforts that began failing immediately after dos 
santos sealed a truce with savimbi on jun 22 at an african summit 
in gbadolite zaire 
an ensuing ceasefire lasted one week and government and rebels 
repeatedly exchange accusations of truce violations 
last week the rebels killed six cubans fighting with angolan 
soldiers and accused government forces of launching a largescale 
attack in southern angola 
mobutu has mediated sporadic negotiations between the two sides 
since the ceasefire but the fighting has escalated over the past 
two weeks 
in washington the state department said national reconciliation 
in angola only can be achieved by direct negotiations between the 
guerrillas and government 
state department spokesman richard boucher said they expect 
another round of talks in kinshasa shortly and have urged both 
parties to progress on the central issue of how to achieve 
reconciliation 
the guerrillas have been fighting for a share in government since 
portuguse colonizers hastily withdraw in 1975 leaving rival groups 
to fight for power the us government gives the rebels between 15 
million and 18 million aid a year 
under international peace accords signed last year south africa 
pledged to end aid to the rebels and give independence to angolas 
southern neighbor namibia in exchange for the withdrawal of 50000 
cuban troops fighting with angolan government troops

frightened children wouldnt talk about years of 
rape sodomy and beatings allegedly inflicted by their father until 
about two weeks after they were taken from their apartment 
authorities said wednesday 
at an arraignment assistant district attorney marie corliss said 
the nine childrens treatment by herman carlie mcmillan and his 
wife frances was reminiscent of medieval torture 
she quoted mrs mcmillan as saying i have seen my husband 
perform sex acts on my oldest female child 
the government also said mrs mcmillan told investigators her 
husband had sodomized other children tied them up and beaten them 
with paddle boards 
mcmillan was held without bail and his wife held in lieu of 
10500 bail both were due back in court friday 
in a related development authorities said mcmillan 42 had 
twice escaped from north carolina prisons where he was serving time 
for a 1967 assault and two charges of breaking and entering 
after his second escape he spent eight years hiding from the law 
at least part of that time he lived in new yorks bronx borough 
where he was arrested on separate assault charges in 1974 
police and social workers on may 25 removed the mcmillans six 
boys and three girls ages 4 months to 16 years from the cramped 
threeroom apartment 
police arrested the parents monday night and charged mcmillan 
with rape sodomy assault incest reckless endangerment 
endangering the welfare of a minor and sexual abuse 
mrs mcmillan 34 was charged with assault and endangerment she 
had no prior arrest record 
it was charged that the couple held the children captive for at 
least three years in the unlit unheated apartment where they were 
sexually abused beaten or had their heads held underwater 
city regulations require that a social worker from either the 
city or a voluntary agency interview each child before he or she is 
placed in a foster home and the social workers usually ask the 
child about sexual abuse 
but a spokeswoman for the citys human resources administration 
suzanne trazoff said it usually takes some time before a child 
volunteers details of abuse 
children dont necessarily walk in the door and say i was 
sexually abused she said information has a way of coming over 
time 
after his arrest monday mcmillan told police he had secretly 
buried three other children who had died as infants over the last 
five years apparently of natural causes police wednesday resumed 
digging for the bodies

a key cabinet official of newly inaugurated prime 
minister toshiki kaifu publicly apologized thursday for an 
extramarital affair the latest scandal to hit japans 
troubleridden governing party 
that such news would be reported was due completely to my own 
indiscretion chief cabinet secretary tokuo yamashita said at a 
news conference televised live thursday yamashita is the 
governments main spokesman and the prime ministers top lieutenant 
the task of he kaifu cabinet is to promote clean government and 
as i must follow that and support the prime minister i can offer 
only my deepest apologies to the people of japan he said adding 
that he was seriously considering whether to resign or remain in 
office 
yamashitas remarks were prompted by an article in the respected 
weekly shukan shincho magazine alleging that he had an affair with a 
26yearold office worker he met at a tokyo bar where she worked 
part time in 1984 it said the affair ended in 1987 
the magazine which went on sale thursday also said the 
69yearold yamashita who is married offered the woman 21000 
just one week before he assumed office aug 9 but quoted him as 
saying it was not intended as hush money 
i did it from my own good intentions after hearing that shes 
still having problems in her life the magazine quoted yamashita 
as saying the report said the woman whom it did not name did not 
accept the money 
reports in the masscirculation mainichi shimbun newspaper and by 
the japan broadcasting corp earlier thursday said yamashita was 
planning to resign but kyodo news service said he had decided 
simply to apologize after discussing the matter with his mentor 
liberal democratic party elder toshio komoto 
the reports came just two weeks after similar allegations helped 
bring down kaifus predecessor sousuke uno and could deal a severe 
blow to kaifu who analysts believe to be little more than a 
caretaker until his term as party president and prime minister 
expires in late october 
for the time being we will apologize and try to explain to the 
people and wait for further reaction said a member of komotos 
faction within the party he requested anonymity 
after only 69 days in office uno who allegedly kept paid 
mistresses announced his resignation july 24 to accept 
responsibility for the governing liberal democrats unprecedented 
losses in a parliamentary election the day before 
in those elections for half the seats in the twochamber bodys 
upper house the governing party lost its majority for the first 
time since the party was formed in 1954 much of the vote against it 
went to the socialists japans leading opposition party 
uno had taken office june 2 after noboru takeshita stepped down 
to take responsibility for the recruit affair a widespread 
influencebuying scandal that forced three cabinet ministers to 
resign and led to over a dozen arrests 
soon after becoming prime minister however a report in the 
weekly sunday mainichi magazine charged that uno had paid a geisha 
to be his mistress and then mistreated her the woman later told her 
story on national television seriously damaging unos public image 
the recruit scandal along with a new sales tax unpopular 
agricultural policies and the sex scandals have created what 
governing party leaders acknowledge is the conservative partys most 
serious crisis ever 
analysts believe the party could also suffer major setbacks in 
elections for the more powerful lower house which chooses the 
nations prime minister though such elections need not be held 
until july 1990 political pressure from the oppositioncontrolled 
upper chamber could force them to be called sometime this year

environmentalists are criticizing a government 
plan calling for all studies on damage caused by the exxon valdez 
oil spill off the alaskan coast to be completed by february 
this plan could lead to a serious underestimation of harm to 
the environment and a limited recovery of damages from exxon 
sarah chasis a lawyer for the natural resources defense council 
said tuesday by february ms chasis said there still will be oil 
on alaska beaches causing additional damage 
the extent of damage on species such as the bald eagle and salmon 
may not be known for years she said because the young born this 
year and exposed to the oil wont return to the region for three or

is pat sajak about to meet the same fate as a 
legion of challengers who assaulted the ramparts of johnny carsons 
latenight kingdom 
the pat sajak show premiered on cbs last jan 9 and after a 
brief honeymoon with the audience fell into the ratings doldrums 
that defeated carson rivals from les crane to dick cavett to alan 
thicke to joan rivers 
sajak has not only failed to lure viewers away from carson he 
faces his own serious challenge from arsenio hall although the 
arsenio hall show is syndicated and does not compete directly 
against sajak his ratings have been running behind those for hall 
another problem is that halls show is a favorite of the young 
audience most prized by advertisers 
sajak is also behind abcs nightline and nbcs late night 
with david letterman in addition its slightly behind the 
ratings cbs had last year for a mixture of latenight shows 
reportedly cbs executives said they would kill the show if the 
ratings didnt improve by the end of the year some people are 
starting to write sajaks obituary but according to sources at cbs 
as in the case of mark twains reported death the reports may be 
greatly exaggerated 
as far as i know theres no ticking clock said sajak i 
honestly dont know what their expectations are my department is 
doing the show not worrying about the ratings 
i have no control on the ratings i do have control over seeing 
that the show is good and i think in time that will affect the 
ratings we had no illusions about going in and knocking anybody off 
and becoming an overnight sensation it doesnt work that way in 
late night we said from the beginning wed get an early splash out 
of curiosity then people would settle into their old viewing habits 
and in the long haul we would bring them back 
an important point perhaps the crucial point is that the sajak 
show is making a profit for cbs 
the fact that sajak is running behind nbc and abc and even 
behind what cbs had last year certainly generates a discussion of 
how long well hang in said david poltrack cbs senior vice 
president for planning and research on the other hand the show 
is highly marketable even with the low ratings the advertising 
rates are higher and the spots are selling well 
poltrack said an increase in the audience would make the sajak 
show a major moneymaker 
it is a show that has already improved our revenue picture 
he said and has the potential of improving our profitability 
dramatically if it can develop a larger audience that suggests 
patience and an investment of time and energy to get it right 
part of the shows profitability undoubtedly is due to the fact 
that a talk show is cheaper to produce than the actionadventure 
shows it replaced 
rod perth cbs newly appointed vice president for latenight 
programming said he has not received any ultimatums 
i would not have taken this job to get involved in a project 
that the network did not have confidence in said perth nobody 
gave me any mandate the way this business works is i think if 
people are competitive they want to make things work and work well 
thats my personal mandate 
perth said he was too new to the job to say what changes he will 
make in the sajak show to improve its ratings 
all of these shows evolve he said of course there are 
things being discussed we feel this show has the potential and 
anything thats a living breathing fivedayaweek entity has to 
evolve we have every confidence in pat sajak 
the sajak show has been undergoing some changes in an effort to 
attract more viewers 
weve been fiddling with the show from the beginning said 
sajak but were not going to imitate oprah winfrey and wander 
into the audience looking for lesbian nuns weve played around with 
various elements but i think the show is basically the same as it 
was when we went on the air i signed up for an 
entertainmentoriented talk show and thats what im doing 
perth who said as a broadcaster he would not be happy until he 
was no 1 added i would ask people to remember this show entered 
the most competitive time period in television against the most 
entrenched competition in television you have to put expectations 
at a reasonable level

hedging a bet the white house seems to be 
taking out some political insurance against the risk of a recession 
next year should there be a serious slump the republicans will 
blame the federal reserve board 
the administration long ago declared that the old theory of 
business cycles up then down no longer need apply to the us 
economy at least it hasnt applied since early in ronald reagans 
presidency the longest period of economic expansion in peacetime 
history began in 1982 and continues now 
president bush said as a candidate that he could keep it going 
with policies that restrain spending and forbid new taxes after 
all economic growth doesnt die out from old age it is smothered 
by bad policies he said last oct 24 
picking up the theme with some of the same words an 
administration economic spokesman said on july 10 that the 
recordlong expansion could be sustained with the outlook favorable 
for continuing growth ahead 
economic history teaches us that expansions have not died of 
old age but were killed by policies usually monetary policies 
which with the benefit of hindsight were unfortunate mistakes 
said undersecretary of commerce michael r darby 
translated that argument holds that its usually the federal 
reserve board that stalls or scuttles economic expansion by clamping 
too tightly on the money supply and pushing up interest rates 
thats the issue that prompted budget director richard g darman 
to chide the central bank for tightening interest rates because of 
what he said may have been excessive concern about renewed inflation 
if we do have a recession it will be because they have erred on 
the side of caution darman said aug 13 on nbcs meet the 
press i think its quite important that the fed appreciate that 
growth is indeed fundamental to the health of this economy and that 
they not become too obsessed with concern about things going too 
well for too long 
bush endorsed those comments i think ive said essentially the 
same thing in the past bush said he called darmans comments 
balanced although he dodged the question of whether he agreed that 
the fed would be responsible for any recession 
listen i dont know of any president now or in the past who 
doesnt favor lower interest rates bush said thats the 
american way 
trying to chart a course between the risks of inflation on one 
side and recession on the other the fed began increasing interest 
rates in march 1988 and pushed up shortterm rates by three 
percentage points over the next year then early in june it began 
edging rates downward to stimulate economic activity and avoid a 
severe slump 
its policymaking committee met on tuesday and decided how to 
proceed for the next six weeks those policy decisions will not be 
disclosed until oct 6 although their impact could show in the 
marketplace current guessing is that interest rates will be left at 
or near current levels into the fall 
as bush noted strains between the central bank and the white 
house are nothing new lower interest rates serve the political and 
budget agendas of most presidents alan greenspan chairman of the 
federal reserve board knows all about that he was an economic 
adviser to richard m nixon during the 1968 campaign he served as 
chairman of the council of economic advisors when gerald r ford was 
president reagan appointed greenspan chairman of the fed 
the seven governors of the federal reserve are appointed for 
14year terms the chairmanship is for five years tenure that is 
supposed to provide political insulation 
that seems to work in the past there have been times of real 
tension between the fed and expansionbent presidents and 
congresses this seasons differences have been polite by comparison 
shortly after he was inaugurated bush said greenspan seemed to 
be worrying more about inflation than he was after the fed raised 
interest rates in february the president said they differed on the 
right way to interpret economic indicators regarding possible 
inflation 
but greenspan has warned that inflation itself can trigger 
recession if inflation emerges i think a recession will move up 
on us much more quickly than we can imagine and when it occurs it 
will be a prolonged one he told congress early this year 
in congressional testimony last month he said that while the 
risk may have shifted somewhat away from inflation the rate still 
is too high the administration says the inflation rate is headed 
downward and that interest rates should therefore be eased 
some day some event will end the extraordinary string of 
economic advances that has prevailed since late 1982 greenspan 
has warned 
that always has happened before the administration isnt 
conceding that it will again at least not soon but if it does the 
blame has been assigned in advance

along with their classroom schedules many 
students heading to college in the next few weeks will be getting 
reallife introductory lessons in personal money management 
by hallowed tradition the main financial challenge most college 
students face is a chronic shortage of funds 
but the course description includes other assignments as well 
including dealing with unfamiliar financial institutions and 
safeguarding possessions away from home 
for many moving away from home to attend college marks the 
first big step toward adult independence says the credit union 
national association a trade group with more than a passing 
interest in the subject 
part of this growth process involves taking control of your own 
financial affairs 
to start with most financial advisers agree a simple 
onestepatatime approach is likely to be best 
all the offers of credit cards banking services and other 
promotional material handed out during orientation week dont have 
to be dealt with right away 
if youre a typical student you dont have a lot of money and 
you probably wont make frequent use of the few financial services 
youll need cuna advises 
look for services that provide the features you want but wont 
penalize you for infrequent use 
students also may not have to spend a lot of money insuring their 
everyday possessions such as clothing radios and bicycles against 
theft 
if a students parents have a homeowners policy the insurance 
information institute notes it probably already covers property 
that might be stolen away from home up to a specified limit 
for example the institute says a typical policy covering a 
house for 100000 would give the student 5000 coverage at school 
minus any deductible 
still this bears verifying beforehand for any families who are 
uncertain what their policies say and if a student is taking 
anything of significant value along jewelry say or a personal 
computer an insurance agent should be consulted to determine 
whether special coverage is required 
should a student open a checking account its a good idea the 
insurance institute says because cash lying around a dorm room in 
any amount is prime prey for theft 
the checkbook furthermore should be kept in a safe place so 
should the automatic teller machine card that comes with most of 
todays accounts 
collegeage consumers seem to have developed a special affinity 
for the convenience atms offer according to cuna people 18 to 24 
years old use atms more often than any other age group 
and a credit card a generation ago a student might have had a 
lot of trouble getting one today he or she is more likely to be 
inundated with application forms 
that can be a nice extra or it can mean potential trouble for 
people taking on new responsibilities in a new place without much 
experience in managing money 
having your own credit card is a good way to begin to establish 
your credit history and it is useful in emergencies cuna says 
be sure not to abuse the convenience though or you could damage 
your creditworthiness for years

with the economy shuffling along and with 
economists focused on whether well have a recession theres a 
tendency to think that good news doesnt exist 
it does many of the published economic forecasts say inflation 
is likely to remain restrained for the time being that home 
mortgage rates could resume their fall and that most jobs seem 
secure into next year 
it also seems likely that interest rates arent going to go to 
the sky it was only a few months ago that such talk sounded 
plausible and that means an opportunity for americans to 
straighten out their finances 
its a buyers market in many items compare that with the 1970s 
when prices and interest rates rose so fast that consumers almost 
trampled each other to buy before more increases came by 
comparison these days are serene 
if you want to look into the future there are seers who say even 
better times are coming in the 1990s a viewpoint that often becomes 
submerged by the tide of foreboding about budget and trade deficits 
and third world loans 
these optimists about the decade to come cite improvements in 
business that make it more efficient global competition that will 
tend to keep prices in line and the opening of big new consumer 
markets in asia for instance 
but you do not need to go that far into the future to find good 
news some is mixed with bad of course and that makes it harder to 
find but its there if you want to search theres gold in the 
gravel 
amidst a generally bleak picture for example there are signs 
that some areas of health care costs might finally be submitting to 
control and while doctors still quit rather than risk medical 
malpractice there are signs of a corrective process the 
beginnings anyway 
doctors have learned to avoid some of the incidents that lead to 
malpractice claims to document their motives and methodology to 
communicate better with patients even to adjust their bills 
at the same time tort reform is reducing the number of cases 
brought to court states are putting caps on claims juries are 
becoming more aware of the societal costs of litigation and are 
cutting back on extravagant awards 
you might also have thought that foreigners mainly japanese 
were buying up america thats a recurring badnews theme a hot 
one a theme that lends itself to such phrases as the selling of 
america and economic invasion 
but america hasnt been sold smart foreign investors did in 
effect let americans use their money in return for some assets but 
a report from the national realty council made up of real estate 
owners and operators shows they own only about 1 percent of 
americas 12 trillion worth of real estate and the japanese 
werent the big investors the british were 
so whats all the fuss about two things the japanese did invest 
a lot of money in america during the 1980s and they forced canada 
into third place secondly foreign investments were concentrated 
mainly in downtown areas 
in 1987 for instance the real estate firm of coldwell banker 
estimated that foreigners owned 46 percent of office space in 
downtown los angeles 39 percent in houston and 32 percent in 
minneapolis those are headline figures 
but foreigners owned relatively little in baltimore cincinnati 
san diego and other large cities and they owned very little of 
americas geographical area its a big country but the myth of 
foreign ownership was even bigger

gerald smith has never seen a piano 
though he has made his living seated at one for 41 years running 
his fingers over the strings as well as the keys 
blind since birth smith began tuning pianos in 1948 he learned 
his trade at the tennessee school for the blind in nashville 
i found out i was going to have to make a living some way or 
another smith said they taught you how to make brooms and they 
taught you chair caning i didnt think i could do either one of 
them too good 
while playing the alto horn in the school band smith found piano 
tuning more to his liking 
in the band you have to tune up and i found out i could do 
that pretty good said the native of jamestown ala i had a 
pretty good ear 
smiths good ear and sensitive fingers have tuned keyboards for 
the likes of floyd cramer ronnie milsap johnny cash and the 
nashville symphony as well as thousands of customers for the two 
dealers hes worked for 
the 62yearold tuner is now semiretired spending three days a 
week sharpening the sounds from uprights and grands it takes him 
about an hour to tune a piano 
he makes his way easily among the instruments in a showroom 
identifying the make and model with a touch of his hand 
when you tune a piano its just like being acquainted with 
someone the more youre around them the better you know them its 
just like an old friend he said 
four decades in the tuning business has taught smith that each 
piano has a story behind it as well he can tell a lot about the 
people who play them even without meeting them 
if you see dust on the keys up on this end and down on the 
lower end you know they havent touched those keys in years which 
indicates they play little simple songs he said 
if i sit down at a piano run my fingers over the keys i can 
tell whether its been tuned very often i can tell if it needs 
rebuilding or overhauling by the way the mechanical part feels 
smith said his blindness has never caused disharmony with a 
customer 
ive never had anybody tell me well youre blind i dont 
think you can see to do the job good 
but youd be surprised how stupid people are he said 
laughing they know im blind when i go in the door i sit down 
and start tuning the piano and they ask me if i need the light 
turned on 
he says he just tells them no and goes on working touching 
listening running his hands along the 88 familiar keys 
its just like an old friend

for 19yearold krzysztof tulatycki 
selling stamps in a municipal post office is just another job 
like anywhere else 
but this particular post office a few blocks from the center of 
old gdansk is one of the two spots where the greatest conflagration 
in history began 
before dawn on sept 1 1939 german armored cars artillery and 
police and ss detachments armed with flamethrowers surrounded the 
main polish post office in the free city of danzig and opened fire 
on the 50 postal workers inside 
at the same time the german battleship schleswigholstein on a 
courtesy visit to danzig trained its heavy guns on a 182man 
polish army garrison stationed on the westerplatte peninsula in the 
citys port area and started firing 
soon german dive bombers were over central poland and tanks had 
punched across the border at dozens of spots heralding the start of 
world war ii 
in late august 1939 danzig was already filled with nazi troops 
swastikas flew from buildings and young polish men avoided the 
streets for fear of being arrested recalled brunon zwarra a 
70yearold businessman who has written two books on the period 
although nominally independent under the postworld war i treaty 
of versailles danzig known today by its polish name gdansk had 
been tied politically to the german reich since adolf hitlers 
national socialists won control of the city government in 1933 
elections 
the mainly germanspeaking baltic port city located at the mouth 
of the vistula river that flows through poland had been loyal to 
polish or prussian kings at different turns in its history usually 
enjoying a degree of autonomy 
under the versailles agreement danzig and the territory around 
it was to be an independent buffer between polands newly created 
corridor to the baltic sea and germanruled east prussia poland was 
given jurisdiction over the citys customs administration control 
of its railroads and limited rights to operate a postal service in 
the free city 
by 1939 harassment of the polish officials by danzig authorities 
had turned the guarantees into a mockery 
nazi armaments were shipped to the city and ethnic poles who 
constituted less than 10 percent of the population started to flee 
a germanpolish nonaggression pact was abrogated by hitler in 
april 1939 the death knell of the uneasy peace sounded when nazi 
germany and the soviet union signed a nonaggression treaty aug 23 
zwarra then 20 a polish danziger working for a german company 
and having many german friends saw the handwriting on the wall 
poles of military age were being arrested on various pretexts so he 
asked a girlfriend to buy him a train ticket and bring it to him 
later on the platform plainclothes policemen stopped them only 
when she lied that they were on their way to get married was he let 
go 
in this tense nervous atmosphere a small contingent of polish 
postal workers prepared to take their stand 
the attack came at 445 am the postal workers had secretly 
armed themselves with rifles and a reserve officer with military 
training had been assigned to lead the defense the postmen had been 
told to hold out for six hours when a polish army rescue was 
supposed to come they fought for 14 hours but the rescuers never 
came 
five postmen were killed in the battle two more were slain while 
surrendering and about 30 others were executed in a nazi prison in 
october as partisans 
they were simple postmen defending this plot of polish soil in 
such a heroic way said andrzej januszajtis a gdansk physicist 
and amateur historian for them it was just a piece of poland 
it was an act of great patriotism but why asks andrzej 
stanislawski a retired journalist we poles are experts in this 
the more hopeless the situation he answers his voice 
trailing off 
stanislawski who escaped from the majdanek death camp in 1944 
lectures on the destruction and reconstruction of gdansk 
on westerplatte the polish garrison was outnumbered 20to1 but 
held out seven days before surrendering 
it has become a patriotic shrine visiting heads of state are 
ritually escorted by polands leaders to lay wreathes at the base of 
the 75foottall granite obelisk memorializing the defenders 
the monument is the focus of anniversary observances but the 
post office has been less remembered 
the bombarded and burned building was reconstructed after the 
war one half of the lobby is a museum and the other half remains a 
post office serving the neighborhood a plaque outside recalls the 
postal workers inside on display is a prewar polish mail box 
pocked by bullets 
there is a steady stream of curious visitors including german 
tourists tulatycki said 
he said the wars 50th anniversary does not signify much to him 
but it will be meaningful for his family especially since his 
grandfather was put to death by the germans for being a communist 
i have a somewhat different view said the young man who came 
of age in the era of solidarity the movement born in the lenin 
shipyard seven blocks away 
but asked if he would have followed the example of the postmen 
who sacrificed themselves tulatycki did not hesitate i would 
have done the same 
troubled relations between poland and germany still touch gdansk 
a longdiscussed conciliatory visit to the rebuilt now quite polish 
city by west german president richard von weizsaecker for sept 1 
observances was quietly scrapped amid lingering tensions over aid to 
poland and other issues 
polands denial that it has a large german minority angers bonn 
while poles were irked recently when a leading west german 
politician spoke of restoring germanys 1937 borders a move that 
would erase a third of presentday poland 
but in a small token of friendship januszajtis said poles and 
germans are cooperating to restore a 37bell carillon to a historic 
gdansk church 
it is a great symbol that is very appealing to me i would 
like to close the stage of hatred said the professor whose 
father died at the auschwitz death camp 
for stanislawsji we are a passingaway generation the young 
generation is not so involved in the past we should look toward the 
future

a popular singer was crooning on the radio when the broadcast was 
interrupted for the official announcement of the state of war by 
premier edouard daladier

staring at each other 
in the following days men arrived at the barracks we started 
getting our arms revolvers carbines light machine guns grenades 
one or two mortars ammunition 
requisitioned cars vans and trucks arrived driven by their 
owners or chauffeurs to their surprise they were told they too 
were being mobilized they frantically phoned relatives who were 
expecting them back

was packed with frenchmen from the area who were being mobilized

shoppers at giant food the countrys 12th 
largest supermarket chain are accustomed to getting a lecture with 
the lettuce 
lower the fat cries a sign over the meat counter choose 
chicken remove the skin eat more white meat than dark 
on shelf labels arrows point out foods that are high in fiber or 
low in fat and cholesterol eat for health suggests a giant 
guidebook sold at the checkout next to soap opera digest the 
booklet gives hints for picking foods that may combat cancer 
the signs and the pamphlets are the work of giants vice 
president for consumer affairs odonna mathews 
as the customers ombudsman advocate and confidant she is as 
much a presence as the tv weather forecasters in the area served by 
the chain the district of columbia and parts of maryland and 
virginia 
everyone in the washington area can tell you who odonna is 
marvels lou garcia of the society of consumer affairs professionals 
which represents 1000 firms from amoco to zenith that have 
consumer advisers not many of them have her kind of recognition 
the only woman among 22 giant vice presidents mrs mathews 
boasts she is free to openly disagree with company policies when 
they are not in the consumers best interest 
some people think im a pain in the neck she says if i 
am im doing my job 
what giant pioneered other stores are practicing in northern 
california and nevada the 54store raleys chain is a food safety 
leader the company requires fruit and vegetable growers to promise 
they will shun pesticides then subjects shipments to laboratory 
tests to make sure the growers keep their word 
mrs mathews sees her job as making sure giant offers customers 
healthful choices and then nudging customers toward the right ones 
after word came out about good fats and bad fats she persuaded 
giants bakers to forswear highly saturated palm and coconut oils in 
baked goods except for whipped toppings and shes working on that 
prodded by her own consumer boards on which customers volunteer 
to serve meeting four times a year she got giant to create a 
checkout lane in each store without candy to tempt kiddies the 
chocolate industry protested in vain she says 
giant customers are offered a choice between paper and plastic 
bags those who contend plastic bags are environmentally unsound get 
back a twopage reply on the dynamics of biodegradeabilty and 
landfill chemistry it boils down to it is not so simple but 
were studying the problem 
when giant started selling live lobsters two letters came from 
customers squeamish about commiting deathbyboiling in their own 
kitchens 
so mrs mathews consulted with the animal rights people the 
national aquarium and the fish industry and wrote into a guidebook 
two alternative ways of cooking the crustacean go for the quick 
kill by severing the spinal cord or start out with cool water the 
consensus being that the lobster feels less pain than when it is 
plunged into boiling water 
mrs mathews is a presence in giants newspaper ads and radio and 
television commercials offering and reinforcing commonsense advice 
suggesting halloween safety tips and ways to deal with high blood 
pressure or proposing fruitfilled shredded wheat as an alternative 
to fatty sugary lowfiber snacks 
make your snacks count she advises 
in an interview in giants nothingfancy corporate headquarters 
in an industrial warehouse neighborhood here mrs mathews spells 
out her philosophy 
people are going to eat their hot dogs and their chocolate 
chips but choices should be there consumers have the right to 
choose and they have the right to be informed 
twenty thousand times a year giant customers write or call her 
to ask for a recipe or to complain about a checkout clerk who packed 
the eggs in the bottom of the bag 
mrs mathews shops at giant of course but is not above 
occasionally sneaking into a competitors store ive never had 
anyone recognize me yet she says 
she started as an intern to the companys first consumer adviser 
esther peterson who held the post between stints as white house 
consumer adviser to presidents kennedy and carter 
guy ford who analyzes supermarket stocks for the investment 
corp of norfolk va says 
giant was ahead of the curve the industry is just coming 
around to what giants been doing for years 
the food marketing institute says a third of 164 retailers who 
took part in a 1987 survey reported they have established consumer 
affairs departments forty percent of the consumer advisers report 
to top management 
joan claybrook president of public citizen a consumer group 
welcomes the trend 
it is critical that the consumer adviser be allowed to 
participate in the top councils of the company as does odonna and 
that they not be sanctioned for expressing unpopular opinions she 
says but even then she says society will always need the 
viewpoints of outside consumer critics such as herself 
analyst kimberly walin of the securities concern of prudential 
bache says what mrs mathews does is also good business 
the costs are not that high and the goodwill between giant and 
the community is great 
mrs mathews agrees everyone sells chicken she says but 
not everyone sells a visit to the supermarket that can be pleasant 
she must be right with 147 stores giant enjoys net profit 
margins of more than 3 percent of sales well above the industry 
average of 071 percent giants sales nearing 3 billion a year 
have doubled in eight years 
for all that mrs mathews pushes advice that might make many a 
profitminded grocer blanch 
three ounces of meat in a serving she says is really enough 
slice the meat thinly and fan it out on the plate 
or in a pamphlet for older shoppers buy basic foods rather 
than convenience products quick rice costs more than regular 
rice buy plain frozen foods rather than fancy mixed dishes or 
butter sauced vegetables 
mrs mathews has one last trick she sends a newsletter on 
health nutrition diet and exercise to all giant store managers and 
executives get them thinking healthfully she reasons and theyll 
push those thoughts at their customers

forty years after the netherlands lost 
the pearl of its east asian empire thousands of its former colonial 
subjects still live in exile here awaiting repatriation to their 
own nation that never came to be 
camp lunetten in vught is the last of 74 resettlement camps 
established to house moluccan troops who fought for the dutch in 
their losing war with rebels in the 1940s in what then was the dutch 
east indies and now is indonesia 
lunetten a former nazi concentration camp is the netherlands 
most visible symbol of moluccan nationalist aspirations despite the 
fact that their homeland a sprinkling of islands west of new 
guinea was long ago swallowed up by indonesia 
the 220 moluccans still living in the ramshackle brick buildings 
maintain it is their symbol of defiance against the dutch whom they 
say reneged on a pledge to secure them an independent moluccan 
nation 
as long as we dont have our own nation were just living from 
one day to the next well always be moluccans said 30yearold 
ety huliselan who was born raised and still lives in camp lunetten 
weve always been homesick here its not our country but a 
strange country said her 61yearold father johannes a former 
private in the royal netherlands east indies army 
despite assimilation and the passage of four decades most 
moluccans still hold to the vision of an independent homeland 
according to current and former dutch government officials 
the dutch government says it promised only to do its best to 
secure a moluccan homeland and that political realities have since 
ruled out such an effort 
moluccan resentment exploded into terrorism in the 1970s when 
moluccan nationalists seized a school two trains and the indonesian 
consulate in amsterdam the attacks left 11 people dead 
when the indonesian separatists defeated the dutch in 1949 the 
moluccans proclaimed their own republic of the south moluccas 
to save them from possible indonesian reprisals however the 
dutch evacuated about 4000 moluccan troops and 8500 dependents to 
the netherlands in 1951 
in all about 45000 moluccans now live in the netherlands many 
still torn between their families authoritarian traditions and the 
more liberal dutch culture 
moluccan drug abuse and dutchlanguage illiteracy rates far 
exceed the national average and their unemployment rate of up to 60 
percent is four times higher 
successive dutch governments have tried to integrate the 
moluccans into dutch culture but have also given them more 
preferential treatment than any other ethnic minority in this nation 
of 146 million 
these people have been pampered by the state for years said 
maurice van hurck the welfare ministry official responsible for 
lunetten theyre looking for an enemy on which to vent all their 
aggression and the enemy is the welfare ministry 
until 1956 all moluccans lived in camps where they were issued 
free food and clothing since then the government has built them 
2800 rental units and about 50 churches in a program that has no 
parallel even in the generous dutch welfare state 
a 69million vught housing project designed along the 
organizational lines of moluccan village stands virtually empty 
because lunettens residents refuse to move 
the residents maintain their camp has great symbolic value in 
their fight and maintain that leaving it would imply giving in on 
their position that theyre victims of government neglect 
van hurck said rents in the camp start at the dutch guilders 
equivalent of only 8 a month and gas electricity and water are 
free rents in the new housing complex start at 90 a month which 
is still very low by dutch standards gas and electrical services 
for a dutch household run 90180 a month depending on the size of 
the home 
the moluccan nationalist movement which has a 
presidentinexile 79yearold johannes manusama provided the 
moluccans with a new foothold to hang on to their pride said 
annelies kouwenhoven a specialist on moluccan culture 
its the teaching of a lifetime to moluccans that the entire 
moluccan culture be transferred from father to son from mother to 
daughter said mrs kouwenhoven former secretary of the 
dutchindonesian joint committee on moluccan affairs 
some lunetten resident claim they were never officially 
demobilized from the dutch army and are owed 38 years back pay by 
the dutch government 
the government has paid for moluccan youths to travel to the 
moluccan islands so they could choose between life under indonesia 
and life in the netherlands 
only a few have opted for the moluccas according to mrs 
kouwenhoven 
lena dejong 32 a secondgeneration moluccan woman married to a 
dutchman said young moluccans continue to profess a belief in 
moluccan nationalism only out of respect for their elders 
were used to so many things here she said

two years ago sergei grigoryants was in a soviet 
labor camp ostracized and imprisoned by his government for what it 
called slander 
today he is among a new breed of globetrotting soviet activists 
flocking to the west to pitch their causes attend seminars meet 
government leaders and finally shake hands with people whose 
stubborn support kept many of them going 
unlike soviet tourists and emigrants these activists also are 
forging new contacts with people who will support them when they 
return home along the way they are amassing an arsenal of donated 
computers printers and fax machines to open new electronic windows 
on the onceclosed soviet society 
the number of activists visiting the west has soared since 1986 
the year after president mikhail gorbachev launched his reforms 
they range from veteran moscow dissidents who spent years in jail 
for their beliefs to proindependence baltic activists spurred by 
gorbachevs programs 
nearly every top leader of the three independent popular 
front groups in the baltic republics has visited europe the 
united states or canada in the last year leading moscow activists 
such as lev timofeyev and sergei kovalyov have crossed both 
continents and nobel peace prize winner andrei sakharov has 
returned to the west twice since his first visit last year 
but soviet authorities still tightly control travel visas for 
personal and business trips leaving wide speculation about the 
kremlins motives for allowing activists to ply their trade freely 
abroad 
id shy away from conspiracy theories but it obviously builds 
up gorbachevs reputation he obviously believes enough in his 
reforms to allow this said ginte damusis of the lithuanian 
information center in new york 
gorbachev wants to appear as a peaceful lawabiding 
figure said ludmilla thorne soviet affairs director at the new 
yorkbased human rights organization freedom house they dont 
want bad publicity 
jeri laber executive director of helsinki watch in new york 
suggested the kremlin simply is less concerned about activists 
influence somebody there has realized its not so bad when these 
people speak out 
a soviet embassy spokesman in washington said only that kremlim 
policy on visas for travel to the west doesnt discriminate between 
activists and all other soviet travelers whose total number could 
reach 2 million this year 
vytautas landsbergis president of the lithuanian independence 
movement sajudis said he didnt know why authorities let him visit 
the united states and europe but that he had more important things 
on his mind 
there is an opportunity to maintain contacts to establish new 
contacts the 56yearold musicologist said through an interpreter 
last month in new york i hope that sajudis will be known not just 
by name only but as a very real movement and representative of its 
people its nation 
landsbergis who became an activist only in the last two years 
said his trip reaffirmed sajudis rejection of soviet authority 
imposed on the baltics under a 1939 pact signed by josef stalin and 
adolf hitler 
were raising questions about the authority of our 
representatives abroad can we expect emigres or other governments 
to represent us 
he met with state department officials congressmen a former 
white house policymaker and lane kirkland president of the aflcio 
which has appointed a representative to deal with lithuanias 
fledgling independent labor union 
just a few weeks before the 48yearold grigoryants met with 
vice president dan quayle and other officials and activists and 
signed an agreement with freedom house to fax daily installments of 
his journal to america 
grigoryants the georgian publisher of the journal glasnost was 
freed in 1987 after four years in a labor camp for publishing an 
underground journal he formally came to america to accept the 
golden pen of freedom award from the international association of 
independent journalists 
a state department spokeswoman would not comment on any of the 
meetings saying only that us policy is to meet with all soviet 
activists 
one of their intentions for contacts with the west is to be so 
well known that if a crackdown came theyd be well known enough to 
protect themselves said martin zvaners of the american latvian 
association in washington the fact that these people are coming 
to the west showing their faces gives westerners a stake 
personally in their fate 
the activists also are seeing us working and they get an idea 
about how they could work they see participation in a real 
parliamentary democracy said robert van voren director of the 
bukovsky foundation in amsterdam 
but ideas and contacts arent the only things activists take home 
grigoryants handed thorne a list of supplies from staples to 
computers for his moscow office which was stripped by kgb agents 
and internal security forces last year thorne said she wasnt sure 
if all his requests were filled but that his wife tamara earlier 
in the year had carried a personal computer back to moscow after 
visiting the west 
landsbergis picked up a desktop publishing system with which 
sajudis hopes to put out a daily newspaper from vilnius the 
lithuanian capital 
baltic armenian and georgian activists regularly use fax 
machines they got from the west to send dispatches to western 
activists the recipients said 
one fax can perform miracles said eduard gudava executive 
director of the new yorkbased center for democracy in the ussr 
they can stop all this travel but they cannot cut all the 
telephone lines 
the center receives daily dispatches from the human rights 
journal expresskhronika and translates them for western media such 
independent reporting will make moscow think twice before sending 
troops against protesters gudava said 
its impossible now to keep information inside the soviet union 
about such things he said 
still nothing can replace facetoface contact said van voren 
they would be doing their jobs even without these trips but its 
easier to discuss things in person you know they still have bugs 
in their offices

mick jagger and keith richards were 
taking a break while putting the finishing touches on their new 
album a few weekes ago and they once again heard a tv announcer 
refer to the rolling stones as the greatest rock n roll band in 
the world 
theyve been blessed or cursed with the label for about 20 
years the pair tested each others memory to find who first pinned 
the phrase on the band finally settling on a former tour manager 
who doubled as a public address announcer during the 1960s 
its a title you wouldnt claim it but if its bestowed upon 
you youd say thank you very much richards said i would 
never call us that 
some nights we are some nights we aint 
nearly 3 million people hope theyll catch the right nights as 
the stones embark on their first us tour since 1981 and release 
their 34th album steel wheels a surprisingly strong effort if 
only because of the considerable doubt the band would ever record 
again 
the beatles the rolling stones and the who were a golden troika 
of british rock supergroups in the 60s but only jagger richards 
and crew have survived until today as a creative force 
the rock n roll hall of fame members boast a catalog that began 
with such radio hits as i cant get no satisfaction and 
lets spend the night together matured with seminal rockers 
jumpin jack flash and brown sugar and boogeyed through the 
70s and 80s with its only rock n roll miss you and 
start me up 
but until a fateful summit in barbados last february it appeared 
the story of the rolling stones was drawing to a close 
jagger and richards the unquestioned leaders of this fivemember 
band had been conducting a public feud the likes of which havent 
been seen in rock since john lennon and paul mccartney sniped at 
each other on record in the early 70s 
it centered on the restless jaggers desire to record and tour 
separately from the band the fiercely proud richards who guards 
the rolling stones reputation like a museum curator thought 
jaggers priorities werent straight 
there were a couple of dodgy months during the last seven years 
when i thought it didnt look too bright on the horizon admitted 
guitarist ron wood during a series of recent interviews with the 
associated press at a long island hotel close to where final 
rehearsals were taking place for the tour 
jagger and richards after months of talking to each other 
through the press had a facetoface meeting in barbados and 
eventually set to work writing 20 to 30 songs together 
richards laughs nervously at descriptions of his relationship 
with jagger as an uneasy truce its far more simple and far more 
complex he said in a weary rasp ground down by cigarettes 
it seems theyve simply agreed to disagree 
jagger his thin wiry body coiled like a rubber band on a hotel 
suite chair peppers his conversations with references to the stones 
as ancient he bluntly replies no when asked if the stones 
still satisfy him creatively 
i dont really know he was just annoyed jagger said in 
clipped tones when asked about his partner you should ask him 
hes a very moodswingy person im fine with touring with the 
rolling stones part of the time i dont want it to be my whole 
life i think he learned over the period of time that it didnt have 
to be his whole life as well 
jagger whose solo albums were unexpected flops learned some 
lessons as well its clear he said that some people cant accept 
him as an artist outside the rolling stones 
if keith had sold like michael jackson figures he would have 
still been back in the stones he would have dropped everything to 
come back wood said mentioning richards solo record 
what surprised me was that mick didnt do those figures wood 
said that probably surprised him too and maybe it did make him 
realize the strength of the band not that he didnt realize the 
strength of the band but once he and keith spent some time 
together in barbados they just realized the friendship was longer 
and stronger than any paper or any magazine 
jagger wood said has come back into the band very genuinely 
and weve made no compromises 
although jagger and richards cowrite most stones songs theyve 
actually done little writing together during the 70s and 80s band 
members said steel wheels was different 
the way we wrote these songs is very similar to the way we used 
to work in the 60s before we had to split up in the early 70s and 
leave england and start to live apart from each other richards 
said 
drummer charlie watts was called in after a few weeks to add 
rhythm to the basic tracks recorded by jagger and richards and bass 
player bill wyman and wood soon followed the rolling stones used 
to interminable months of piecing songs together in the studio 
tried another novel concept before recording this time they 
rehearsed 
it was such a bonus to do that to know the arrangements 
wyman said then you can hone it down and really tighten up 
before it was go into the studio keiths got some vague riff mick 
mumbles some words and it becomes a song after five days 
jagger said he wanted to replace a slovenly style of 
recording with one more organized night owls richards and wood 
curbed their tendencies to work into the early morning and for all 
of the worries about solo projects the extra work left the stones 
in fighting trim richards said 
unlike the previous dirty work an album band members 
privately criticize steel wheels shows more versatility than 
the stones have displayed in years theres the required hard 
rockers but also a countrytinged ballad with fiddles a tune 
featuring moroccan drummers and a grungy blues workout 
the rolling stones were drifting into this rather boring rerun 
of riffs past jagger said im not saying everything on this 
album is brilliantly original but it does have some sparks of 
ingenuity 
new songs sad sad sad and the single mixed emotions are 
among the 60 songs the band is rehearsing for its concert trek 
other new songs will be worked in as the tour winds its way across 
the country band members said it starts aug 31 in philadelphia 
jagger whos arrived onstage in past tours riding a giant 
phallic symbol and tossed flower petals from a cherry picker 
hesitated to talk about what audiences can expect this time but 
wood and richards spoke freely

audiences can expect to hear some perennials like start me 
up tumbling dice sympathy for the devil honky tonk 
women and gimme shelter the stones have also dug deep into 
the past for such gems as ruby tuesday paint it black 
sweet virginia and the 1967 psychedelic oddity 2000 light 
years from home songs will be rotated in and out of the show so 
it wont be the same every night 
wood described the concert as really showy the stage is so 
high we have to have faa warning lights on top he said 
im really proud of them all this year richards said ever 
since we got together in february its been going like a dream the 
songs came up real easy and the boys in the rest of the band came in 
and started playing like demons 
he said the stones took out old records to try to recall the 
original ideas behind the songs rather than just remember the last 
time they were performed live 
weve done a lot of work especially on the old songs he 
said theres a lot more work gone into this tour and the record 
than the stones usually put into it and very concentrated too 
because its all taken place since february when mick and i sat down 
and said have you got any songs 
perhaps as a nod to jagger richards doesnt want to talk about 
the future of the rolling stones beyond the current tour but he and 
wood make it clear theyre not looking to retire this 27yearold 
band anytime soon 
wed be chicken not to follow this thing down the road now 
because nobodys taken it quite this far richards said weve 
been around a long while and were still functioning its not like 
the beach boys getting up there and doing all songs that theyve 
written 20odd years ago just a nostalgia trip theres old stuff 
and theres new stuff and hopefully it compares pretty well 
will the rolling stones still be functioning in 20 more years 
yeah i reckon wood said

heres news for the woodstock generation 
who think rock music today just isnt what it used to be keith 
richards thinks youre right 
the music thing is going through a lot of trauma said the 
rolling stones guitarist in a recent interview with the associated 
press during a break from rehearsals for their upcoming us tour 
which begins aug 31 in philadelphia 
he agreed with respondents to a recent media generalassociated 
press poll who said by almost a 2to1 margin that the music of the 
late 1960s topped the music of today in quality 
the technology is becoming overwhelming he said 
throughout the 80s the record companies are saying why bother 
with things like musicians when you can just push a button here 
its toytown he continued everything goes around in 
cycles and i think in the 80s theres been a lot of confusion over 
what to do with all of these possibilities and how to sort it out 
and bring it back under control to make it music again 
not surprisingly mick jagger disagrees 
i dont think its better said the stones rubberlimbed 
lead singer its just different i think its a banal question to 
ask anybody 
its so subjective to an age group said jagger whos spent 
much of the 80s battling with richards his songwriting partner 
if you are 19 now whatever bon jovi record is still going to hold 
that memory for you 20 years down the line its got nothing to do 
with whether the band is any good or the song is any good its your 
subjective experience with rock n roll that counts and i think 
thats got a lot to do with the continuing popularity of these 
ancient 60s bands 
those stories about competitiveness between the beatles and 
rolling stones during the 1960s were true jagger said 
its very hard to come to terms with the fact that someones 
been around for so long he said you dont have very many 
contemporaries still with you 
theres no pressure because there isnt anybody else giving us 
any jagger said the who since the death of keith moon were 
no longer the who it is a drag in a way and not just in a 
competitive sense 
jagger and richards cant pinpoint why this band of 
fortysomething rockers are smashing attendance records across the 
country this year four shows at new yorks shea stadium sold out in 
hours ticketsale speed records were set in los angeles 
philadelphia boston toronto cincinnati and elsewhere 
its a lot of reasons richards said not the least of which is 
it is a good band 
theres people who have grown up with us been with us all the 
way he said maybe its because they dont know a world without 
the rolling stones theres the sun the moon the trees and the 
rolling stones 
two of todays hottest bands living colour and guns n roses 
will open various shows along the rolling stones nationwide tour 
this fall 
theyre selected he said because theres a feeling that 
theyve been elected by the public and not by the music business 
richards flashes his intense pride in his own band when asked if 
the stones feel competition from those hot young sellers 
you cant compete with this richards whispered his face 
contorting in a wicked laugh

vehicle had few fitandfinish problems at delivery and they ranked 
reliability high 
the 1990 model is toyotas first fourdoor version of the 
4runner which has been sold in this country as a twodoor since 
late 1983 but more than just two doors have been added 
the new 4runner marks the second generation of the 4runner and 
features a more rounded exterior an upscale interior and 
shiftonthefly fourwheeldrive that can be engaged in speeds of 
up to 50 mph it appears to be a new generation of promise 
the test vehicle was capable where it counted on all kinds of 
roads over many kinds of bumps and holes and at different speeds 
a new suspension including a fourlink coil spring system in the 
rear gave a stable feel to the handling though toyota warned in 
its owners manual that the 4runner like all sport utility 
vehicles maneuvers differently than a regular car and must be 
driven carefully 
the 4runner had good ground clearance 10 inches to get over 
rocks and stumps when offroading it came in handy too when 
someone left a truck tire in the middle of a highway lane during the 
test drive 
of course the 4runners high profile the door handles were 
above my waist also made for some interesting maneuvering of my 
own as i scampered inside thankfully getting out was easier just 
sliding sliding sliding down 
superb described the fit and finish inside and out and toyota 
wants to make sure the vehicle stays in top form the automaker uses 
greater amounts of galvanized steel on the new model a coated 
frame chip resistant paint specially shaped rocker panels and 
special wax coat on hinges to protect against the elements 
inside the optional cloth sport seats in front the decent 
legroom in back and generally pleasant surroundings made the outside 
elements seem distant 
even the inside roof was clothcovered in the test 4runner 
the rear cargo area behind the split rear seat was nicely 
carpeted with attention given to carpeting the rounded tops of the 
wheel wells back there it was a spacious cargo area even with the 
rear seats not folded down 
the rear window of the 4runner slides down electrically with the 
turn of the key in the rear door or from the inside with the touch 
of a button on the center console next to the driver theres also a 
button on the console to lock the window so it cant be 
accidentally opened 
the rear door folds down outward is carpeted and makes a nice 
shelf for tailgating at football games 
but the 4runner test vehicle wasnt cheap base price for the 
1990 4runner 4door 4wd sr5 v6 the official name of the tester 
was more than 19000 including automatic transmission with 
options and delivery charge it totaled more than 22000 and 
thats without power windows power locks and cassette player 
in contrast ford said its large twodoor bronco 
fourwheeldrive sport utility vehicle with sixcylinder engine 
threespeed automatic transmission air conditioning and many other 
options on the 4runner would total about 18000 
you can find a lowerpriced 4runner with a manual transmission 
and a fourcylinder engine with a base price of more than 15400 
toyota expects the new 4runner to attract a different crowd than 
the previous one prior buyers were predominantly male with median 
age of 32 sixtynine percent were married 44 percent were college 
graduates and the average income was 44000 
company spokesman mike michaels said toyota expects the number of 
women buyers to increase with the new model because it will be a 
more attractive package for adventurous families michaels also said 
toyota expects to attract an older higherincome crowd 
sales of 4runners last year totaled 28000 and had been tapering 
downward for a couple years michaels said but he added that toyota 
hopes to double even triple sales once the new model takes hold 
consumer report magazine did not have a listing for owner reports 
on the 4runner

the outbreak of world war ii half a century ago 
helped put american farmers on the hightech course they follow 
today and it bailed them out of the great depression 
market prices for most commodities crept up in the months 
following germanys sept 1 1939 invasion of poland the price of 
horses however barely moved 
president roosevelts secretary of agriculture henry a wallace 
advised farmers to proceed with 1940 production plans as if the 
outbreak in europe had not occurred 
the farm price of cotton in august 1939 averaged 87 cents per 
pound corn brought less than 48 cents a bushel and wheat was about 
55 cents nationally on the average 
horses were reported by usda in the month before the start of 
world war ii at 78 per head 
six months later in february 1940 the department reported the 
farm prices of cotton at 997 cents per pound corn at 55 cents a 
bushel and wheat at 84 cents per bushel 
horses gained only 20 cents averaging 7820 each in february 
1940 
early predictions of demand for farm products remained guarded 
european war has not stimulated it has diminished the export 
demand for farm products the march 1940 report said united 
states exports of tobacco and fruits have been greatly reduced 
exports of pork and lard are not up to the volume that would 
flow normally in a year of large production and low prices export 
sales of cotton have been good but have declined recently little 
wheat is going abroad 
some increases in us domestic demand were reported as war 
clouds deepened but us industrial production had not yet geared 
up and the outlook for agriculture was clouded 
there seems little in the picture now that would justify any 
expansion in farm production this year 1940 in excess of domestic 
plus limited export needs for foods and fibers usda 
economists intoned 
but in may 1940 after the fall of france and as britains 
tattered army prepared for its evacuation from dunkirk the usdas 
analysts reported 
news comes of a quick change in the european political front 
and yeast of commodity speculation rises wheat goes to highest 
prices in three years feed grains follow hog prices climb too 
massive us aid to britain including food and clothing and a 
buildup in american military forces would gradually put the united 
states on a war footing pearl harbor on dec 7 1941 settled any 
remaining doubts 
doug bowers the departments historian says world war ii 
brought epic changes to american agriculture 
since world war i in 191418 the main problem in us 
agriculture had been overproduction he said in a telephone 
interview but with the 193945 conflict they needed full 
production for wartime bowers said 
this coincided with a very important change in american 
agriculture he said that was the widespread adoption of 
chemicals fertilizer and pesticides and also the continued 
mechanization of agriculture 
the war didnt contribute directly to mechanization simply 
because factories that normally turned out tractors and combines 
were building guns and tanks 
but in the midwest for example farmers who had never 
fertilized before at all began using fertilizer on crops bowers 
said it began a long trend in upward productivity in american 
agriculture 
there were domestic price controls and rationing during world war 
ii he said even so there was inflation as families sought 
products for wartime incomes 
the farmer came out of world war ii in better economic shape 
than hed been in for a quarter of a century since the end of world 
war i bowers said 
as the war drew to a close there was some concern that 
agriculture might suffer the same kind of collapse that happened in 
the 1920s a harbinger of the great depression when the farm 
economy was burdened by the loss of wartime markets and high prices 
government price supports were kept at relatively high levels 
through world war ii and for some time afterward just in case he 
said but us aid to a wartorn world required a large output by 
farmers the outbreak of the korean war in 1950 also was a factor 
it wasnt until the mid1950s that surpluses were a serious 
problem again bowers said 
by february 1943 with the allied invasion of naziheld europe 
still more than a year away the economists at usda noted that 
food production was expanded greatly in 1942 and that more was 
needed 
when the great victory drives in europe and the far east get 
under way food production will become more and more important in 
relation to other war production they said food requirements 
will become acute with the liberation of axisoccupied territories 
the report also showed the farm price of cotton at 197 cents per 
pound corn at 88 cents per bushel and wheat at 118 per bushel 
horses were not included in the february 1943 agricultural 
situation report tanks and tractors had taken their toll

a california company awarded a federal 
contract tuesday to clean up hazardouswaste sites faces a lawsuit 
for alleged stock fraud and has been fined 4 million for 
infractions at two landfills 
the army corp of engineers which awarded the contract was not 
aware of the lawsuit or fines against international technology 
corp or itx until two weeks ago when an aide to a utah 
congressman told the agency said the aide who asked that he and 
the congressman remain anonymous 
a spokeswoman at the corps omaha office betty white said itx 
based in torrance calif had been audited and found able to 
perform the work we want done 
the contract the first of four to be awarded could be worth 50 
million over five years and entails cleaning up leaking barrels 
containing pcbs kerosene and other hazardous wastes at government 
and private landfills nationwide itx performs similar work for the 
state of california 
itx corporate counsel john allen said the lawsuit and fines are 
not relevant to the contract allen said the landfill fines were for 
administrative violations 
an attorney in the corps omaha office ann wright said 
companies bidding on the contract are required to disclose all 
relevant information wright would not say if itx disclosed the 
lawsuit and fines in its bid 
allen said companies do not routinely disclose that kind of 
information it doesnt relate directly to your ability to provide 
a service he said 
the lawsuit arose from a stock offering in late 1987 when itx 
sold 35 million shares to raise 475 million itx began issuing 
the stock in september 1987 but announced that december that it was 
closing its hazardouswaste transport and landfill operations a 
substantial part of the companys business 
the lawsuit alleges that itx planned to leave the landfill 
business before issuing the stock but withheld the information from 
the public 
the stock was sold at an inflated price said ernest kaufman 
an attorney for the plaintiffs kaufman said the suit seeks many 
millions of dollars and represents thousands of people 
allen said the stocks price dropped with the rest of the market 
during the october 1987 market crash itx stock hit 9 a share after 
the market collapse the stock sold for 13 to 14 a share when 
issued 
itxs annual 10k report said the securities and exchange 
commission is looking into the allegations 
five months before itx issued the stock the company agreed to 
pay the california department of health services 32 million in 
fines for violations at two landfills the company owned this past 
june itx paid another 900000 fine because it underestimated the 
closure and postclosure costs of one of its landfills 
an attorney for the california health services department sue 
bertkin said the 1987 fines covered several violations including 
disposing of hazardous wastes not identified in the companys 
application not gaining approval before increasing the capacity of 
a landfill and inadequate training of personnel 
officials from various california state agencies said none of the 
violations threatened public health or the environment the fines 
are not unusual said health services worker rubia bertram

officials on tuesday delayed for at least two 
weeks the sale of refinancing bonds for two troubled nuclear 
projects of the washington public power supply system after a new 
york bank said it has a claim against the sales proceeds 
wppss which defaulted on 225 billion worth of bonds in 1983 
in the biggestever municipal bond default planned this week to 
sell 450 million worth of bonds that would yield an estimated 7 
percent to 8 percent interest 
the bonds would replace bonds sold early this decade at 10 
percent to 15 percent interest for its nuclear plants nos 1 and 3 
said wppss spokesman john britton 
wppss a consortium of utilities formed to build power plants 
estimates it will save an average of 70 million to 80 million a 
year over the next 30 years through the refinancing 
the sale would mark the first time wppss has sold bonds since the 
default 
the nos 1 and 3 plants sit partially completed at the hanford 
nuclear reservation and at satsop west of olympia construction was 
halted early this decade because of financing problems and doubts 
about the need for new electricity sources 
late last week chemical bank of new york wrote to the bond 
trustees for nos 1 and 3 saying it had claims against the proceeds 
of the refinancing bonds because of a federal court case involving 
the two plants britton said 
chemical bank is a trustee for investors who hold bonds in wppss 
plants nos 4 and 5 which were terminated in 1982 when partially 
built it was these bonds that resulted in the wppss default 
chemical bank is involved in an action in us district court in 
seattle in which it claims costs were misallocated between twin 
plants nos 1 and 4 which sit on the same site at hanford and 
between nos 3 and 5 which share the satsop site 
because of their proximity and design similarities certain costs 
such as engineering work access roads and some buildings were 
shared by plants 1 and 4 and by plants 3 and 5 and those costs 
were allocated to each plant according to a formula 
chemical bank claims the formula misallocated some of those costs 
to nos 4 and 5 and that the bondholders it represents stand to 
gain up to 1 billion because of the incorrect billing 
in may a federal judge ruled that chemical bank does have a lien 
against any costs that were misallocated to plants 4 and 5 however 
a decision has not been made on whether any costs were in fact 
misallocated britton said 
william berls a vice president for chemical banks financial 
services division said tuesday that the letter to the trustees for 
nos 1 and 3 contained nothing new and was intended solely to 
make sure the trustees understood chemical banks interest 
the exact terms of the refinancing bond sale were to be set 
tuesday by the sales underwriters goldman sachs amp co and smith 
barney harris upham and co britton said 
the sale was scheduled for thursday britton said 
the lawyers are discussing the matter but our position hasnt 
changed that chemical bank has no claim against proceeds of the 
refinancing sale britton said 
britton noted that the costsharing litigation was covered in the 
250page disclosure statement wppss issued for the refinancing sale

when federal authorities handcuffed and arrested 
kidder peabody amp co trader richard b wigton in front of his 
colleagues he was shocked 
when he was charged on the basis of information supplied by 
kidders former highflying mergers specialist martin siegel who 
already had confessed to insider trading with ivan boesky he 
thought i cant believe that lying soandso 
the government did believe siegel but 2 years after the 
dramatic february 1987 arrest prosecutors anounced they were 
dropping their insider trading investigation of wigton and a kidder 
colleague 
wigton 59 a paunchy wall street veteran said tuesday he was 
not bitter angry is a better word about the episode that ended 
with the government essentially saying he did nothing wrong 
im not waiting for an apology i dont think im going to get 
it wigton told a news conference at this point i just want to 
put it all behind me 
the human cost was very bad for the first five or six months 
but with the support of my family and all my acquaintances and 
friends i just came to live with it came to feel good about my 
innocence wigton said 
he said that if he encountered siegel who turned federal witness 
after he was implicated by nowimprisoned speculator boesky today 
i think at this point id turn my back and walk away 
the us attorneys office last week ended its probe of wigton 
and kidder coworker timothy tabor former goldman sachs amp co 
arbitrager robert freeman who also was arrested in the case agreed 
to plead guilty to one felony 
wigton tabor and freeman were charged with violating securities 
laws by making illegal securities trades using nonpublic 
information otherwise called insider trading in may 1987 the 
prosecutors voluntarily dropped the charges after a judge refused 
the government more pretrial preparation time 
former us attorney rudolph w giuliani now a new york mayoral 
candidate who has said the timing of the arrests was a mistake 
indicated at the time that a new indictment would be brought it 
never was 
to accuse somebody of a crime when all you have is the 
uncorrobrated word of one man who himself is in trouble was just 
a terrible injustice said wigtons attorney stanley arkinthey 
simply went on siegels word and they went swiftly without a 
great deal of thoughtfulness 
i think they had hoped their shock tactics would bring people 
around to confessing and getting others he said the 
misjudgment here was they had innocent people 
arkin said he would not pursue a wrongful arrest case on wigtons 
behalf against the government because it would be a nearly 
impossible case to mount legally 
wigton began working on wall street in 1956 and rose to become 
kidders head of arbitrage the risky trading in the stocks of 
takeover targets he received investment advice from siegel the 
firms widely admired young mergers specialist 
the arbitrage departments performance soared after wigton and 
tabor began receiving advice from siegel but wigton said at no time 
did he suspect siegel was passing them inside information 
the us attorneys office has said it is satisfied it believes 
siegel told the truth arkin said prosecutors never told him what 
siegel said 
wigton who lives in the affluent suburb of short hills nj 
said he has not decided whether to return to kidder which has paid 
his legal fees and a reduced salary since his arrest 
for now wigton said hes happy playing golf and relaxing and 
doesnt miss the long hours on the trading desk the mildmannered 
wall streeter said he celebrated his victory over the government at 
a champagne dinner with his wife and three children monday

the us dollar eased against most major foreign 
currencies in early european trading today gold prices were little 
changed 
currency dealers said the market was empty with most investors 
staying on the sidelines in the absence of any news developments 
some market participants attributed the dollars slightly weaker 
stance partly to tuesdays report of a sharperthanexpected 
19percent drop in us durable goods orders for july and partly 
to rumors in new york that the west german central bank would raise 
key interest rates thursday 
although the market will be watching for developments when the 
bundesbank resumes its regular policy meetings after a summer pause 
most analysts agree such action is unlikely 
in tokyo where trading ends before europes business day begins 
the dollar fell 043 yen to a closing 14235 later in london it 
was quoted at 14245 yen 
other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late tuesdays 
prices included 19405 west german marks down from 19410 66755 
swiss francs up from 16730 65520 french francs down from

lire down from 140300 11750 canadian dollars up from 11742 
in london the dollar fell against the british pound it cost 
15875 to buy one pound compared with 15840 late tuesday 
gold opened in london at 36630 a troy ounce compared with late 
tuesdays 36675 at midmorning the citys five major bullion

the us dollar dropped against the japanese yen 
today for the third consecutive day in tokyo and share prices fell 
on the tokyo stock exchange 
the dollar closed at 14235 yen down 043 yen from tuesdays 
close of 14278 yen after opening at 14230 yen the dollar ranged 
between 14220 and 14260 yen it now has fallen 117 yen in three 
trading days 
analysts said the us currency opened lower following its 
downswing in new york tuesday but then recovered slightly 
there was speculation that the west german bundesbank would 
raise interest rates and it caused the dollar to decline against the 
west german mark said a dealer at daiichi kangyo bank but the 
speculation was said to be groundless and it caused the dollar to 
bounce back marginally 
another dealer at the bank said it was another quiet day in 
tokyo most dealers find it difficult to make substantial moves 
because of a lack of incentives institutional investors are not 
placing large orders either 
dealers also said market participants were awaiting the results 
of a twoday meeting of the us federal reserve boards open market

contrary to its public stance ual corp is 
actively seeking potential bidders for the company and should be 
forced to negotiate with suitor marvin davis and auction the company 
to the highest bidder a shareholders lawsuit contends 
the suit filed tuesday by shareholder lionel brazen in cook 
county circuit court here asked the court to grant a temporary 
injunction to compel the parent of united airlines to bargain in 
good faith with all interested acquirers and auction ual to the 
highest possible bidder 
the lawsuit which seeks certification as a class action was 
filed as ual reportedly was being courted by a number of suitors 
besides davis whose original offer several weeks ago touched off a 
recordbreaking climb in ual stock 
davis bid was sweetened last wednesday to 619 billion or 275 
a share 
the complaint alleged that while refusing to publicly take a 
position on the davis proposal ual and its directors are actively 
engaged in seeking out other potential bidders for ual 
the suit also cited a wall street journal report that ual might 
be favoring british airways plc as a potential acquirer saying such 
talks would constitute an admission by ual and its directors that 
the company is for sale 
ual spokesman rob doughty denied a decision to sell the company 
had in fact been made repeating what ual directors said after two 
board meetings last week that it was premature to say that a 
decision has been reached on whether a sale of the company is 
appropriate 
the journal reported today that ual was likely to wait for 
financing details of davis financing bid before deciding what to do 
ual shares slipped 175 tuesday on the new york stock exchange 
to close at 272 
besides british airways said to be working in tandem with morgan 
stanley amp co other reported bidders for ual are leveraged buyout 
specialist kohlberg kravis roberts amp co and a managementled group 
headed by ual chairman stephen wolf 
united and representatives of those firms have declined comment 
citing policies regarding speculative reports 
some potential acquirers also reportedly met with union officials 
representing uniteds pilots and machinists who are considered 
crucial to any sale or restructuring of the airline and might seek 
an equity stake in return for their cooperation 
union officials also have declined to comment on matters related 
to an acquisition of the company 
the lawsuit without specifying any potential suitor asks the 
court to order ual directors to bargain in good faith with all 
interested acquirers and to auction ual to the highest possible 
bidders

who else would be in an oldsmobile but ringo starr 
and his daughter lee 
oldsmobile the general motors corp division known mostly for 
drivers with graying hair and car trunks big enough for a couple of 
sets of golf clubs kicks off a secondyear series of advertisements 
friday night with the theme of this is not your fathers 
oldsmobile 
in one ad to debut on nbcs nfl preseason football the 
exbeatle complete with pony tail and an earring is chased by a 
crowd of middleaged women slides down a banquet table and out of a 
12thfloor window his fall is broken by an awning and he winds up 
in the passenger seat of a new fourdoor olds cutlass supreme 
at the wheel is his 18yearold daughter sporting purple hair 
would you ever have imagined that oldsmobile would use someone 
with a ponytail and an earring and a daughter with purple hair to 
sell their cars said rick ross the divisions director of 
advertising 
others in the father campaign for 1990 will be actor peter 
graves and his daughter amanda ted einstein greatgrandson of 
albert einstein and the adult children of entertainer harry 
belafonte without their father 
the campaign begun last year caught the eye of the advertising 
world but may not be attracting buyers to dealer showrooms through 
aug 10 of this year oldsmobile sales were running 154 percent 
behind last years pace while gm car sales were down 9 percent 
it takes two or three years sometimes longer for a campaign 
to end up in a directsales boost ross said i think were 
going to see some sales results in 1990 our dealers are reporting 
theyre getting a lot younger traffic 
according to olds its average buyer is 51 years old and 
executives would like that age to drop into the upper 40s 
in an effort to broaden the oldsmobile appeal the company will 
introduce a minivan the silhouette and will get some production of 
a new sportutility vehicle next year gm officials have said 
advertising budget figures are closely held by automakers but 
there have been estimates that gm has spent 120 million advertising 
its oldsmobiles for the 1989 model year much of that cost in 
starting up the new theme 
ross said the division is increasing its advertising spending 
this year but not by as much as it did in 1989 to get the 
father campaign off the ground

nl industries inc a company controlled by texas 
financier harold simmons said it was prepared to offer around 13 
billion for georgia gulf corp a commerical concern in which it 
recently accumulated a 99 percent stake 
the propsal made in a letter to georgia gulf chairman james r 
kuse sent georgia gulf stock surging 725 a share to close at 
5875 tuesday in active trading on the new york stock exchange nl 
shares rose 125 cents to finish at 24625 
the closing georgia gulf price exceeded the 55 a share simmons 
said he was prepared to pay for the company two months ago georgia 
gulf shares traded at around 35 
such a transaction might take the form of a leveraged 
recapitalization merger or other transaction said the kuse 
letter which was signed by nl president j landis martin we 
believe that the value of georgia gulfs common shares would be 
enhanced by a transaction in which shareholders receive 55 per 
share in cash 
georgia pacific released the letter without comment on tuesday a 
day after it was sent 
the letter follows a recent filing with the securities and 
exchange commission in which simmons indicated a takeover attempt of 
georgia gulf was possible he said his interest in the company was 
no longer held solely for the purpose of investment 
simmons and his companies owns 23 million shares or 99 percent 
of georgia gulfs approximately 24 million shares outstanding a 
stake that was accumulated in recent months 
john garcia a securities analyst with wertheim schroder amp co in 
new york said that georgia gulf might try to establish an employee 
stock ownership plan to fend off a hostile takeover attempt 
georgia gulf created in 1985 as a spinoff of georgiapacific 
corp had 1988 sales of 106 billion 
simmons has built a fortune estimated at more than 16 billion 
through acquisitions his holding company dallasbased valhi inc 
had 1988 sales of 225 billion 
simmons acquired control of nl industries a chemical and 
petroleum service company last year in a 1 billion deal

restoring customers confidence in prime computer 
inc will be the first order of business when the company hobbled 
by an expensive antitakeover campaign completes its friendly merger 
with jh whitney amp co 
whitney partner russell e planitzer said tuesday the deal should 
be completed within 10 days 
a new president james f mcdonald will immediately take the 
reins and a new board will be named planitzer said 
prime a natickbased minicomputer maker had been searching for 
an ally against a 113 billion hostile bid from mai basic four inc 
of tustin calif when whitney the nations oldest venture capital 
firm came forward in june 
the companies agreed to a friendly merger under which prime will 
effectively become a private company 
whitney offered to pay 20 a share for 495 million shares and 
exchange notes with a face value of 22 per share for the remaining 
21 percent of primes shares 
securities analysts said those notes would trade at a substantial 
discount and estimated the total value of the deal at between 17 
and 1850 a share or 106 billion to 116 billion 
mcdonald the next president has most recently been president of 
gould inc which he guided to a turnaround and subsequent sale to 
nippon mining co in 1988 he succeeds anthony l craig who has 
held the post since november and has chosen to resign after the 
whitney group completes its tender offer for prime 
repaying debt will be pivotal for prime in the coming months 
said john w adams an analyst who follows prime for the boston 
investment firm adams harkness amp hill 
the real issue is whether all that debt on the balance sheet is 
going to make a difference to customers he said prime had a 
very strong balance sheet going into this and goes out with a very 
leveraged balance sheet 
mcdonald said the companys two immediate priorities would be 
employees and customers he said both groups had been severely 
shaken by the long struggle against mai basic 
if i were a customer in the last 10 months the companys 
situation would have bothered me to death he said i think the 
change is a very welcome one 
mcdonald said the computer company would remain in natick but 
that a new business strategy would include an undetermined number of 
layoffs and substantial changes in the companys senior management 
prime which makes minicomputers and computeraided design and 
manufacturing systems turned a profit of 19 million on sales of 
16 billion in 1988 
but the cost of defending against a takeover and slow sales of 
minicomputers led to losses of 144 million in the final quarter of 
1988 5 million in the first quarter of this year and 19 million 
in the second quarter

digital equipment corp reportedly has told at 
least nine of its departments to cut their workforces by 25 percent 
through attrition or transfer by july 1991 
digital which is based in maynard has about 125800 employees 
but only an estimated 30000 apparently would be involved putting 
the total reduction in employees at around 7500 the boston globe 
reported today 
the computer manufacturer confirmed the existence of an internal 
memo about the workforce reduction and said any of the cuts would be 
made through attrition and transfer of workers whose jobs are 
eliminated to other divisions 
we have no plans at all for layoffs said nikki richardson a 
spokeswoman for digital 
the announcement comes less than a week after unisys corp 
another big computer maker said it plans to reduce its worldwide 
workforce by 7 percent to 8 percent by the end of 1990 a cut of 
6000 to 7000 jobs would include some layoffs 
jobs affected by cutbacks are considered support jobs including 
those in administration law finance personnel purchasing data 
information services facilities materials and quality the globe 
said 
ms richardson said she did not know how many employees performed 
such job but analysts told the globe it could be as many as 30000 
because the companys headquarters is in maynard much of any 
reduction could affect massachusetts employees digital has 33700 
of its employees in the state 
the memo the globe said orders heads of affected departments to 
plan for cutting budgets for the fiscal year that began july 1 by 10 
percent 
it is assumed that this will include a sizable reduction in 
population the memo said 
it also said that to reduce the number of employees in those 
departments by 25 percent by july 1991 each group will have to 
struggle with what work to discontinue 
they should not just shave expenses but rather eliminate 
entire efforts it said 
its not a plan its a working document a directional 
document to promote ideas within the company ms richardson said 
of the memo 
digital previously said it will freeze the salaries of all its 
employees in the united states and move as many as 4000 employees 
from manufacturing to sales and service because of a slowdown in 
demand for its computers 
it announced last month that profits for the quarter ended june 
30 were down 22 percent to 3132 million on sales of 3495 billion

the dutch aerospace firm fokker has 
decided to expand a dutch assembly line for its successful f100 
passenger jet but is still negotiating over a new plant in the 
united states a dutch newspaper reported wednesday 
fokker denied that any decision had been made on the expansion of 
its current f100 assembly line at amsterdams schiphol airport and 
said the issue was still wide open 
however the amsterdam newspaper de volkskrant said the company 
had opted to invest 381 million to expand the schiphol plant which 
can build up to 46 f100 jets a year 
other contenders for the new assembly line which would be set up 
to produce 200 f100s from 1991 to 1997 are the lockheed aircraft 
corp grumman corp and rockwell 
according to the volkskrant report fokker is still negotiating 
with lockheeds marietta georgia plant but the talks are 
stagnating over the price demanded by lockheed for assembling the 
twinengine shorthaul jets the report gave no specifics 
banking circles in britain openly discuss the impending 
expansion at schiphol said the newspaper report adding that 
several unidentified british banks had financed the new assembly 
line 
however fokker spokesman bart van veen denied that any british 
financiers were involved and characterized the volkskrant story as 
incorrect 
nothings been decided yet the decisions will all be taken in 
the course of or even late next month van veen said 
according to de volkskrant fokker would announce the move to 
expand at schiphol officially on friday along with its semiannual 
profit figures 
so far fokker has sold 193 f100s to customers including 
swissair usair american airlines and braniff airlines fokker 
customers have taken out options for another 199 of the 
fuelefficient jets 
however the companys schiphol plant which employs 7000 
people is too small to meet the demand for f100s 
van veen said negotiations were still under way not only with 
lockheed but also with other plane builders in the united states

jerrold pass keeps a tighter leash on inventories of 
rhinestonestudded dog collars now that his midwest pet store chain 
operates under the heavy burden of a debtfinanced takeover 
rather than go hogwild when building a new store pass 
scrutinizes the cost of everything from cages to cash registers 
the enormous interest payments that go with leveraged buyouts 
takeover deals that rely on borrowed money have hurt a number of 
highly visible companies from drug chains to truckers to furniture 
outlets 
but as pass pets ltds experience shows a lowerprofile crop of 
postbuyout firms is flourishing partly because the high debt 
levels force management to cut unnecessary spending 
pass says the relentless pressure of a multimilliondollar debt 
on the 35store chain headquartered near st louis has made him a 
better manager he wouldnt disclose the exact amount of money owed 
but said ive got to make those interest payments 
moreover pass said hes unafraid of a recession unlike many 
managers of heavily indebted companies who worry that a downturn 
could shrink their income delay debt repayments and bring angry 
creditors knocking 
the pet business can jump 25 percent in a recession he said 
people dont send their kids to camp they stay home with their 
pets 
a small percentage of the nations lbo debt has been repaid 
delinquently or not at all and some finance experts forecast that 
lbo failures may rise sharply 
federal reserve board vice chairman manuel johnson for example 
said in a june speech that about 40 percent of all debtfinanced 
deals are in cyclical industries that could face severe problems if 
the economy shrinks 
the troubles that lbo companies face when they cant repay 
creditors first began receiving heightened attention more than a 
year ago revco ds inc one of the largest drug store chains 
sought bankruptcy protection at that time because of inability to 
pay the debt incurred in its 13 billion lbo 
other highprofile lbos such as the 11 billion buyout of singer 
co 25 billion buyout of storer communications inc and 37 
billion of owensillinois inc also have faced difficulty managing 
their heavy debt loads 
but some experts argue that many lbo companies can pay debts 
promptly and make money steven kaplan assistant professor at the 
university of chicago said the companies that cant make debt 
payments get a lot of press 
kaplan said that in his study of more than 50 lbos completed 
between 1975 and 1985 the companies experienced an average jump in 
operating income of 10 percent and a 26 percent increase in 
profitability both exceeding the averages by nonlbo competitors 
an lbo has become one of the most popular corporate takeover 
tools of the decade figures compiled by idd information services 
mampa database a securities industry research concern show the value 
of lbos completed in 1989 already totals 4948 billion vs about 
16 billion for lbos completed in 1984 
in such a transaction a group of investors that often includes 
company management buys a company largely with borrowed money using 
its assets as collateral for the loans 
the investors repay the loans with the companys earnings or the 
sale of what they consider unnecessary assets or operations ranging 
from corporate jets to inefficent factories or entire subsidiaries 
the results often are drastically shrunken but highly profitable 
privately owned companies that dont have to worry about the demands 
of public shareholders and can concentrate instead on their 
longterm businesses 
such companies can be resold later for an enormous profit because 
the lbo investors put up little of their own money most of the risk 
is borne by creditors who finance the lbos 
experts say lbo success depends upon a company having reliable 
streams of incoming cash steady demand for its products and assets 
that maintain value regardless of economic swings thats why some 
lbos dont make it 
one example is cuisinarts inc which earlier this month sought 
chapter 11 bankruptcy protection because of stagnant demand for its 
upscale food processors and a failure to exploit its famous name on 
other products debt stemming from the companys 1988 lbo was just 
one problem 
other companies likely to encounter difficulties are those that 
undertook managementled lbos mainly to escape a hostile takeover 
among the casualties is trailer maker fruehauf corp forced to 
sell most of its businesses to help pay for a 15 billion lbo that 
thwarted an unwanted bid by takeover investor asher edelman little 
is left of the original fruehauf now known as kh corp 
problems also arise when deals are priced on the bet that the 
best case is going to materialize its never happened said al 
rappaport chairman of chicagobased consulting firm alcar group inc 
lbo specialist kohlberg kravis roberts amp co generally 
considered the pioneer of the strategy and engineer of the record 
25 billion lbo of rjr nabisco inc earlier this year reportedly 
faces difficulties unloading some businesses acquired in several of 
it debtfinanced takeovers 
in addition some companies kohlberg helped acquire via lbos are 
foundering new yorkbased seamans furniture co for example has 
said it must renegotiate debt payments partly because sales have 
stagnated the 360 million lbo engineered two years ago presumed 
healthy sales growth 
despite the difficulties faced by some of highprofile lbos many 
others are considered mundane transactions that do not hinge on the 
mass sale of assets or other drastic restructuring 
rappaport said more than 80 percent of lbos undertaken between 
1986 and 1988 were divestitures meaning that management bought 
divisions from the parent company that could be run more efficiently 
as separate businesses such deals have been widely successful 
take om scott amp sons co an ohio fertilizer maker that 
conglomerate itt corp sold to a managementled group in a 1986 lbo 
in the past two years sales have risen by 35 percent operating 
profit has jumped 50 percent and the company has repaid 20 percent 
of its debt load 
the case of pass pets also is relatively common an entrepreneur 
wants to sell the company he founded but still retain a stake in the 
business 
after grooming his pet chain for 20 years pass sold a majority 
stake to horizon investments an lbo investment firm and kept his 
position as president and minority owner horizon purchased its 
stake with borrowed money 
such an arrangement pass said allowed him to have my company 
and get my money out i got a job my company and cash 
still as manager he is responsible for repaying the lbo debt 
getting used to that was difficult for pass who called it a new 
way of doing business 
august ceradini saw an lbo as a way of buying a company with 
other peoples money his yacht charter business has a 
debttoequity ratio of 5to1 but hes having no problem paying the 
interest 
we have a good growth rate and good control of costs said 
ceradini president of new york cruise lines inc the company was 
created when a manhattan sightseeing ship company completed an lbo 
of world yacht inc which runs dinnerdance cruises around new york 
harbor 
despite the pressure of interest payments ceradini is unafraid 
of recession every restaurant in new york is down 20 percent and 
were ahead of last year good food and good service doesnt wear 
out and neither does a spectacular view of the city

federal prosecutors are considering whether to 
reverse course and allow drexel burnham lambert inc to pay michael 
r milken more than 100 million for work he did last year sources 
said wednesday 
the provision barring drexel from paying its indicted former junk 
bond trader his 1988 compensation was included in the investment 
firms formal settlement of criminal securities fraud charges with 
the government 
the withholding has been controversial because milken has not 
been charged with any wrongdoing in 1988 milken has challenged the 
provision in us district court in manhattan 
sources familiar with the case who asked not to be named said 
prosecutors have not made a final decision on whether to pay milken 
his compensation estimated at more than 100 million 
but they indicated that a reversal may be made because legal 
experts have criticized the provision as potentially 
unconstitutional and that the government may not want to start its 
case against milken off on the wrong foot 
they said that ending the lengthy delay in drexels plea in the 
case was not a factor in reconsidering the payment provision 
drexel spokesman steven anreder assistant us attorney john 
carroll and a milken spokesman all declined to comment 
the government has not said officially why it sought to keep the 
money from milken but prosecutors have indicated they believed it 
was improper for drexel to settle criminal charges at the same time 
it was paying millions of dollars to the employee it contended was 
responsible for the illegal activity 
drexel agreed in december to pay 650 million and plead guilty to 
six felony charges of securities law violations but the plea has 
been held up by a series of legal issues related to milken who had 
headed the investment houses junk bond operation 
the last of these issues was milkens challenge to the 
prosecutors agreement with drexel on his pay 
milken was charged in march in a 98count indictment with 
racketeering conspiracy mail fraud and other illegal activities 
related to securities transactions he pleaded not guilty and is 
scheduled to go to trial in march 
a us district court hearing has been scheduled for sept 6 on 
milkens arguments that the pay provision deprived him of due 
process 
milken has resigned from drexel and set up his own financial 
consulting firm

the new york mercantile exchange said wednesday 
it plans to begin trading in a new residual fuel oil futures 
contract on oct 2

dry beer is becoming a big hit across the united 
states although most drinkers still have no idea what it is or what 
it tastes like 
that may be one reason the distinct new beer has become so 
popular 
the curiosity level is unbelievable said bob goughenour a 
group brand executive at anheuserbusch inc who helped bring dry 
beer to american supermarkets and taverns 
so be prepared 
the cacophonous vendors at the stadium may soon begin asking 
hows about a nice dry one your neighbor may invite you over 
for something dry to drink 
its been a year since anheuserbusch introduced michelob dry in 
this country and the brand has been so successful at one point 
the brewer couldnt make it fast enough to keep up with sales the 
company earlier this year introduced a dry version of budweiser the 
worlds bestselling beer 
bud dry should be available nationally by the end of the year 
said goughenour 
were just delighted with dry beer our volumes are more than 
twice what we expected its just been incredible he said 
dry beer is brewed to produce a lesssweet taste that doesnt 
linger its made with a process that converts more of the malt and 
rice into fermentable sugars which interact more efficiently with 
the yeast 
the beer contains less sugar than regular beer fewer calories 
and no aftertaste which probably is its most noticeable difference 
bud drys advertising slogan is comes on strong then its 
gone 
last year about 500000 to 600000 barrels of dry beer were sold 
in the united states said frank walters director of research for 
impact magazine a new yorkbased trade publication for the 
alcoholic beverage industry 
this year walters expects sales of about 25 million barrels 
next year he said the amount should climb to 6 million barrels 
annual sales of beer in the united states total about 188 million 
barrels 
its still very early to say but we expect by the end of this 
century dry beer should be at about 20 million barrels walters 
said but this category is so new that that could all change in 
the next hour 
one big question remains about dry beer is it just a fad 
its honestly too early to tell said robert weinberg an 
industry consultant and professor of marketing management at 
washington university in st louis i think it may be more than a 
fad because it looks like this is a very pleasing product to young 
women 
weinberg said several female students have told him they like 
michelob dry because its the only beer that doesnt make them feel 
like they smell like a brewery 
the female market has been something brewers have hungrily eyed 
for decades weinberg said and if dry beer opens the door to that 
market it will prove much more than a fad 
odds that a beer drinker will be male are about twotoone 
weinberg said 
at the countrys second largest brewery miller brewing co 
officials are carefully watching the growth of dry beer but remain 
unconvinced that the category will be around for a long time 
our research shows that these products do not offer any 
significant benefit or appeal to mainstream beer drinkers said 
miller spokeswoman susan henderson 
she said miller based in milwaukee has no plans to plunge into 
the dry beer fray 
nineteen imported and domestic dry beers are currently sold 
around the country including canadian japanese and european brands 
g heileman brewing co of lacrosse wis sells five different 
dry beers on a regional basis including rainier special dry in the 
northwest and ic special dry in pennsylvania 
earlier this month the company which is a collection of 
regional breweries introduced lone star dry in texas said 
spokesman bill eiler 
we see a real strong future in dry beer we think its here to 
stay eiler said 
although its just started to catch the publics fancy dry beer 
is not new 
regional beers in the 1950s and 60s such as rheingold and stag 
pale dry were touted for dry taste but they never caused a big a 
stir in the industry like the current craze which got started about 
two years ago in japan 
asahi breweries ltd of toyko introduced a dry brand that started 
the sensation and prompted all of japans major brewers to scramble 
to concoct their own dry brands 
now the category has captured 20 percent to 30 percent of the 
japanese beer market industry analysts say 
goughenour was sent to japan by anheuserbusch to investigate the 
skyrocketing dry beer sales and see if the company should get into 
the category 
he came back perplexed 
i couldnt figure out how this could be applied in this 
country that was the question mark he said when we first 
started nobody knew what we were talking about americans know dry 
wine they know dry martinis and dry cleaning but they really dont 
know what dry is 
in japan consumers know what dry is because dry sake is a staple 
beverage so dry beer is kind of a logical extension for them 
goughenour said 
but in the united states the concept of dry is elusive 
thats why goughenour spent a lot of time asking us beer 
drinkers to define the meaning of dry as they thought it might 
apply to beer 
we got consumers to tell us what dry is and then we made 
something with a brand new refreshing smooth taste he said 
they told us what to make

futures prices of grain and soybeans closed mostly 
lower wednesday on the chicago board of trade reflecting overnight 
rainfall in midwestern growing areas and forecasts for more 
precipitation in the region 
rainfall amounts ranging from sprinkles to more than an inch were 
reported tuesday in the eastern corn belt states of indiana ohio 
and michigan overnight showers brought badly needed moisture to 
iowa illinois and missouri 
but the losses were limited by rising worries about the potential 
for damage to crops that were planted later than usual due to wet 
conditions in the spring 
some articles are starting to surface from meteorologists 
concerning the potential for an early freeze said ted mao a 
grain specialist with shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
perceptions also are growing that crop yields may not be as great 
as many experts had earlier thought 
at the close of trading wheat was 3 cents lower to 1 cent higher 
with the contract for delivery in september at 391 a bushel corn 
was 2 cents lower to 1 cent higher with september at 235 a 
bushel oats were 1 cents lower to cent higher with september at

former drexel burnham lambert inc assistant 
trader lisa jones was sentenced wednesday to 18 months in prison and 
ordered to pay more than 50000 for lying to a grand jury 
investigating wall street crime 
jones 26 was the first person convicted in the nearly 
threeyearold federal probe and her case had indirect links to the 
prosecution of former drexel financier michael milken who is 
accused of racketeering and fraud 
a federal jury in march found jones guilty on five counts of 
perjury and two counts of obstruction of justice for lying to a 
federal grand jury in january 1988 in an investigation of trading 
involving drexel 
jones plans to appeal the verdict 
us district judge leonard b sand dismissed arguments by jones 
lawyer that a prison term would cause greater psychological harm for 
the onetime teenage runaway saying mental treatment would a part 
of her sentence 
the judge said jones was aware she was breaking the law and said 
her crimes pose a grave danger to law enforcement 
there was a very conscious and deliberate decision which she 
made to lie sand said no one contends she did not know she was 
lying 
jones who left home at age 14 climbed to a 100000ayear job 
as an assistant bond trader in drexels highyield junk bond 
department in beverly hills calif 
in three appearances before the federal grand jury jones said 
she did not recall any discussions about stock parking in 
contacts with princetonnewport partners lp a defunct investment 
firm whose principals were convicted of securities fraud last month 
jones worked for former drexel trader bruce lee newberg who was 
convicted in the princetonnewport case and faces other charges at 
jones trial prosecutors showed that transactions she handled 
constituted parking which involves concealing the true ownership of 
stock 
newberg reported directly to milken who has been indicted on 98 
counts of racketeering and securities fraud some of the charges in 
the princetonnewport case overlap counts in milkens indictment 
jones attorney daniel h bookin argued that jones had 
substantially reduced mental capacity when she was questioned 
during the drexel investigation and that a jail term would be 
harmful to her he cited a psychiatrists report to bolster his 
defense 
bookin said jones had suffered a difficult life and drexel became 
the family she never had when she was thrust into the largest 
and most bitterly contested whitecollar criminal investigation in 
history 
but the government urged a sentence above the possible minimum 10 
to 16 months on grounds that jones perjury severely impeded the 
governments drexel investigation 
assistant us attorney mark hansen said said jones was offered 
numerous chances to alter her grand jury testimony and cooperate 
with prosecutors but did not 
the government said in court papers that jones also gave about 
150 demonstrably false answers about professional and personal 
matters on the witness stand during her trial 
sand said whether bruce newberg or others at drexel were 
family or quasifamily or occupied some other sheltering or 
nurturing role in miss jones life it does not overcome the fact 
that there was a very conscious and deliberate decision which she 
made to lie and to persist in a pattern of lying 
new federal sentencing guidelines recommend a sentence of 18 to 
24 months imprisonment for the severity of the perjury the 
prosecution indicated jones had committed federal law provided a 
maximum possible penalty of up to 35 years and a 175 million fine 
for the seven felony counts 
sand ordered her to serve 18 months in a minimum security womens 
prison in phoenix ariz where he said she would have access to 
mental health therapy 
sand also ordered 2 years of supervised work release with 
continued mental health treatment jones was fined 25000 plus the 
cost of her incarceration and supervised release for a total of 
5153150 
the judge said he would rule sept 13 whether to allow jones to 
remain free on bond pending an appeal

car and light truck sales by the nations big 
three automakers were flat in midaugust as buyer incentives and the 
urge to beat 1990 price increases barely overcame summer sales 
doldrums the companies said wednesday 
while ford motor co and chrysler corp reported slight increases 
in car sales general motors corps auto sales sagged a fraction of 
a percent 
overall the big three reported selling cars and light trucks at 
an average daily rate of 31200 during the aug 1120 period this 
year 008 percent higher than the daily rate of 31173 during the 
same period last year 
car sales were up 15 percent truck sales which had been strong 
despite a weakening car market sagged 23 percent 
automakers with higherthananticipated new car inventories have 
been offering buyers hundreds even thousands of dollars in some 
cases to take 1989 models off dealer lots 
further driving home the buy now theme have been 
announcements of tentative 1990 car prices with increases on new 
models expected to average 34 percent at gm 48 percent at ford 
and 5 percent at chrysler 
for the year to date the big three automakers said cars and

federal prosecutors are considering reversing 
course and allowing drexel burnham lambert inc to pay indicted 
financier michael r milken more than 100 million for work he did 
last year sources said wednesday 
the provision barring drexel from paying its former junk bond 
trader his 1988 compensation was included in the investment firms 
formal settlement of criminal securities fraud charges brought by 
the government 
the withholding of pay has been controversial because milken has 
not been charged with committing any wrongdoing during 1988 milken 
has challenged the provision in us district court in manhattan 
sources familiar with the case who asked not to be named said 
prosecutors have not made a final decision on whether to let drexel 
pay milken his compensation which court documents place at well 
over 100 million 
but they indicated a reversal may be made because legal experts 
have criticized the provision as potentially unconstitutional and 
the government may not want to start its case against milken before 
us district judge kimba wood off on the wrong foot 
they said ending the lengthy delay of drexels plea in the case 
was not a factor in reconsidering the payment provision 
spokesmen for drexel and milken declined to comment 
assistant us attorney john carroll said when and if we make 
a decision with regard to any matters in these cases we will tell 
them to judge wood before we tell them to anyone else 
the government has indicated the money was ordered withheld on 
grounds it was improper for drexel to settle criminal charges while 
it was paying millions to the employee allegedly responsible for 
illegal activity 
drexel agreed in december to pay 650 million and plead guilty to 
six felonies for violating securities laws charges that stemmed 
from the ivan boesky insider trading case the plea has been held up 
by a series of legal issues related to milken the last of which was 
his challenge to the pay requirement 
milken was charged in march in a 98count indictment with 
racketeering and fraud related to securities transactions he 
pleaded innocent and is scheduled to go to trial in march 
a us district court hearing is scheduled for sept 6 on 
milkens arguments that the pay provision deprived him of 
constitutional due process milken has resigned from drexel and set 
up his own financial consulting firm 
under a separate settlement with the securities and exchange 
commission drexel and its employees are barred from doing business 
with milken and his brother lowell who also is charged by the 
government 
the milkens were not party to the firms sec settlement which is 
to take effect after drexel enters its criminal plea 
drexel this week issued a threesentence memo reminding its 
employees they cannot advise corporate clients if milken also is 
advising them 
while employees of drexel burnham may have purely social 
contact with them business matters that do or could involve drexel 
burnham are not to be discussed read the memo signed by drexel 
chief executive frederick joseph 
drexel spokesman steven anreder said the memo was issued because 
the firm is determined to live within the spirit of the sec 
agreement in the absence of its finalization

a task force within digital equipment corp has 
issued a memo urging at least nine of the computer makers 
departments to cut their work forces by 25 percent through attrition 
or transfer by july 1991 
only an estimated 30000 of the maynardbased companys 125800 
employees would be affected by the memo putting the total reduction 
in employees at about 7500 analysts said 
digital the nations secondlargest computer manufacturer behind 
international business machines corp on wednesday confirmed 
existence of the memo but said it was issued by a task force and 
was not a firm company policy 
the memo said that to achieve the employee reductions each 
group will have to struggle with what work to discontinue any 
proposed cuts would be made through attrition and transfer of 
workers whose jobs are eliminated to other divisions 
they should not just shave expenses but rather eliminate 
entire efforts it said 
nikki richardson a digital spokeswoman said the memo was not 
a real plan 
its a memo from a task force task forces do not make 
policy she said 
we have a lot of task forces a lot of committees ms 
richardson added this was meant to generate internal discussion 
jobs affected by the proposed cutbacks are considered support 
jobs including those in the departments of administration law 
finance personnel purchasing data information services 
facilities materials and quality 
analysts said the cutbacks could affect departments employing 
about 30000 people 
last week unisys corp the no 3 us computer maker announced 
plans to cut its worldwide work force by 7 percent to 8 percent by 
the end of 1990 a reduction of 6000 to 7000 jobs that would 
include some layoffs 
reasons cited for the cuts included weakerthanexpected us 
demand and sharper competition in all industry segments worldwide 
digitals troubles began when interconnected personal computers 
began taking business away from the minicomputer market digitals 
stronghold according to george colony president of forrester 
research inc a computer research firm in cambridge 
digital has been able to ride out ths storm for the last 
several years because they were so dominant colony said but 
now the storm is beginning to rock decs boat as well 
in may digital tried to avoid workforce reductions through a 
freeze in salary increases and said it would move as many as 4000 
employees from manufacturing to sales and service because of the 
slowdon in demand for its computers but colony said the companys 
situation is apparently more severe than it first appeared 
a fundamental restructuring of dec is requried colony said 
he said digital needs to commit itself to workstations and 
personal computers and called the companys agreement to market 
tandy corp personal computers halfhearted digital does not 
make its own pcs 
the memo directs heads of affected departments to plan to cut 
budgets by 10 percent for the fiscal year that began july 1 
its not a plan its a working document a directional 
document to promote ideas within the company ms richardson said 
of the memo 
digital announced last month that its profit for the quarter 
ended june 30 was down 22 percent to 3132 million compared to the 
same period last year sales totaled 35 billion compared with 33 
billion a year ago

the telephone rings and theres nothing 
on the line but heavy breathing a tireless salesman or some other 
nameless voice pouring out of the ear piece with total anonymity 
picking up the phone can be like opening the door to any knock 
the telephone company says 
thats why nynex corp in new york and other phone companies have 
started offering customers a kind of early warning device known as 
caller identification 
with a small video panel located beside the phone caller 
identification displays the number from which an incoming call is 
originating before the call is answered 
its an intelligent use of the telephone said nynex 
spokesman joe gagen people want more control over their 
telephones they want more flexibility in using them 
not everyone thinks caller identification is a good idea some 
consumer advocates say the device could cause problems for people 
who want to keep their phone numbers secret others say it could 
hurt the telemarketing industry 
caller identification and several other services will be offered 
in new york this fall through nynex subsidiaries new york 
telephone and new england telephone new jersey bell the first to 
offer the serrvice in december 
pacific telesis group which serves much of the west coast will 
introduce the service later this year other phone companies also 
are testing caller identification across the country 
its the next generation of calling services its not just 
something we dreamed up gagen said its the way the network is 
evolving 
karen johnson a spokeswoman for new jersey bell says four out 
of five people who tried the service in a test in that state liked 
it they cited an added sense of security as the reason she said 
ninety percent of those also said it was a good solution to 
harassing calls johnson said 
along with caller identification nynex will offer three other 
services call return which calls back the last person who called 
whether the call was answered or not call trace which records the 
telephone number of an obscene or unwanted call and automatic 
redial which keeps dialing a number that rings busy for up to half 
an hour 
nynex predicts at least 20 percent of its residential customers 
will subscribe to the new calling services 
new jersey bell said about 5000 residential customers have 
signed up for caller identification the company expects the number 
to quadruple by yearend 
the new services are possible because of a technology called 
signaling system 7 which lets the telephone company transmit 
information about the call separately from the actual voice signal 
gagen said 
nynex is spending more than 1 billion on the new technology 
its a big investment but its a tremendous market gagen 
said we estimate that over the next five to 10 years well be 
converting the entire network 
caller identification is the most expensive of the services 
offered it costs 650 a month in new jersey gagen says nynexs 
caller identification will cost about the same 
subscribers also must buy an electronic recording device that 
displays the callers phone number on a screen the device about 
the size of a desk radio costs between 40 and 90 depending on 
the model it plugs into a phone jack and flashes the callers 
number for 30 seconds after the first ring 
the device also records the callers number and the date and time 
of the call it can store 20 to 50 calls a day 
the services are intended to give people and businesses more 
information about callers and more control over their telephones 
gagen said 
caller identification also would enhance the ability of emergency 
services to respond to crises if a caller couldnt provide the 
location of a problem caller identification would at least get the 
phone number 
we do get calls of an emergency nature and people leave 
incomplete information said capt donald briggs of the 
poughkeepsie police department a phone number would certainly 
help us 
some critics say caller identification could hurt legitimate 
telephone marketers and others that rely on telephone solicitation 
such as charity concerns or political campaigns 
gene kimmelman a telecommunications specialist with the consumer 
federation of america in washington said people who use the service 
probably would hesitate before patronizing businesses that call them 
at home 
nynex doesnt think that will be a problem 
we prefer to see the service go in and then deal with anything 
afterward gagen said 
to address privacy concerns pacific telesis plans to offer a 
feature that will allow callers to block their telephone numbers by 
dialing a special code before they place the call at the receiving 
end a message that says private call will appear on the caller 
identification video panel

mcdonalds has flipped billions of 
burgers and tossed chef salads for the masses but now its toying 
with pizzacraving palates in a move aimed at giving pizza hut and 
dominos pepperoni heartburn 
the latest addition to mcdonalds menu is a 14inch pizza served 
as an experiment in a few test markets its designed to woo 
families and couples who might not normally frequent the fastfood 
giant for supper 
so far the pizza made of quickcooking crust and fresh toppings 
seems to be getting good reviews partly because its ready in a few 
minutes faster than fastest pizza hut or dominos pizza car 
the experiment began july 10 at a mcdonalds in evansville now 
16 stores in evansville and nearby owensboro ky are serving 
mcdonalds pizzas daily after 4 pm 
mcdonalds wont say how sales are going and the company hasnt 
decided whether the pizzas will earn a permanent place on the menu 
its very preliminary testing at this point said terri 
capatosto a spokeswoman at mcdonalds corps headquarters in oak 
brook ill 
ms capatosto said pizzas arent sold until late afternoon 
because market research indicates pizza is eaten by families or 
couples usually at dinnertime she declined to explain why the 
product was being introduced now 
we tested salads for 12 years before we rolled them out 
nationally last year ms capatosto said we tested mcnuggets 
for two years 
fastfood industry analysts said they werent surprised by the 
mcdonalds pizza experiment partly because the company has a 
history of menu innovations to lure new customers during slack hours 
their main day business is lunch and breakfast is pretty 
successful said robert bernstein who follows mcdonalds for 
edward d jones amp co a st louisbased investment company 
their evenings arent as crowded bernstein said lets say 
its not as strong as they would like it chicken and burgers are 
finger food onthego pizza food is sit down and enjoy the evening 
meal they think that could improve their overall business 
the pizzas come in four varieties cheese pepperoni sausage 
and deluxe which includes pepperoni sausage green peppers 
mushrooms and tomato slices prices range from 584 to 949 
test stores have been remodeled to include a special pizza 
shoppe where customers can watch employees spread the ingredients 
on readymade dough brought in from bakeries 
its weird to go into mcdonalds and order a pizza said 
julie bales a 16yearold customer from owensboro munching on a few 
slices of pepperoni pizza but you dont have to wait i only had 
to wait about three minutes 
people hang out here and you have to buy something to stay 
here she said you might as well get pizza 
a friend amanda hagan 16 of owensboro said she also sampled 
the pizza 
that crust tastes kind of like cardboard but i like the 
topping she said 
rene and george jones of rockport ind said they were 
pleasantly surprised by the taste 
its in between frozen and the kind you buy at pizza hut 
said mrs jones 25 its a lot better than frozen for what you 
pay 
jones 31 said its not as spicy as other pizzas but it 
doesnt taste greasy 
mcdonalds experimented with small individual pizzas in test 
markets a few years ago then evidently dropped the idea this is 
the companys first foray into large pizzas aimed at attracting more 
than one eater 
regardless of whether mcdonalds pizza becomes a permanent item 
the tests are enough to have the giants of the pizzarestaurant 
business worried that mcdonalds with 8300 stores nationwide 
could grab a piece of their pie 
we certainly dont take mcdonalds lightly said roger 
rydell spokesman for no 1 pizza hut inc a 7000chain network 
with sales expected to reach 32 billion this year its an 
enormous company with tremendous resources were going to have to 
deal with it and well be fierce competitors 
rydell said pizza hut has prepared a marketing plan to deal with 
the competition 
we would not want to tip our hand he said but we are 
going to treat the tests in that particular market the way we treat 
any encroachment 
dominos pizza inc ranked no 2 with 5020 outlets and 
expected 1989 sales of 21 billion also is watching the mcdonalds 
experiment closely said michael raymond divisional vice president 
of marketing 
any time you have a company the size of mcdonalds with the 
marketing clout mcdonalds has you have to go on full alert 
raymond said 
but he said mcdonalds isnt considered a direct threat partly 
because dominos has concentrated much of its strength on pizza 
delivery to homes and offices mcdonalds doesnt deliver pizza as 
part of its experiment while dominos raymond said is a phone 
call away

cbs won us television and radio rights to the 
1994 winter olympics at lillehammer norway with a 300 million bid 
wednesday and added another major sports event to its fastgrowing 
collection 
in little more than a year cbs has won rights to the 1992 winter 
olympics at albertville france for 243 million and an exclusive 
fouryear network contract with major league baseball for 106 
billion 
the network already has exclusive network rights to the ncaa 
basketball tournament the nba the masters golf tournament and the 
us open tennis championships it shares the nfl with nbc and abc 
and college football with abc 
we consider ourself the number one sports network said 
lawrence a tisch cbs inc president and chief executive officer 
we will go all out to maintain our position and no matter what the 
event is cbs will be there 
barry frank a television adviser for the international olympic 
committee said 300 million was the minimum price the organizers 
were willing to accept 
a network source familiar with the negotiations said abc had told 
the olympic organizers that it did not intend to bid the source 
said frank had told nbc the minimum would be 290 million although 
frank denied that wednesday 
nbc officials visited norway two weeks ago and decided they would 
not meet the minimum but told frank they would participate in the 
bidding which had been scheduled for sept 7 frank then decided to 
negotiate with cbs rather than run an auction 
nbc sports spent considerable time examining the economics and 
preparing a bid nbc sports president dick ebersol said in a 
statement but when the ioc informed us that cbs was prepared to 
guarantee approximately 300 million we decided that this was 
substantially in excess of what their value would be to nbc and its 
affiliates 
at a twohour meeting wednesday morning in toronto cbs president 
neal h pilson finalized the deal with ioc vice president richard 
pound and other ioc officials 
acquiring the rights to lillehammer is still another step in 
cbs major events strategy pilson said in 1992 and again in 
1994 the crucial february sweep period will be dominated by the 
olympic games and ratings for both olympics will be part of the 
seasons average for those years 
while the rights for lillehammer went for 57 million more than 
the rights for albertville cbs bid was still 9 million less than 
abc paid for the 1988 winter games at calgary alberta the record 
rights for any olympics is the 401 million nbc is paying for the 
1992 summer games at barcelona spain 
starting with lillehammer the olympics will be held every two 
years alternating the summer and winter games 
of the 300 million for the lillehammer games 30 million will 
go to the us olympic committee under a 1985 agreement with the 
ioc over a sixyear period the usoc will receive 1044 million 
from cbs and nbc for the sale of rights 
the united states is sort of the seat of power for the 
television revenue that the ioc lives by usoc spokesman mike 
moran said wednesday were ecstatic with that its a great boost 
to our budget as well 
the norway olympic organizers will get 140 million and the ioc 
70 million production costs will be covered with the remaining 60

copper futures prices rallied strongly wednesday on new yorks 
commodity exchange amid fears that the shutdown of mexicos largest 
copper mine would put another crimp in the already tight supplies of 
the metal 
on other markets precious metal futures retreated most oil 
futures advanced grains and soybeans were mostly lower and 
livestock and meat futures were mostly higher 
copper futures settled 245 cents to 255 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in september at 12785 a pound the highest 
settlement for a copper contract since may 5 the september contract 
traded as high as 12920 during the session 
the mexican government declared its cananea copper mine bankrupt 
over the weekend and shut it down prompting speculation that the 
mine could be closed for several months 
the mine is capable of producing about 160000 metric tons of 
refined copper a year about 2 percent of the world total 
copper prices have risen sharply this month underpinned by an 
ongoing nationwide copper miners strike in peru a strike at a 
highland valley copper co mine in canada and persistent production 
problems in several other major copperproducing countries 
the market will look at any situation that tells us about 
supply said craig sloane an analyst with smith barney harris 
upham amp co in new york if the situation in mexico means theres 
a potential loss of supply thats important 
gold and silver futures slid lower on the comex partly in 
reaction to the dollars gains against other major currencies 
gold settled 210 to 270 lower with august at 36580 a troy 
ounce silver was 6 cents lower across the board with september at 
5175 a troy ounce 
most oil futures ended higher on the new york mercantile exchange 
after an early selloff tied to the american petroleum institutes 
bearishly construed weekly inventories report 
the api report indicated that us stocks of crude oil rose by 
448 million barrels last week while refinery runs increased 08 
percent 
west texas intermediate crude settled 4 cents lower to 11 cents 
higher with october at 1880 a barrel heating oil was 03 cent 
lower to 15 cent higher with september at 5191 cents a gallon 
unleaded gasoline was 55 cent lower to 35 cent higher with 
september at 5393 cents a gallon 
most grain and soybean futures fell slightly on the chicago board 
of trade reflecting overnight rainfall in midwestern growing areas 
and forecasts for more precipitation in the region 
but the losses were limited by rising worries about the potential 
for freeze damage to crops that were planted later than usual due to 
wet conditions in the spring 
wheat settled 2 cents lower to 1 cents higher with september at 
391 a bushel corn was 2 cents lower to 1 cent higher with 
september at 236 a bushel oats were cent to 1 cents lower with

exchange supported by stronger spot markets pork futures advanced 
ahead of the agriculture departments monthly coldstorage report 
which showed 964 million pounds of pork bellies in cold storage on 
aug 1 the number was close to market expectations 
the report also showed large supplies of frozen ham and turkey 
which should translate into abundant supplies of thanksgiving and 
christmas meats said charles levitt an analyst with shearson 
lehman hutton inc in chicago

an influential farming leader on wednesday called 
for a federal probe of the worlds largest commodity exchange for 
abruptly forcing a big sale of soybean contracts last month a move 
he called the worst blow to market confidence since the soviet grain 
embargo nearly a decade ago 
the emergency action by the chicago board of trade caused a sharp 
drop in july soybean futures prices and undermined farmer trust in 
the exchange which grain producers rely on to set fair prices for 
their crops said illinois farm bureau president john white jr 
my own confidence is at an alltime low he told a telephone 
news conference 
white said he will ask federal regulators next monday to 
investigate events leading up to the exchanges july 11 order 
including whether any board of trade directors may have improperly 
profited from it 
white whose organization represents 330000 illinois farmers 
also sits on the agricultural advisory committee of the commodity 
futures trading commission the federal agency that regulates 
futures trading 
white said the committee will hold a special meeting monday at 
his request to discuss the board of trades order 
board of trade officials have repeatedly denied any conflict of 
interest regarding the action which they say was taken to ensure an 
orderly market and prevent defaults as the july contract expired 
the order was widely perceived as an act aimed at heading off 
what some traders called an attempt by the large italian grain 
company ferruzzi finanziaria spa to corner the us soybean 
market 
the order forced ferruzzi which has denied any cornering 
attempt to slash to 1 million bushels from 23 million bushels the 
amount of soybeans it could have called in for delivery on july 20 
the board of trade said that at the time it issued the 
liquidation order less than 13 million bushels of soybeans were 
available for delivery against the july contract 
white said as many farmers may have profited as lost money from 
the resulting drop in futures prices the real damage he said was 
to the credibility of the board of trade as a free market 
he said no action had so disturbed farmers since president carter 
ordered an embargo on sales of us grain to the soviet union in 
retaliation for the december 1979 soviet invasion of afghanistan 
the embargo sent prices plunging because the soviets were among the 
biggest us grain consumers 
white said the soybean liquidation order was especially damaging 
because it followed by six months the revelation of an fbi 
investigation of suspected futures trading fraud at the board of 
trade and the rival chicago mercantile exchange so far 46 traders 
have been indicted because of that probe 
the news in january of the fbi investigation opened a wound 
white said and here just a few months later we have another 
gash in the wound every time one of these things happens it just 
erodes the credibility of the markets more 
illinois is the nations secondlargest soybeanproducing state 
behind iowa illinois farmers harvested 235 million bushels last 
year about 15 percent of the us crop

oil futures prices recovered from early lows to 
close mostly higher wednesday 
traders said prices were depressed early in the day in response 
to new weekly data from the american petroleum institute that showed 
a rise in us crude oil and gasoline supplies 
on the new york mercantile exchange the october contract for 
west texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us crude rose 11 
cents to finish at 1880 a barrel after trading as low as 1858 
contracts for later delivery were mixed 
among refined products september unleaded gasoline rose 035 
cent to close at 5393 cents a gallon and domestic heating oil for 
september delivery rose 012 cent to 5191 cents a gallon other 
contract months were mixed 
the api report for the week ended aug 18 showed total gasoline 
stocks rose more than 1 million barrels to 22295 million and were 9 
million barrels higher than a year ago the report was released 
after the close of trading on tuesday 
crude stocks rose 44 million barrels to 3352 million for the 
week but were 5 million barrels below last years level 
heating oil inventories declined by 335000 barrels to 407 
million barrels the api said 
the market declined early in reaction to the apis but recovered 
late in the day on short covering said john h oconnell energy 
analyst with refco inc 
analysts said the market had been looking for a decline in 
gasoline inventories as an indication of whether refineries were 
beginning to wind down production wholesale and retail gasoline 
prices have fallen in recent weeks due to excess supply and sluggish 
demand 
wti has remained in the 18 to 19 range despite reports of 
excess production by the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries opec is believed to be producing about 2 million barrels 
a day more than its 195 million quota 
the market has grown accustomed to 216 million or 218 million 
barrels so its already built into prices oconnell said

dunkin donuts inc reported a 34 percent 
drop in thirdquarter earnings wednesday attributing much of the 
decline to costs associated with fighting a hostile takeover bid 
the doughnut maker is the target of a takeover by dd acquisition 
corp a canadian partnership of kingsbridge capital group and cara 
operations ltd 
dunkin donuts said earnings for the three months ended july 29 
totaled 21 million or 24 cents a share on revenue of 303 
million compared with earnings of 32 million or 49 cents a share 
on revenue of 292 million 
the quarterly figures include a pretax charge of nearly 25 
million for professional fees dunkin donuts needed for battling the 
dd acquisition 
last week dd acquisition removed some conditions on its 296 
million hostile bid for dunkin donuts and said it would raise the 
offer to 308 million if it wins a lawsuit challenging the doughnut 
shop chains antitakeover measures 
dunkin donuts has established a series of defenses including an 
employee stock ownership plan that holds about 16 percent of its 
outstanding common shares 
for the nine months ended july 29 dunkin donuts said earnings 
totaled 762 million or 108 a share down 227 percent from the

disappointing secondquarter sales 
prompted eastman kodak co to announce a reorganization plan 
wednesday that will trim 4500 jobs from its worldwide payroll this 
year 
the photo company acknowledged the cuts were 3500 jobs above 
what had been previously forecast kodak employs 145000 people 
worldwide 
kodak will also restructure or divest businesses with annual 
revenues of 125 billion through sale closure or reorganization 
and implement substantial reductions in operating costs 
kodak spokesman paul allen said the company wouldnt reveal which 
of its units would be effected but some have speculated on its 
information systems business segment which include copiers 
microfilm and graphics equipment might be targeted 
for the second quarter of 1989 that segment posted a 144 
million loss 
the company said the moves are being made to raise 1 billion in 
operating cash during 1990 
allen could not provide specifics on where the jobs would be lost 
colby h chandler the companys chairman and chief executive 
officer said we have dealt with adversity in the past but never 
with such broadbased intensity these uncharacteristic actions are 
being carried out with great resolve by the entire management team 
its been a tough decade for the photography industry giant 
which had turned around a sagging bottom line twice in the 1980s 
only to see the same problems increased competition a rising us 
dollar and higher costs return to eat away at profits 
thousands of workers were laid off in 1983 and in 1986 10000 
more were laid off in both instances profits rose substantially 
the next year 
the company also said it would put increasing emphasis on 
incentive compensation and benefits by placing at risk up to 40 
percent of annual management pay 
and in rochester where the companys headquarters and several 
plants are located kodak said it would suspend changes in the 
structure of wages and salaries in 1990 
chandler said the actions invade sacred areas of the company 
but are a needed remedy for the ills that have resulted in 
disappointing secondquarter results 
on aug 1 the company announced earnings fell 85 percent in the 
second quarter down to 60 million or 18 cents a share from a 
record 390 million or 120 a share a year earlier 
for the first half of 1989 earnings fell 60 percent to 260 
million or 80 cents a share from 650 million or 2 a share a 
year earlier 
chandler said units would attack excessive costs by cutting back 
on excessive inventories and by shortening the length of time 
between sales and receipt of payment 
with regard to kodak business groups and support organizations 
reducing their operating costs chandler said nothing is sacred 
including administrative expense distribution costs research and 
development advertising expenses and product costs 
the company also said it would revise the formula for determining 
any future dividends paid to senior management in 1990 and all 
eligible employees in 1991 and beyond 
individual employee wage dividends will range from a minimum of 5 
percent to a maximum of 15 percent of that individuals current 
annual pay depending on corporate performance the current range is 
approximately 9 to 10 percent 
by placing more management compensation at risk and relating 
the wage dividend more directly to corporate financial performance 
we are creating an effective incentive not only to enhance the 
individual financial rewards for all kodak employees but to improve 
the competitive position of the company chandler said

a coalition of state and national 
environmental groups sued exxon corp on wednesday asking the 
courts to order the oil company to continue cleaning up the nations 
worst oil spill throughout the fall and winter 
exxon has announced it intends to cease cleanup operations sept 
15 because the weather in prince william sound and along the 
southern coast of the alaska mainland will be too severe to allow 
work to continue 
over the winter exxon is proposing to leave only a skeletal 
crew stationed in anchorage to monitor the spill said stewart 
elgie an attorney for the sierra club legal defense fund that is 
simply outrageous if exxon insists that it cannot clean up a spill 
after sept 15 maybe we shouldnt allow winter traffic into 
valdez 
other environmentalists complained that exxons cleanup efforts 
to date have been grossly inadequate 
exxon keeps reassuring the public that the cleanup is going 
well that all beaches will be cleaned up soon that the ravages to 
wildlife are almost over that things are well in hand said lauri 
adams another defense fund attorney theyre not 
exxons cleanup efforts have proven largely ineffective and it 
has vacillated on a commitment to further cleanup next spring 
adams said we want the court to make it absolutely clear that 
exxon will be responsible for cleaning up its mess until the area is 
fully restored 
exxon has said only that it will reassess the situation next 
spring and comply with any reasonable request for additional cleanup 
work 
exxon officials declined comment on the suit filed tuesday in 
us district court until it had a chance to review the complaint 
the suit is one of more than 100 filed against exxon in state and 
federal courts since the exxon valdez ran aground march 24 on bligh 
reef in prince william sound spilling 11 million gallons of north 
slope crude 
adams said the environmental groups represented in the lawsuit 
have a membership of more than 25 million

northwest airlines said wednesday it paid a 
650000 federal penalty for 10 problems found during a national 
airline inspection program a reduction from the 139 problems 
investigators initially identified 
the penalty was primarily for inadequate record keeping 
conducting certain minor aircraft repairs before the repair 
procedures were approved in writing by the aircraft manufacturer 
and not meeting a timetable to conduct a particular followup 
inspection northwest said 
none of these issues involves the safe operation of northwest 
aircraft said william slattery northwests executive vice 
president of operations 
the airline said it paid the penalty which the federal aviation 
administration reduced from the 801000 it proposed in february 
last week 
the monthlong inspection leading to the penalty was part of the 
national aviation safety inspection program covering all airlines 
other fines levied so far range from 95 million against eastern 
airlines to 250000 against trans world airlines said northwest 
spokesman kevin whalen 
the original inspection report issued in march 1988 found that 
northwest flew two unairworthy jetliners improperly delayed 
aircraft repairs and let some pilots fly longer than allowed 
faa spokesman mort edelstein said at the time that the agency 
defines unairworthiness as any malfunction in any part of the 
aircraft the problems found with the two planes cited were not 
something that would make an airplane fall out of the sky he said 
the agency also praised northwest for its cooperation and said it 
had a very good safety record 
northwest disputed some findings when the report was issued but 
a month later said it had hired more operations workers revised 
procedures and issued disciplinary notices to some employees by 
that point airline officials said they believed most of the issues 
had been resolved 
slattery said the number of concerns included in the final 
penalty was reduced through discussions and information 
exchanges with the faa 
one of the violations for which northwest was penalized was the 
use of boeing jumbo jets on 8198 flights without a required engine 
bolt inspection 
whalen said northwest had done initial inspections on the bolts 
but failed to meet the timetable for followup inspections no 
problems were found when the followup inspections were later done 
he said 
another problem cited by the faa was unauthorized repairs on flap 
panels and horizontal and vertical stabilizers on two 747s whalen 
said northwest received verbal approval from boeing the 
manufacturer to perform the repairs but failed to get it in writing
