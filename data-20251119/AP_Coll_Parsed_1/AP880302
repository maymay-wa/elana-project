about 200 people staged a candlelight march 
at dartmouth college on wednesday night to protest as racist a 
student newspapers criticism of a black professor 
members of dartmouths afroamerican society and others marched 
down the ivy league schools fraternity row without incident and 
held a moment of silence on the campus green in the protest aimed 
at the dartmouth review 
the demonstration came a day after a federal judge dismissed a 
lawsuit filed against the school by three former students involved 
in a 1986 sledgehammer attack on antiapartheid shanties 
the former students wanted their college records cleared and the 
school barred from intimidating or interfering with the 
dartmouth review and staff members of the conservative student 
weekly 
in 1986 12 students mostly review staffers took sledgehammers 
to symbolic antiapartheid shanties on the campus green the raid 
hours after a service marking the birthday of martin luther king 
jr sparked a semester of turmoil 
racial tensions were revived last week with the reviews 
stinging written attack on a black professor who once sued the 
newspaper for libel 
four review staffers now are charged by the school with 
harassing professor william cole after confronting him in his 
classroom over the article which criticized a music course he 
teaches and his ability as a professor 
critics of the review also plan a larger rally on thursday 
three former review staffers involved in the 1986 incident said 
the shanty attack constituted symbolic speech similar to that 
of the group that erected the shanties to protest dartmouth 
investments in companies doing business in south africa 
on tuesday us district judge shane devine dismissed the 
lawsuit deciding that the students failed to prove that their 
rights were violated 
the suit was filed by deborah stone of keene frank reichel of 
philadelphia teresa polenz of katonah ny and the company that 
publishes the review 
the four review staffers now charged with harassing cole face a 
college disciplinary hearing on tuesday and possible expulsion 
the staffers say are being persecuted for taking strong stands 
on the quality of dartmouth life and education and deny that race 
is a factor the afroamerican society believes the review 
contributes to racial problems at dartmouth

delta air lines suit blaming federal 
agencies for the fiery crash of a delta jet that killed 137 people 
went to trial tuesday with both sides accusing the other of 
negligence 
the delta crew played russian roulette with the lives of their 
passengers said kathlynn fadely a government attorney during 
opening arguments in the complex case 
flight 191 crashed and exploded into flames aug 2 1985 as it 
headed toward a dallasfort worth international airport runway 
during a storm the 137 dead included the driver of a car that was 
hit as the plane plunged downward twentyfive people were injured 
in his opening statement delta attorney john martin said the 
government is to blame arguing that the federal aviation 
administration tower and the national weather sevice failed to warn 
the flight crew of the severity of a weather system at the airport 
he said the delta flight happened to be at the wrong place at 
the wrong time and air traffic control completely broke down at 
dfw when the crash occured 
but fadely said the crew didnt listen to warnings from the 
control tower and flew into the storm system 
a report by the national transportation safety board concluded 
that the crash was caused in part by the pilots decision to fly 
into a wind shear a violent downdraft 
the trial of deltas claims against the government delayed six 
months from its original date seeks to determine who is to blame 
for the crash and may also decide how much can be recovered in 
damages 
the decision also will determine whether the government must pay 
part of 912 million in claims that deltas insurers have paid so 
far in connection with the crash 
in december about 90 lawsuits filed by individuals against 
delta were parceled out from federal court in fort worth to other 
us district courts judge david o belew jr ruled that lawsuits 
filed by passengers families will be sent back to the courts where 
they were originally filed 
about half of those 90 suits have been settled 
the nonjury trial between the airline and the government could 
last up to three months and could include testimony from any of 550 
potential fact and expert witnesses named by the two sides

government leaders concerned about israels 
battered image abroad are arguing increasingly in favor of barring 
journalists from the occupied territories after nearly three months 
of violent protests there 
most of israels 24 cabinet ministers support closing the west 
bank and gaza strip to journalists as long as the unrest persists 
defense minister yitzhak rabin said after attending a cabinet 
session where the issue was raised this week 
closing areas to reporters is done in various countries around 
the world where confrontations of this sort take place said 
prime minister yitzhak shamir 
if it becomes clear that indeed it may limit the damage i 
would be willing to consider it he said 
the executive committee of shamirs rightwing likud bloc voted 
unanimously monday evening that journalists should be banned from 
entering the territories 
west bank army commander maj gen amram mitzna reissued 
instructions to field commanders to close areas to reporters for 
several hours if they believe it is necessary to keep or restore 
calm army officials told the associated press on condition of 
anonymity 
but shamirs government partner foreign minister shimon peres 
of the centrist labor party warned against further restrictions 
if we were to close off the area in my opinion rumors of 
atrocities would be spread around the world that we would not be 
able to refute peres said 
israel is an open society and a free society and even if 
journalists are not always pleasant we have to allow them to 
fulfill their jobs he told reporters tuesday 
other officials oppose closing the territories on the grounds 
that such a move might fuel comparisons between israel and south 
africa an issue about which israel has been particularily 
sensitive 
south african police like israeli army officers have the 
discretion to declare an area closed to media on the spot because 
of unrest journalists then are barred from entry and must leave if 
already there 
cable news networks bureau chief robert wiener said israeli 
soldiers seized videotape last week from a crew which photographed 
a palestinian hanging dead from a pole in the village of qabatiyeh 
after his neighbors lynched him because he was suspected of 
collaborating with the israelis 
the army was criticized afterward for failing to rescue the 
palestinian wiener said the soldiers detained the cnn crew for 
three hours and refused to return the videotape saying it 
contained material damaging to israels security 
the israeli military command said tuesday that our policy is 
to keep the administered territories open to journalists however 
there are exceptions to the rule in isolated incidents where 
certain troublesome areas can be closed 
the latest debate over media access was triggered by a cbs news 
report last week that showed four israeli soldiers beating two 
captive palestinians 
the two were beaten for more than half an hour while a cbs 
cameraman photographed it surreptitiously after the footage was 
broadcast embassies in the united states and europe received many 
complaints and jewish communities abroad also expressed concern 
foreign ministry officials said 
the four soldiers are being investigated the army said the cbs 
office in tel aviv has received anonymous threatening telephone 
calls said cbs bureau chief terry plantinga 
one more incident like the cbs film and the territories will 
be closed to journalists a government official told the ap on 
condition of anonymity 
rabin met monday with a delegation from the foreign press 
association and said most cabinet ministers supported blocking 
journalists from entering the territories but he did not according 
to fpa chairman robert slater 
the voices in favor of closing the territories have become 
much louder than the others slater said it appears more 
likely than ever before that such a step will be taken and the fpa 
is increasingly worried 
two israeli newspapers the leftwing al hamishmar and the 
independent maariv ran editorials tuesday criticizing discussions 
in government circles about closing the territories to journalists 
without media in the territories we may live in a warm 
comfortable bubble next to an erupting volcano al hamishmar 
said but we will be caught by surprise and off guard when the 
lava overflows and threatens our very existence

i am astounded that an intelligent woman such as yourself

follow whatever a member of the royal family does as though it were

chinese authorities have crushed efforts at 
peaceful dissent by the nationalist monks of tibet as swiftly as 
they did last years bold and violent protests by the buddhist holy 
men 
hundreds of monks boycotted the opening of a prayer festival in 
the first major clash of wills since at least 14 people were killed 
in a demonstration oct 1 
by the second day however a major monastery that led the 
boycott yielded to chinese pressure and sent more than 200 monks to 
the festival other monks reported official media had called the 
gathering a sign of normality in the troubled himalayan region 
the monks didnt want to come one holy man whispered at the 
jokhang temple in central lhasa where the prayer festival began 
last thursday and continued this week 
they finally did he said because they were afraid afraid 
that the police will grab them he glanced over his shoulder at 
an approaching plainclothes policeman one of dozens patrolling the 
temple 
fear remains the primary legacy of the three proindependence 
demonstrations led by monks over a twoweek period in september and 
october in lhasa the milehigh tibetan capital whose name means 
holy ground 
the monks dispute chinas claim to sovereignty and want 
independence under the leadership of their exiled godking the 
dalai lama 
chinese authorities have removed all remnants of a police 
station near the jokhang temple that was burned oct 1 by hundreds 
of angry monks and lay tibetans prompting police to fire on the 
crowd a new stone building is being built on the site 
military roadblocks have been removed from outside the three 
main monasteries in the lhasa area sera drepung and ganden and 
police who were billeted inside the monasteries have been 
withdrawn plainclothes chinese agents now keep watch 
all but 15 of the 80 people arrested during the protests have 
been released from jail after repenting according to official 
reports 
the prayer festival called moinlam qenmo has been held at 
jokhang temple every year since 1409 except for the period 196085 
when it was banned by china it gathers monks from the lhasa area 
for eight days of continuous prayer and is one of the the most 
important tibetan buddhist events 
as a precaution beijing sent the highestranking tibetan 
buddhist leader in china the panchen lama to tibet in early 
february to persuade monks to cooperate 
he is regarded as second in prestige only to the dalai lama who 
fled to india nine years after the chinese army entered tibet in 
1950 
the panchen lama said dont demonstrate said a 
20yearold monk at the sera monastery whose whitewashed stone 
buildings cling to a mountainside on the southern fringe of the 
city 
some monks said ok but some were quiet didnt answer he 
said gathering his bloodred robes against a chill wind 
their answer came thursday when fewer than 600 showed up in 
jokhangs silkdraped central courtyard for the opening of the 
prayer festival which attracted more than 1000 monks last year 
those attending quickly spread the word not one monk from 
ganden is here 
a monk from sera said the holy men of ganden stayed away because 
the situation is not good too many chinese are here too many 
police other monks said the same 
sera and drepung sent fewer monks than usual and those who 
remained at drepung conducted their own smallscale prayer 
festival 
were afraid of the police said one boycotter at drepung 
its a very big festival but if we make a small mistake we will 
be in trouble 
in addition to plainclothes officers inside uniformed police 
were stationed every few yards around the whitewashed stone jokhang 
temple which is the size of a city block 
several policemen watched from the roof of a nearby police 
building and others photographed foreign visitors some of the few 
allowed into tibet since the protests last year 
the ganden monks finally arrived quietly thursday night from 
their home on a holy mountain 35 miles west of lhasa their 
presence brought to nearly 800 the number of monks who sat 
crosslegged most of the day in the stone courtyard chanting 
a stream of pilgrims including herdsmen in tattered furs edged 
around the courtyard and spooned offerings of butter into lamps 
that flickered in racks along the wall 
tibetan sources and westerners who have seen previous festivals 
said there were fewer pilgrims as well as monks this year 
one tibetan said lhasas population of 40000 usually doubled 
with the influx of monks and pilgrims during moinlam qenmo no 
count of pilgrims was available because most stay only a few days 
and sleep in the streets 
chinas official media said festival attendance was up from 
1100 monks and pilgrims last year to more than 2300 
dozens of chinese reporters wrote of the event and the official 
news agency xinhua quoted local authorities as saying last 
years riot has not had any impact on the ceremony 
monks who stayed behind at the the ganden monastery which was 
leveled by radicals during the 196676 cultural revolution and is 
only partially restored were not allowed to talk freely to 
visitors 
of more than a dozen monks interviewed at the jokhang temple and 
at sera drepung and smaller monasteries none expressed regret for 
the violence of the protests all were emphatic in disdain for the 
chinese 
chinese are no good a 12yearold novice monk said in 
english but we are not afraid 
a lay tibetan said tibet had its own culture its own 
religion its own border guards how can they say we are one 
country

danny the red leader of student 
revolts in france and west germany in the 1960s jokingly says he 
was never quite as leftist as his nickname implied 
they only meant my hair color said daniel cohnbendit 
referring to his rustcolored hair during an interview in his 
frankfurt office ive always been an anticommunist more of one 
than reagan 
hes now 42 years old and an active member of west germanys 
antiestablishment environmentalist greens party the moderate 
wing and publishes a leftleaning regional magazine in frankfurt 
he ran unsuccessfully for mayor of frankfurt in 1986 in a purely 
symbolic move he said but he is considering seriously running for 
frankfurts city council next year 
cohnbendit has also become an author a collection of 
interviews with other 1960s activists around the world was 
published in west germany in september 
american activists featured in the book include jerry rubin and 
abbie hoffmann leading yippies of the era and the black panther 
activist bobby seale 
the book we loved it so the revolution portrays rubin as 
a yippieturnedyuppie and seale as hoping for commercial success 
as a cookbook author 
his book isnt the only look back west germanys news media 
have carried numerous articles on the tumultuous times of 1968 
cohnbendit said that he has basically remained true to many 
views he had 20 years ago 
i believe that i can still legitimize everything i do from my 
standpoint in 1968 cohnbendit said 
as a moderate member of the greens cohnbendit favors forming 
coalitions with west germanys liberal social democratic party 
which the greens radical wing opposes nor does cohnbendit favor 
a west german withdrawal from nato as some of the radicals do 
west german militarization is more dangerous on its own than 
embedded in a larger context he said thats the lesson of 
world war ii 
cohnbendit has always been a figure who defied traditional 
national political and religious labels he was born in 
montauban france on april 4 1945 the son of german jews who 
fled hitlers persecution in the 1930s 
his parents moved to west germany when cohnbendit was 13 in 
1961 cohnbendit became a west german citizen 
i did it only for pragmatical reasons he said i didnt 
want to serve in the military 
jews whose parents or siblings were persecuted under the nazis 
are by west german law exempted from the countrys mandatory 
military service 
cohnbendit who speaks french and german fluently said he 
doesnt assign his national identify to either country as a french 
citizen he would have been subject to the military draft in france 
im just me im not german or french he added i dont 
need a national definition 
cohnbendits views have led to occasional flaps with 
frankfurts jewish community in a highly publicized dispute in 
1985 he publicly supported the city playhouse in presenting a play 
by rainer werner fassbinder which many jews wanted banned as 
antisemitic 
in the feb 18 issue of his magazine pflasterstrand 
cohnbendit described himself as a convinced antizionist 
in the interview he said he favored the existence of israel but 
also a separate palestinian state and a limitation of zionism 
tenants housing rights and terrorist amnesty are among other 
issues that have made cohnbendit a household name 
but the era that propelled the activist to world fame the 
1960s is a topic cohnbendit said he no longer wants to talk a lot 
about 
in his book originally published in france he writes that 
people have used him like a machine that turns back time 
cohnbendit captured world attention as a university student in 
france at a time when youth protests were rocking the globe 
he was a spokesman for students whose demands included greater 
social equality and an end to war in vietnam and elsewhere danny 
the red became the leader of paris tumultuous and occasionally 
bloody student revolts 
we had the will to change our lives to participate in history 
right at the moment it happened cohnbendit writes of his 
revolutionary days 
in may 1968 french authorities expelled him from the country on 
grounds of disturbing the peace the ban was not officially lifted 
until 1978cohnbendit wrote in his book 
cohnbendit lives with his girl friend but he said he doesnt 
intend to get married

elevated rates of colon cancer in the nations 
northeast and northcentral region may be due to an acid rain 
pollutant that absorbs sunlight impairing the bodys ability to 
make vitamin d reseachers say 
preliminary studies have suggested that vitamin d and calcium 
combine to lower the risk of colon cancer 
according to the new theory sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere 
absorbs ultraviolet rays from the sun that trigger the production 
of vitamin d in the skin researchers said at a press conference 
tuesday 
sulfur dioxide produced by the burning of highsulfur coal is 
a principal ingredient of acid rain 
a similar effect was observed in london more than 350 years ago 
said the originators of the new theory said cedric garland of the 
university of california san diego and his brother frank of the 
naval health research center in san diego 
around 1629 londoners began burning highsulfur coal from 
newcastle they said within a short time children began 
exhibiting the leg malformations characteristic of rickets a 
vitamin d deficiency disease 
vitamin d aids the absorption of calcium and calcium and 
vitamin d together appear to lower the risk of colon cancer the 
garlands said 
dr martin lipkin of new yorks memorial sloankettering cancer 
center said the garlands theory is a legitimate theory and 
work is in progress to clarify the role of vitamin d and calcium in 
colon cancer 
were looking into how many individuals might be benefited by 
calcium and the degree to which they might be said lipkin two 
years ago he showed that calcium supplements could change the 
growth of cells in the colons of people at high risk of colon 
cancer and might therefore lower colon cancer risk 
an authority on diet and cancer regina ziegler of the national 
cancer institute in bethesda md cautioned that because this was 
only a theory people should not begin taking vitamin d supplements 
to protect against colon cancer 
people have trouble distinguishing theories from proven 
effects she said with evidence such as this you certainly 
dont want to start taking large doses of vitamin d vitamin d in 
high doses can be hazardous to your health 
the garlands explanation is not the only theory to explain why 
colon cancer rates are highest in the northcentral and 
northeastern states 
other people have hypothesized that increased exercise 
increased fruit and vegetable intake and differences in drinking 
water may lead to the lower incidence in the south said ziegler 
the garlands cautioned that people should not spend more time in 
the sun to increase their vitamin d production because exposure to 
sunlight increases the risk of skin cancer they suggested instead 
that people eat foods high in vitamin d which include anchovies 
sardines salmon and tuna milk is fortified with vitamin d but 
most other dairy products are not they said 
breast cancer also occurs at an increased rate in the areas 
where colon cancer is highest and the garlands suggested that 
breast cancer too might be indirectly related to sulfur dioxide 
in the atmosphere that theory is more speculative than the colon 
cancer theory frank garland said

attacked in a hotel elevator 
the hosts made no mention of the various problems during the 
television show 
the late departures of two contestants both from minnesota 
opened a spot for julie nelson 20 of minneapolis but the 
lateness meant she arrived about a week after the other contestants

advantage she said before the pageant opened having so short 
a time to pull myself together getting all my clothes together 
finding a fur coat dropping everything when all the other girls 
had months to prepare it shows off my abilities

threefourths of the democratic party leaders 
who will be national convention delegates are not yet supporting 
any of the presidential candidates as the initial round of 
primaries and caucuses draws to a close an associated press survey 
found 
since late last year the candidates together have attracted 
support that will add up to fewer than three dozen votes at the 
convention according to the survey in which hundreds of the 
partys super delegates were contacted 
and despite the months of debates and the weeks of primaries and 
caucuses many of the automatic delegates who include democratic 
national committee members democratic governors and others are 
not closing in on which candidate they plan to suppport 
the more i hear the more uncommitted i become said ruth 
moss a democratic national committee member from maine 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis the winner of the new 
hampshire primary leads the pack with commitments totaling just 
315 votes at the convention by comparison the runaway favorite 
so far is uncommitted a category in which delegates with 
24765 votes at the convention place themselves the ap survey 
found 
missouri rep richard gephardt winner of the iowa caucuses is 
next behind dukakis with commitments amounting to 21 votes at the 
convention followed by jesse jackson with 1955 tennessee sen 
albert gore with 1655 and illinois sen paul simon with 155 
only gary hart who has acknowledged his chances of winning the 
democratic nomination are remote at best has not received a 
commitment from any of the delegates contacted by the ap 
when added to delegates won by the candidates in the primaries 
and caucuses so far that brings the total to 635 for dukakis 47 
for gephardt 355 for simon 2755 for jackson 1655 for gore and 
none for hart a total of 25865 are counted as uncommitted 
the survey conducted during the last two weeks of february 
indicates that the iowa caucuses and the new hampshire primary 
along with nearly weekly debates have made little impression on 
democratic party leaders the survey found that just 3525 more 
convention votes have been won by the candidates since a similar ap 
survey late last year 
im still not convinced that iowa and new hampshire are 
representative of the cross section of the united states said 
new mexico party chairman sam pick 
call over to the grammar school and talk to any firstgrader 
he knows just as much as i do said jt rose a dnc member from 
arkansas its up for grabs im just sitting back enjoying it 
thats not what the gephardt campaign had hoped to hear after 
the victory in iowa 
i think we expected a bigger bounce said jude barry a 
gephardt campaign aide who works on delegate selection we would 
like people to commit sooner but were encouraged by what theyre 
telling us 
rick hutcheson a gore campaign aide involved in delegate 
selection said he is not surprised to see the super delegates 
holding back 
these are political people they want to wait and see what the 
voters in the primaries decide and then they will exercise their 
judgment he said 
however barry said party leaders may feel some incentive to 
begin committing themselves after next weeks super tuesday 
contests when nearly onethird of the partys delegates are at 
stake 
at that point i think that people start looking at the 
calendar barry said people who come in after new york which 
holds an april 19 primary are really going to be seen as coming 
late to the party 
the democratic party allots 362 convention votes to members of 
its national committee some of whom will cast only fractions of 
votes an additional 25 votes are given to governors of states and 
territories and five to former leaders including former president 
carter and walter mondale a former vice president who was the 
partys nominee in 1984 
delegates representing 35275 convention votes were contacted 
for the ap survey in february 
an additional 253 delegate slots will be awarded to democratic 
members of congress in april 
the republican party makes no such provision for automatic 
delegates awarding all the seats to its national convention 
through the primaries and caucuses 
in all 4162 delegates are to attend the democratic national 
convention in atlanta july 1821 and 2082 are needed to win the 
presidential nomination

that masterpiece of music comedy and nostalgic 
americana the music man suffered from a lack of strong clear 
singing as the new york city opera opened its annual season of 
musical comedy 
the acting directing dancing and scenery were firstrate 
tuesday at the new york state theater but some of the verve and 
excitement of those glorious fastpaced songs was lost during the 
first act as the singing did not carry well over the orchestra 
the problem was alleviated after intermission perhaps it was 
the shift to mostly ballads or perhaps the level of the singers 
microphones had been boosted but act 2 was the rich delightful 
experience one hopes the whole show will be for the rest of its run 
through april 10 
bob gunton debuting with the company as harold hill had the 
most trouble a broadway performer he moves as gracefully as a 
dancer and sold his 76 trombones to the folks of river city 
with more charm than brass but his light voice didnt project in 
act 1s ya got trouble and the sadder but wiser girl 
the female chorus also was difficult to understand in 
pickalittle talkalittle and the townspeople blurred the 
words of joyful anticipation in the wells fargo wagon david 
burdick smaller than most boys who play the lisping winthrop also 
is no belter and didnt get his words across the footlights 
opera singers learn to project their voices and they came out 
best making themselves understood and never sounding too operatic 
for the music leigh munro was a pretty and sympathetic marian the 
librarian muriel costagreenspon a natural leader of ladies as the 
mayors wife richard mckee as the pompous mayor james billings as 
harold hills cohort brooks almy as marians mother and william 
ledbetter as the constable 
the dancing chorus was splendid with choreography by marcia 
milgrom dodge making her company debut theres a generous amount 
of dancing in the library in rehearsals for a social in the 
center of town several times david jenkins set of business 
buildings pulled back to give the dancers room andrew marlays 
costumes for 1912 were glorious from feathered hats to peppermint 
suits for the four school board members who squabbled every minute 
they werent harmonizing lida rose 
donald pippin a broadway conductor was conducting at the new 
york city opera for the first time it was wonderful to hear the 
overture played by a big orchestra less wonderful later when words 
were covered 
the late meredith willson wrote the book music and lyrics he 
and frank lacey wrote the plot which came out as a memory of 
bygone innocent days of mason city iowa where willson grew up 
one wonderful song follows another goodnight my someone 
my white knight till there was you and the audience 
greeted each gem like a reunion with a longlost best friend

the reagan administration is trying to soften 
earlier accusations that the federal reserves tight monetary 
policies are nudging the country toward a recession 
in separate forums a trio of reagan administration officials 
said tuesday they believe the nations central bank is doing a good 
job of supplying money to the economy 
just a few weeks ago administration officials worried about the 
prospect of a recession during an election year had been 
complaining that the fed wasnt pumping enough new money into the 
economy 
on tuesday however treasury secretary james a baker iii told 
the senate appropriations committee that he has absolutely no 
disagreement with the feds monetary policy 
speaking at the national press club budget director james c 
miller iii said there seems to be a little bit of easing and i 
welcome that 
and at a meeting of the national association of business 
economists beryl sprinkel president reagans chief economic 
adviser said the administration is supportive of present policy 
as well as the plans for the future the fed revealed last week 
the suddenly conciliatory administration tone follows a sharp 
counterattack by fed chairman alan greenspan who had responded to 
the administration complaints with some pointed remarks of his own 
greenspan said that a looser monetary policy could spark higher 
inflation he also said pressure by the administration could push 
the fed into asserting its independence by doing the opposite of 
what the white house wanted 
the administration began pulling back from its criticisms last 
week sprinkel said he supports the feds policies so far in 1988 
and reagan said at his news conference last wednesday that he had 
confidence in greenspan whom he appointed to the fed job last 
summer 
the central bank can usually increase the flow of credit by 
easing interest rates 
baker told the senators tuesday that when it comes to finding 
the balance between keeping interest rates low and avoiding 
inflation i think the fed is doing that and doing a very good 
job of that 
in other testimony baker played down concerns raised by 
senators about the growth of the national debt 
projections by the congressional budget office cited at the 
hearing are that the national debt could reach 4 trillion by 
1993 the debt was below 1 trillion when reagan took office in 
1981 
there are some risks in the growth of debt of this magnitude 
but i think they tend to be overstated baker said i think to 
some extent thats a consequence of the fact that were moving into 
1988 which happens to be an election year 
baker also said however that an increase in the debt is not 
a development about which this administration nor the congress can 
be very happy

the head of comedie francaise actor and director 
jean le poulain died tuesday night he was 63 
le poulain died at his home on the avenue de lopera near the 
famed theater he had administered for the past two years no cause 
of death was given 
it is the theater of yesterday and today which cannot 
tonight hide its tears culture minister francois leotard said 
in a statement the curtain of the comedie francaise has fallen 
on a great voice 
le poulain had been a member of the comedie francaise since 1979 
and was placed in charge in 1986 
during his 40year career in the theater he acted in and 
directed dozens of plays from the classics to contemporary pieces 
with his disappearance french theater loses one of its most 
brilliant servants an inheritor of the tradition of the comedie 
francaise that which runs from moliere to jacques charron 
leotards statement said 
le poulain was born in marseille sept 12 1924 but spent much 
of his childhood in cambodia where his father worked 
returning to france at the age of 19 he studied at the paris 
conservatory which he left in 1949 with the first prize in acting 
in 1952 he founded his own theater company directing a variety 
of plays from shakespeare to jean anouilh 
le poulain was known to the public as both a buffoon and a 
tragedien but he received the most acclaim for his portrayals in 
the plays of moliere such as tartuffe and le bourgeois 
gentilhomme 
after taking over the comedie francaise as the candidate 
proposed by president francois mitterrand le poulain neither acted 
nor directed he said he concentrated his time to running the 
institution i am the protector of its soul

alarmed by a rise in drug production and the 
violence that goes with it the reagan administration is warning 
colombia and mexico that their antinarcotics programs will receive 
close scrutiny in the coming months 
they were singled out tuesday in the presidents annual drug 
report to congress as countries that are making some efforts to 
stop narcotics traffic but need to improve 
they were not classed with iran afghanistan syria and a new 
entry on the list panama as countries whose support for drug 
trafficking makes them ineligible for us aid 
ann wrobleski assistant secretary of state for international 
narcotics matters said the message to colombia and mexico is we 
believe that youre cooperating and you deserve certification but 
we want to put an asterisk next to it and we will be watching 
closely in 1988 
in the annual report to congress the president certifies 
whether countries are doing enough to battle narcotics to deserve 
us assistance and other benefits 
panama made the list this year because its military chief and de 
facto leader manuel antonio noriega has been indicted by a us 
grand jury on drug conspiracy charges panama is not a major 
narcotics producing country but according to wrobleski panama 
has been a drug traffickers and money launderers haven 
putting panama on the list will have no immediate impact 
because the country had lost us aid even before noriegas 
indictment but tuesdays action does permit further steps by the 
administration including some tariffs and tightening of customs 
rules that could hurt panamanian exports 
sen alfonse damato rny said he would introduce 
legislation to go further by imposing a trade embargo on panama 
the good news is that panama is on the list said sen 
lawton chiles dfla on the other hand mexico and colombia 
arent i think we have to continue to apply pressure against 
these countries 
the presidents report faulted colombia for not breaking a 
cartel of drug dealers and for not fully backing us requests for 
extradition of drug suspects wanted in the united states at the 
same time it noted that whatever efforts colombia made in the 
fight were at great peril to its officials 
it said mexico is the largest single source of heroin and 
marijuana entering the united states and officials there need to 
do more to eradicate opium poppies and deal with allegations of 
official corruption 
three countries said to be doing little to stop narcotics 
escaped inclusion on the list due to special national security 
concerns the report said 
laos was kept off the list out of concern that a condemnation 
would harm us efforts to win laotian help in accounting for more 
than 500 us servicemen listed as missing there after the vietnam 
war wrobleski said laos doesnt get us aid anyway 
paraguay escaped decertification because officials think it 
would be counterproductive at a time the united states is trying 
to woo that country toward democracy 
lebanon retained its certification because there isnt much the 
central government can do to stop trafficking and production in 
regions of the country it does not control 
in its estimates of worldwide drug production the report 
predicted that coca leaf output would increase from a high of 
211400 metric tons in 1987 to as much as 213650 metric tons this 
year 
marijuana production will drop from a high of 17625 metric tons 
to 10100 tons and opium output will drop from a high of 3017 
metric tons to 2992 metric tons in 1988 the report said a metric 
ton equals 2200 pounds 
ms wrobleski said one of the gloomiest outlooks is for control 
of coca leaf growth especially in peru and colombia the origin of 
a vast majority of the worlds cocaine 
bolivia has made some strides in eradicating the crop by sending 
work crews into the production areas to kill the plants thats 
impossible in peru and colombia she said because the growers 
control the regions in peru for example 27 eradication workers 
have been killed she said

presidential candidates are turning to 
increasingly aggressive television advertising in the week before 
the highstakes super tuesday contests in 20 states and american 
samoa 
vice president george bush is taking some heat on the 
irancontra affair from sen bob dole sen albert gore jr is 
moving onto the populist turf claimed thus far by rep richard 
gephardt and gephardt is continuing his broadside against 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
gephardt dmo also is running an ad in which rep marvin 
leath of texas praises him for standing with us for lower taxes 
for an oil import fee to make america strong for a tough trade 
bill to stand up for american workers leath says gore and 
dukakis oppose all three 
gore spokesman arlie schardt said tuesday it had not been 
decided yet whether the tennessee senator would release his own 
cache of hardhitting ads 
were prepared for any needs that may arise schardt said 
were considering what other messages we may still want to convey 
over the next few days 
gore did mount an indirect tv challenge to gephardt on tuesday 
when he started running three new ads promoting populist themes 
similar to the ones gephardt has adopted 
one new ad depicts gore as a fighter against polluters 
pricefixers and big corporations exactly the type of 
antiestablishment image gephardt has tried to cultivate 
the other two ads feature gore talking to groups of texas oil 
workers in one spot he says corporations need to invest in america 
and create jobs at home while in the other he tells the workers 
that its time to put people back to work in the united states 
and have the rigs in libya and iran stand idle for a change 
the blame foreigners message is strikingly similar to one of 
gephardts strongest ads the hyundai spot that helped him win 
the iowa caucuses and is now being used across the super tuesday 
states 
in that ad the congressman criticizes south korea for putting 
high import tariffs on us autos and asks how many hyundais the 
koreans could sell here at 48000 apiece 
gephardt has also revived a highly effective south dakota spot 
now retooled for super tuesday alleging that dukakis is a 
taxraiser and mocking his suggestion that depressed iowa farmers 
recover by growing belgian endive 
the dukakis campaign was planning to take aim at gephardts 
newly acquired reputation as an antiestablishment crusader and 
possibly run an ad featuring a swirling weathervane to raise 
questions about his consistency 
leslie dach dukakiss communications director said no final 
decisions had been made about which ads would be used where and 
when 
but he said the general thrust of the spots is that gephardt 
says he is leading the little guys fight but his campaign is 
financed and supported by the big guys his biggest contributors 
are americas biggest corporations he has failed to show a set of 
principles or a set of values that give a rudder to his policies 
he said dukakis was also prepared to counterattack against 
gore if necessary 
dukakis has commercials on the air in texas and florida the 
biggest super tuesday states plus maryland his ad campaign was to 
expand this week into washington state oklahoma arkansas 
alabama georgia and north carolina aides said 
dole rkan went on the air tuesday in north carolina and 
south carolina with an ad contrasting his and bushs positions on a 
number of issues including the irancontra affair 
the narrator says dole opposed selling arms to iran bush 
supported the armsforhostages deal the ad also accuses bush of 
waffling on taxes taking a soft line on the ussoviet arms 
control treaty and opposing a textile bill popular in several 
southern states 
another dole spot running in florida depicts a man walking 
through snow but leaving no footprints dole campaign manager bill 
brock said the message is that bush has held all these big jobs 
yet left no mark 
the vice president in west palm beach fla called the 
footprints commercial terribly ineffective 
bushs campaign refused to disclose any details of how or 
whether it planned to respond but the vice president said were 
not going to sit out there unprotected i think i have every 
right to set the record straight 
bush used a negative ad against dole in new hampshire last 
month but it ran for only a couple of days before the primary 
as the super tuesday tv campaign grew more heated rep jack 
kemp rny questioned pat robertsons judgment in radio ads 
throughout south carolina which holds a gop primary on saturday 
the kemp ad asks if the former television evangelist has the 
qualifications and the judgment to be our next president and 
cites some of his more unusual positions such as a 1979 suggestion 
that public schools be eliminated robertson later changed his mind 
about that 
in addition to negative ads the candidates are using more 
traditional biographical spots and political testimonials among 
them former sen barry goldwater endorses bush former house 
speaker thomas p oneill of massachusetts praises dukakis and 
rep claude pepper an elderly florida legislator with enormous 
clout among senior citizens speaks kindly of gephardt 
at least two candidates gore and dukakis are using 
spanishlanguage ads in texas dukakis does the talking himself 
the governor is fluent in spanish so it seemed like the thing to 
do said tom cosgrove dukakiss texas campaign director 
there are 712 republican delegates and 1307 democratic 
delegates up for grabs on super tuesday march 8 television is the 
candidates major tool in seeking to win them

bob dole assailed george bush on the irancontra affair in a 
tough new television commercial tuesday and richard gephardt used 
an advertisement to attack democratic rivals michael dukakis and 
albert gore jr as the presidential campaign spread across the 
south one week before super tuesday 
bush defeated dole tuesday night in vermonts nonbinding gop 
presidential primary and dukakis won the states democratic 
contest with jesse jackson running second 
this win gives us three out of three in new england and im 
hopeful we can be as successful this saturday in south carolina and 
on super tuesday bush said 
mary ellen grupp said the dole campaign was very pleased with 
doles strong showing and would use the primary results to 
build up for the gop caucuses in april 
former president carter the last democrat to occupy the white 
house said he thought the chances were 5050 that no democrat 
would arrive at the party nominating convention with enough 
delegates to claim the nomination 
bush sounded confident that nothing of the sort would happen in 
the republican race bush in a strong position in virtually all of 
the southern states that will vote next week said im convinced 
that whoever wins super tuesday will be the next president 
bush was further buoyed by the results of a washington postabc 
news poll released tuesday showing him with a nearly 3to1 lead 
over dole among republicans likely to vote super tuesday dukakis 
and jackson were battling for the democratic lead 
gop hopeful pat robertson meanwhile said he intends to drop 
his 35 million libel suit against former rep pete mccloskey 
rather than go to trial on super tuesday 
robertson has accused mccloskey of defaming him in a letter 
contending that the former television evangelist used the influence 
of his father the late sen a willis robertson to avoid combat 
duty in the korean war but robertson may not be able to walk away 
from the suit without paying mccloskeys legal fees 
with nearly all the precincts reporting in vermonts beauty 
contest primary bush had 49 percent to doles 39 percent 
robertson had 5 percent and rep jack kemp 34 percent 
dukakis rolled to a solid win with 56 percent jackson had 27 
percent gephardt 8 percent paul simon 6 percent and gary hart 4 
percent gore was not on the ballot 
we have found the common chord that is linking the american 
people whether they are in iowa or maine or new hampshire or 
mississippi jackson said about his impressive showing 
the vermont contest did not involve allocating any delegates to 
the republican and democratic national convention 
in contrast super tuesday on march 8 involves 1307 delegates 
in democratic primaries and caucuses in 20 states and 712 delegates 
in 17 contests on the republican side 
the broad sweep of that days contests means candidates must 
place greater stress than ever before on costly television 
commercials gone are the days of retail politics consisting 
of six stops in iowa or new hampshire in a single day 
the new campaign style features chartered jets trips to two or 
three regions of two or three different states and a heavy dose 
of commercials scattered across several states 
in his new advertisement dole says that bush has refused to say 
he would veto an increase in income tax rates that he wont 
support a textile import bill and that he supported the arms for 
hostages deal in the irancontra affair 
thats precisely what he did he supported the sale of arms 
to iran the kansas senator said as he campaigned in durham nc 
bush campaigned in florida where he said of doles irancontra 
comments i support the president i have nothing to say about 
doles charges nothing at all instead he touted his own role 
in the decision to invade grenada with us troops in 1983 as well 
as the part he has played in the administrations antidrug program 
if bush is heavily favored in most republican super tuesday 
states the democratic contest shapes up as a struggle among 
massachusetts gov dukakis missouri rep gephardt tennessee sen 
albert gore jr and jesse jackson 
ironically it was a democratic idea to develop a regional 
southern primary in the hopes that it would give a candidate from 
the deep south a springboard to the nomination 
it hasnt worked that way and carter who invited gephardt to 
his home in plains ga said he is no longer sure whether the idea 
is good or bad 
he added my hope is that out of the primary and caucus season 
will come a clear winner im not sure thats a likelihood now 
gephardt said he traveled to carters home in rural georgia 
not to enhance my prospects but to greet an old friend 
at the same time he began running a new commercial in which 
texas rep marvin leath says gephardt stood with us for lower 
taxes for an oil import fee to make american strong for a tough 
new trade bill to stand up for american workers 
on all these issues gore and dukakis were opposed to us he 
says 
there was no immediate response from either gore or dukakis 
among the other democrats jackson was in washington where he 
met with officials from south africa about the recent arrests of 
black leaders in that country 
sen paul simon largely skipping southern states campaigned in 
seattle for support in the washington caucuses 
rep jack kemp struggling to survive in the republican race 
said if either bush dole or robertson wins the gop nomination 
the reagan revolution is over 
robertson under pressure for several comments he has made in 
the past two weeks said a transcript of 1967 senate subcommittee 
testimony supports his belief that there are nuclear missiles in 
cuba he quoted testimony by a state department official who said a 
cuban refugee told him of the missiles 
this is documented evidence robertson said

an assembly began an 11day session 
tuesday to elect a new president and vice president 
the session opened with a 35page report by president suharto on 
the affairs of state since he was reelected in 1983 for a fourth 
fiveyear term 
the 1000member assembly is expected to reelect suharto a 
66yearold former general and the sole candidate for president 
the peoples consultative assembly dominated by the presidents 
governing golkar party is a special body summoned every five years 
the post of vice president though largely ceremonial has been 
the subject of intense speculation in recent weeks because it is 
likely to be filled by a figure considered to be suhartos chosen 
successor 
two people have been viewed as possible candidates for the vice 
presidency state secretary sudharmono 61 golkar chairman and 
try sutrisno 52 newly appointed armed forces commander who has 
served four years as a suharto aide 
in his report to the assembly suharto said his administration 
in the last five years has had to overcome an economic recession 
and a sharp drop in oil prices a major source of foreign exchange 
in indonesia 
suharto also said indonesias economic growth rate was estimated 
to reach an average of 38 percent annually in the current 
fiveyear economic plan ending march 1989 the original target was 
set at 5 percent 
in foreign affairs the president reaffirmed indonesias 
position that it will not normalize relations with china until 
beijing pledges it will not provide support to communist guerrillas 
in the region including indonesia 
jakarta suspended relations with beijing in 1967 after accusing 
it of complicity in the abortive communist coup attempt of 1965 
however trade relations between the two nations have been 
restored since the signing of a memorandum of understanding in july 
1985

texas will seek a court order to stop the 
shipment of florida citrus to texas and other citrusproducing 
states officials say 
the move was prompted by a judges order tuesday that overturned 
a texas ban on the florida fruit 
texas imposed the ban last month after a federal rule took 
effect allowing the shipment of florida citrus that meets certain 
standards to other citrusproducing states 
the new rule lifted a 3yearold federal quarantine on florida 
citrus that was prompted by discovery of the citrus canker disease 
in that state 
us district judge james nowlin said he overturned the ban 
because the federal regulation takes precedence over the state rule 
texas agriculture officials said the ban was needed to protect 
texas 65 millionayear citrus industry from canker

when chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson 
steps before the house of commons on march 15 he is expected to 
unveil one of the rarest of british commodities a budget surplus 
the expectation is so real that already there is widespread talk 
of a massive tax cut and also widespread criticism of the 
governments reputed plans for the extra money 
the budget on march 15 should be the most momentous of 
britains postwar history the economist magazine said 
anything could happen in the next two weeks and the budget may 
turn out very different from what is now forecast 
but for the moment analysts are assuming a tax cut is in the 
works and the governments critics are attacking the budget as a 
gift to the rich at the expense of the poor 
last autumn the government announced its planned expenditures of 
278 billion for the fiscal year ending march 31 1989 and the 
spring budget day is when it discloses how it will raise the money 
for the first time in almost 20 years prime minister margaret 
thatchers conservative government might produce a budget surplus 
for the current fiscal year which ends march 31 said a treasury 
spokesman who wasnt identified in accordance with british custom 
the government expects to outperform its most recent forecast 
of a deficit of 177 billion which was down from a previously 
forecast deficit of 71 billion the spokesman said 
it will probably turn out to be a surplus said diane coyoe 
economist for the private forecasting firm dri europe 
very definitely a surplus said anthony thomas an economist 
at the london investment firm kleinwort grieveson ltd 
the surplus will be 2 billion to 5 billion the economists 
estimated 
if they are right the surplus will have resulted from the 
governments tight grip on spending its buoyant tax receipts and 
proceeds from its giant and continuing privatization program of 
selling off to the public billions of dollars worth of stateowned 
companies 
the surplus has sparked speculation that the government will 
slash its top income tax rate of 60 percent to 50 percent or even 
lower in what would be the biggest cut in almost 10 years 
the cut which applies to people earning more than 72900 
annually would be effective in the fiscal year beginning april 1 
thomas said there was much speculation that lawson would cut it 
below 50 percent we suspect he will want to do those cuts over 
an extended time period it will seem like too much of a giveaway 
otherwise 
but the times of london said lawson might slash the rate to as 
low as 35 percent adding the chancellor has been stung by 
criticisms from his own party that president reagans tax reforms 
in the us have overtaken britain with a simplified system 
in her first budget in june 1979 mrs thatcher cut the top 
rate from 83 percent to 60 percent it has remained unchanged since 
in the united states the top federal income tax rate is 33 
percent this year although for most individuals the maximum rate 
is 28 percent 
lawson also is expected to cut the lowest tax rate which 
applies to income up to 31600 to 25 percent from 27 percent 
that rate stood at 33 percent in 1979 
the expected tax cuts part of mrs thatchers longterm 
sweeping reform of the tax system would be highly controversial 
in a country where the welfare state prevails despite the prime 
ministers capitalist revolution 
the government is bracing itself for the charge that it 
will be introducing a rich mans budget the observer newspaper 
wrote 
critics of mrs thatchers tight spending policies already have 
raised a furor demanding that surplus money go to the national 
health service rather than toward tax cuts 
in february nurses staged a oneday walkout to protest the 
state of the health service which has 700000 people waiting for 
surgery at state hospitals 
other critics fear that cuts could spur consumer spending enough 
to ignite inflation and force up interest rates 
but mrs thatchers supporters say her fiscal policies have 
helped boost britains nowstrong economy 
the budget proposals must be approved by parliament where they 
are assured passage because of the conservative partys 102seat 
majority in the 650seat house of commons

republican presidential candidate pat 
robertson said he would use the military to help stem the flow of 
illegal drugs into the united states and would order airplanes 
suspected of carrying drugs to be shot down 
if one of those drug planes is flying without giving 
identification coming into this country i wouldnt hesitate to 
give orders to shoot him down the former television evangelist 
said at a rally tuesday 
i believe we have played games long enough with drugs 
robertson said i dont think we are being as aggressive as we 
should 
robertson who has tapped a vein of anticommunist sentiment 
among cubanamericans as he campaigns around florida also accused 
cuban president fidel castro of involvement in drug trafficking 
earlier robertson cited 21yearold secondhand testimony 
before a senate subcommittee as evidence that the soviet union has 
intermediaterange missiles based in cuba 
he called for closing what he calls a cuban loophole in the 
ussoviet intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty which now is 
awaiting ratification by the senate 
if the inf treaty is ratified without addressing this matter 
then i think it will be virtually treasonous robertson said at a 
news conference i do not feel there is any way that they can 
sweep this thing under the rug i am not going to permit them to do 
it 
several us officials said tuesday the cuban military has some 
surfacetosurface missiles in its inventory but none has a 
nuclear warhead and none could reach the united states even if it 
did 
robertson quoted 1967 testimony by paul bethel a state 
department official from miami who said cuban refugees had told 
him of seeing missiles and one of the refugees identified only as 
mr apud who swore cuban soldiers let him know about missiles 
aimed at washington before he left in 1966 
neither man testified he had personally seen the missiles the 
transcript indicates 
the testimony was given to the judiciary subcommittee to 
investigate the administration of the internal security act and 
other internal security laws robertson read portions of it to 
supporters tuesday at a breakfast in fort lauderdale and during a 
rally the night before in miami 
ive been accused of bringing funny facts robertson told 
the fort lauderdale gathering ladies and gentlemen the clear 
eyewitness sworn testimony of witnesses before a senate judiciary 
committee is not funny facts this is documented evidence 
robertsons assertion that there are missiles based in cuba has 
been denied by the white house congressional defense experts and 
castro who told nbc on monday that robertson should go and see a 
doctor really or a psychiatrist because this is pure madness 
several defense and administration officials were asked tuesday 
about robertsons claim the officials speaking on condition of 
anonymity because they did not want to become involved in the 
presidential race said cuba has about five dozen frog4 and frog7 
battlefield missiles dating from the 1960s 
the frog7 when originally introduced by the soviets could 
carry either a conventional or nuclear warhead but were 
confident no nuclear warheads ever went to cuba for that missile 
and it doesnt have any range anyway said one source who 
requested anonymity 
according to the reference book janes weapon systems the 
frog7 has a range of only about 43 miles or half the distance 
between cuba and florida moreover the rocket has no guidance 
system to direct it to a specific target 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said last month that cuba 
has been under extensive surveillance since the 1962 missile crisis 
and there is no evidence any other nuclear weaponry had ever 
been deployed there by the soviet union 
in the subcommittee transcript apud said he was told by cuban 
soldiers he had known for many years that the missiles were 
nicknamed washington left washington right and 
washington central

a congressional study is painting a dismal 
environmental picture of vital streamside areas on federal property 
across the west 
tens of thousands of miles of these riparian areas have been 
degraded by poor livestock grazing practices on land leased to 
ranchers by the bureau of land management according to the general 
accounting office the investigative wing of congress 
james duffus a gao official says the damaged land would start 
repairing itself if the bureau either would ban cattle from 
degraded streamsides or limit the amount of grazing there 
but that solution is being made difficult because bureau leaders 
appear to be siding with opposition from many ranchers who pay 
belowmarket rates to graze cattle on the taxpayers land he told 
a house hearing tuesday 
streamside areas are important in the arid west because they 
help raise water tables collect sediment increase the 
availability of forage dissipate the energy of flood waters and 
serve as fish and wildlife habitats said duffus the gaos 
associate director for resources community and economic 
development 
it has taken decades of abuse to produce the level of riparian 
area degradation that currently exists he told the interior 
national parks and public lands subcommittee most riparian areas 
managed by the bureau are in degraded condition largely as a result 
of poorly managed livestock grazing 
duffus said that while the bureau does not know the extent of 
the damage tens of thousands of stream miles on federal 
rangelands remain in degraded condition 
duffus said two bureau assessments found that 80 percent of the 
12000 miles of streamside areas in idaho need better management 
and that 90 percent of 5000 miles in colorado were rated in poor 
or fair condition 
not only has the bureau reduced its ranks of wildlife and 
fisheries biologists since 1981 many remaining personnel 
responsible for riparian areas dont believe the bureau is serious 
about improving the condition of the streamside areas according to 
duffus 
these staff widely believe that if their proposed actions for 
restoring riparian areas are opposed by the permitted ranchers 
their managers will not support them he said 
many bureau staff recounted specific instances where their 
riparian management efforts were specifically undercut by bureau 
headquarters or local management direction after permitted ranches 
raised objections duffus said 
subcommittee chairman bruce vento dminn distributed copies 
of a 1986 bureau headquarters memo telling field personnel that 
streamside area management requires the full support and 
cooperation of the permittee or lessee 
pointing to the memo vento asked whether ranchers using bureau 
land for cattle grazing are experts in environmental restoration 
i wouldnt look to them for any expertise duffus replied 
tim locke a bureau spokesman gave no immediate response when 
asked by the associated press to comment on duffus report

the music industry promises to find a new way 
to thwart home taping with digital recorders now that its proposed 
electronic antitaping device has been declared ineffective by the 
national bureau of standards 
the bureaus report released tuesday dealt a blow to the 
recording industrys campaign to prevent digital audio tape or 
dat recorders from reaching the domestic market 
the recorders now manufactured by japan and other foreign 
makers can copy compact disc recordings with virtually no loss in 
sound quality the us recording industry fears that the machines 
will lead to mass copying that would devastate the compact disc and 
record markets and so far has managed to keep the devices off the 
us market 
but rep robert w kastenmeier dwis chairman of a house 
judiciary subcommittee that handles copyright issues said the 
results of the bureaus study which he requested last year 
shows that congress should stop trying to prevent us sales of dat 
recorders 
kastenmeier said the report appears to doom an industrybacked 
bill that would require equipping dat recorders with scanning 
devices intended to prevent copying of specially coded recordings 
the bill sponsored by rep henry waxman dcalif also would 
prohibit the manufacture or sale of any device designed to bypass 
the scanner 
the bureau an agency of the commerce department said that the 
scanning device was unreliable and easily bypassed and that it 
damaged the sound quality of recordings 
because the report was conclusive about the ineffectiveness of 
blocking devices it is even more desirable that the dat 
controversy be resolved by the industries involved rather than by 
congressional imposition of a solution kastenmeier said 
kastenmeier said in an interview that as a result of the bureau 
of standards report i think it highly unlikely that the waxman 
bill will succeed 
us manufacturers voluntarily blocked introduction of dat units 
on the domestic market until congress resolved the home taping 
issue but the selfimposed ban has recently shown signs of 
crumbling under pressure from foreign manufacturers and demand from 
us recording enthusiasts 
kastenmeier said an alternative to a congressional solution 
might be payment of recording artists out of proceeds from sales of 
dat units or from an endowment fund created by the recording 
industry 
jason berman president of the recording industry association of 
america said the industry accepts the study results but intends to 
find a new technological solution to home taping which he said 
costs the recording companies 15 billion in lost sales annually 
working together with the hardware manufacturers we are 
certain to find an acceptable technological solution berman said 
meanwhile recording industry officials promised to sue any 
manufacturer that tries to sell the machines in the united states 
before the copying issue is resolved either legislatively or 
through industry negotiations 
but gary shapiro of the home recording rights coalition said 
there is no reason at this point why manufacturers should not be 
selling digital recorders in the united states 
the coalition has been fighting antitaping efforts as an 
infringement on the rights of consumers to make home recordings of 
records tapes and compact discs for their private use 
the scanning device was designed to detect notches or tiny 
bands of frequencies removed from the audio signal of protected 
recordings and interrupt taping of copies with intervals of 
silence 
the bureau said its series of laboratory tests showed that 
notched material was recorded anyway in about half of the sound 
tracks studied 
advocates of the antitaping device claimed that the notches did 
not affect sound quality but the bureau said its study showed that 
the systems encoder alters the original electrical signal 
resulting in a discernible difference between notched and 
unnotched recordings 
also the bureau said the copy prevention system can be 
bypassed easily it said its engineers designed and built several 
electronic circuits to circumvent the system in five different ways 
the circuits are simple and easy to construct and cost about 
100 the bureau said

attorney general edwin meese iiis investment 
manager turned a 40000 profit for him under an arrangement that 
may have involved financial favors or gifts to the attorney 
general says a senator 
the investment manager w franklyn chinn wasnt investing 
mr meeses money so much as he was assigning profits and losses 
to the accounts of mr meese and his other clients at his own 
discretion sen carl levin dmich said tuesday 
chinn now under indictment in the wedtech scandal turned a 
profit of nearly 40000 for meese on a 50000 investment in just 
23 oneday trades of brandnew stock issues over an 18month span 
meese established a limited blind partnership with chinns company 
and the attorney general says that under the arrangement he knew 
nothing about chinns stock trading activity 
the democratic majority staff of the senate subcommittee on 
oversight of government management found that stock purchases by 
chinn which later appeared in meeses account were initially made 
without identifying the customer in whose name the stock would 
eventually be recorded the purchases were assigned by chinn to the 
accounts he managed after the profit or loss was known 
the report said that in one instance chinn bought and sold 
5000 shares of a new stock issue in oliver stores inc worth 
30000 on feb 11 1986 it wasnt until the next day however 
that chinn instructed imperial trust co that 2000 of the shares 
were to be recorded for meeses account the transaction gave meese 
a profit of more than 1700 
in seven of the 23 stock trades chinn spent substantially more 
money on behalf of his corporations limited blind partnership with 
meese than meese had invested in the account the subcommittee 
staff found the sums ranged from 5000 to 140000 
chinn exceeded the account balances for his other customers as 
well said the subcommittee staff he avoided the appearance that 
he had exceeded the account balance by directing that his stock 
purchases be recorded as if they had been made in smaller lots any 
one of which would not exceed the account balance 
because he did not allocate winners and losers to his clients 
accounts until after the fact he was effectively able to assign 
greater benefits to some including apparently mr meese on 
numerous occasions levin said in a statement this procedure 
again raises questions about possible financial favors or gifts 
levin asked the office of government ethics in a letter for a 
formal finding on whether meese complied with federal regulations 
governing gifts and loans to public officials 
levin also sent a copy of the letter to the securities and 
exchange commission to investigate possible violations of 
regulations prohibiting brokers from exceeding account balances and 
regulations governing the conduct by investment advisers 
meese had no knowledge of chinns stock trading activity and i 
dont think meese should be held responsible said one of the 
attorney generals lawyers nathan lewin 
this blind partnership was set up to be sure that he had no 
knowledge of how things were being done 
lewin dismissed suggestions that meese should have reported the 
amount over the account balances as gifts saying there were a 
number of losing transactions as well as profitable transactions 
meese made a profit on 18 of the trades and lost money on five 
according to the majority subcommittee staff on sept 4 1986 
chinn had 730000 in five of his customers accounts at imperial 
trust co but on that day bought 66 million in sears roebuck 
stock for them which subsequently was reflected as 34 separate 
transactions and sales 
chinn a former director of scandalplagued wedtech corp was 
introduced to the attorney general in 1985 by longtime meese friend 
e robert wallach chinn and wallach are now under indictment for 
racketeering fraud and conspiracy in an alleged scheme to extract 
payments from the bronx ny defense contractor in order to 
influence meese and other federal officials wallach and chinn have 
pleaded innocent 
meese has been under criminal investigation by independent 
counsel james mckay since last may 11 for his involvement with 
wedtech meese acknowledges interceding on behalf of the company 
when he was white house counselor to ensure that the firm got a 
fair hearing from the army in its effort to win a 32 million 
nobid enginebuilding contract the company eventually got the 
work 
sources familiar with mckays probe say one aspect of the 
investigation has been an examination of chinns stock trading to 
determine whether chinn may have given meese preferential treatment 
over other customers 
meese may be found to have benefited from a very subtle 
bribe if preferential treatment were found and were determined to 
be a reward for official action one knowledgeable law enforcement 
source said in december 
one of chinns lawyers penny cooper said the questions 
addressed by levins subcommittee are exactly the same material 
the independent counsel went over for months and they found no 
wrongdoing there was no wrongdoing she said that chinn did no 
better for meese than any other client 
the subcommittee staff didnt reach any conclusions on whether 
meese received preferential treatment

many motorists who wear seat belts are still 
exposing themselves to serious injury by wearing them improperly 
according to a federal study that says women children and 
motorists over 50 are most likely to put themselves at risk 
the national transportation safety board raised questions 
tuesday about the way some belt users wear the safety devices after 
examining 167 accidents in which at least one occupant was belted 
twentyone percent of the motorists wearing belts had too much 
slack in the shoulder harnesses and 7 percent of the occupants 
often children wore belts that were improperly routed behind the 
back or under an arm 
thirtyone states have laws requiring use of safety belts but 
ntsb chairman jim burnett said we have a lot of misuse and that 
problem has to be tackled 
overall the safety board said lapshoulder belts provide 
excellent protection with 80 percent of the belted occupants 
suffering minor or no injuries but the study suggested the results 
could have been even better were it not for improper wearing of 
belts 
the ntsb study was not a random sample and therefore does not 
necessarily translate into similar percentages for all motorists 
said lynne smith who was involved in writing of the report but 
she added the data are consistent with previous findings of 
widespread misuse 
for example the report cited an earlier insurance industry 
study of maryland motorists indicating that belts are worn too 
loosely about onefourth of the time 
examples of misuse with tragic consequences included a headon 
collision and an accident in which a car struck a tree according 
to the safety board 
in the headon crash a passenger who had loosened her shoulder 
belt significantly died of massive injuries while the driver who 
had worn his belt snugly walked away from the crash with moderate 
injuries said suzanne stack an ntsb staff researcher 
in the other crash the driver who had worn his belt properly 
escaped with minor injuries when his car struck a tree but the 
passenger whose shoulder belt was routed under her arm was killed 
from extensive injuries 
the board also cited examples of people suffering extensive 
injuries fatal ones in a case involving a 7yearold boy when 
belts were used while seats were in the reclining position in some 
cases the combination of the belt and the reclining seat may create 
new dangers the report suggested 
the fourmember safety board urged the national highway traffic 
safety administration to require that safety belts meet standards 
for the maximum amount of slack allowed or require that the belt 
systems be equipped with a pretension device that 
automatically pulls a belt tight a split second before a crash 
the safety board questioned the widespread use among us 
carmakers of a belt design that allows a person to pull the belt 
out to its full length without it automatically retracting most 
foreign manufacturers use another design which automatically keeps 
the belt snug against the occupant but which has been criticized 
as being less comfortable and therefore less likely to be used 
the safety board said there is evidence indicating drivers aged 
50 years or older and female occupants are the most likely to 
misuse belts especially wearing them too loosely ms smith said 
that generally slack equal to no more than the width of a fist 
should be allowed in the shoulder belt 
a particularly high misuse of belts was found among children 
onethird had part of the belts behind the back or under an arm 
such misuse seriously degrades the protective capabilities 
of the lapshoulder belt reducing it to a laponly belt with 
inferior crash protection the safety board said 
a number of auto safety pamphlets including two distributed by 
the nhtsa and one by the american automobile association have 
advised parents to place the shoulder belt behind a child if the 
harness crosses the neck or face 
the safety board does not agree the ntsb report said 
there is little evidence that small children or short adults are 
likely to be harmed by the shoulder portion of a belt 
the board called for the highway safety agency to revise its 
brochures 
nhtsa which issues auto safety regulations was reviewing the 
ntsb report said spokeswoman betsy tyson

an agriculture department labor expert says 
farmers probably will begin feeling the impact of a new federal 
immigration law next year 
robert coltrane of the departments economic research service 
said the immigration reform and control act of 1986 exempts many 
agricultural employers from penalties for knowingly hiring illegal 
aliens but that exemption will expire dec 1 
the real test is likely to come after that time when 
penalties can be imposed and immigration investigators may take a 
more aggressive approach to agriculture coltrane said 
coltrane whose analysis is scheduled for the march issue of 
farmline magazine said farm employers may be relying heavily on 
the special agricultural worker program or saw which allows 
temporary legal resident status for foreign workers who formerly 
helped in the us production of designated perishable crops 
producers of those crops are exempted from the laws penalties 
until dec 1 as defined by usda regulations those crops include 
not only fruits and vegetables but also wheat sugarbeets and a 
number of other commodities 
coltrane said the main crops not qualifying as saw commodities 
are cotton sugarcane hay sod forage and silage seed intended 
solely for seed use flax millet and sorghum livestock producers 
also are not covered by the saw provision 
the pool of saw workers has been growing although it is still 
relatively small compared with total agricultural labor needs 
coltrane said in the first eight months of signup june 1987 
through january around 240000 workers filed saw applications the 
first step to temporary legal residency and under certain 
conditions eventual us citizenship 
but only about 2 percent of the saw applications through 
december were filed from outside the united states coltrane said 
this means that temporary rules relaxing border restrictions to 
bring in farm workers have not had much of an impact moreover 
there is no requirement that saw workers stay with farm jobs 
once farm workers receive their work authorization card they 
can work wherever they want and in whatever industry they want 
he said agricultural employers have no assurance that the 
workers will stay in agriculture

the soviet union has used up virtually all of 
its authorization to buy us wheat at subsidized prices with 
additional purchases totaling 500000 metric tons for delivery this 
year 
agriculture department officials said tuesday that the latest 
sales equal to about 183 million bushels were handled by 
continental grain co 100000 tons cargill inc 375000 tons 
and mitsui grain corp 25000 tons 
at recent prices averaging 275 per bushel the wheat would 
have a farm value of about 50 million 
more than 68 million tons of subsidized wheat has been sold to 
the soviet union under the departments export enhancement program 
or eep for delivery in the year that began last oct 1 
george j pope acting general sales manager for the 
departments foreign agricultural service said that only 200 tons 
of wheat are still available to the soviet union under current eep 
authorization there has been no official indication that a new 
line of subsidy may be approved 
under eep private exporters are given surplus commodities owned 
by the departments commodity credit corp so they can sell a 
foreign buyer wheat or other authorized commodity at competitive 
world prices 
pope said the subsidies or bonuses averaged 27 per ton on the 
latest sales or about 74 cents per bushel the subsidies for the 
soviet union have been available only for wheat 
the sales also are part of the grain the soviet union is 
committed to buy during the fifth and final year of a longterm 
agreement which calls for the annual purchase of at least 9 
million tons of us grain the pact expires sept 30 
according to the agreement the annual purchases include a 
minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn the soviets have 
the option of buying the remaining 1 million tons as wheat corn or 
soybeans with every ton of beans counting as two tons of grain 
up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain equivalent 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of wheat or soybeans or 39 bushels of corn 
in addition 262 million tons of us corn 813300 tons of 
soybeans and 13 million tons of soybean meal have been bought by 
the soviets for delivery this year

when the first musher charges north in 
the 16th annual iditarod trail sled dog race on saturday 
organizers already will have their own victory over alaskas 
economic bust and the races 773000 debt 
fiftyfive mushers have signed up for the rugged 1100mile 
contest billed as the last great race on earth last year 63 
teams signed up the year before 73 
this years field includes fourtime champion rick swenson 
twotime winner susan butcher whose 50000 winners check last 
year bounced 1983 champion rick mackey and 16 rookies mushers 
from austria canada france and great britain also have signed up 
the race is named after the iditarod trail an old gold rush and 
mail route to nome this years race takes mushers over the tougher 
northern route where temperatures although moderate of late can 
reach minus 50 degrees 
starting in downtown anchorage on truckedin snow racers must 
cross over the alaska range traverse frozen tundra and climb the 
timbered kuskokwim mountains to reach the yukon river at ruby an 
old gold mining community 
the mushers trek south on the yukon and turn toward the coast at 
kaltag at unalakleet the teams turn north and run along the 
windblown coast and sea ice to nomes front street 
the trail became part of alaskas legends in 1925 when 20 
mushers pushed for 127 hours to relay diphtheria serum 674 miles 
from nenana to nome to save the city from an epidemic 
after the check issued butcher bounced a special audit in april 
found the race was 773000 in debt said rosemary phillips the 
races executive director 
i suppose the economy had a lot to do with it she said 
the iditarod was caught up in the collapse more was spent than 
was taken in 
oil prices peaked at about 30 a barrel in 1985 but plunged to 
less than 10 by july 1986 about 85 percent of the states 
revenues come from royalties and taxes paid by the oil industry 
when oil prices fell the states economy heavily dependent on 
state expenditures went into the abyss 
bankruptcies and foreclosures soared property values tumbled 
jobs dried up and businesses closed but the iditarod which relies 
on private contributions did not get the message 
we had a hard time seeing our problem said iditarod trail 
committee president lavon barve there was a budget and the 
money was spent for that budget but the money didnt come in 
joe redington an iditarod board member and race founder said 
the race was spending money for things it did not need we spent 
a lot of money and didnt pay no bills he said it was spent 
unwisely we had too many employees we had top salaries and all 
the benefits we had better insurance than general motors 
when the races financial problems became known officials cut 
the staff by twothirds we had 34 to start with the rest took 
pay cuts we cut all benefits phillips said 
joanne potts race coordinator since 1983 said about 700 
volunteers such as pilots and ham radio operators worked for the 
race last year she expected about 1200 this year 
while cutting expenses the race also has found new sponsors a 
footwear manufacturers fouryear sponsorship could bring in more 
than 500000 phillips said a dog food manufacturer agreed to a 
oneyear contract worth more than 25000 a television network has 
offered 15000 for coverage rights 
merchandising the iditarod name on everything from beer steins 
to buttons makes up as much as 40 percent of the races revenues 
she said 
as of right now our outstanding debts are about 220000 i 
think its fantastic phillips said this years purse will be at 
least 125000 still the largest purse in sled dog racing she 
said 
potts said she never doubted the race would continue 
there were people last june who didnt think we were going to 
have a race this year she said we fooled them were going to 
have one its just bigger than all the little problems we had last 
year

a treaty to eliminate most tariff barriers 
between the united states and canada leaves disputes in the auto 
industry unresolved witnesses at a house hearing said 
lee kadrich director of governmental affairs and international 
trade with the automotive parts and accessories association said 
tuesday the treaty was a lopsided agreement that sanctions 
longstanding canadian protectionism 
he told the trade subcommittee of the house ways and means 
committee that the treaty would put us parts makers at the mercy 
of foreign competitors 
automotive products which account for about onethird of the 
trade between the united states and canada have been governed for 
more than 20 years by the auto pact which gives dutyfree 
treatment to some parts and vehicles moving between the two 
countries 
critics of the freetrade agreement however charge that 
canadian efforts to attract manufacturing have given their makers 
an unfair advantage under the auto pact and the agreement leaves 
that advantage in place 
our current bilateral auto trade is skewed to canadas 
benefit by a number of tradedistorting practices resulting in 
part from canadas domesticcontent requirements and duty rebates 
on some auto parts said rep sander levin a southfield mich 
democrat 
steve beckman international economist for the united auto 
workers union said that the treaty by retaining canadian 
production incentives for honda toyota and hyundai provides a 
subsidy of canadian production much of which will be sold in the 
us 
an exception to that overall assessment was given by thomas 
hanna of the motor vehicle manufacturers association which 
represents auto manufacturers 
hanna said the treaty would create the worlds largest 
freetrade zone and takes on and resolves most of the trouble 
spots which were developing in the bilateral auto trade 
he said concerns that the treaty would provide expanded entry 
for japanese and korean manufacturers were unfounded because the 
north american auto industry already has excess manufacturing 
capacity 
it makes no sense for the canadian government to lure more 
foreign auto investment especially when much of the production 
would be headed for the us market he said

the national transportation safety board says 
it was unable to determine what caused the crash in 1986 of a 
helicopter scheduled to carry the entourage of jordans king 
hussein in which four people died 
investigators concluded that poor flying conditions including 
fog that caused limited visibility were factors in the june 6 
1986 crash in sutton mass but the official probable cause was 
listed as undetermined 
dennis jones the lead investigator said tuesday the massive 
disintegration of the helicopter hindered the inquiry were only 
as good as the evidence he said 
theres no evidence to point to anything that we can 
concretely say triggered the crash ntsb spokesman michael benson 
said 
investigators originally concentrated on a mysterious piece of 
wire that raised questions of sabotage but that turned out to be 
part of an electrical testing instrument 
the investigation later focused on what looked like a frayed 
cable that controlled the tail rotor which provides stability to 
the craft but the final report issued monday said no 
preimpact part failure or malfunction was found 
four employees of sikorsky aircraft were killed when the 
sevenseat sikorskybuilt s76b helicopter went down on a trip 
from hanscom field in bedford mass back to sikorsky headquarters 
in stratford conn 
the helicopter was one of four sikorsky had provided to hussein 
during his new england visit but the king his family and aides 
drove from massachusetts to the westover school in middlebury 
conn for the graduation of his daughter princess zeim because 
of the bad weather her twin sister princess aisha graduated from 
the dana hall school in wellesley mass later that weekend 
sikorsky spokesman marty moore said the company supports the 
boards findings 
benson said the crash illustrates the need for smaller aircraft 
to carry black boxes devices that would tape the crews 
conversations and possibly provide clues 
the safety board has been pushing the federal aviation 
administration to require cockpit voice recorders in smaller craft 
including helicopters that seat at least six passengers the faa is 
considering the proposed rules change

scientists in two laboratories say they have 
confirmed a report from researchers that a new kind of 
superconducting material loses all resistance to electricity at a 
record high temperature 
researchers at the university of arkansas say the material 
showed zero resistance at about minus 269 degrees fahrenheit more 
than 20 degrees above previous widely accepted reports for stable 
superconducting compounds 
paul chu of the university of houston said he had confirmed the 
arkansas results finding zero resistance at minus 272 degrees he 
said his sample also expelled an applied magnetic field a hallmark 
of superconductivity called the meissner effect 
the results also have been confirmed by researchers at 
international business machines corp said ibm spokesman jerry 
present he said he could not release details 
superconductivity is the ability to carry current without 
resistance scientists are trying to make materials that become 
superconducting at as high a temperature as possible to make them 
practical for uses in highspeed computers bullet trains and other 
applications 
higher temperatures than the arkansas mark have been reported in 
the press but some have not been confirmed in other laboratories 
and others refer to the temperature at which a sample shows initial 
signs of isolated pockets of superconductivity rather than 
superconducting pathways along its entire length 
the new compound showed initial signs of superconductivity at 
minus 238 degrees said university of arkansas researcher allen 
hermann who did the research with zhenghi sheng 
that is slightly higher than the mark of about minus 243 degrees 
recently reported for superconductors that include the element 
bismuth rather than a socalled rare earth 
the arkansas compound uses the element thallium rather than 
bismuth or rare earth other ingredients are calcium barium 
copper and oxygen 
the results were announced to the press and at a scientific 
meeting last month but were not widely reported they have been 
accepted for publication in the british journal nature hermann 
said in a telephone interview 
chu said lessons from the thallium and bismuth compounds will 
help in developing materials with still higher temperatures he 
also noted that the thallium compound showed zero resistance above 
100 degrees on the kelvin scale giving a psychological boost for 
hopes of higher temperatures 
the 100degree kelvin mark corresponds to about minus 280 
degrees fahrenheit 
thallium is not quite practical for applications outside the 
laboratory because it is toxic and in limited supply he said 
hermann said he thinks thallium and bismuth eventually will be 
abandoned in favor of new materials with higher temperatures and 
better characteristics for applications 
brian schwartz physics professor at brooklyn college said the 
arkansas work is encouraging because it shows that substituting 
elements in superconducting materials may lead to higher 
temperatures

a federal court ruling expected today in 
boston could determine whether new regulations will go into effect 
this week that cut off funds to family planning centers which 
advocate or perform abortions 
the months of debate continued tuesday as nabers cabaniss 
deputy assistant secretary at the department of health and human 
services defended the administration proposals before members of a 
family planning group challenging the regulations in court 
cabaniss told the gathering that the new title x regulations 
were not an attack on the family planning industry but a 
reaffirmation of the administrations antiabortion policy 
addressing the annual meeting of the national family planning 
and reproductive health association cabaniss said the new 
regulations due to go into effect tomorrow would withhold funding 
to centers in which abortion is a method of family planning 
we support family planning but not abortion on demand she 
said urging the group to work together to separate family 
planning from abortion 
cabaniss said the regulations require socalled 
nondirective counseling which offers pregnant women 
information about their medical options with the exception of 
abortion 
if the facility also performs abortions to keep title x funding 
for its other programs the clinic must maintain separate personnel 
separate accounting procedures and provide different and clearly 
defined waiting and treatment rooms for each type of patient 
among participants speaking out against the new title x rules 
was dorothy p mann executive director of the family planning 
council of southeast pennsylvania in philadelphia she told 
cabaniss we are not fools women wont come to programs that 
cant help them 
these regulations will destroy the family planning programs 
and in doing so the lives of millions of poor women 
since the regulations were published in the federal register 
last month two injunctions have been granted in courts in denver 
and new york the denver suit was brought by planned parenthood 
federation of america while the new york court action was brought 
by the american civil liberties union 
the denver ruling covers all planned parenthood centers and the 
new york ruling covers clinics in that state 
a third suit filed by nfprha in us district court in boston 
seeks an injunction to protect its publicly funded member clinics 
and other family planning centers not covered by the other 
injunctions 
scott swirling the associations executive director said the 
suit was filed to eliminate regulations he asserted are illegal 
violate the intent of congress violate medical ethics and could 
harm the health care of almost 5 million poor women we serve 
if the boston court agrees the three preliminary injunctions 
would stop the regulations from going into effect and give the 
court time to look at the regulations and issue or deny a permanent 
injunction cabaniss said 
in this case we would expect some permanent ruling in march 
she said adding that the cases will end up in the supreme court 
if the us district court in boston denies the injunction hhs 
must decide whether to wait or implement the regulations affecting 
those clinics not covered in the planned parenthood or new york 
state suits 
as head of the office of population affairs cabaniss 
administers the 140 million title x program which funds about 
4000 family planning centers according to hhs statistics 85 
percent of the patients served by these centers are lowincome and 
onethird of them are adolescents

work could begin this week on a 23 million 
elevator that will allow visitors to view what is believed to be 
the perch from which president john f kennedy was shot 
the contract to build the elevator was awarded monday by the 
dallas county commission 
the dallas county historical foundation struggled to fund the 
exhibit for the past 11 years and plans to raise 15 million more 
from private sources for additional renovations on the sixth floor 
of the former texas schoolbook depository 
as sad as it is it is the most important historical site in 
dallas said lindalyn adams president of foundation 
the project includes construction of a sixstory access tower 
that will house the elevator and a onestory groundlevel exhibit 
hall adjacent to the building 
the exhibit to be called the sixth floor is expected to 
attract an estimated 300000 to 500000 visitors annually 
the warren commission determined that on nov 22 1963 lee 
harvey oswald fired a highpowered rifle at kennedys motorcade 
from the sixth floor of what is now the dallas county 
administration building where he worked 
tony callaway a partner in the architectural firm of hendrick 
callaway said construction could be completed by november but 
foundation officials say they are unlikely to schedule the 
exhibits opening for nov 22 the 25th anniversary of kennedys 
assassination 
we think it would be inappropriate ms adams said

about 30 of israels leading 
entertainers staged a singin to protest the governments handling 
of 12 weeks of arab riots in the west bank and gaza strip 
shalom shalom we are making peace there will be peace we 
are together beyond fear they sang swaying together on a stage 
in front of tel avivs city hall 
about 3000 israelis sang along in hebrew to the tune of we 
are the world 
the protesters also heard newly released peace songs and carried 
placards that said we wont be a nation of bullies and enough 
of occupation 
the demonstration was held in kings of israel plaza site of a 
protest by more than 100000 israelis in 1982 that helped lead to 
israels pullout from lebanon 
tuesdays protest was sponsored by red line peace activists who 
are staging a fourday march from rosh haniqra on the lebanon 
border to jerusalem where about 1500 marchers are expected today 
three months of arab rioting against the 20year israeli 
occupation of their homelands has produced a crop of new protest 
songs the first since the end of israels threeyear occupation of 
lebanon in 1985 
among the stars was rita fayrouz the iranianborn singer who 
recently released a song for children the lyrics say he was 
born of mother war but deep in his heart he just wanted to be a 
poet 
a number of participants expressed disappointment at the 
relatively small turnout but rami kleinstein a rock musician and 
ms fayrouzs husband predicted change is going to happen 
one of the most critical songs was by si hyman 26 who wrote 
shooting and crying to protest an incident last month in which 
israeli soldiers buried alive four arabs in kfar salem the victims 
were rescued by relatives 
ms hyman sang 
shooting and crying burning and laughing 
when did we learn to bury alive 
shooting and crying burning and laughing 
when did we forget that we also had children killed 
in an interview after the performance she said she was shocked 
that this was done by the jewish people who lived through the 
holocaust i said to myself weve got to stop it

japan and western europe were rebuilt with 
americas help after world war ii and should now repay the united 
states by picking up a larger share of nato and japanese defense 
costs according to a wellknown historian 
the comments tuesday by yale historian paul kennedy echoed other 
calls by legislators and former government officials as president 
reagan flew to europe for a twoday meeting of the 16nation north 
atlantic treaty organization 
kennedy author of the rise and fall of great nations told 
the senate budget committee that calls for increased burden 
sharing are part of the effort to find a way out of evergrowing 
defense expenditures 
some american allies are now richer per capita than the usa 
kennedy said adding that japan and western europe ought to bear 
a larger share of the defense burden 
sen lawton chiles dfla chairman of the panel agreed 
saying it seems to me we are draining our power trying to do too 
much our adversaries are happy to see us try our allies havent 
done as much as they can to help 
defense secretary frank c carlucci also agreed at least in part 
with kennedy at a house budget committee hearing earlier tuesday 
he said i quite agree with the thesis that our allies need to do 
more but he added that i dont think it is very useful to 
simply berate the europeans on this 
carlucci told the house panel that he doesnt think nato will 
increase spending in response to complaints by congress 
rep william gray dpa chairman of the committee complained 
about what he called unequal sharing by nato countries our 
allies in nato are not doing in my estimation enough for their 
own defense he said 
the united states is spending about 6 percent of its gross 
national product on defense while no other countries in nato are 
above 3 percent gray said 
rep richard durbin rill said the average japanese citizen 
spends about 100 a year in taxes for defense while the average 
american spends 1200 
we need to make every effort to get our allies to do more 
carlucci agreed but he added that they do more than is generally 
recognized he cited a statistic that nato would supply 90 
percent of the ground troops that would be used to halt a soviet 
nonnuclear attack 
carlucci said americas defense budget is 57 percent of the 
nations gnp not 6 percent and he added that us defense budgets 
generally have stayed even or declined in recent years 
nato has long set a target for each member to increase spending 
by 3 percent a year after inflation and most nations dont meet 
that target carlucci said the united states hasnt met the 3 
percent target for at least four years he added 
carlucci and adm william crowe jr chairman of the joint 
chiefs of staff said nato needs to improve its conventional 
defenses in the wake of the treaty banning mediumrange atomic 
missiles from europe 
crowe detailed natos shortcomings in nonnuclear weapons but 
added surely the prospect of having to fight 16 nations at once 
remains a sobering one for the kremlin

when congress convened last july for 
the first time in 15 years it vowed to build democracy from the 
ruins of authoritarian rule seven months later critics say it has 
been slow to address fundamental issues 
the new constitution drafted under president corazon aquino 
reestablished the bicameral usstyle congress former president 
ferdinand marcos abolished congress in 1972 and replaced it with a 
singlechamber rubberstamp assembly 
members of the senate and house of representatives were elected 
in may 1987 and congress convened last july 27 since then more 
than 6000 bills have been submitted in the 23member senate and 
the 202member house 
as of the end of february only 13 had been enacted into law 
the bills are not an indication of quality at all said rep 
bonifacio gillego he said most were for local projects such as 
roads schools and hospitals 
meanwhile legislation on major national issues such as land 
reform has been bogged down by special interests and 
organizational problems in the two chambers 
commentators and congressional sources disagree on why congress 
has not been more productive 
some complain that traditional politicians spend too much time 
on peripheral topics or delivering lengthy speeches while 
ignoring complex issues 
its part of the turmoil of transition part of growing up 
said opposition leader wilson gamboa who was defeated for the 
senate last may vital issues of legislation that should have 
farreaching effects on the condition of the people have not been 
addressed 
some congressmen defend the slow pace saying it is better to 
take time with complicated issues than rush legislation which 
members may later regret 
we cannot afford to hurry that much and regret it later 
said sen juan ponce enrile were not just talking about our few 
interests but a complex situation 
sen ernesto maceda chairman of the senate defense committee 
also defended the slow pace 
is that what they want faster laws but probably imperfect 
laws maceda said in an interview were slower but probably 
all sides are heard 
last month eight senators formed a conscience bloc and 
publicly criticized senate president jovito salonga for delays in 
bringing legislation to the floor 
one of the eight sen alberto romulo said economic and social 
issues have not been given the importance they deserve he 
added our performance will be assessed by how much we have done 
to improve the quality of life of our people 
salonga promised to speed up senate proceedings and reduce the 
time allotted for speeches 
some congressmen also complain that the two chambers lack 
sufficient staff and resources to provide members with detailed 
information and advice on legislation 
many commentators view the current debate on land reform as a 
test case of congress ability to legislate controversial issues 
with farreaching impact on national life 
last july mrs aquino decreed a nationwide land redistribution 
program but left virtually all the difficult decisions such as 
compensation and retention limits to congress 
she gave the lawmakers 90 days to approve the legislation and 
house speaker ramon mitra boasted his chamber would meet the 
deadline within 30 days but neither the house nor the senate has 
approved a land reform bill in part because of opposition by 
landlord members 
there has been considerable delay almost intentional on the 
part of the landlords to avoid the passage of an agrarian reform 
bill said gillego chairman of the houses land reform committee

the justice department should appeal a pair of 
conflicting rulings on random drug testing for civilian government 
employees in order to resolve the issue says a judge responsible 
for one of the decisions 
us district judge thomas f hogan on tuesday ordered the army 
to stop random checks of 9400 of its civilian employees for drug 
use because the tests are an unreasonable search prohibited by the 
constitution 
it is with some regret that the court removes what might be a 
powerful weapon from the nations arsenal in the campaign against 
illegal drug use but the values represented by the constitution 
and fourth amendment are transcendent hogan ruled 
hogan said random checks could not be justified by safety 
concerns because the urine test used by the army did not indicate 
whether an employee was using drugs on the job 
the ruling was made on three challenges brought by public 
employees unions to the armys 1986 order directing random drug 
tests of civilians in sensitive jobs the cases involved unions 
representing civilians at ft stewart ga the sharp army depot in 
lathrop calif and guards at aberdeen proving ground md 
noting that another federal judge in washington last year upheld 
random drug testing of nearly 30000 transportation department 
employees hogan invited the justice department to appeal his 
decision 
he also suggested that the us circuit court of appeals here 
consolidate the two cases for a single review of a question of 
exceptional importance 
based on hogans invitation we are reviewing the opinion and 
are considering an appeal said amy brown a justice department 
spokeswoman 
on monday the supreme court agreed to review a ruling by a 
federal appeals court in new orleans which had upheld drug testing 
of us customs service employees who seek promotions 
a federal appeals court in san francisco last month ruled 
unconstitutional the mandatory drug testing of railway workers 
involved in accidents

sen edward m kennedy says increases in the 
governments food stamp program are needed to make up for reagan 
administration cuts that have helped create hunger in america 
through the 1980s 
the cold statistics only begin to measure the toll in terms of 
the human lives damaged disabled and destroyed by our shameful 
abdication of responsibility in recent years the massachusetts 
democrat told a group of nutrition activists tuesday 
we have financed the greatest arms buildup in human history 
but once again we are losing the war on hunger he said 
kennedy chairman of the senate labor and human resources 
committee planned to introduce legislation today with sen patrick 
j leahy dvt and rep leon e panetta dcalif that would 
help right those wrongs 
i do not intend to accept proposals that seek to balance the 
federal budget on the backs of poor children he said survival 
of the fittest may be the law of the jungle but it is not the law 
of america and it is time for america to help 
kennedy said his antihunger legislation would raise food stamp 
benefits so that no americans are forced to go hungry for the 
last part of every month 
it also would ease food stamp eligibility requirements and 
provide more public information about the program 
kennedy said hunger in america was largely eradicated by the 
late 1970s but misguided budget cuts under president reagan 
have rubbed salt in the wounds created by the recession of the 
early 1980s triggering the reemergence of hunger 
earlier boston mayor raymond l flynn told the food research 
and action centers annual conference that the nation needs a 
compassionate urban agenda 
flynn chairman of the us conference of mayors task force on 
hunger and homelessness said both problems are growing especially 
among families with children 
the sad truth is that hunger is now more prevalent in our 
nation than at any time since the great depression he said

a stamp cancellation such as the british one 
proclaiming that jesus is alive could not be issued in the 
united states a postal service official says 
the postal services 74 division managers can approve special 
cancellations for events of general public interest said dick 
rustin manager of the stamp information branch 
the special cancellations may not deal with things only of local 
interest or for political religious fraternal trade or 
commercial purposes he said tuesday 
the british post office on tuesday began postmarking nearly all 
letters mailed in that country with the words jesus is alive 
as part of a private arrangement financed by an evangelist 
jewish leaders criticized the christian cancellation as 
potentially offensive 
the special postmark which also contains a small cross will 
last six weeks and was paid for by paul slennet who sells 
religious literature at two bookstores in southendonsea east of 
london he said god told him to buy the postmark 
the stateowned post office said slennet paid the equivalent of 
88500 for the privilege of having every letter mailed through 68 
of britains 69 sorting offices with the jesus message 
rustin said groups seeking the special cancellations have to pay 
900 for the engraving of the cancellation plus about 100 for each 
canceling die to be used for a large post office many dies can be 
required rustin said

the state department says it approves of 
efforts by opponents of panamanian strongman manuel antonio noriega 
to freeze panamanian assets in the united states and choke off 
payments to the government 
its their action to take state department spokeswoman 
phyllis oakley said tuesday calling it the legitimate action of 
the constitutional government in panama 
panamanian opposition leader gabriel lewis a former ambassador 
to washington said legal steps were being taken to freeze the 
assets but he gave few details 
lewis said disclosing specifics of the plan could enable 
panamanian officials loyal to noriega to take countermeasures 
juan b sosa us ambassador for panamas president in hiding 
eric arturo delvalle released a proclamation from delvalle calling 
on all panamanians not to engage in any financial transactions with 
the authorities who seized power from him last week 
the proclamation states that payment of debts taxes and other 
obligations should be withheld until constitutional government is 
restored in panama 
the legal efforts in the united states were being handled by 
william d rogers a former assistant secretary of state for 
interamerican affairs and an undersecretary of state for economic 
affairs

pentagon officials are studying a 
reorganization plan for the stars amp stripes military newspapers 
that could change their printing schedules introduce advertising 
and cut back on staff 
the reorganization plan proposed to the pentagon last fall by 
an advisory task force but only recently released publicly is now 
being studied by the european and pacific commands where the two 
newspapers are published 
the top military leaders of those commands are to file comments 
with the pentagon within the next week or so allowing defense 
department officials to make some final decisions on the fate of 
the two newspapers said william caldwell a pentagon spokesman 
ultimately dan howard the assistant defense secretary for 
public affairs will decide whether to change the newspapers 
operation in consultation with defense secretary frank c carlucci 
and congress 
the internal review comes at a time when the general accounting 
office is conducting an independent investigation of alleged 
censorship by military commanders at the papers congress at the 
prodding of sen william proxmire dwis ordered that 
investigation last december and is likely to study closely any 
reorganization plan 
the newspapers are published for american servicemen posted 
overseas and date back to publication in france during world war i 
the papers chief goal is to provide the same national and 
international news available in the united states to troops 
assigned to foreign countries 
although frequently referred to as one newspaper there are two 
separate editions of the stars and stripes published by autonomous 
bureaus in west germany and japan 
the papers are staffed by military as well as civilian 
journalists and report to the commanders of the european and 
pacific commands they are partially supported by taxpayer funds 
roughly 9 million in fiscal 1986 
the pentagon formed a sevenmember stars amp stripes advisory 
task force in the fall of 1986 asking for ideas on how to make 
the operations more efficient named as chairman was capt robert 
a rosen a longtime communications executive in private life who 
is also a public affairs officer in the naval reserve 
the 55page report produced by the rosen panel concludes that 
the two newspapers are bringing to overseas dod personnel a 
balanced presentation of us and international news along with 
relevant dod and unified command news but at a high cost 
the task force saw areas where improvement in newspaper 
quality and significant cost savings could be made 
the panel said the pentagon should consider such things as 
shifting from a sevendayaweek schedule to a sixdayaweek 
schedule consolidation of management and procurement paring 
expenses on wire services by subscribing to only one investing in 
modern textediting computers to improve staff efficiency and 
closely reviewing staff levels in any event 
the newspapers are published in a similar fashion yet the 
editorial staff of the european edition is twice that of the 
pacific edition 87 to 41 the panel found 
the task force came away with the distinct impression that the 
european stars amp stripes and possibly the pacific stars amp stripes 
editorial departments were overstaffed the report states 
most importantly it is time to rethink the restrictions that 
prevent the newspapers from accepting most forms of advertising 
the panel insisted the two papers rely now primarily on their 
25cent subscription charge 
the report said the task force believes that the congress and 
the dod must come to grips with the practical reality of what a 
newspaper is namely a manufactured product that conveys news and 
other information including advertising information 
congress and dod must apply that reality to the stars and 
stripes so that the papers may better serve their readers and 
become economically secure with a reduced need of appropriated 
funds 
if the government is not willing to do that it should either 
resign itself to continued appropriated fund support or get out 
of the daily newspaper business the panel concluded

richard gephardt stood in the bright 
sunshine on the steps of the capitol building and delivered the 
message that has carried him to the front rank of the democratic 
presidential field 
it was tough talk about trade and the problems of american 
workers 
his critics call gephardts message protectionist they decry 
the undeniable fact that this washington insider is running against 
the establishment 
but the missouri congressman appears to be getting a positive 
response no other candidate has a message that has caught hold so 
effectively with a large portion of the democratic party electorate 
gephardt may fall short in the race for the democratic 
presidential nomination the party may turn to gov michael 
dukakis technocratic appeal to sen albert gore jrs tough 
defense and foreign policy message or to jesse jacksons 
antiestablishment platform 
but gephardts strong run for the nomination already has 
delivered a message to the the party one that might outlive his 
candidacy 
a strong tribute to the gephardt message came in the republican 
presidential debate in atlanta last sunday when rep jack kemp of 
new york turned to kansas sen bob dole and accused him of sounding 
just like dick gephardt 
when dole campaigns in south carolina he unabashedly supports 
legislation to restrict textile imports so does pat robertson 
the reason is simple over 45 percent of the jobs in south 
carolina are in the textile industry and the state has lost 126 
plants 
a staple of the gepardt message is reference to an editorial in 
the wall street journal that referred to the trade deficits as 
just a fact of life 
then he said hed like the editorial writer to come with him to 
bettendorff iowa where 6000 workers in three different 
industries have recently lost their jobs because of foreign 
competition 
sit across the table as i did from live human beings and have 
them tell you what its like to lose their life insurance lose 
their health insurance lose their pension what its like to go 
home and tell their families that theyve lost their jobs that 
theyre going to stand in an unemployment line or a welfare line 
to tell them its just a fact of life he said 
he referred to electronics workers in new hampshire and textile 
workers in south carolina and said ladies and gentlemen i dont 
like those facts of life 
he said it was time for america to get control of our economic 
destiny a powerful message to americans who feel uneasy over the 
nations enormous trade deficits 
four years ago republicans derided as protectionist walter 
mondales call for legislation that would require a certain portion 
of foreign products to be manufactured in the united states 
socalled domestic content legislation 
the label stuck it was special interest legislation a bad 
thing for the country 
but during the four years since that election the situation has 
not improved and more and more people are feeling they are a part 
of that special interest 
two former governors of south carolina robert mcnair and 
richard riley stood with gephardt on the capitol steps and 
endorsed his candidacy 
both felt compelled to defend the congressman against charges he 
is protectionist 
mcnair said gephardt has faced up to putting america first 
with a fair sound and sensible trade bill it is not a piece 
of protectionist legislation as some have tried to portray it but 
it is what is best for this country 
dick gephardt has spoken out during this campaign on trade and 
some have referred to him as a protectionist said riley hes 
not a protectionist at all hes a pragmatist

dole a senator from kansas has received 645190 in 
contributions from pacs representing banking institutions utility 
companies and other groups according to a report issued tuesday by 
congress watch 
vice president bush has received the secondhighest amount with 
559895 rep jack kemp has gotten 57766 and the other 
republican candidate former television evangelist pat robertson 
has not accepted any pac contributions the report said 
tennessee sen albert gore jr was second among the democrats 
with 174934 in pac money and illinois sen paul simon was third 
with 152250 jesse jackson accepted 47925 in pac contributions 
the report said 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis and former colorado sen gary 
hart have said they do not accept pac money 
gephardt was roundly criticized on the subject by several of his 
rivals in a debate monday night in williamsburg va 
and the dukakis campaign has prepared antigephardt ads that 
communications director leslie dach described this way he says 
he is leading the little guys fight but his campaign is financed 
and supported by the big guys his biggest contributors are 
americas biggest corporations 
congress watch which issued the report is the legislative arm 
of public citizen the liberal organization founded in 1971 by 
consumer advocate ralph nader the group based its report on 
federal election commission documents from october 1987 and 
campaign contributions through jan 31 of this year 
monday night dukakis took gephardt to task for accepting pac 
contributions while racing around the country beating up on the 
establishment 
gephardt said he had often voted against the policies advocated 
by his contributors and to suggest that people have voted 
according to the wishes of people who have given them money i just 
think is out of touch with reality i havent done that and i know 
you havent done that 
but jackson said gephardts contention that he ignored the 
wishes of his contributors was unrealistic 
lobbyists would lose their jobs if they gave money 
continuously against the interests of who they were working for 
jackson said 
among contributors to gephardts campaign were the builders pac 
association 5000 first republican bank fund 5000 
prudentialbache securities 2500 mercantile bank corp 1000 
and ef hutton 1500

5000 and federal express 2000 
according to fec documents released last year dole led his 
senate colleagues with a total of 33 million received from pacs 
since he entered congress in 1968 
of that about 1 million was raised from pacs for the kansas 
senators reelection campaign in 1986 
bush accepted contributions from pacs representing citicorp

the league of women voters called off 
democratic and republican debates scheduled for sunday after 
presidential candidates in both parties showed little or no 
interest in attending 
in essence the candidates are snubbing nearly half the 
country two days before this critical election said carole bucy 
president of the league of women voters of nashville 
the debates which were to have been telecast from nashville by 
cable news network would have come only two days before the 
20state round of caucuses and primaries on march 8 or super 
tuesday 
league spokeswoman janice kaplan had said earlier in the day the 
democratic debate was definitely on and the republican debate would 
proceed even if there were only two candidates 
the cancellation followed indications by republican bob dole 
that he was unlikely to join jack kemp for a twoman debate 
in knoxville where dole spoke to a downtown rally press 
secretary walt riker said he doubted seriously that dole would 
participate in the rally without vice president george bush 
bush and pat robertson a former television evangelist both 
advised the league they would not show up 
ms kaplan said rep richard gephardt told us this week he did 
not want to debate in tennessee sen albert gores back yard 
even though he has known all along the debate was in nashville 
ms bucy said massachusetts gov michael dukakis had decided not 
to participate 
gores chief campaign spokesman mike kopp chided gephardt and 
dukakis passing up the debates here both of them also skipped a 
debate last sunday in houston 
kopp said gephardt and dukakis participated fully in the 
debates that preceded the iowa caucuses now these same candidates 
are dodging these nashville and houston debates where they have 
to talk about the issues 
sen paul simon who has said he would not campaign actively in 
southerndominated super tuesday states was apparently planning on 
taking part in the nashville debate 
other democrats in the running are jesse jackson and former 
colorado sen gary hart

another was slated uncommitted as wyomings gop presidential 
delegation selection process got under way 
republicans in two counties met tuesday to select two of the 
states 18 delegates to the republican national convention 
most of the rest of the gop delegates and 13 of the states 18 
democratic delegates will be selected saturday three days before 
super tuesday 
despite the emphasis on campaigning in the south wyoming was 
getting some attention from the candidates 
sen albert gore jr of tennessee and massachusetts gov michael 
dukakis both planned stops in the state before saturdays county 
conventions gary hart who is from neighboring colorado has 
visited 
rep richard gephardt bought radio ads in wyoming the first 
time a candidate has advertised his candidacy over the airwaves 
none of the republican candidates were expected in the state 
where vice president bush and sen bob dole were considered the 
frontrunners 
natrona and platte counties were the first to allocate 
presidential delegates tuesday with eight other counties ready to 
select their gop delegates on saturday 
the natrona county delegate judy catchpole said she was 
committed to dole the platte county pick natty dodge was 
uncommitted 
weston county republicans planned to choose their delegate 
friday and niobrara county party members were to do the same on

former president jimmy carter said theres an 
even chance that none of the democratic presidential candidates 
will have a lock on the partys nomination before the national 
convention in july 
carter who has not endorsed any of the candidates received a 
visit tuesday from one of the hopefuls rep richard gephardt of 
missouri who characterized the meeting as a nonpolitical call on 
an old friend 
my hope is that out of the primary and caucus season will come 
a clear winner carter said just one week before 20 states most 
of them south of the masondixon line hold primaries and caucuses 
with 1307 delegates at stake 
im not sure thats a likelihood now he said 
carter made it clear he is not one of those waiting for some 
other candidate to enter the race a mario cuomo bill bradley or 
even georgia sen sam nunn 
i would not personally favor turning to someone outside the 
active candidate group for the nomination said the former 
president 
carter explained his decision not to endorse any of the partys 
contenders saying it is better for us not to take a preferential 
position among the democratic candidates 
he said the only democrat he might have thrown his support 
behind was nunn who decided against entering the race 
carter talked about the democratic race and super tuesday after 
meeting at his rambling brick home with gephardt one of six 
democratic aspirants for the presidency 
gephardt denied he had any political motive for his trip to this 
tiny georgia town carter put on the map 
i didnt come here to try to be helped on super tuesday 
said gephardt who stopped in georgia on a trip from williamsburg 
va to columbia sc 
i came here today not to enhance my prospects but to greet an 
old friend he said 
gephardt carter and his wife rosalynn stood on the front walk 
of the former presidents home at 1 woodland road his hair much 
whiter than when he left the white house in january 1981 carter 
wore an opennecked checked shirt a tweed jacket and khaki pants 
asked if he missed all the attention of a political campaign 
carter laughed and said he and his wife had just returned from 
skiing in colorado 
but he was also willing to answer questions as long as reporters 
had any to ask 
carter was careful to say something nice about all the 
democratic candidates and suggested that any one of them could do 
well in the south 
im sure sen albert gore of tennessee will have an 
advantage among some voters because hes a southerner said 
carter the former presidents daughter amy has endorsed jesse 
jackson 
amy doesnt ask me for counsel he said when asked if she 
had discussed her position with him

gibbs took the crown in a contest marred by arrests an assault and 
protests

texas victory record and felt compelled to assure reporters tuesday 
night that the contest televised nationally by cbs was not rigged 
the woman who started the winning streak in 1985 laura 
martinezherring of el paso did a little jig after ms gibbs was 
crowned and echoed the sentiments of many pageantwatchers i 
just feel sorry for the next miss texas 
ms gibbs a 21yearold junior at texas christian university 
smiled broadly when outgoing miss usa michelle royer of keller put 
the crown on her head 
it feels fabulous the blueeyed brunette said calmly 
seemingly unsurprised by her victory 
one of the gifts michelle royer gave me was a dictionary 
with the word impossible whited out so of course it was 
possible she said

republican george bush and democrat 
michael dukakis on new england home ground triumphed in vermonts 
beauty contest primary but jesse jackson and bob dole had 
reason to celebrate as well as the presidential pack headed into 
the final days of the super tuesday campaign 
our message continues to win jackson exulted after 
finishing a strong second in vermont which has only a tiny black 
population jackson garnered 26 percent to dukakis 57 percent 
dole outspent and outorganized nonetheless made an impressive 
showing gaining 39 percent to bushs 49 percent in what his 
campaign called the vice presidents back yard bush has a 
summer home in maine 
still the vice president pronounced himself pleased 
this win gives us three out of three in new england and im 
hopeful we can be as successful this saturday in south carolina and 
on super tuesday said bush who was campaigning in florida 
no delegates were at stake in the tuesday primary delegate 
selection begins at local caucuses next month and representatives 
of the dole campaign said they would work now on organizing for the 
caucuses 
dukakis fresh from a weekend win in maines democratic caucus 
was buoyant about his victory 
its terrific were rolling em up said the massachusetts 
governor who was campaigning in baltimore with a strong 
organization and the endorsement of gov madeleine kunin dukakis 
had been expected to do well here 
rep richard gephardt who has been dukakis chief opponent in 
some recent contests trailed with 8 percent gephardt backers said 
his poor showing was caused by a lack of spendng in the state by 
his national campaign 
dukakis and jackson both made a decision to compete said 
lt gov howard dean gephardts state chairman you cant 
overcome national organizations with just a vermont organization 
some political observers had predicted a tight race between 
jackson and gephardt for second place but jackson stole the show 
he ran a strong second in the states largest city of burlington 
and actually beat dukakis in 27 communities and tied him in two 
we have found the common chord that is linking the american 
people said jackson from his mothers home in greenville sc 
its putting to rest once and for all that he is candidate for 
black people said burlington mayor bernard sanders a jackson 
backer we are the whitest state in america i think its an 
extraordinary showing 
in unofficial results with 100 percent of the states 262 
precincts reporting dukakis had 28244 votes or 57 percent 
jackson 13030 votes or 26 percent gephardt 3968 votes or 8 
percent simon 2596 votes or 5 percent and hart 2052 votes or 4 
percent 
bush received 23550 or 49 percent dole got 18636 or 39 
percent former television evangelist pat robertson 2447 votes or 
5 percent rep jack kemp 1866 votes or 4 percent dropouts pete 
du pont and alexander haig received 794 votes or 2 percent and 327 
votes or 1 percent respectively 
the robertson and kemp campaigns put up little effort in the 
state although robertson plans to compete in the caucuses 
i really didnt contest it said robertson in orlando fla 
we had virtually no organization in vermont 
in years past vermonts primary won national media attention 
because of its timing candidates could use a victory in the state 
to build momentum following a victories in new hampshire or iowa 
or they could try to repair an image wounded by a loss in either 
of those two states 
but the timing element worked against the state this year 
because no delegates were being allocated the candidates 
practically ignored the state to concentrate on the megadelegate 
race in the south 
the primary was part of the states annual ritual town meeting 
day when vermonts voters decided town budgets road repairs and a 
host of other local issues turnout was lower than expected with 
just under 100000 venturing to the polls

vermont residents used their annual town 
meetings to bolster efforts to save family farms and grapple with 
growth 
one town voted to exempt silos from property taxes and another 
declared its population growth rate too high 
the votes tuesday reflected concern that vermonts rural 
heritage is being gobbled up by condominiums resort developments 
and vacation homes that issue was the focus of a special 
commission created by gov madeleine kunin that recommended a 
comprehensive package of legislation to control growth and save 
open land 
the town meetings a mainstay of local government in which 
residents vote on town budgets and perennial issues such as road 
repairs took up the growth controversy during debates of zoning 
regulations expansions of planning staffs and other proposals 
pawlet residents voted 249178 to exempt farm silos from the 
property tax though proponents ackowledged it would mean a savings 
of only 200 a year for each of the towns 17 farms 
its going to be a combination of these little things that 
keep the farmers going said state rep perry waite 
in wallingford residents tried to go even further approving a 
proposal to exempt local farms from paying any property tax on farm 
land or buildings 
for technical reasons the vote was not binding said board 
chairman robert barker 
we determined though the selectmen have the authority to 
institute this program he said and i think theres support 
for it im for it 
in woodstock residents were asked to recommend a preferred 
population growth rate for the community ranging from 066 
percent the highest annual growth rate the town had between 1890 
and 1970 to 25 percent the average so far this decade 
they opted for the middle range of 09 percent far below the 
present growth rate 
if the populace makes it loud and clear it doesnt want rapid 
growth perhaps the town could control growth by setting up certain 
conservation areas or by steering patterns of development and 
population densities said john wiggin a member of a group 
studying growth in the community 
growth wasnt the only issue on the minds of voters at town 
meetings in corinth the question of the day was whether the tiny 
hamlet at the town center is called cookville or cookeville 
town clerk jack learmonth had asked for the vote because of 
disagreements throughout history henceforth it will be 
cookeville he said following the vote

jesse jackon returned to his boyhood 
hometown as he headed down the home stretch to the super tuesday 
showdown buoyed by another strong showing in a northern state 
our message continues to win the democratic presidential 
candidate said when he learned tuesday night that he had finished 
second in vermonts beauty contest primary 
jackson was surrounded by family staff and reporters enjoying a 
homecooked southern style meal when word of his showing reached 
him 
we have found the common chord that is linking the american 
people where they are in iowa or maine or new hampshire of 
minnesota or south carolina he said 
jackson is hoping that the inroads he has made among white 
voters in iowa new hampshire minnesota and maine all states 
with 1 percent or less black voting age population will continue 
in the march 8 series of primaries across 20 states most of them 
in the south 
jackson is expected to run well on super tuesday especially in 
the deep south with its heavy black population but the campaign 
also is targeting the working class students gays and other 
minorities 
jackson acknowledged upon arriving in south carolina which 
holds its primary saturday that the south is different than the 
states that have voted so far but he said im a son of the 
south i know the south and its ways 
he said his message attacking multinational corporations and 
appealing to the economically oppressed would remain the same as 
he campaigns in the south 
arriving at the greenville airport jackson highlighted the 
plight of textile workers who have been hurt by us industry 
taking its operations overseas 
he said that when he was a youth greenville was the textile 
capital of the world and was filled with mills now closed down 
jackson said the customs laws must be enforced to keep foreign 
products from entering the country illegally and he called for 
adjustment of the exchange rates by south korea and taiwan so those 
nations cannot receive inflated prices on their goods 
jackson also defended his leadership qualifications which have 
come under attack from democratic rival tennessee sen al gore jr 
because jackson has never held an elected or appointive government 
post 
speaking to a baptist convention at the springfield baptist 
church where his mother sang in the choir when he was a boy 
jackson repeated his oftstated claim that he knows the american 
people better than any other candidate he also gave a litany of 
foreign leaders he has met labor strikes he has mediated and civil 
rights causes he has championed 
im not propped up by aides he said adding that he can 
speak to the poor because i was born in the underclass 
earlier in washington jackson met with the south african 
ambassador to protest pretorias new clampdown of antiapartheid 
factions and arrest of dissident religious leaders including 
archbishop desmond tutu 
jackson told a news conference later that the ambassador piet 
gj koornhof asked for a followup meeting with rep ronald 
dellums dcalif who attended the meeting and who is sponsoring 
legislation on sanctions against south africa because of its 
apartheid policy of racial separation

the president of connecticuts 
thirdlargest bank is trading his pin stripes for dancing tights to 
help promote corporate support of the arts 
david carson 53 president and chief executive officer of 
peoples bank in bridgeport will play the role of the duke of 
courland in the ballet giselle to be performed march 1112 by 
the connecticut ballet theater in stamford 
the production also will feature stephanie saland principal 
dancer with the new york city ballet 
the bank has supported the theater but i think you can 
support the arts with not just money but with your presence 
too said carson 
the ballet was looking for a very regal type of person and 
it decided to approach carson said brett raphael the companys 
artistic director 
it occurred to me that this was natural casting if possible 
however farfetched raphael said its not every day a 
corporate personality takes time out of his schedule to dabble in a 
very different art form 
said carson it appealed to my sense of humor and if it helps 
give the ballet some recognition thats great 
carson will do some mime and walk to music rather than dance 
but he asked when does walking in time become dancing

the post office today began delivering mail 
bearing the postmark jesus is alive throughout britain a move 
that jews humanists the national secular society and others 
called offensive to other beliefs 
it is absolutely outrageous said martin horwood spokesman 
for the british humanist association a national organization for 
the nonreligious 
imagine the furor if we had asked to have jesus is dead 
printed on hundreds of millions of letters we might think these 
things privately but they should not be forced on everybody else 
in such an insensitive way he said 
horwood said he is writing to post office chairman sir brian 
nicholson asking for the postmark to be withdrawn 
christian evangelist paul slennet privately financed the 
arrangement with the post office slennet 41 sells christian 
literature at two bookstores in southendonsea east of london he 
said god told him to buy the postmark 
the sixweek arrangement runs through good friday april 1 when 
christians mourn the crucifixion of jesus christ and easter sunday 
april 3 when they celebrate his resurrection 
slennet was quoted by the daily telegraph as saying he was 
convinced the lord will speak to the nation through the scheme 
which he said was designed to mark easter 
we are not trying to offend people in any way the paper 
quoted slennet as saying 
but shimon cohen spokesman for lord jakobovits the chief rabbi 
of britain said it could well cause offense and resentment 
weve made our feelings known to the post office 
the staterun post office began using the postmark on mail 
tuesday and the first deliveries of mail bearing it began today 
barbara smoker president of the national secular society said 
she was enraged by the slogan which she condemned as insensitive 
propaganda 
press reports quoted ms smoker 64 as saying that 26 percent 
of britains 56 million population are atheists or agnostics and 
that the society exists to defend their rights 
ms smoker was quoted as saying she plans to retaliate by 
stamping her own slogan jesus is a myth on every envelope she 
mails 
post office spokesman duncan marshall said the printing of 
this slogan in no way confirms post office approval of its 
contents the slogan is not considered to be contentious but a fair 
and reasonable message generally acceptable to the public 
the post office said slennet who belongs to an evangelical 
group called intercessors for britain paid 88500 for the 
privilege of having every letter mailed through 68 of britains 69 
sorting offices stamped postmark jesus is alive 
the 69th office in plymouth is already booked for a slogan 
celebrating englands defeat of the spanish armada in 1588 
the deal includes mail sent abroad but excludes parcels 
periodicals and mail stamped by businesses that do their own 
franking nearly 52 million letters are mailed daily in britain 
the post office said it considers each private application for a 
postmark slogan on its merits revenueboosting privateslogan 
postmarks usually urge support for healthresearch charities and 
other worthy causes the postmark before the jesus is alive 
slogan was a post office message reading pass on your postcode 
cohen said the chief rabbis office was flooded with phone 
calls after news of the slogan appeared tuesday 
we recognize that this is a christian country and we have the 
utmost respect for the primacy for the church cohen told the 
associated press but he added we do fear that the slogan is 
by implication addressed to nonchristians and could well cause 
offense and resentment 
rabbi charles emmanuel chairman of the assembly of rabbis of 
the reform movement of great britain told the ap to me it is 
simply a question of not only an infringement of my personal rights 
but of my religious rights 
but the united kingdom islamic mission a group representing 
moslems was quoted by the guardian newspaper as saying of the 
jesus is alive postmark there is no problem for us

cocaine now is the most visible target in the 
war on drugs a battle that a congressional report says is costing 
society tens of billions of dollars a year in lost wages law 
enforcement outlays and treatment programs 
a study of recent changes in the drug trade by the general 
accounting office the investigative arm of congress said 
cocaine has emerged as the widely abused drug of greatest 
concern 
marijuana use has been declining the report said while various 
substances known as designer drugs have emerged as a significant 
phenomenon 
some highlights of controlling drug abuse a status report 
include 
in 1983 alone drugs cost american society some 597 billion 
in crime lost employment criminal justice spending prisons 
reduced productivity and treatment programs 
the number of cocainerelated emergencies reported by hospitals 
jumped 167 percent from 1983 to 1986 
the share of high school seniors who admitted ever having used 
cocaine fell from 169 percent in 1986 to 152 percent in 1987 
however some experts fear this may not include all those using the 
newly popular crack form of cocaine which is smoked and is 
highly popular among young people 
heroin seems to be widely available across the country the 
number of heroinrelated hospital emergencies rose 24 percent from 
1983 to 1986 
marijuana use has declined although it remains the most widely 
used illegal drug in the country an estimated 619 million people 
over age 12 have used this drug at least once 
los angeles is the cocaine consumption capital of the nation 
although pcp and heroin are also popular and its a transshipment 
point for mexican heroin 
miami is the cocaine importation center with many homicides 
related to the drug trade the spread of the disease aids is being 
added to by the use of drug needles 
new york has become a center for the importation of heroin and 
has the nations largest heroin addict population with the spread 
of aids also a major problem the new york heroin trade is 
dominated by chinese immigrants 
san francisco faces a major problem with lsd and 
methamphetamines with growing use of heroin and cocaine 
cocaine availability has increased sharply in washington dc 
where pcp also is used heavily a high per capita overdose rate is

mayor thomas vezzetti the badly dressed 
bootleggers son who took to the streets with a bullhorn to win 
elections and fight the gentrification of this hudson river city 
died early today he was 59 
vezzetti died of a heart attack at st mary hospital shortly 
after midnight police said 
vezzetti a lifelong bachelor was said to have been angry 
tuesday night by the outcome of a special election in the 5th ward 
a councilman who frequently criticized vezzettis policies won a 
special election over a candidate supported by the mayor 
officials said that at about 11 pm tuesday neighbors heard 
vezzetti fall in his apartment and they called for an ambulance 
city business administrator edwin chius said city council would 
meet later today to choose a successor to head this city of 42000 
before vezzettis election to public office he had developed a 
reputation as an eccentric sometimes wearing mismatched shoes 
orange pants and a hawaiian shirt his face was often unshaven and 
he sometimes carried his belongings in two paper bags 
he also was a political gadfly showing up at school board and 
city council meetings complaining about the waste of taxpayers 
money 
he took a bullhorn in 1982 and walked up and down washington 
street the citys main artery to announce he was challenging the 
city council president in the next election 
he won and then used the tactic against mayor steve cappiello 
in 1985 hitting on the theme of stopping yuppies from sweeping the 
working and middle class out of the city across the hudson from 
manhattan 
if you want to stay in hoboken vote for me he often said 
he forced cappiello into a runoff and the mayor questioned 
vezzettis mental competence and wardrobe 
clothes do not make the man vezzetti said at a campaign 
debate 
and he beat the threeterm mayor in a major upset supporters 
literally carried him to city hall 
his longtime motto was its not that im so good its just 
that theyre so bad 
thomas jefferson vezzetti and his twin sister louise were born 
in 1928 
he once described his father as a bootlegger who owned five 
saloons the mayors mother was an heiress to a peanuts and dried 
fruits fortune 
thats where i get my campaign money from vezzetti once 
told new jersey monthly 
he was one of a kind said police chief george crimmins 
itll be a long time before he can be replaced

vietnam has begun urging the united states to 
play a larger role in southeast asia and to work for a settlement 
of the conflict in cambodia four us scholars said after 
returning from two weeks in vietnam 
three said the push indicated that vietnam was changing and 
wanted to improve relations with the united states 
the fourth said vietnam was just putting into practice the old 
chinese proverb using barbarians to control barbarians 
the four china specialists spoke at a briefing tuesday sponsored 
by the henry luce foundation which supported their trip from dec 
29 to jan 11 
in all seven american china hands took part in the trip 
which included stays in hanoi and ho chi minh city once known as 
saigon and talks with highranking vietnamese officials 
helen chauncey a professor of history at georgetown university 
said americas preoccupation with its loss of the vietnam war and 
with the powmia issue was hampering its ability to respond to a 
changing vietnam 
we have to stop letting the past determine our actions in the 
region agreed brantly womack a professor of political science 
at northern illinois university 
jonathan pollack of the rand corporation was not as optimistic 
about the changes in vietnam or about the prospects for peace in 
indochina 
pollack contended that the fighting in cambodia was still a 
sideshow in a larger struggle between the soviet union and its 
ally vietnam against china it will remain the scene of violence 
until the larger powers can sort out their problems he said 
frederic wakeman jr a history professor at the university of 
california berkeley said he was impressed by changing vietnamese 
society citing beatles songs played on a flight from hanoi and the 
raffish tilt of berets on the heads of communist party officials 
we were astonished again and again by the candor of the 
vietnamese wakeman said intellectuals officials party 
members were all very open 
as a china scholar wakeman said he was particularly interested 
in the entrepreneurial spirit of the ethnic chinese in ho chi minh 
city 
we had the sense in saigon of a commercial economy waiting to 
break loose he said 
chauncey and womack said a combination of circumstances has 
given america a chance for a new beginning in vietnam 
for the first time womack said vietnamese officials including 
foreign minister and vice premier nguyen co thach are talking with 
eagerness about leaving cambodia 
vietnam invaded cambodia in december 1978 kicked out the 
chinesebacked khmer rouge and installed a puppet government in 
phnom penh 
about 140000 vietnamese troops remain in cambodia fighting a 
resistance coalition headed by prince norodom sihanouk that is 
backed by china the united states and the freemarket countries of 
southeast asia 
but last year sihanouk split with the coalition and began 
direct negotiations with hun sen prime minister of the 
vietnamesebacked government 
chauncey said the negotiations supported by vietnam were a 
sign that vietnam wants to end the conflict 
vietnamese officials told me they want the united states to 
play an active role in negotiations to bring peace to cambodia 
she said 
vietnam also is trying to boost its economy in which the 
average annual income is about 125 as such it has recognized the 
need for foreign exchange and investment from the west 
wakeman said he believed vietnam wants an increased us 
presence to counterbalance chinese interests in southeast asia 
in part its a very old diplomatic tactic of using the 
barbarians to control the barbarians he said 
chauncey said the united states must reassert itself in 
southeast asia 
if it doesnt we will be left behind in what will be a 
realignment of political and economic forces she said

west coast members of the writers guild of 
america almost certainly voted to authorize a strike against movie 
and television producers a former guild president said 
the vote was taken tuesday night in hollywood by secret ballot 
and results were not expected to be announced until thursday the 
9000member union also includes 2500 east coast members who were 
scheduled to vote this afternoon 
the guilds contract expired at 1201 am tuesday 
union negotiators said a replacement contract offered by the 
alliance of motion picture and television producers was calculated 
to force a strike the negotiators unanimously urged members to 
reject the offer and vote instead for a strike authorization said 
cheryl rhoden a guild spokeswoman 
she said 2400 ballots were cast tuesday night 
the former guild president mel shavelson said that judging 
from the sentiments he heard expressed during the balloting i 
dont think there was any doubt as to what the vote was 
while a strike could begin as early as thursday shavelson said 
it was unlikely a walkout would be called immediately 
a strike could have an immediate impact on talk shows and soap 
operas which use scripts daily and without much lead time 
primetime programs and feature films would be affected only by a 
longer strike 
negotiators for the two sides met for just two hours before 
quitting tuesday afternoon 
the brief meeting followed a 21hour session that lasted until 
715 am tuesday and made progress on 25 to 30 lesser issues 
said herb steinberg spokesman for the producers 
steinberg and ms rhoden said three major stumbling blocks 
remained the writers are seeking more creative rights to 
control what happens to their scripts and higher payments when 
programs are distributed in foreign markets the producers want to 
give writers reduced payments for domestic syndication of onehour 
television programs a shrinking market 
the entertainment writers last went on strike three years ago 
the walkout lasted two weeks before writers voted to accept a 
package offering them essentially the same terms as one they had 
earlier rejected 
the median annual income for guild writers is 40000 but about 
half of the members are unemployed at any given time the union 
says

five thousand troops from half the nato 
countries were airlifted to the mountains and valleys of northern 
norway in a show of unity as leaders of the alliance gathered in 
brussels at a major strategy conference 
us transport planes on tuesday ferried in the combat units for 
the maneuvers codenamed arrowhead express which climaxes in 
two weeks in a battle on snowcovered terrain against an enemy 
of 9500 norwegian forces 
the exercise mobilized the allied command europe mobile force a 
brigade designed to rush to areas of potential conflict with the 
sovietled warsaw pact 
the maneuvers were clearly intended to serve political more than 
military aims and to demonstrate the cohesion of the north 
atlantic treaty organization 
our operational role is in peacetime to show as many flags 
with as much visibility as possible in a threatened area to deter 
an aggressor said british maj don mclaren 
if we reach the combat stage weve failed he said in a 
telephone interview tuesday from command headquarters in bardufoss 
1000 miles north of oslo 
although not officially tied to the summit the exercise 
dovetails with president reagans recent efforts to reassure us 
allies of the american commitment to defend europe at the same time 
that it negotiates arms reductions with the soviet union 
the war games also coincide with mounting norwegian concern that 
natos flank in the north atlantic will become more active 
following the ussoviet agreement to dismantle intermediaterange 
nuclear weapons 
the inf agreement has made the norwegian and the barents seas 
more important kaare willoch chairman of the norwegian 
parliaments foreign affairs committee said tuesday 
the soviet union has built the worlds greatest concentration of 
firepower on the kola peninsula adjacent to norways northern 
border 
willoch a former conservative prime minister said in an 
interview that the soviet buildup in the north had been going on 
for decades and had shown no signs of slackening since the 
disarmament accord was signed in december 
the buildup proceeds it necessitates nato countermeasures 
while negotiations continue on further arms reduction accords he 
said 
the soviet northern fleet armed with submarinelaunched 
longrange nuclear weapons must pass norway to reach the atlantic 
fire zone the closest point of deployment to the united states for 
soviet missiles 
norways northwestern coast kept icefree all year by the 
warmth of the gulf stream also becomes more attractive to the 
soviets as naval warfare grows in importance in soviet military 
strategy norwegian analysts say 
one war scenario foresees the soviets slicing off norways 
remote and nearly unpopulated northern province challenging natos 
willingness to respond that is precisely the kind of action the 
allied command europe mobile force was formed in 1960 to deter 
mclaren said 
arrowhead express commanded by norwegian vice admiral torolf 
rein involves forces from eight of natos 16 countries the united 
states canada west germany italy luxembourg the netherlands 
britain and norway 
the us role in arrowhead express is limited to air support 
since its units are not trained for arctic warfare much of the 
maneuvering will be done on skis or snowmobiles mclaren said 
the force holds maneuvers twice a year once in norway or 
denmark and once along an isolated region of natos southern flank 
in turkey greece or italy

nuclear waste shipments from the crippled 
three mile island plant will be temporarily halted while the 
department of energy completes its investigation into a rail 
switching incident in the st louis area according to sen john 
danforth 
meanwhile rep jack buechner rmo has introduced legislation 
that would require casks used by the doe to ship radioactive waste 
to meet safety standards set by the nuclear regulatory commission 
danforth rmo said tuesday the doe has agreed to stop the 
shipments from pennsylvania to a laboratory in idaho falls idaho 
until the investigation is completed he said he didnt know how 
long the probe would take to complete 
danforth ranking minority member of the senate commerce 
science and transportation committee last week requested the 
investigation into whether there were violations of rail 
regulations feb 9 when a mislabeled car was added to a conrail 
train carrying casks of radioactive wastes 
the covered hopper car carried a placard stating it contained a 
flammable material federal railroad administration spokesman bill 
loftus said last week it was later discovered the car was not 
carrying the dangerous cargo 
loftus said the investigation is looking at possible violations 
by the rail switching yard and the union pacific railroad which 
operated the train after it left the yard and a lime company that 
was shipping the car 
danforth said tuesday the doe had agreed to allow the department 
of transportation to make a complete study of the routes used to 
transport the tmi material the energy department has done such 
studies in the past but has always concluded that the route from 
pennsylvania to idaho was the best 
a request by danforth not to move rail shipments in the st 
louis area between the hours of 630 am to 930 am and 330 
pm and 630 pm commuter rush hours also was agreed to by 
the doe 
other agreements by the doe included a promise not to add cars 
to tmi trains along the route the trains which leave pennsylvania 
under conrail power will continue to switch to union pacific when 
necessary but no cars will be added danforth said 
as a way to minimize the total number of shipments all future 
shipments will be consolidated into three casks danforth said 
according to a statement by danforths office other agreements 
made by the doe include

a jetliner returned to kennedy airport after a 
passenger was found in a lavatory with crack and equipment to burn 
it for freebasing authorities said 
the man and a companion who was standing outside were arrested 
tuesday by federal agents who happened to be aboard said robert 
stutman head of the drug enforcement administrations new york 
office 
a flight attendant who smelled ether discovered the man in the 
lavatory along with about a quarterounce of crack a torch ether 
and butane stutman said the man outside also had crack in his 
possession he said 
this could have produced a real tragedy stutman said 
ether is an extremely volatile explosive substance when it is 
near flames 
richard moskowitz and jeff tofler were arrested on charges that 
included possession of cocaine and interference with a flight 
stutman said they were turned over to the fbi upon landing he 
said 
about 98 passengers were aboard eastern airlines flight 977 
which left kennedy at 135 pm and was scheduled to arrive in 
miami at 424 pm said karen ceremsak an airline spokeswoman 
when the pilot learned about the alleged drug activity he 
notified a dea agent and a us customs agent who were on board to 
attend a trial in miami stutman said 
the ages and hometowns of the suspects were not immediately 
known 
a powdered form of cocaine not crack a potent derivative is 
usually used in freebasing a process in which the powder is mixed 
with ether and then heated so the fumes can be inhaled stutman 
said 
he said there was no damage to the aircraft

a sri lankan soldier opened fire with 
a semiautomatic rifle and killed seven sleeping comrades before he 
was shot to death by his commander military officials said today 
nine other soldiers were wounded in the tuesday night attack at 
an army camp next to a steel mill 10 miles southeast of colombo 
they said 
the attacker was a member of the peoples liberation front an 
ultranationalist sinhalese group that has raided several military 
camps to steal weapons the officials said 
the officials who by regulation cannot be identified said the 
attack was designed to kill as many soldiers as possible and to 
steal weapons they said all the victims were sinhalese the 
majority ethnic group that controls the government and military in 
sri lanka 
the officials were unable to explain why the assailant risked 
making so much noise by gunning down fellow soldiers if the purpose 
of the attack was to collect weapons and escape 
a vehicle had arrived at the scene to enable the attacker to 
make his getaway they said but the escape was foiled when the 
commanding officer heard the shooting rushed to the scene and 
killed the soldier 
the driver escaped in the vehicle the officials said 
neither the soldier nor his commander was identified but the 
officials said they both served in a signal corps unit 
according to the officials similar attacks have occurred in the 
past but this was the largest number of soldiers ever killed by a 
fellow soldier 
the government has blamed the peoples liberation front for the 
assassinations of at least 150 government officials and supporters 
since july 29 when sri lanka signed a peace accord designed to end 
a 4yearold separatist war by tamil guerrillas 
the front says the accord makes too many concessions to the 
minority tamils and has vowed to kill anyone who supports the pact 
military officials said last winter that front had about 4000 
supporters in the 45000man army 
india mediated the peace accord last summer and it now has 
45000 peackeeping troops in the island 
tamils who are mostly hindus and comprise 18 percent of sri 
lankas 16 million people want a separate homeland claiming they 
are discriminated against by the majority sinhalese buddhists

experts have started conducting tests 
to determine how to repair the sphinx the ancient monument that 
lost a chunk of stone from its right shoulder 
the limestone slab fell from the sphinx feb 7 six days after a 
sandstorm buffeted giza plateau 
damage to the sphinx caused heated political and scientific 
debate over the future of the 4600yearold monument and egypts 
other ancient treasures 
the main casualty of the unrest was ahmed kadry until early 
february chairman of the egyptian antiquities organization 
kadry lost his job after accusing his boss culture minister 
farouk hosni of staging the rock fall to reflect badly on kadrys 
stewardship of the sphinx and by extension the other relics of 
egypts rich past 
restoration work began on the sphinx on monday 
the monument was fitted with sandbags for support and 
scaffolding to help in the early stages of the effort 
a committee of experts took rock samples to test for salt 
content and damage and to see whether the stone is strong enough to 
hold iron bars that will be inserted to strengthen it 
tests also are being conducted to determine what kind of mortar 
should be used to cement the rock in place 
were not in a hurry we want to do things right said zahi 
hawass general director of the pyramids area and director of the 
restoration 
the sphinx has the head of a pharaoh and the body of a crouching 
lion many egyptologists think the face belonged to chephren son 
of cheops and builder of the second pyramid on giza plateau next to 
cheops great pyramid 
any damage to the pyramids or the sphinx symbols of the past 
with deep emotional overtones for modern egyptians brings instant 
outcries in cairos national press the rock fall proved no 
exception to kadrys chagrin and charges of incompetence and 
corruption flooded the newspapers

vietnam today repatriated what it 
believes are the remains of 17 american servicemen listed as 
missing in action from the vietnam war a us military official 
said 
the vietnamese also turned over written reports on three other 
missing americans said lt col paul mather head of the us 
military team that flew to hanoi to receive the remains 
the remains were flown to the armys central identification 
laboratory in honolulu for analysis after a brief turnover ceremony 
at hanois noi bai airport 
the repatriation was the fourth largest since the war ended in 
april 1975 with a communist victory over the usbacked south 
vietnam government the largest was in august 1985 involving 26 
sets of remains 
earlier reports that 20 remains were to be returned today 
resulted from a misunderstanding in communications from hanoi said 
mather the head of the bangkok office of the us joint casualty 
resolution center 
the center based in hawaii is entrusted with resolving the 
fates of nearly 1800 americans listed as missing in action or mia 
mather said some of the 17 remains and three cases on which 
written reports were received were on a list of 70 high priority 
cases that us presidential envoy and retired gen john w vessey 
jr gave the vietnamese during his mission to hanoi last august 
the united states says that in these socalled discrepancy 
cases there is strong evidence the vietnamese know what happened 
to the missing men including photographs of them taken after their 
capture 
mather said each set of remains was accompanied by a written 
report containing such information as the area where the remains 
were found and what people there said about them he said the 
vietnamese also turned over identification cards and dog tags 
military identification tags which servicemen wear around their 
necks 
mather said the remains were placed in metal transfer cases and 
loaded onto a c141 transport plane for the flight to honolulu a 
us honor guard saluted as each case draped with a folded us 
flag was loaded during the halfhour ceremony he said 
a high proportion of remains returned by vietnam after a 
preliminary analysis are later confirmed by the us army 
laboratory as those of mias 
mather also announced that the vietnamese have set march 12 as 
the starting date for the next round of technical talks on mias 
during these talks which hanoi has agreed to hold six times 
annually experts on both sides discuss ways of retrieving remains 
locating warplane crash sites and related issues 
todays turnover was the third since hanoi agreed during 
vesseys visit to break a long deadlock and resume efforts to 
account for the missing men 
the united states pledged then to look into vietnams own 
humanitarian concerns and an official us medical team flew into 
hanoi today to continue that mission said the spokesman of the 
us embassy in bangkok ross petzing 
it was the fourth visit by a us medical team the teams have 
been studying the plight of disabled war veterans and other 
humanitarian cases and made recommendations on how private us 
charitable organizations can aid rehabilitation programs 
petzing said the team included dr bruce van dam an orthopedic 
surgeon at the walter reed army medical center in washington dc 
frederick downs the director of the prosthetics and sensory aids 
service of the veterans administration and laurence kerr the 
state departments desk officer for vietnam 
the vietnamese have said they prefer direct us government aid 
but washington has refused because of its embargo on aid to protest 
vietnams occupation of cambodia

a millionaire stock trader charged 
with intending to shoot financier ivan boesky has been ordered held 
without bail by a judge who rejected arguments that jail would harm 
the traders mental health 
john a mulheren 38 of rumson appeared tuesday before us 
magistrate john c manna to face two charges of attempting to 
tamper with a federal witness he was transferred to a federal 
prison in new york city 
the magistrate scheduled a friday bail hearing over the 
objections of mulherens attorney peter bennett who said his 
client suffered manicdepression 
a manicdepressive such as my client back on lithium for the 
last five days is not a risk to himself or others bennett told 
the judge jail is detrimental to his condition hes far better 
off in a private care clinic 
bennett said mulheren was on a maniccrash the day 
authorities allege he intended to shoot boesky 
authorities contend mulheren pulled out of his riverfront estate 
feb 18 with a highpowered assault rifle and army fatigues in the 
back seat of his car after police had confiscated three other 
weapons from him 
he intended to shoot boesky 50 of new york and boeskys former 
chief stock trader michael davidoff 43 of manalapan township 
according to a new jersey complaint 
before the federal hearing tuesday state superior court judge 
alvin y milberg released mulheren from the county jail where he 
was being held on the state charges 
mulheren was arrested immediately afterward by four us 
marshals flanked by an investigator from the us attorneys 
office in the southern district of new york and a federal attorney 
from new jersey authorities said 
mulheren had been held in the county jail in lieu of 17500 
bail on two weapons charges that carry a total maximum of 15 years 
in prison 
bennett told the magistrate that mulheren was not bailed out of 
the county jail for 12 days because his manicdepressive condition 
precluded him from cooperating with attorneys on a defense bennett 
asked that bail be set at tuesdays hearing 
however manna ruled in favor of terrence flynn an assistant 
us attorney who said he needed more time to prepare his case 
boesky once a close friend of mulherens and davidoff pleaded 
guilty last year to a single count of securities fraud and have 
cooperated with the governments continuing investigation of 
insider trading on wall street 
boesky paid a fine of 100 million to the securities and 
exchange commission to settle civil charges of insider trading and 
will begin serving a threeyear prison term march 24 davidoff 
faces a fiveyear term when sentenced 
mulheren is a friend of rock star bruce springsteen the singer

president reagan and 15 other allied 
leaders today began their first summit talks since 1982 in a bid to 
underscore the unity of the western alliance despite differences 
over nuclear arms strategy 
reagan the last of the leaders to arrive at sprawling nato 
headquarters made no comment as he passed a crowd of reporters and 
diplomats for the first summit session but nato secretary general 
lord carrington stressed the cohesion of the alliance 
carrington said the summit will provide nato with sustained 
impetusin a way which will reflect the fundamental solidarity 
which unites us in transatlantic partnership 
looking toward sovietamerican arms talks carrington said an 
improved soviet human rights record was fundamental to creating 
the confidence necessary to proceed with a radical arms control 
agenda 
he added for most of us in the west that cause of tension 
is the degree of mistrust created by the denial of basic human 
rights and freedom to the peoples of eastern europe and the soviet 
union 
carrington reaffirmed natos commitment supporting a proposed 
superpower agreement to reduce longrange nuclear weaponry by 50 
percent on both sides he said nato also looked forward to a more 
serious engagement with the sovietled warsaw pact on a chemical 
weapons ban and reducing the eastern blocs superiority in 
conventional arms 
central to the summit talks here was the issue of how to fill 
the gap left by reagans agreeement with soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev last december to eliminate groundlaunched mediumrange 
nuclear missiles from europe 
while the allies agreed on the need to reduce eastwest 
conventional forces a dispute remained over whether nato members 
should quickly improve their stocks of shortrange nuclear missiles 
i dont look for any glossing over at all said canadian 
prime minister brian mulroney as he arrived for the talks 
as the meeting began white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
reported that progress is fine on drafting a statement of 
common alliance goals to be issued at the conclusion of the twoday 
summit 
reagan who reached brussels coughing and complaining of 
allergies ws to spend 2 12 hours conferring with the 15 other 
heads of state or government when he arrived tuesday the 
president tried to allay concerns over the warsaw pacts advantage 
in conventional forces by promising to keep us troops in europe 
as long as europeans want them to stay 
before the summit talks began over lunch reagan met privately 
with secretary of state george shultz on the secretarys recent 
efforts to get the peace process moving in the middle east 
fitzwater told reporters that shultz has been doing yeomans 
work and that united states has made clear it wants a more 
visible role in the middle east peace process 
although fitzwater said no decision had been made he and other 
officials indicated reagan is likely to send shultz back to the 
middle east after the summit 
in his afternoon remarks to nato a session closed to reporters 
in the alliances austere central meeting hall the president was 
to repeat his assurances of the us commitment to the nato 
democracies and urge them to repel soviet attempts to split the 
pact 
the heads of state and government will discuss overall policy 
and the direction of the alliance the big picture fitzwater 
added 
fitzwater said reagan also planned to listen to his colleagues 
concerns particularly about the new round of arms control talks 
and their worries that american budget restrictions might force 
cutbacks in the 326000 us troops stationed in western europe 
we also expect them to voice support as the president 
prepares for the moscow summit fitzwater said a date hasnt 
been set but the fourth meeting between reagan and soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev is expected to be held in late may or june 
the spokesman said that while the nuts and bolts on issues such 
as troop strength would be left to lowerlevel aides reagan would 
urge the members to push forward on talks with the east bloc on 
reducing its edge in conventional forces 
now in a preliminary stage in vienna the discussions over 
conventional force reductions are expected to begin in earnest this 
fall 
planners on both sides of the atlantic have predicted that no 
major decisions will result from the nato summit the leaders are 
expected to sidestep differences over such issues as modernizing 
their own shortrange nuclear weapons arsenal and concentrate 
instead on issuing final statements that emphasize the pacts 
cohesion and resolve

michael caine has just made his eighth film in 
three years and has a tv miniseries set to roll but the 
oscarwinning star of sherlock and me says he still worries 
about being out of work 
you feel uneasy if you havent got something to do caine 
said in an interview in north londons camden town where the 85 
millionmovie was concluding its nineweek shoot 
people say i work all the time but i dont what they 
distributors do is always put the bloody things out at the same 
time 
the actors onscreen good cheer has been one of the few 
constants in the everchanging hollywood scene 
last year he played sally fields love interest in 
surrender and a british intelligence agent in the fourth 
protocol he starred in films as quintessentially american as 
jaws iv the revenge and as quintessentially english as the 
whistle blower a political thriller 
in 1986 he was a british diplomat romantically linked with call 
girl sigourney weaver in half moon street and had vivid 
supporting roles in sweet liberty and mona lisa 
then too there was his academy award last year for best 
supporting actor for his performance in hannah and her sisters 
the erstwhile cockney who was born maurice joseph micklewhite in 
1933 the son of a porter at billingsgate fish market in london 
had integrated himself into the bittersweet world of woody allens 
manhattan neurotics 
id known woody for years and i knew new york so well said 
caine i dont have a voice which is posh british anyway 
my attitude is that im more like an american coming from a 
workingclass background lots of americans think im australian 
or something like that crocodile dundees father 
caines previous oscar nominations were for alfie in 1966 
sleuth in 1972 and educating rita in 1983 
in his new film he impersonates that celebrated sleuth 
sherlock holmes caine is a boozing downonhisluck actor who is 
hired by dr watson to play the famed fictional detective to prove 
him real 
i get to play two parts and a particular hero of mine which i 
like because ive always been a great fan of holmes he said 
we have the pipe the magnifying glass everything said 
caine referring to the traditional holmes accoutrements its a 
chance to play a hero who im not really right for and to do it in 
an entirely different way as a comedy 
the film due out in the fall from orion pictures costars 
oscar winner ben kingsley gandhi as dr watson who is forced 
by public demand to find a reallife holmes to match the figure he 
has been writing about in a magazine 
caine compared his creation to the part of the inimitable

victorian london in the late 1880s 
caine said hes made a conscious effort to vary his parts and 
his performances it gives you cachet as someone who can play 
anything he said 
ive been a leading actor not a movie star who comes on and 
does the michael caine personality performance like a cary grant or 
a john wayne although i admire both of them very much

living for nine years in los angeles 
people here treat me as if id just come back from some 
fearsome jungle and survived he said americans are just like

the pilot of the delta airliner that 
crashed at dallasfort worth international airport in 1985 killing 
137 people had a pattern of use and abuse of three 
tranquilizers a government lawyer said 
attorney roy krieger suggested during his opening statement at a 
trial to determine liability for the crash that delta capt edward 
m connors might have habitually piloted jetliners under the 
influence of drugs 
krieger told us district judge david o belew jr who is 
presiding over the nonjury trial that prescription records will 
show connors took the tranquilizers dalmane in 1978 valium in 1982 
and 1984 and stelazine from 1982 to 1985 
the records will show a clear pattern of use and abuse of 
these tranquilizers over the eight years before the aug 2 1985 
crash krieger said 
the conclusion is inescapable krieger said he must have 
been taking them on the days he was flying because the 
prescription quantities were too large to have been taken only when 
he was off duty 
why should the day of the crash be any different than all the 
other days in the previous years that he was taking 
tranquilizers krieger said 
delta lawyer john martin said during a break in the trial that 
there is no evidence that connors was using stelazine at the time 
of the crash he said too little tissue was recovered from the 
crash to run tests for drugs other than alcohol those tests were 
negative 
the medical experts will show stelazine is a prescription 
tranquilizer that would not affect a persons ability to fly 
anyway martin said there are pilots who fly taking 
stelazine 
during his opening statement martin said negligence on the part 
of federal aviation administration and national weather service 
employees caused delta flight 191 to crash 
the crew of 191 found themselves in the wrong place at the 
wrong time because none of the government employees did their 
jobs he said 
martin claimed faa controllers and the weather service failed to 
warn the flight crew of the severity of weather at the airport 
a report by the national transportation safety board concluded 
that the crash was caused in part by the pilots decision to fly 
the l1011 widebody jet into a wind shear a violent downdraft 
the trial will determine whether the government must pay part of 
912 million in claims that deltas insurers have paid so far in 
the crash 
in december belew ruled that about 90 lawsuits filed by 
individuals against delta should be parceled out from federal court 
in fort worth to other federal courts about half of those suits 
have been settled

stooges for two years was found dead of an undetermined illness at 
his home his publicist said he was 80 
he had been ill for some time and wouldnt even see a 
doctor said publicist jeff lenburg bessers body was found 
tuesday by a relative lenburg said 
i go back 50 years with joe besser when i played vaudeville 
with him said comedian milton berle he was one of a kind he 
was very innovative very creative he was a darling of a man very 
congenial 
besser joined moe howard and larry fine from 1956 to 1958 and 
was one of several actors to replace shemp howard as the third 
stooge 
the three stooges specialized in headknocking eyegouging 
slapstick pratfalls and endless buffoonery the trio made more 
than 190 short films and about 50 featurelength films until the 
60s lenburg said 
besser embraced his role bouncing off his fellow stooges in a 
schtick that distinguised his character 
no matter how light the slap bessers invariable response was a 
whining not so haaaaard the stooges preposterousness 
elicited from besser an exasperated ooooh you crazy 
the original three stooges created in the vaudeville days of 
the 1920s were morris moe horowitz who changed his last name 
to howard his brother samuel shemp horowitz and larry 
fineberg who used the stage name fine 
by the early 1930s shemp had left in a pay dispute and was 
replaced by his brother jerome howard known as curly curly left 
the team in 1946 after suffering a stroke and brother shemp came 
back to replace him after shemps death in 1955 he was replaced 
by besser who in turn was replaced in 1959 by joe de rita who 
played curly joe when the trio began making feature films 
curly howard died in 1952 moe howard and fine died in 1975 de 
rita the last surviving stooge is 79 and retired lenburg said 
the character of joe became bessers trademark and he added to 
it in televisions the abbott and costello show where he 
played the mean whining brat stinky who liked to slap lou 
around 
he appeared on the abbott and costello show in the 1950s and 
60s along with regular appearances on the ken murray show and 
the joey bishop show 
besser made 250 television appearances during his 67year 
career joking with such comics as berle and jerry lewis he also 
appeared in more than 40 films 
before becoming a stooge besser worked as a comedian on 
broadway on radio and in motion pictures 
in the 1940s his portrayal of an exasperated whining child 
earned him a spot in olsen and johnsons longrunning broadway 
show sons o fun a sequel to their hellzapoppin 
besser called his association with the stooges the happiest 
years of my life in show business he was on hand in 1983 when 
the three stooges were awarded a star on the hollywood walk of fame 
besser is survived by his wife of 56 years ernie funeral 
arrangements were pending

foreign minister bill hayden today 
urged poland to allow lech walesa leader of the outlawed 
solidarity labor federation to visit australia 
he said he cabled polands foreign minister urging him to 
approve walesas application to travel to melbourne to attend a 
fourday world congress of the international confederation of free 
trade unions starting march 14 
the polish government said tuesday it would bar walesa and three 
aides from attending the congress citing the protection of 
polands basic political interests walesa and the three other 
solidarity leaders have been trying to obtain passports to allow 
them to attend the congress 
they were invited by the australian council of trade unions 
but jerzy urban the government spokesman in poland said the 
solidarity delegation would be prevented from going to the congress 
as representatives of a polish trade union which was dissolved 
and ceased to exist legally 
walesas and his colleagues trip and their participation in 
the australian congress would be contradictory to the basic 
political interests of poland and would be a mockery of our legal 
order urban told reporters 
polish law regulating passport affairs orders denials of 
passports in such cases poland has the sovereign right to protect 
its legal order 
urban criticized some australian trade union activists for 
threatening to cut off water and electricity to the polish 
consulate in sydney and the polish embassy in canberra if walesa 
and his aides are refused passports saying that such threats are 
only inflaming the atmosphere 
he said poland would not yield to the pressure of hooligan 
threats toward its diplomatic missions adding that it was 
australias duty to guarantee the functioning of polish consular 
offices 
walesa has not traveled abroad since the december 1981 
imposition of martial law that crushed solidarity 
also invited to australia were wroclaw solidarity leader 
wladyslaw frasyniuk gdansk leader bogdan lis and senior adviser 
bronislaw geremek 
walesa contacted tuesday at his gdansk apartment expressed 
surprise and disappointment now i can see that as long as urban 
and company are in power i have no chance please let me know as 
soon as you hear about urbans end said walesa the 1983 nobel 
peace prize winner 
i have no further comment he said we have to wait for 
the reaction of trade unions and other organizations 
in australia trade unionists reacted angrily to urbans 
comments 
we have a moral duty to protest against the polish 
authorities actions and to back up our verbal condemnation with a 
bit of action said michael easson assistant secretary of the 
trades and labor council of new south wales 
we reject the accusation by polish authorities that australian 
unions were behaving like hooligans for insisting that mr walesa 
by granted permission to visit australia he added 
charles weyman ethnic affairs director for the federated iron 
workers told his members to boycott polish ships and cut off 
water gas and electricity supplies to the consul in sydney and the 
embassy in canberra

authorities today acknowledged 
manifestations of antisemitism in a 1968 purge of 
intellectuals and liberals that forced thousands of jews out of the 
communist party government and academia 
an article in the communist party daily trybuna ludu said 
innocent people were harmed merely for advocating reform but it 
added that the predominant majority of party and state activists 
had no part in antisemitism 
addressing the 20th anniversary of the march 1968 event the 
1page article said some conservative nationalist party factions 
took advantage of the jewish ancestry of some of their 
political rivals 
injustice was done to many people of jewish descent as they 
were removed from political and professional positions 
irrespective of their views and conduct the paper said 
but it added all the people in the conservative faction in the 
intraparty struggle were not antisemitic and some actively 
disassociated themselves from antisemitism 
about 9000 jews lost positions in the party government 
academia and other official institutions in the purge an estimated 
12000 to 20000 jews emigrated the majority of the jewish 
population that remained after the nazi holocaust 
the first word that the party was going to issue a revised 
history of the 1968 antizionist purges came at the end of 
january in a speech by a polish historian in jerusalem 
two weeks ago the party weekly polityka printed a chronology of 
the events with a critical introduction but the trybuna ludu 
article which was reported by the staterun news agency pap and 
television has the authority of an official party statement 
speaking more generally about the persecution of liberals at the 
time the party paper said identification of the proreformatory 
movement with revisionist and antisocialist movements was a 
mistake on the part of the leadership 
it said the party leadership failed to make contact with the 
leading intellectuals who made rational proposals of 
democratization and who sought a dialogue with the authorities 
while recognizing the authority of the party 
discrimination against jews in the guise antizionism 
began after israels victory in the june 1967 middle east war but 
it accelerated sharply in 1968 
before world war ii poland was home to more than 35 million 
jews more than half the worlds jewry there are now believed to 
be between 7000 and 15000 jews with not a rabbi among them 
all the obscenities of the march 1968 propaganda campaign 
have been repeated all of them said adam michnik a prominent 
opposition activist and historian who was a student leader in 1968 
and a chief target of antisemitic attacks 
what has been done is nothing but cosmetics he said in a 
telephone interview 
a leading party theoretician and journalist ludwik krasucki 
said on polish television tuesday that the partys attempts to 
reconsider the history of the period were vital 
he expressed hope that with a thorough reexamination of the 
period in all its aspects this chapter which nevertheless 
cant be forgotten shall once and for all be closed

less than a week ago eric arturo delvalle was 
reviled in much of the hemisphere as a figurehead president of 
panama a tool of the countrys military establishment a man who 
gave panamas political system a constitutional facade 
but in a single stroke delvalle has carried out a remarkable 
political rehabilitation he has been transformed from delvalle the 
meek to delvalle the martyr 
much of the reagan administrations strategy toward panama over 
the past few days has been built around delvalle and his claim to 
be panamas constitutional president 
he is an integral part of the administrations chipmunk 
strategy toward panama keep gnawing away at panamas economy 
at military strongman manuel antonio noriegas claim to legitimacy 
and his reputation and base of support at home and abroad 
in time the administration hopes noriega will wake up find 
his hold on power has evaporated and depart his homeland quietly 
the administration wanted a democratic symbol around whom 
panamanians could rally and found one in delvalle the man who 
defied noriega the armed forces chieftain political heavyweight 
and according to a federal indictment cocaine smuggler for now 
at least delvalle has the earmarks of a panamanian version of 
corazon aquino a democratic symbol around whom opposition to 
philippine president ferdinand marcos coalesced 
delvalles image as a powerless front man dates back to when he 
took office in the fall of 1985 noriega was unhappy with the 
president at the time nicolas ardito barletta because of an 
independent streak and he forced barletta from office 
delvalle was sworn in as president under the most unpromising of 
circumstances in effect he had to behave according to noriegas 
wishes or he would end up like barletta he carried that burden for 
two years 
the image he projects nowadays is quite different a certain 
mystique has developed around delvalle since he tried to fire 
noriega and wound up out of office himself rather than flee the 
country after his dismissal he has gone into hiding issuing 
proclamations to his countrymen making videotaped messages and 
frustrating efforts by noriegas forces to locate him 
one of his chief allies these days is gabriel lewis a former 
ambassador to washington who is now a captain of the antinoriega 
campaign in exile 
to hear lewis tell it delvalle had wanted to break with noriega 
for five months but was reluctant to do so because of confusing 
signals from washington 
lewis said tuesday that noriega has been suspicious of 
delvalles intentions for some time and kept telling the president 
dont act against me because the gringos are behind me 
this was based on what noriega felt were reassuring visits by 
emissaries from washington including assistant defense secretary 
richard armitage 
one turning point occurred in early january lewis said when a 
gathering of panamanian opposition leaders met in miami and 
delvalle sent an envoy 
the emissary told us that if we gave him delvalle assurances 
that we would support him he was ready to act and dismiss 
noriega lewis said 
we sent him back a message lewis said we have heard that 
many times we want deeds and not words if you fire noriega and 
his cronies we will give you support 
contacts with lewis and other noriega opponents continued with 
some messages being passed by delvalles dentist in florida 
another turning point took place in early february when two florida 
grand juries charged that noriega was a key figure in an 
international drug smuggling ring 
with an end to the ambiguity in washingtons position the 
opposition front suggested that delvalle come here to announce his 
break with noriega before the organization of american states 
delvalle agreed and arrangements were made 
but then delvalle had second thoughts reasoning that firing 
noriega at oas headquarters in washington might be seen as acting 
on instructions from the united states lewis said but was 
delvalle getting cold feet 
at lewis instigation sen edward m kennedy dmass called 
delvalle to give him encouragement on feb 17 delvalle was in 
miami and invited assistant secretary of state elliott abrams to 
visit him 
if delvalle was ousted for trying to fire noriega abrams 
assured him the united states would support him as panamas 
constitutional president lewis said eight days later in an 
important moment in panamas tumultuous history delvalle fired 
noriega only to be dismissed himself hours later by noriegas 
allies in the national assembly 
lewis said the turn of events was foreseen in an 18point 
antinoriega conspiracy crafted by the opposition coalition 
he said the program is up to point six twelve to go

police have been guarding the offices of a 
conservative weekly newspaper that has revived stinging attacks on 
a black professor and reawakened charges of racism at dartmouth 
college 
a march through the schools fraternity row and continued 
picketing of several businesses that advertise in the dartmouth 
review were planned today and a larger rally was scheduled for 
thursday 
four review staff members face college disciplinary charges and 
possible expulsion stemming from a confrontation last week with 
william cole a music professor who once sued the paper for libel 
the staffers say they are being persecuted for taking strong 
stands on the quality of dartmouth life and education and deny 
that race has anything to do with it 
the independent newspaper also was at the center of controversy 
two years ago when 12 students mostly review staffers took 
sledgehammers to symbolic antiapartheid shanties on the campus 
green that raid sparked a semester of sitins disciplinary 
hearings and other unrest that caused a leadership crisis for 
dartmouth president david mclaughlin 
mclaughlin resigned in june 1987 though he said the 
disturbances didnt contribute directly to his decision 
as tensions rise again mclaughlins successor james freedman 
said tuesday he would urge everyone in the dartmouth community to 
take the high road to civility of expression 
freedman had a similar message monday when he spoke to 250 
students at a rally protesting the reviews attacks on cole he 
defended coles qualifications as well as the right to freedom of 
speech however unpopular provocative and offensive that speech 
may sometimes be 
cole sued the paper in 1983 for libel over an article that said 
he looks like a used brillo pad he dropped the suit in 1985 
he received no damages and both sides claimed vindication 
two weeks ago the review published a cover story calling coles 
teaching performance academically deficient and including 
excerpts from a transcript from one of his recent classes 
on thursday four review staffers approached cole after a class 
editorinchief chris baldwin said the staffers wanted to give cole 
a chance to rebut their article and to demand that he apologize 
for allegedly calling them whiteboy racists during a class 
shouting ensued and the incident ended with the professor 
allegedly breaking the camera flash of review photographer john 
quilhot the review published a photograph of an agitated cole on 
its cover in its next issue with the headline the truth hurts 
cole explodes over review criticism 
cole has not commented publicly on the incidents 
three police officers stood guard tuesday outside the reviews 
office above a hardware store a block from the dartmouth campus 
nearby hoisting signs that urged motorists to honk if you 
dont support the review about 25 people picketed the dartmouth 
bookstore and other stores that advertise in the review 
the four review staffers face punishment ranging from a fine to 
expulsion if they are found guilty of disorderly conduct 
harassment or violating coles right to privacy they are baldwin 
a junior from hinsdale ill quilhot a sophomore from fort wayne 
ind executive editor john sutter a senior from st louis and 
staff writer sean nolan a freshman from lexington mass

the foreign ministry said today that many aspects 
of soviet president andrei gromykos memoirs dealing with 
chinesesoviet relations are false 
many of the recollections and descriptions in gromykos 
memoirs relating to the history and present state of chinesesoviet 
relations do not square with the facts ministry spokeswoman li 
jinghua told a weekly news briefing 
she refused to elaborate on what elements in the memoirs china 
disputed 
the new york times quoting an advance copy of gromykos 
twovolume book memoir said gromyko claimed chinese leader mao 
tsetung proposed in 1958 that the soviet union help lure us 
troops into china and attack them there with nuclear weapons 
gromyko wrote that mao was expecting a us attack on mainland 
china because of washingtons support for the nationalist chinese 
government on taiwan and tensions over the tiny islands of quemoy 
and matsu in the taiwan strait 
gromyko said in memoir that he rejected the plan proposed 
while he was on a secret august 1958 visit to china according to 
the times 
ms li confirmed that gromyko then soviet foreign minister 
visited china in 1958 she refused to comment on the purpose of the 
trip or the content of his talks with mao 
at the time the soviet union had close ties with the younger 
communist state and provided it with economic and military aid the 
two countries split bitterly a few years later over ideological and 
strategic differences 
memoir is due to be distributed soon to soviet bookstores 
it covers nearly 50 years of soviet diplomacy including relations 
with nine us presidents from franklin d roosevelt to ronald

his 35 million libel suit against mccloskey 
in order to compete in that trial i would have to break off 
my campaign today and run the risk of losing florida texas south 
carolina and other parts of the south robertson told reporters 
in sarasota fla 
that was an impossible decision for me to make and an unfair 
one he added 
but mccloskey who insists robertson invoked his late fathers 
political influence to avoid combat in the korean war said he will 
oppose the former television evangelists request to drop the case 
i think the truth ought to be told mccloskey said on cbs 
this morning i dont know any better place to get the truth 
than in the courtroom he invoked the process he ought to go 
through with it 
mccloskey said he fears that an individual who avoided combat in 
his youth may try to make amends in the white house 
you know when you get a president in office who has evaded 
combat in his youth and all his advisers are saying look tough 
against the soviets i think there is a tendency to try to prove 
your manhood late in life mccloskey said 
robertsons lawyers called a news conference at their washington 
offices today to discuss their decision to ask us district judge 
joyce hens green to dismiss the lawsuit 
she cant force a plaintiff to continue the suit robertson 
said 
but under the civil rules of procedure the judge could force 
robertson to go to trial unless he pays mccloskeys legal expenses 
of nearly 400000 
we are prepared to go to trial said mccloskeys lawyer 
george lehner adding that the former congressman has long insisted 
that robertson pay his legal fees as a condition for any settlement 
the case involves a 1986 letter that mccloskey wrote to rep 
andrew jacobs jr dind alleging that robertson used the 
political influence of his father the late sen a willis 
robertson dva to get out of combat duty in the korean war 
mccloskey a decorated marine was aboard a troop ship from 
which robertson was removed during a stop in japan before the ship 
proceeded to korea he quoted robertson as telling fellow marines 
that his father had helped him get out of combat 
in the letter that was published by two syndicated newspaper 
columns mccloskey also said the former television evangelist was 
later assigned to be a booze officer to a rearechelon unit in 
korea 
robertson called mccloskey a patent liar 
but mccloskey a liberal republican who once sought the 
republican presidential nomination as an opponent of president 
nixons vietnam war policies has found a number of exmarines who 
served in korea who support his story 
the former congressman also said today that a willis robertson 
in letters written during the war thanked the marine corps for 
assuring that his son would not be involved in combat mccloskeys 
lawyers subpoenad the letters which had been left to william amp 
mary college 
a trial as scheduled would have resulted in extensive 
publicity about the allegations as robertson is trying to win votes 
in the presidential race as early as last fall robertson 
expressed regrets over filing the politically troublesome lawsuit 
telling time magazine in all candor i think it was a bad idea 
robertson who had earlier called judge green patently 
unfair for refusing to postpone the trial said tuesday that she 
had done everything she can to get us to drop the case 
robertson proposed that he and mccloskey submit their case to 
the iowa libel dispute program run by the university of iowas law 
school and the american arbitration association 
if mccloskey refuses robertson says he will seek to drop the 
lawsuit anyway and put the facts of the case to an unspecified 
panel of experts 
we will prove to the american people that he truly doesnt 
want the truth to come out robertson said 
lehner called the proposal for arbitration a red herring 
and noted that the idea had been rejected by robertsons own 
lawyers nine months ago

a 19yearold woman could be sentenced to 
up to four years in jail and fined 10000 in the deaths of her two 
children last summer in a locked sunbaked car 
lisa shields of white township pleaded guilty tuesday to 
reduced charges in the deaths of kristle 3 and calvin shields 1 
washington county judge john bell accepted pleas to two counts 
of endangering the welfare of children and indiana county district 
attorney william martin agreed to drop two counts of involuntary 
manslaughter no sentencing date was set 
mrs shields 24yearold husband john shields goes on trial 
march 14 on charges of involuntary manslaughter and endangering the 
welfare of children 
mrs shields stopped her trial which began monday and pleaded 
guilty after her husband testified that he had agreed to care for 
the children and had locked them in the car while his wife slept 
shields said he hid the car in which the children were sleeping 
in a sunny area at the rear of a farmhouse after a friend told him 
a warrant had been issued for his arrest because the car had no 
license plates and was not registered 
he said he closed the car windows because it was supposed to 
rain and locked the doors because i didnt want anyone taking 
my kids 
shields said he left the children in the car because the house 
was unheated and had broken windows 
earlier tuesday dr william kenney a penn state university 
assistant professor of physiology said the temperature in the car 
probably reached 150 degrees which the children could have 
withstood for 17 minutes 
both parents have been in jail since their arrests shortly after 
the childrens deaths in august

a lawyer seeking lt col oliver norths 
testimony in a drug trial says the exnational security council 
aide will refuse to answer questions by invoking his constitutional 
right against selfincrimination 
ronald c dresnick who obtained subpoenas last week against 
north and two other figures in the irancontra affair said tuesday 
he had not decided whether to pursue his bid to compel north to 
appear march 15 in us district court in detroit 
however the attorney said he believed north could provide 
information to support his claim that his client frank ivan turek 
correa of colombia was a victim of entrapment or other government 
misconduct 
dresnick said he wanted to question north about michael palmer 
a former airline pilot whom dresnick claimed was being protected 
from prosecution 
palmer accompanied correa and other defendants on an airplane 
that allegedly carried drugs from south america to michigan the 
attorney said but dresnick said he believed palmer was allowed to 
go free because the government wanted to conceal his alternate role 
in shipping food and clothing to the contra rebels trying to topple 
the government of nicaragua 
dresnick in court papers seeking to subpoena north said the 
dc6 airplane allegedly used to ship the drugs to michigan was once 
owned by vortex air international palmer is a former executive 
with both vortex and southern air transport which dresnick called 
a ciabacked operation 
i believe the government knows about palmer and must be 
aware that palmer was involved in drug smuggling dresnick said 
palmer also has been subpoenaed to testify in detroit but his 
whereabouts are unknown dresnick said the attorney said he was 
forced to subpoena north because of the governments refusal to 
produce palmer 
assistant us attorney robert donaldson acknowledged tuesday 
that palmer was not included in a sept 24 1987 indictment naming 
correa and seven other defendants he said the government had no 
interest in norths testimony and declined further comment 
dresnick said barry simon a washington attorney representing 
north told him by telephone monday that his client indicated he 
will take the fifth amendment 
if thats all thats going to happen its a little pointless 
to drag him out to detroit to say that dresnick said 
simon contacted monday night had declined to say whether north 
would appear in detroit and would not answer any other questions

a federal judge rebuked shiloh true light 
church of christ for exploiting children and cited church members 
for contempt of court for violating federal child labor laws 
us district judge robert potter also ordered two companies 
owned and operated by church members to pay 203272 to cover a 
federal investigation and litigation expenses and to pay employees 
back wages and interest 
the actions tuesday further set back the churchs campaign to 
stop what it calls government interference with its religious 
beliefs 
potter ruled that church members and the two companies mcgee 
brothers co inc of union county and wendells woodwork inc of 
mint hill violated his october 1987 order to obey federal child 
labor laws 
true light families educate their children at home the church 
also sponsors a jobtraining program that gives youths the 
opportunity to earn money while learning such trades as 
bricklaying woodworking and sewing 
church members acknowledged during the trial they used their 
children some as young as 9 at construction sites and in 
workshops where they carried bricks laid foundations and more 
recently operated forklifts and power saws they said they had 
been doing that for at least 100 years 
in october potter ordered children to stop working for the 
companies when the owners of the companies continued the program 
for the church the labor department asked they be found in 
contempt 
in separate judgments potter ordered both companies again to 
obey the laws and warned that mcgee brothers would be fined 10000 
and wendells woodwork 5000 for each day the companies remain in 
contempt of his order 
in addition potter said wendells two owners wendell long and 
herbert long would be fined 500 each per day that they remained 
in contempt of his order the five brothers who own mcgee brothers 
face fines of 1000 per day each if they remain in contempt 
potter also ordered mcgee brothers to pay 133890 in back wages 
and interest to employees who had not been paid minimum wages and 
for overtime work 
calls to both companies offices and the offices of their 
attorneys for comment were not returned 
we feel like our freedom of religion and freedom of worship 
has been violated said rommie purser the churchs minister 
we just plan to go on to the supreme court and see if we arent 
being denied freedom of worship 
in a january trial the labor department charged the owners of 
the two companies all of whom are members of the church with 
violating the federal statute against child labor 
the judge wrote in his 58page opinion that the children 
employed are children doing adults work and regardless of the 
label defendants have attached to them ie trainees in shiloh 
vocational training program they are manifestly being exploited 
by defendants in this case whether or not they proclaim their 
purpose to be in furtherance of their religious beliefs

vice president george bush buoyed by 
polls showing him with a comfortable lead in the south said today 
no candidate can win the nomination without winning on super 
tuesday 
you cannot design a strategy to be president of the united 
states without doing well in the super tuesday states bush said 
at a breakfast with supporters here at the start of a campaign day 
that will take him to alabama mississippi louisiana and south 
carolina 
bush said tuesday he wants to keep a rather high plane in 
the closing days of the super tuesday campaign 
but when asked about a television advertisement in which dole 
attacks him on the irancontra affair bush told reporters well 
see whether it helps him but i think i have every right to set the 
record straight you ought not to be surprised if you see some 
comparative ads 
you know were not going to sit out there unprotected he 
added 
after a swing through south florida on tuesday bush planned to 
breakfast today with senior citizens in pinellas county then head 
on to mississippi and louisiana campaign events 
bush said that he is confident but not cocky about the campaign 
for the march 8 super tuesday of 20 primaries and caucuses most in 
the south a washington postabc poll released today gave him a 31 
lead over dole 
two weeks ago yesterday the polls in new hampshire where he 
won the primary showed me on the canvas and the voters said 
different im not going to get overconfident because polls show 
him leading in the south said bush 
the vice president campaigned tuesday with former sen barry 
goldwater the 1964 republican presidential nominee from arizona 
and florida gov bob martinez 
in recent days dole has made a point of saying he is the only 
candidate tough enough to deal with the problems a president 
faces 
bush replied with an appearance that played up his combat 
record when he arrived at the tampa airport a grumman avenger 
plane the same model he flew during world war ii had been brought 
from a nearby air museum he climbed into the cockpit 
later bush drove a paving machine at the construction site of a 
north miami beach development

the mediator through nearly six years of peace 
talks on afghanistan opened a crucial and perhaps final round today 
and said he was sure it would lead to the withdrawal of soviet 
troops 
un mediator diego cordovez said difficult problems 
remained but that he believed both sides were determined to 
overcome them and reach a settlement as soon as possible 
cordovez said the negotiations would last as long as was 
necessary to forge that settlement 
perhaps it will be signed earlier than you think he added 
i have the impression that the afghan people are tired of this 
conflict that they will want peace cordovez said he did not 
specify what problems remained citing a need of confidentiality 
that allowed the parties to be flexible 
cordovez spoke to reporters shortly before beginning his shuttle 
between the pakistani and afghan delegations seated in separate 
rooms in the geneva office of the united nations 
the indirect format was adopted because pakistan representing 
the antimarxist afghan guerrillas does not recognize the 
sovietbacked afghan government of president najib 
cordovez said he had been in contact with representatives of 
several countries including the united states the soviet union 
the european community and australia to discuss humanitarian aid 
to afghanistan after a settlement 
i have the feeling that there will be a broad international 
effort he said 
pakistan has insisted that pullout of the 115000 soviet troops 
from afghanistan be accompanied by formation of a broadbased 
transitional government to replace the afghan regime 
the soviets intervened in 1979 to back the kabul government 
against moslem insurgents 
pakistans chief negotiator minister of state zain noorani 
said pakistan came to geneva with a constructive attitude to 
finalize the text of the peace package 
the head of the afghan delegation foreign minister abdul wakil 
did not renew charges that pakistans demand for an interim 
government threatens to thwart a settlement 
both held separate news conferences on tuesday 
wakil said he approached the talks with a sense of full 
optimism 
asked whether pakistan would sign the peace package with the 
najib government noorani said that would be decided after 
consultations in islamabad on sunday with national leaders 
including opposition leaders 
the geneva talks will recess to allow noorani to take part in 
those talks 
noorani said pakistan would continue to press for an interim 
government acceptable to all afghans to be created in conjunction 
with a soviet withdrawal 
otherwise he said there is a threat of new bloodshed 
preventing the return to afghanistan of more than 3 million refuges 
from pakistan and another 2 million from iran 
we also seek cooperation of the soviet union said noorani 
we feel that after 8 years of occupation the soviets owe it to 
the people of afghanistan to give them a durable peace 
wakil said afghanistan has no preconditions for the makeup of 
the future government 
but seven pakistanbased resistance movements that claim to 
speak for the about 200000 moslem guerrillas have ruled out any 
powersharing with najib last week they presented their own plan 
for an islamic government 
kabul immediately rejected the plan which noorani described as 
a positive proposal 
the talks have moved rapidly since soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachevs feb 8 announcement that moscow would bring its troops 
home within 10 months starting may 15 provided a geneva settlement 
is signed by march 15 
noorani said the march 15 date is not all that important and 
that he is sure soviet withdrawal plans would not be upset if the 
signing came later 
he said the timetable for the pullout is now within negotiable 
range but he indicated there are still considerable differences 
pakistan wants at least half the soviet troops to leave during 
the first three months of a pullout noorani said gorbachev has 
been vague on the subject which is directly related to the 
question of a cutoff in western aid to the guerrillas 
the united states is reported to have given the guerrillas 700 
million last year 
wakil said agreements already drawn up provide for the cutoff to 
coincide with the start of the soviet pullout 
the afghan monarchy was overthrown in 1978 and a communist 
government was installed the soviets intervened at the request of 
the embattled new marxist government

the doctor for three aidsexposed brothers 
who were ostracized in their hometown has retracted his diagnosis 
of aidsrelated complex for the oldest boy 
jerry barbosa testified at a hearing tuesday that he earlier 
made the diagnosis for 11yearold ricky ray because he felt 
compelled to under a judges order 
aidsrelated complex or arc often is a precursor to acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome there is no known cure for aids 
the way i interpreted the order i had no choice but to label 
this patient as having arc against my clinical judgment barbosa 
told us magistrate elizabeth a jenkins 
the purpose of tuesdays hearing was to clarify earlier reports 
that the physician had diagnosed arc in the youth weeks before 
reporting it to the court 
on jan 29 us district judge elizabeth kovachevich modified 
an earlier order and required barbosa to report the progress of 
any aids aids symptomology or other aidsrelated syndrome 
her wording prompted him to say in his feb 2 report that ricky 
had developed arc barbosa said 
but ricky has not exhibited physical symptoms necessary for such 
a finding although the boys blood tests might support an arc 
diagnosis the doctor said he also cited april 1987 guidelines 
issued by the federal centers for disease control in atlanta that 
prohibit labeling any child under age 13 as having arc 
it doesnt mean much to the court that somebody has or doesnt 
have arc ms jenkins said when material changes in the boys 
health occurs it is not up to the court to try to look behind the 
medical reports to see what is there 
when ms kovachevich ruled aug 5 1987 that the desoto county 
school system had to readmit the ray brothers to regular classes 
she ordered aids testing of the boys every six months and said any 
changes in their condition had to be reported to her 
ms jenkins told attorneys for the rays and the school board to 
devise an improved way to keep the court informed about the 
hemophiliac brothers medical conditions the attorneys must submit 
the plan by monday 
ricky robert 10 and randy 8 were banned from regular 
classes after they tested positive for the aids antibody in august 
1986 doctors say the children were apparently exposed to the aids 
virus through infusions of blood products that aim to promote 
clotting 
soon after the boys began school in arcadia last fall amid a 
boycott and protests by other students parents an arsonist 
torched the ray home since then the family has moved to sarasota 
where the ray children have attended public school without incident

a group of 300 austrians has asked state 
prosecutors to investigate whether president kurt waldheim can be 
prosecuted on suspicion of murder a spokesman for the group said 
today 
a petition asking that waldheim be prosecuted in connection with 
his world war ii service as an officer in the nazi army has been 
circulating among intellectuals and at antiwaldheim demonstrations 
for the past three weeks 
the leftwing vienna magazine falter today published the text of 
the complaint which it said was signed by 300 people including 
two prominent writers robert jungk and erich fried 
walter oswalt a journalist and spokesman for the group said 
the complaint was sent to the vienna state prosecutors office by 
registered mail and was delivered this morning 
later waldheim asked state prosecutors to sue falter on grounds 
of defamation and asked that it be removed from newsstands the 
presidents spokesman gerold christian said 
waldheim has initiated four other similar suits including one 
against the west german news magazine der spiegel which published 
a document last month purportedly linking waldheim to the 
deportation of civilians to prison camps in 1944 the magazine 
later said the document was a forgery and apologized for publishing 
it 
a spokesman for the state prosecutors office said privacy laws 
prevent the office confirming the receipt of the austrian groups 
complaint 
the complaint quoted extensively from a historians report on 
waldheims wartime service published feb 9 and from other 
material to back its request for an investigation of waldheim on 
suspicion of murder 
it cited an article in austrias criminal code saying that not 
only the direct perpetrator commits the punishable act but also a 
person who persuades another person to commit it or who otherwise 
contributes to its perpetration 
the historians report concluded that waldheim had concealed his 
record as a german army lieutenant in the balkans during world war 
ii it also said he was in close proximity to some nazi 
atrocities knew about them and did nothing to prevent them 
christian asked for a reaction to the complaint said only that 
legal proceedings were constitutionally impossible 
under article 63 of the austrian constitution a president can 
be prosecuted only if both houses of austrias parliament agree to 
it 
waldheim has said the report exonerates him from accusations 
linking him to war crimes but the historians left open the 
question of guilt 
waldheim has consistently denied any links with alleged war 
crimes and has insisted he will stay in office despite increasing 
pressure to resign he was elected to a sixyear term in june 1986 
three months after his service in the balkans was first disclosed 
the us justice department has barred waldheim from the united 
states as an undesirable alien 
the israeli member of the historians commission yehuda l 
wallach has said the report could serve as a basis for an 
investigation of whether waldheim could be prosecuted 
the west german historian on the panel manfred messerschmidt 
said in an interview published feb 25 in the munich daily 
sueddeutsche zeitung that legal steps could be considered over 
waldheims role in the fate of british commandos executed in greece 
in 1944 
last month british prime minister margaret thatcher ordered a 
renewed investigation into that episode by british authorities 
parts of messerschmidts interview were quoted in the text of 
the complaint against waldheim 
messerschmidt said in connection with the 1944 episode i 
think that from the point of view of penal law one could think 
about whether this was not assistance in murder 
justice ministry spokesman gerhard litzka said that under 
austrian law the state prosecutors office is bound to examine 
such a complaint and to deliver a recommendation to the justice 
ministry on whether or not to open legal proceedings

a spokesman says shrimpers will defy a 
federal regulation requiring the use of devices designed to save 
endangered sea turtles despite a federal judges decision to 
enforce the regulation 
to further complicate matters louisiana wildlife and fisheries 
agents are prohibited by state law from enforcing the federal 
regulation requiring use of turtle excluder devices which 
shrimpers claim could ruin their business 
federal enforcement of the regulations began tuesday after us 
district judge patrick carr threw out a suit by shrimpers that 
claimed that the devices cut down on their shrimp catches and 
arent effective 
but louisianas department of wildlife and fisheries is bound by 
a state law forbidding enforcement of the federal law said phil 
bowman assistant chief of the seafood division 
well have to consult with legal counsel before we know what 
to do he said 
tee john mialjevich spokesman for concerned shrimpers of 
louisiana vowed defiance despite carrs ruling 
i dont care if he upheld it its a bad law and the 
shrimpers aint going to live by it he said 
the law also went into effect tuesday in texas mississippi and 
alabama waters and has been in effect in florida since jan 1 
louisiana waters wont open to shrimping for two months but big 
boats work yearround in federal waters beyond the threemile limit 
coast guard patrols caught six shrimp boats working without the 
devices since the law went into effect in florida suzanne montero 
of the national marine fisheries service said by telephone from st 
petersburg fla 
there were no reports of violations tuesday she said 
the maximum civil penalty is 10000 but firsttime offenders 
will probably be fined 5000 to 7500 she said 
under the law most shrimpers will be required to use the 
cagelike devices to save turtles protected under the endangered 
species act the devices which fit in shrimp nets have slats to 
force a trapped turtle out of a flap but critics say they dont 
always work that way 
critics said sometimes shrimp escape and debris gets caught in 
the frame and ruins the net 
mialjevich said florida shrimpers experienced catch reductions 
of 35 percent to 50 percent 
im telling you myself personally im not going to pull a 
ted turtle exclusion device because i cant make a living ill 
lose everything ive accumulated in 45 years i cant take a 1 
percent shrimp loss how am i going to take a 35 percent loss 
said mialjevich 
carr had said in advance that his ruling would not determine the 
effectiveness of the devices but would address only whether the 
government had followed proper procedures

assemblies of god leaders in louisiana have 
rejected a request by national church officials to toughen their 
recommended sanctions against evangelist jimmy swaggart a church 
official says 
juleen turnage spokeswoman at church headquarters in 
springfield mo said today that national church officers have not 
been informed of any decision by the louisiana district 
the louisiana official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said tuesday the 19member state presbytery decided at a ninehour 
meeting monday in alexandria to resubmit its original 
recommeendation that swaggart be barred from preaching for three 
months as part of a twoyear program of rehabilitation 
the official said it would now be up to national assemblies of 
god officials to decide whether to accept the state panels 
recommendation 
the assemblies general presbytery has a regular session 
scheduled march 29 but an emergency session could be convened 
sooner 
mrs turnage said at least three of the officers must attend any 
meeting of the executive presbytery she said it would be at least 
thursday before three of the officials will be back in springfield 
mrs turnage said she talked by telephone tuesday night with the 
rev g raymond carlson the general superintendent of the church 
who said he believes it would be unprecedented for a state 
presbytery to reject the national churchs recommendations 
asked about reports last week from from friends of swaggart that 
he might leave the church if he feels the punishment is too harsh 
mrs turnage said national officers have heard nothing directly 
from swaggart 
were not dealing with a radical or a rebel here if he does 
leave the church it will be because his ministry cant survive 
without him it will be a pragmatic decision she said 
i think he is very committed to the church mrs turnage 
said 
the louisiana presbyterys original sanction was a twoyear 
rehabilitation program that also included counseling for swaggart 
who heads a ministry that reportedly takes in 150 million a year 
swaggart stepped down from the pulpit feb 21 telling the 
congregation at his baton rouge worship center in a tearful 
confession that he had sinned against his wife and god swaggart 
reportedly paid a prostitute to pose nude for him and then tried to 
make a deal with a minister who confronted him about it 
the national presbytery reportedly recommended barring swaggart 
from the pulpit and television for a year with an additional year 
of regulation of his ministry afterward 
a louisiana assemblies of god official contacted tuesday night 
by the associated press confirmed that the state panel stood by its 
previous punishment for the evangelist the decision originally was 
reported by katctv of layfayette 
when asked if louisiana officials had sent back their original 
censure to the churchs national leaders the source said it 
would be correct to say that 
cecil janway the assemblies of god district superintendent for 
louisiana had said any actions made monday by the state board 
would not be made public 
there was no indication whether swaggart attended that meeting 
the rev jim rentz who is substituting for swaggart at his family 
worship center did attend 
forrest hall secretarytreasurer of the louisiana district 
council acknowledged monday that national assemblies of god 
representatives also were at the meeting

evicted the last resident of the lorraine motel where martin 
luther king jr was assassinated 20 years ago 
jacqueline smith who has lived at the motel for 11 years 
refused to obey an eviction order in protest of attempts to build 
an 88 million museum at the site she has said the project would 
force poor people out of the neighborhood 
king was shot by an assassin april 4 1968 while in memphis to 
help organize a strike by sanitation workers

the federal aviation administration will 
require the boeing co to install 10 exit doors in its new 747 
passenger jetliners rather than the eight the company prefers the 
agencys chief said today 
faa administrator allan mcartor told a house subcommittee that 
for safety reasons he had decided to issue a final rule that would 
require the additional doors and expected it to be ready by late 
summer 
a boeing official however told the lawmakers that having eight 
doors would be safe 
prudence mcartor said when asked during a break in the 
hearing about why he had made his decision just a concern of 
safety 
boeing plans to soon begin building a new line of the widebody 
747s whose first generation went into service in 1970 the 
aircraft which can carry more than 500 passengers are the most 
frequently used jetliners for international travel and are also 
commonly used for coasttocoast flights within the united states 
there are currently eightexit versions of the 747s used by 
foreign airlines but they carry only 440 passengers 
mcartor told the house public works investigations subcommittee 
that the new rule would require a maximum of 60 feet between exit 
doors for aircraft flown by us airlines this would in effect 
require 10 doors in the 747s 
in testimony prepared for delivery to the subcommittee boeing 
vice president orvil m roetman contested mcartors decision 
data tests inservice experience and analysis all show that 
the 747 distances between exit doors with either eight or 10 doors 
on the main deck are more than adequate for providing safe 
evacuation he said

days of diplomatic shuttling in the area and a critical session 
tuesday in london with king hussein of jordan 
all countries in the region believe it is useful for the 
united states to remain engaged in this process reagan said 
we will spare no effort in our search for a comprehensive 
settlement 
shultz will leave from brussels after the windup of a nato 
summit meeting thursday he is expected to make stops in israel 
jordan and egypt before returning to washington next weekend 
marlin fitzwater the white house spokesman told reporters 
earlier today the president has said on a number of occasions 
the united states wants a more visible role in the middle east in 
terms of trying to be helpful that we were willing and eager to 
participate in any way that could move the peace process forward 
the us spokesman said shultz was doing yeomans work in 
trying to promote negotiations 
a us official who demanded anonymity said hussein had not 
thrown cold water on the us initiative but also had not 
endorsed it 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir had a similar reaction 
if i had to describe the situation i would say that nobody 
has signed up to our proposals but everybody wants us to keep 
working shultz said tuesday in tel aviv 
yossi benaharon directorgeneral of shamirs office said both 
jordan and israel had asked shultz to continue his mediation 
effort however 
shultz saw reagan briefly tuesday night on the presidents 
arrival from washingtoon but they really didnt get a chance to 
talk about the middle east fitzwater said 
we will see where it goes from here the us spokesman 
said there is no decision at this point 
hussein is demanding an active soviet role in peace talks and 
participation by the palestine liberation organization as he sole 
representative of the 15 million palestinian arabs who live under 
israeli control in the west bank and in gaza 
shamir menawhile refuses to deal with the plo which is 
considered to be a terrorist group both by israel and the united 
states and wants also to block participation by the soviets who 
have backed arab positions in the past and do not have diplomatic 
relations with israel 
shultz has made a point of emphasizing a need for us 
communications with the palestinians despite a ban on plo 
contacts theres not a substitute for directly sitting down with 
people he said tuesday and thats in a sense what weve been 
calling for all along

anglican archbishop desmond tutu said 
today he would try to persuade western governments to break all 
diplomatic ties with south africa until it eased restrictions on 
antiapartheid groups 
we want to tell the south african government that they do not 
deserve to be part of a decent society he said at a news 
conference 
tutu said western nations should cut any diplomatic links with 
south africa and expel south african diplomats from their countries 
britain and america and west germany have kept saying that 
sanctions hurt blacks and sanctions are not effective he said 
while not withdrawing my support for economic sanctions i am 
saying to britain west germany and other western countries here 
is your chance 
tutu was in the kenyan capital for a meeting of the allafrican 
conference of churches which he heads 
he said he has called in the past for western governments to 
break relations with pretoria but he said this time he intended to 
actively campaign for such a move 
my own intention now is to challenge the west to break off 
diplomatic relations with south africa to expel south african 
diplomats from their countries until certain conditions are met 
the churchman said 
those conditions are a lifting of the state of emergency 
reversal of a feb 25 ruling that outlawed political activity by 18 
opposition groups and the release of political detainees 
especially children 
tutu winner of the 1984 nobel peace prize and other churchmen 
were arrested monday when they attempted to march on the south 
african parliament at cape town to protest the crackdown on black 
opposition groups 
the rev allan boesak president of the world alliance of 
reformed churches also was arrested in an interview with cbs 
this morning from harare zimbabwe he said it is clear that the 
government now is outlawing all legitimate peaceful activity 
and that apartheid opponents have no choice but to resist 
and if that means confrontation if that means disobedience to 
your unjust laws then i think that is exactly what we mean he 
said we are talking about the possibility of civil 
disobedience 
he said nonviolent protests have ended in deaths in the past 
but wont be a deterrent to civil disobedience 
we will have to take the risks that go with it and we will 
have to take the consequences that follow these actions of ours 
he said

an irish republican army member convicted of 
killing a british army officer has been selected honorary grand 
marshal of philadelphias st patricks day parade 
after initially rejecting joseph patrick thomas doherty last 
week the board of the st patricks day observance association 
reconsidered this week after some members vociferously voiced 
their feelings city councilman and board member francis w 
rafferty said tuesday 
thomas j gibson this years grand marshal and a charter member 
of the st patricks day association and other board members had 
questioned whether any honorary grand marshal should be selected 
this year for the march 13 parade 
i think it takes away from what the parade was organized

religious parade a catholic religious parade and theres 
nothing in there the association constitution that says we should 
go in for these kinds of politics 
doherty 33 has been held in new york citys metropolitan 
correctional center since 1983 on charges he illegally entered the 
country using a false passport after he escaped from a belfast 
prison 
requests by the british government to have doherty extradited 
have been rejected he faces a life sentence in northern ireland 
the us attorney general began reviewing the case last year 
according to dohertys attorney stephen somerstein 
doherty has been named honorary grand marshal in st patricks 
day parades in hartford conn and bergen county nj in past 
years said somerstein irish solidarity day in new york was 
dedicated to him last year he said 
dohertys mother maureen is expected to attend the parade

community and the state vice president of the ancient order of

new york city subway gunman bernhard goetz 
jr will inherit 140550 from his fathers estate but the sum 
will hardly cover legal bills stemming from his 1984 shooting of 
four teenagers a lawyer said 
besides four years worth of unpaid legal fees for the shooting 
in a subway train goetz is being sued for 63 million by three of 
the four black teenagers he shot 
the inheritance wont go very far in defending him on 
anything said joseph kelner who has defended goetz free of 
charge in the civil cases 
kelner also said tuesday that he planned to drop goetz as a 
client saying goetz has been uncooperative 
goetz last october was sentenced to six months in jail and five 
years probation for carrying an unlicensed gun which he used to 
shoot the young men a jury acquitted him of more serious charges 
including attempted murder 
he is free on 5000 bond pending appeal 
goetz his brother and two sisters are to share the 56220092 
remaining in the estate of their father bernhard willard goetz sr 
of orlando orange county probate court records show 
goetz sr 78 died sept 4 1984 the day goetz paid 400 for 
two 9mm pistols at kens firearms inc giving his fathers address 
as his goetzs father had moved to orlando in 1963 from rhinebeck 
ny where the family owned a dairy a bookbinding company and 
several real estate parcels 
a lawyer for one of the shooting victims james ramseur

the supreme court today gave cities at least 
for now additional protection from lawsuits that accuse 
lowerranking city officials of violating the rights of employees 
by a 71 vote the justices threw out a 15000 award st louis 
was ordered to pay james j praprotnik a fired city architect 
but the seven justices voting to overturn the award were sharply 
split in their reasoning only four justices joined in the courts 
main opinion leaving open the possibility that a future case could 
prompt a different result 
todays ruling therefore may leave local officials confused 
over what standards apply in determining when cities can be held 
legally responsible for violating individual rights 
justice sandra day oconnor who wrote the courts main opinion 
said cities may not be held liable unless those who claim their 
rights were violated prove the existence of an unconstitutional 
municipal policy 
she said praprotnik cannot win his case by claiming that 
highranking city officials such as the mayor and city aldermen 
failed to override decisions by subordinates who may have violated 
praprotniks rights 
simply going along with discretionary decisions made by ones 
subordinates is not a delegation to them of the authority to 
make policy oconnor said 
praprotnik was a manager in st louis community development 
agency when in 1980 he became embroiled with his superiors over the 
proposed installation by the city of a controversial sculpture 
praprotnik was suspended for 15 days but the city civil service 
commission reinstated him with back pay 
then in 1982 he was transferred to another city agency the 
heritage and urban design division and his job responsibilities 
were reduced the transfer also meant a loss in seniority that 
exposed him to being laid off 
he was fired dec 30 1983 a day after he was released from a 
hospital where he had undergone surgery the layoff cost him his 
income more than 500 hours of accumulated sick leave and other 
pension and vacation benefits 
city officials said he was fired for budgetary reasons 
praprotnik then sued under a federal civil rights law charging 
he was shunted to a deadend job and then kicked out because of his 
appeal to the civil service commission for his suspension back in 
1980 
a jury awarded him 30000 the 8th us circuit court of 
appeals reduced the amount to 15000 
the appeals court said there was sufficient evidence to support 
praprotniks claim that he was fired for exercising his 
constitutional rights 
the appeals court said the city was liable even though the jury 
exonerated the individual officials sued by praprotnik 
oconnor said the appeals courts ruling was too broad in 
allowing the city to be sued based on decisions made by those who 
lacked policymaking authority 
federal courts are not justified in assuming that municipal 
policymaking authority lies somewhere other than where the 
applicable state law purports to put it she said 
in praprotniks case she said that authority rests with the 
mayor the city aldermen and the civil service commission 
the justices ordered further lower court hearings in the case to 
determine whether praprotnik still has a viable case 
oconnor was joined by chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices byron r white and antonin scalia 
justice william j brennan in a separate opinion said he was 
worried that the courts main opinion embraces a theory of 
municipal liability that is both unduly narrow and unrealistic and 
one that ultimately would permit municipalities to insulate 
themselves from liability for the acts of all but a small minority 
of actual city policymakers 
he was joined by justices thurgood marshall and harry a 
blackmun 
justice john paul stevens dissented voting to uphold 
praprotniks lower court victory justice anthony m kennedy who 
only recently joined the court did not take part in the decision 
the case is st louis vs praprotnik 86772

a ship carrying incinerator ash from 
philadelphia wont be allowed to return to tie up here until there 
is an agreement about cleaning up 2000 to 4000 tons of ash 
reportedly left in haiti a lawyer says 
bruce phillips attorney for joseph paolino amp sons inc which 
has a contract with the city to dispose of the ash said the khian 
sea would be allowed to dock at paolinos pier only after there is 
an agreement on cleaning up the ash in gonaives haiti 
we want an enforceable covenant that the material will be 
removed from haiti or disposed of in an environmentally sound 
manner phillips said 
robert cordes president of the ships operator amalgamated 
shipping co of freeport bahamas declined to comment when reached 
at his office by the philadelphia inquirer 
phillips said paolino will not be paid unless it can show the 
ash has been disposed of legally 
the ship had been turned away from six countries while wandering 
the caribbean and the atlantic seeking a dumping spot it anchored 
at the mouth of delaware bay north of lewes del on tuesday 
in addition to the question about the ash in haiti the ships 
80mile voyage up the delaware river to philadelphia was delayed by 
inspections and a pier fire 
the coast guard refused to allow the ship to proceed until it 
passed an inpsection by the american bureau of shipping 
the coast guard said this morning that the ship passed an 
inspection conducted tuesday and that the captain of the port has 
determined the ship is safe to transit us waters the coast 
guard said 
no time was set for the khian sea to travel upriver its radar 
system still didnt work and the coast guard said the ship is 
restricted to daytime traveling 
the environmental group greenpeace has labeled the khian seas 
cargo toxic state tests conducted when the ash was loaded found no 
dangerous levels of toxins and recent federal tests from the same 
incinerator came to the same conclusions 
the fire department meanwhile is investigating a rubbish fire 
at the paolini pier this morning the fire damaged a transfer 
station a company official said 
coast guard spokesman scott miller said the city will appoint an 
independent engineering firm to determine the safety of the pier 
and whether the khian sea will be able to dock there 
paolino is expected to send the residue to an ohio landfill 
where the bulk of the citys ash has been dumped for the past two 
years said phillips

former first lady rosalynn carter said 
wednesday that mental illness was americas no 1 health problem as 
a house panel opened hearings on a plan to increase spending on 
care and services for mentally ill senior citizens 
the elderly mental health initiative advanced by rep edward 
roybal dcalif would increase outlays for communitybased 
services for the elderly and their families on research into 
prevention treatment and services and on training for health care 
professionals 
it also would lift the lifetime limit on inpatient psychiatric 
care paid by medicare and expand medicare to cover more outpatient 
and communitybased mental health services and it would require 
medicaid to cover communitybased services as well 
in addition the roybal bill would create a consumer bill of 
rights and set up a national mental health education program 
now is the time for federal action roybal said in opening a 
hearing on the subject for far too long mental health care has 
been a neglected priority 
the roybal bill would authorize 161 million in new spending in 
its first year most of it to expand mental health grants to 
states the money does not include added expenditures under the 
medicare and medicaid programs for which roybal did not provide an 
estimate 
according to a report compiled by roybals house select 
committee on aging between 15 percent and 25 percent of americans 
over 65 about 7 million people have significant mental health 
problems very few receive appropriate care the report said 
mrs carter and ohio gov richard celeste told roybals 
committee the federal government needs to pay more attention to 
mental health needs and spend more on them 
she called mental health americas no 1 health problem she 
recommended substantially higher spending channeled through states 
improvements in medicare and medicaid coverage and strengthening 
of patient advocacy services such as the nursing home ombudsman 
program 
one of my most urgent pleas is for adequate insurance coverage 
for mental illnesses mrs carter said i think the congress 
should do everything possible to assure this coverage it is is 
another of our sadly neglected needs 
celeste stressed the need for communitybased services for the 
elderly and the relatives who take care of them 
it is a family and community issue it impacts on all of us at 
one time or another he said many of us here today know 
firsthand the responsibility of caring for an elderly family 
member 
rep claude pepper dfla said more than 25 percent of all 
suicides are committed by the elderly indicating in many cases 
the desperation that they feel he also said more than half the 
patients in nursing homes have alzheimers disease

it might have sounded corny if said by 
someone else someplace else but this was elizabeth dole and the 
praise of her presidential candidate husband struck a pleasing 
chord with her fellow north carolinians 
he kind of reminds me of a laser beam mrs dole said im 
in awe of the way he can cut through the complexities of a tough 
issue and come up with an answer 
the crowd responded with applause and approving smiles 
standing atop a platform in the parking lot of a suburban office 
complex the former transportation secretary spoke with feeling 
about the decision she had made days before to relinquish her 
cabinet post and become a fulltime campaigner 
this is where my roots are said the onetime debutante and 
beauty queen from salisbury nc this is home this is where i 
draw my strength 
george bush boasts a superior organization and pat robertson has 
his invisible army but bob dole has had his own notsosecret 
weapon in the battle for southern votes next week on super tuesday 
the weapon he says is elizabeth dole known as liddy whose 
oldsouth charm and ivy league credentials propelled her from 
smalltown north carolina to the reagan cabinet she has shown a 
talent for holding crowds in the palm of her hand 
shes a vivacious bright enthusiastic campaigner said 
haley barbour a mississippi consultant and former political 
adviser in the reagan white house i think other southerners will 
feel a kinship to her 
mrs dole agreed last fall to step down as transportation 
secretary and hit the campaign trail making what she said was one 
of the toughest decisions of her life some feminists complained 
saying she had squandered on opportunity to debunk the traditional 
image of the candidates wife 
but mrs dole 51 said there was nothing demeaning about her 
change of course 
i mean this is a challenging assignment to be discussing 
national and international issues with the press and the public 
she said then i will be lucky if i get to see bob very much at 
all it is not just standing at his side and smiling 
she spent the fall crisscrossing the south speaking at rallies 
giving interviews lining up commitments among gop activists and 
raising money for the kansas senator 
observers say the final vote counts on tuesday may well show 
vice president bush not senate republican leader dole the big 
winner in the south but that wouldnt mean mrs dole failed they 
say 
shes a charmer but theres only so much you can do said 
ted arrington a republican activist and political scientist at the 
university of north carolina at charlotte 
tim archie the dole campaigns deputy press secretary said 
she laid the groundwork for our presence in the south she 
represents the region can pull in a crowd and her experience in 
the administration is useful 
shes also been credited with helping dole change the image as a 
slashing campaigner acquired in his 1976 quest for the vice 
presidency she speaks of his compassion and courage qualities she 
says are most evident closeup 
campaign strategists considered mrs doles votegetting 
potential important enough to hustle her to iowa in the weeks 
leading up to that states caucuses which dole won 
mrs dole grew up in a small conservative town in the north 
carolina piedmont the only daughter of welltodo parents she was 
a debutante at age 18 and two years later was student body 
president of the womens college at duke university she graduated 
from harvard law school and went to washington where she spent two 
decades in various government posts including the federal trade 
commission 
in 1976 shortly after her marriage to dole she took a leave of 
absence to help him run for vice president in 1979 she quit the 
ftc to join doles presidential campaign

israeli troops hunting for 
arab protesters today fired tear gas into the reception area of a 
hospital emergency room driving out dozens of elderly patients 
doctors said 
palestinians hurled firebombs and troops fired tear gas in 
scattered clashes throughout the night in the occupied west bank 
and gaza strip where violent protests have occurred daily since 
dec 8 
violence erupted for the second consecutive day at the 
governmentrun ramallah hospital about eight miles north of 
jersusalem the latest in a recent series of intense clashes at 
medical facilities in the occupied territories 
about a dozen israeli troops outside the hospital compound were 
confronted by rockhurling palestinian protesters who blocked a 
nearby street one smoking canister landed in the reception area of 
the emergency room and another landed in a hospital courtyard 
doctors said 
two physicians donned gas masks and others held onions to their 
noses to blunt the effects of the tear gas one doctor said about 
30 patients including elderly people were driven outside 
even the doctors couldnt breathe so imagine the effects on 
the patients inside many of whom are seriously ill said a 
doctor who spoke on condition of anonymity 
arab doctors say injured palestinians often are reluctant to 
come to hospitals for fear of being arrested by israeli authorities 
while under treatment 
but hospitals also have often become refuges for arab 
demonstrators fleeing arrest after violent confrontations with 
soldiers 
soldiers detained three youths outside the hospital including 
one with a gash on his forehead and bleeding from the shoulder he 
was seen being dragged by a soldier 
on tuesday three soldiers had burst into the same hospital 
fired tear gas and rubber bullets and struck two doctors with their 
rifles as they looked for demonstrators doctors there said 
an army spokesman denied soldiers entered the hospital or beat 
doctors he said soldiers detained two palestinians but that the 
youths were taken into custody at the entrance to the hospital 
in the occupied gaza strip officials at the shifa hospital said 
israeli sodliers entered the facility overnight and arrested two 
arab demonstrators accused by israel of trying to run over a 
soldier with their car 
at least 76 palestinians have been killed mostly by israeli 
gunfire and hundreds wounded since dec 8 in the territories 
israel seized in the 1967 middle east war 
also today three italian legislators chained themselves to 
electric poles near ramallah to protest the israeli crackdown one 
legislator held a sign saying stop the killing yes to 
palestinian selfdetermination 
israels right and leftwing politicians disagreed today about 
the future of secretary of state george p shultzs peace 
initiative after hearing reports of his meeting tuesday with 
jordans king hussein in london 
shultz had just finished a fourday diplomatic shuttle in the 
middle east trying to gain acceptance of a formula for talks to 
deal with palestinian unrest in the occupied lands and an overall 
arabisraeli settlement 
likud legislator dan meridor a close aide to rightwing prime 
minister yitzhak shamir today said israel was unhappy because of 
the positions we are hearing from jordan following talks between 
hussein and shultz in london 
king hussein says the plo must be involved in the peace 
process and he wants a fullscale international conference 
meridor said on israel television if thats progress i dont 
know what going backwards is 
but former foreign minister abba eban a legislator from the 
centrist labor party said the differences between jordan and 
israel could be bridged

we made a mistake no doubt about it i dont know what went 
wrong police spokesman steve cole said tuesday sometimes in

unfortunate that it did 
i think the officers main concern was he thought he had

the main thing is he doesnt understand why he was struck he 
keeps asking why said his sister betty matthews who shares her 
home with johnson she filed a complaint with police 
the incident began when officer delier diaz gave chase to a car 
that had refused to pull over the chase led to an apartment 
complex where the cars two occupants parked the vehicle and fled 
johnson had just helped two maintenance workers at the complex 
free a tractor from a ditch when diaz arrived 
the officer approached johnson who raised his hand to his ear 
the signal used by the deaf to indicate they cant hear diaz 
ordered him to the ground said apartment resident elizabeth borreo 
jeff put up his hand and the cop just started hitting him 
mrs borreo said he hit him with his stick on the leg jeff bent 
down to grab his leg and he hit him again on the left shoulder 
then the cop pushed him down 
she and her husband said diaz held johnsons hands behind his 
back while another officer handcuffed him and put him in a patrol 
car 
i said you got the wrong guy he lives here and i saw him 
not five minutes ago apartment manager iris cox said within 30 
minutes the officers released johnson 
later monday two people were arrested on charges of grand theft 
auto and resisting arrest without violence 
after those arrests diaz filed a report saying he mistakenly 
tried to apprenhend johnson who he thought was ignored his order

leaders of the western alliance today 
endorsed president reagans efforts to negotiate new reductions in 
nuclear arms and demanded sweeping cutbacks in the soviet unions 
vastly superior conventional forces in europe to rule out a 
surprise attack 
within hours of opening their first summit talks in six years 
reagan and leaders of 15 other nato nations declared that soviet 
conventional forces cast a shadow over the whole of europe and 
must be reduced sharply to ease the imbalance in eastwest military 
strength 
these proposed cutbacks they said will entail for example 
the elimination from europe of tens of thousands of warsaw pact 
weapons relevant to surprise attack among them tanks and artillery 
pieces 
the overall aim of the talks was to demonstrate allied unity in 
advance of reagans planned moscow summit meeting with soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev in late may or june but there were 
nagging differences among the nato leaders over other nuclear arms 
issues 
reagan his voice hoarse and rasping from allergies summoned 
reporters to the steps of his 19th century palace residence the 
chateau stuyvenberg to read his own statement on the nato 
declaration the president called the massive soviet conventional 
forces the most direct threat to our security and to stability in 
europe 
he added but arms reductions are not enough we also look 
for greater respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms on 
which lasting security and stability in europe ultimately depend 
reagan seemed undisturbed by frictions among nato leaders about 
the future of the ussupplied force of shortrange nuclear 
weapons most of them based in west germany 
i have never seen such harmony as we have the president 
said he called the statement on european conventional forces a 
major step forward for the allies 
reagan also announced he was sending secretary of state george 
shultz back to the middle east after the nato summit ends thursday 
to press his talks with arab and israeli leaders 
all countries in the region believe it is useful for the 
united states to remain engaged in this process reagan said 
we will spare no effort in our search for a comprehensive peace 
settlement 
at the opening summit session earlier today reagan sat next to 
british prime minister margaret thatcher and listened intently as 
nato secretary general lord carrington pledged the allies full 
support for reagans drive to reach agreement with the soviets on 
drastic cuts in strategic nuclear weapons 
but carrington declared the alliance will not rest on its 
laurels 
in a sixpage statement on conventional forces the nato leaders 
said 
the soviet unions military presence in europe at a level far 
in excess of its needs for selfdefense directly challenges our 
security as well as our hopes for change in the political situation 
in europe 
thus the conventional imbalance in europe remains at the core 
of europes security concerns 
the allied leaders spelled out demands for far bigger cutbacks 
in soviet conventional forces than in the wests military levels 
during negotiations to begin in earnest this fall in vienna 
austria with representatives of the warsaw pact consisting of the 
soviet union and six east european allies 
our aim will be to establish a situation in europe in which 
force postures as well as the numbers of deployments and weapons 
systems no longer make surprise attack and largescale offensive 
action a feasible option the nato statement said 
carrington said the alliance leaders had gathered to celebrate 
the new ussoviet ban on ediumrange missiles and for charting 
the way ahead as gorbachev pursues a peace offensive 
one agreement which reduces some weapons and indeed one new 
soviet leader who is ready to reduce some tensions however 
significant do not in themselves remove the military capability 
and potential of the soviet union carrington said 
he added that natos collective determination to deploy and 
maintain a military capacity where necessary were what convinced 
the soviet union of the better route of arms control and 
disarmament 
we wish president reagan and his negotiators well in the 
effort to secure an agreement on strategic arms reduction which 
has the alliances full support carrington said 
reagan was the last of the leaders to arrive at sprawling nato 
headquarters today for the opening session of two days of summit 
talks that are expected to stress alliance unity despite 
differences over nuclear arms strategy 
at the first closed meeting reagan reportedly underlined the 
us commitment to europe and urged his fellow leaders to guard 
against soviet attempts to divide the western alliance 
it was west german chancellor helmut kohl who touched on a 
simmering dispute over whether nato members should quickly improve 
their stocks of shortrange nuclear missiles most of which are 
deployed in west germany 
the load the risks and the responsibilities of our defense 
must be equally shared by all members kohl said 
kohls remarks made public by bonn officials alluded to the 
fundamental issue of how the alliance can fill the gap left by the 
reagangorbachev agreement last december to eliminate 
groundlaunched intermediaterange nuclear misiles from europe 
senior nato officials drafting a final communique to be 
published thursday sought to bridge differences ranging from west 
germanys reluctance to britains enthusiasm for a swift decision 
on modernization to internal divisions over the issue within the 
french government 
looking toward sovietamerican arms talks carrington said an 
improved soviet human rights record was fundamental to creating 
the confidence necessary to proceed with a radical arms control 
agenda 
he added for most of us in the west that cause of tension 
is the degree of mistrust created by the denial of basic human 
rights and freedom to the peoples of eastern europe and the soviet 
union 
carrington reaffirmed natos commitment supporting a proposed 
superpower agreement to reduce longrange nuclear weaponry by 50 
percent on both sides he said nato also looked forward to a more 
serious engagement with the sovietled warsaw pact on a chemical 
weapons ban and reducing the eastern blocs superiority in 
conventional arms 
as the meeting began white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
reported that progress is fine on drafting a statement of 
common alliance goals to be issued at the conclusion of the twoday 
summit 
reagan who reached brussels coughing and complaining of 
allergies ws to spend 2 12 hours conferring with the 15 other 
heads of state or government when he arrived tuesday the 
president tried to allay concerns over the warsaw pacts advantage 
in conventional forces by promising to keep us troops in europe 
as long as europeans want them to stay

a federal safety agency filed a civil 
complaint wednesday seeking to force the recall of a device 
intended to help fishermen collect worms but which it says could 
wind up electrocuting the anglers instead 
the consumer product safety commission said it wants to halt 
sales of the worm gettr made by pampm enterprises of caldwell idaho 
directory information showed no listing for pampm enterprises in 
caldwell 
the device uses metal probes on wooden handles and is tied 
together by an electric wire the commission said when the probes 
are inserted into the ground electric current passed through the 
wire drives worms to the surface 
but the commission said the design exposes users to the bare 
metal charged with electricity and thus could lead to a dangerous 
shock 
no injuries have been reported involving the device but there 
have been 23 deaths since 1971 involving other brands of similarly 
designed worm probes the agency reported 
about 30000 worm gettr devices were sold nationally over the 
past five years at prices ranging from 8 to 30 the commission 
said 
the commission asked that consumers who have been injured or 
know of others who have had mishaps involving any type of worm 
probe to call it at 18006382772

doctors stopped treating patients and 
industry and construction halted today as a strike protesting the 
rule of gen manuel noreiga picked up support despite a violent 
crackdown on tuesday 
most stores in the downtown commercial zone were open but many 
outside the area closed 
in washington a lawyer for a panamanian opposition group said 
the state department was preparing to notify all us banks where 
the panamanian government has deposits not to engage in any 
transactions with the regime that seized power last week 
william d rogers said the state department action would require 
the banks to make payments only to the ambassador who represented 
the deposed government of president eric arturo delvalle the state 
department did not immediately confirm rogers statement 
on tuesday security agents armed with shotguns ransacked a 
radio station that defied censors by broadcasting news and backing 
the strike a former presidential candidate also was roughed up 
the raid by a score of state security agents shattered the 
uneasy calm that had marked the organized protest strike that began 
monday to seek the ouster of noriega panamas military strongman 
the station was totally destroyed said the owner carlos 
ivan zuniga who ran unsuccessfully for president in 1984 it 
will return to the air when there is democracy in panama 
many doctors appeared to have joined the strike today most of 
the main hospitals were staffing only their emergency rooms a 
check of major hospitals and clinics showed 
zuniga was seen being arrested with his son carlos and two 
other people 
security agents pulled zuniga by the hair forced his head down 
and shoved him hard into a vehicle his shirt was almost torn off 
as he struggled against the agents 
the car was blocked by another vehicle and zuniga a 
whitehaired man of about 60 fled down the street with his torn 
shirt fluttering and security men in pursuit 
he was captured and later released and said he was unhurt the 
other three were kicked punched and beaten with truncheons 
at least three people were wounded by birdshot none seriously 
security agents confiscated the exposed film of several news 
photographers including the tampa tribunes allyn divito who had 
a pistol held to his head until he surrendered his film 
at a news conference following his release zuniga called the 
attack an act of official state gangsterism he estimated 
damage to his station radio mundial at 100000 the station is 
also known as radio 10fm 
shortly before the attack zuniga said the station broadcast an 
appeal to residents of the capital to demonstrate peacefully 
against the government by waving white hankerchiefs honking their 
car horns and banging on pots and pans each day at noon and 6 pm 
that was in defiance of government censors orders that the 
station only play music 
about 15 people were handing out antigovernment leaflets 
outside the station when the security agents arrived suddenly in 
four fourwheel drive vehicles with darkly tinted windows 
the agents bolted from the vehicles firing shotguns and 
revolvers in the air quickly dispersed the leaflet distributors 
and charged into the station smashing equipment and furniture 
the station is housed in the offices of the popular action 
party which zuniga heads and is in a middleclass neighborhood 
at the first sounds of gunfire about 150 neighbors poured into the 
street many of them waving white banners and taunting the agents 
young men threw rocks at the security men and set up barricades 
of burning trash on the street outside the station and several 
sidestreets order was not restored for several hours 
as word of the attack on radio mundial spread barricades went 
up on streets elsewhere in the city but there was no further 
violence 
leaders of the national civic crusade a wide coalition of 
business professional labor and political groups that organized 
the nationwide strike claimed tuesday night that the action halted 
85 percent of the countrys economic activity 
crusade leaders said they would meet today to decide whether to 
continue the action 
after noriegas former secondincommand went public last june 
with charges the general was involved in vote fraud corruption and 
political assassination the crusade organized several large 
demonstrations 
noriega chief of panamas 17000member defense forces sent 
troops into the streets with guns billy clubs and tear gas to 
break up last summers protests three people were killed and 
scores injured 
crusade leaders deny their goal is to restore delvalle to the 
presidency national assembly ousted delvalle on friday for trying 
to fire noriega 
noriega who has run the country since 1983 was indicted in the 
united states last month for trafficking in colombian cocaine 
delvalle had said last thursday that the general should step down 
while the charges were investigated 
until he tried to fire noriega delvalle was widely seen as the 
generals puppet the reagan administration says it still 
recognizes delvalles presidency 
hours after he was dismissed delvalle went into hiding he has 
not been seen publicly but has issued statements calling for an 
international trade embargo against panama to stop the cash flow

an extreme rightwing party 
opposing all concessions to blacks was favored today as voters 
began the process of filling two vacant seats in the white chamber 
of parliament 
the conservative party was expected to win the seats in the 
districts of standerton and schweizerreneke despite an aggressive 
campaign waged by president pw bothas governing national party 
the turnout was expected to exceed 70 percent in both districts 
more than 15000 people were eligible to vote in schweizerreneke 
and more than 22000 in standerton 
the conservative party seeks to reinstate all rescinded 
apartheid laws and charges that botha is capitulating to the 
countrys 26 million black majority through his limited reforms in 
recent years 
the conservatives have been gaining ground in standerton and 
schweizerreneke rural districts in transvaal province at the 
expense of the national party in parliaments white chamber the 
national party has firm control with 133 seats to 20 for the 
conservatives 
in last mays whitesonly general election the conservative 
party captured both the standerton and schweizerreneke seats but 
they became vacant when the incumbents resigned 
this byelection campaign illustrates the degree to which white 
politics has become a struggle on the right the antiapartheid 
progressive federal party did not field candidates and demands of 
black activists and foreign critics are dismissed as irrelevant 
the choice is between bad and worse said business day the 
leading financial daily it may be an appalling thought but the 
growing power of the extreme right is so serious a threat that we 
believe the conservative party has to be opposed at every turn 
even if it means voting for nationalists 
the star of johannesburg described schweizerreneke as an area 
where blacks are seen and not heard when they are seen it is 
largely in terms of service to whites 
both parties campaigned aggressively revealing the widening 
rift among rightwing afrikaners 
last year the conservative party drew 26 percent of the vote 
nationwide and its support is growing particularly in rural areas 
it is favored to win another special election in transvaal later 
this month 
the conservative party has close links to the afrikaner 
resistance movement a paramilitary whitesupremacist group which 
is taking an increasingly confrontational stance against the 
government 
last saturday 5000 movement members many armed and wearing 
khaki uniforms staged a boisterous rally in pretoria and then 
marched to government buildings with a petition demanding creation 
of a whitesonly state 
conservative party leader andries treurnicht in a televised 
debate monday refused to repudiate the movement 
treurnicht told fw de klerk a cabinet minister who heads the 
national party in transvaal i defend the right of an 
organization to join me in resisting the dangerous course you are 
taking 
the national party in power since 1948 says the conservative 
partys goal of returning to strict apartheid is unrealistic botha 
advocates limited powersharing with blacks gaining a say in 
national politics while whites retain control under apartheid the 
white minority controls the country and keeps blacks in separate 
districts schools and health services 
speaking last week in standerton botha called for unity among 
afrikaners who comprise 3 million of the countrys 5 million 
whites and said the national party would protect white interests 
we are not prepared to sell out south africa to marxist 
revolutionaries botha said we are prepared to fight for our 
country 
why are we afrikaners cutting each others throats when our 
enemy is waiting he asked 
in an hourlong speech before about 1000 people botha did not 
mention the government bans imposed last week that forbid political 
activity by 18 black opposition groups nor did he speak of any 
future race reforms 
the star said in an editorial tuesday to pacify 
rightwingers the government has cracked down on black activists 
the nationalists have abandoned any commitment to reform 
treurnicht spoke in standerton the same night as botha drawing 
a crowd of about 1400 he said the national party was capitulating 
to the 26 million black majority 
when you share power you are no longer in control 
treurnicht said we dont want blacks in our parliament and we 
dont want to sit with them in theirs 
south africas parliament has separate chambers for whites 
asians and people of mixed race blacks are excluded 
treurnicht dismissed the recent crackdown as an election 
gimmick saying it was too little too late 
botha meanwhile said he was not a bad afrikaner simply 
because he was willing to meet with reasonable black leaders 
one has to be realistic he said this country consists 
not only of whites is there a farmer who can produce without 
black labor is there an industrialist who can produce without 
black workers

federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan 
said today that deep cuts in entitlement programs which 
include social security and medicare may be the most realistic way 
for cutting the federal budget deficit 
greenspan testifying before the senate budget committee also 
called for a 15centagallon increase in the federal gasoline tax 
but he said that in general tax increases do not appear to be 
a feasible way for trimming the budget shortfall which was 150 
billion last year 
there are upside limits to the share of income that can be 
taxed greenspan said 
he also said he saw little opportunity for further major cuts in 
military spending or in crucial federal programs such as the 
prison and air control system 
that leaves little left for budget cuts beyond entitlement 
programs which now make up about half of the federal budget 
entitlement programs are automaticbenefit social programs in 
which increases are tied to the rate of inflation 
simple arithmetic points clearly to those areas where the 
scope for action is greatest greenspan testified 
even though trimming social security and other benefit programs 
would be politically difficult greenspan told the panel that 
entitlement programs offer substantial opportunities for 
longterm budgetary savings 
all the alternatives are known the choices are political not 
economic greenspan testified he appeared as the panel 
considered president reagans 109 trillion budget for the fiscal 
year that begins next oct1 
in other testimony greenspan said 
trade deficit improvements led by higher import prices and 
surging exports would continue even at current exchangerate 
levels of the dollar 
there was some danger of increased inflation in the coming 
months from higher prices but that these increases do not appear 
to be on the order of a magnitude that should cause concern 
that there are no secret agreements among industrial 
nations involving interest rate levels in the united states that 
might be needed to support the goal of stabilizing the us dollar 
at its current exchangerate value

like many of his fellow cubanamericans agustin 
aguero is republican and staunchly anticommunist 
the vice president and manager at florida national banks little 
havana branch calls himself a moderate conservative and voted for 
president reagan in 1980 and again in 1984 
but aguero is among the growing ranks of welleducated and 
politically sophisticated cubanamericans who will require more 
from presidential candidates than fierce anticommunist rhetoric 
we cubans are anticommunist but that isnt our only goal 
said aguero who left behind cuba and fidel castro 17 years ago 
in the waning days before super tuesday when 20 states 
including florida will hold presidential primaries and caucuses 
cubanamericans are weighing their options with a heavy tilt toward 
vice president george bush 
more than twothirds of the 165274 cubanamerican voters 
registered in dade county are republicans according to the dade 
county elections department 
since the 1984 presidential elections the republican party in 
dade has added more than 42000 cubanamericans to its rolls 
in tampa the cubanamerican community made up mostly of 
secondand thirdgeneration cubans and some who have been around 
since the turn of the century tends to vote democratic according 
to the hillsborough county elections department which keeps no 
record of the ethnic breakdown among parties 
but the much larger and politically mobilized cubanamerican 
community in miami is clearly dominated by republican fervor 
here bush appears to be the ticket for most cubanamericans he 
has made regular forays here and has a strong organization headed 
by gov bob martinez and his son jeb who is the state secretary 
of commerce 
bush could conceivably capture about 70 percent of the cuban 
vote said dade county republican party chairman carlos salman a 
recent poll of south florida hispanics showed bush the choice of 81 
percent with the other gop candidates far back in single digits 
pat robertson cannot be counted out however he has made a 
serious pitch for the cubanamerican vote criticized castro as a 
butcher and his claim that there are soviet nuclear weapons in 
cuba fell on receptive ears here 
but the former television evangelists recent anticommunist 
appeals apparently arent being taken very seriously and some say 
his impact on the cuban vote will be negligible 
i think the cubans are very sophisticated they can see 
when people are saying things just to cater to them said jaime 
suchlicki director of the institute of interamerican studies at 
the university of miami they prefer truth and candor not 
political sloganism 
bushs ties to the reagan administration could hold negatives 
suchlicki said 
there has been an enormous amount of disillusionment visavis 
nicaragua he said 
as well immigration policy also has been a sore point with a 
reversal in the special treatment once accorded cubans by the 
immigration and naturalization service 
there is definitely a great deal of disappointment said 
eddie levy rodriguez former president and founder of the cuban 
american democrats association with the way immigration 
officials and the state department are treating the cubans from 
mariel and the fact that cuba and the united states are 
talking constantly even though reagan promised he would never deal 
with castro 
foreign policy remains a top concern of cubanamericans but 
increasingly they say their other interests are not being 
addressed including but not limited to issues such as the 
economy housing and unemployment 
aguero said the new generation of cubans who dont harbor 
notions of ever going back to cuba simply have different ideals 
they consider themselves americans first and cubans second he said 
levy said the number of cubanamerican democrats is growing and 
he said massachusetts gov michael dukakis should fare well among 
them 
but most of the cubanamerican population still votes republican 
we feel the republicans have done more for the things we 
like salman said since ronald reagan is president of the 
united states we have not lost one country to communism we also 
are interested in being able to have better lives better jobs low 
interest low inflation and high employment republicans do this 
more often and better than the democrats

a mutiny broke out on among usually meek and 
patient london commuters with passengers refusing orders to leave 
their delayplagued subway train until its driver took them to 
their destination 
only about a dozen rebellious passengers were involved in the 
tuesday night incident on the tube as the subway system is 
known but london regional transport said it was unprecedented 
given the meek and humble nature of the british commuter 
to the london evening standard newspaper it was the great 
tube revolt and the mutineers unidentified leader was a 
superhero in the clark kent mold quiet mildmannered and 
unassuming 
the excitement generated by the incident reflected not only the 
frustrations of riding the systems aging northern line but the 
amazement of londoners at the prospect of british commuters 
abandoning their fabled reserve and making a public fuss 
a similar incident occurred in new york citys subway system in 
april 1985 when about a dozen commuters refused to leave a 
disabled train until they were taken from it by transit police 
london regional transport accused the tube mutineers of being 
selfish 
spokesman david morris said the problem began with delays caused 
by a signal failure passengers bound for high barnet at the end 
of the northern line were told to disembark five stations before 
their destination and wait for the next train 
they started filing off but then according to the standard a 
mildlooking and welldressed passenger declared ive had 
enough im staying put if we all do it theyll have to take the 
train on 
about a dozen passengers got back into the train it said more 
passengers followed and after hurried consultations the staff 
bowed to the pressure and sent the train on 
morris said that had the passengers done as they were told the 
next train would have taken them to high barnet while the first 
train could have turned back to collect passengers in central 
london who had been delayed by the earlier signal failure 
we had an overall picture of what was happening he told the 
associated press those passengers had only a narrow and selfish 
view and put their needs above others 
passenger sheila golding of high barnet was quoted by the 
standard as saying the mutineers were cheering and laughing 
because we knew that if everyone did it and stayed put there 
wasnt anything they could do about it 
another passenger maria gama was quoted as saying everybody 
was just totally fed up the waiting room was freezing and nobody 
could tell us why the train was stopping where it did but when 
everybody climbed back on it was a marvelous moment 
the northern line parts of which are more than a century old 
carries 700000 passengers a day and serves 50 stations between 
south and north london 
dubbed the misery line by newspapers it is attacked for 
defective trains and equipment lastminute schedule changes 
signal failures and dirty stations it is to have a major 
modernization in the 1990s 
morris denied the line was worse than others but conceded that 
some employees can be rude they know what theyre up against and 
they probably dont look forward to coming to work any more than 
passengers look forward to using the line he said

by putting new emphasis on the threat 
to europe from soviet tanks and troops western leaders hope to 
blunt moscows drive to capitalize on splits within nato on nuclear 
arms strategy 
in a joint statement wednesday leaders of the western alliance 
called on the soviet union and its allies to begin negotiations 
aimed at eliminating the easts capability for launching a surprise 
attack in europe 
they said soviet nonnuclear forces facing nato are far in 
excess of moscows needs for self defense and cast a shadow over 
the whole of europe 
president reagan called the declaration a major step forward 
for the alliance 
the idea is to portray the north atlantic treaty organization as 
united in calling for fewer nonnuclear weapons at a time when the 
alliance members cannot agree how far to go in scrapping atomic 
arms 
the nato initiative also shifts the public spotlight away from 
west germanys dispute within the alliance over whether and when to 
replace very shortrange nuclear weapons with new more effective 
ones most of these weapons if used would strike german soil 
east or west 
the main nato theme is that the sovietled warsaw pacts 
numerical superiority in conventional weapons and troops not the 
existence of nuclear arms in europe is the greatest danger to 
western security 
according to western estimates the warsaw pact holds about a 
3to1 advantage in tanks and artillery and nearly a 2to1 edge in 
combat aircraft and troops including reserves in the soviet union 
moscow contends that eastwest conventional forces are roughly 
equivalent 
the stress on conventional arms nato hopes will steal some of 
the momentum from soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs campaign to 
woo the european public with calls for ridding their continent of 
all nuclear weapons 
nato leaders agree that some nuclear arms are needed in europe 
to deter attack 
gorbachev appears to have significantly improved his public 
image in western europe by agreeing last year to a longstanding 
us proposal to eliminate all intermediaterange nuclear weapons 
based mostly in europe 
the 16 nato nations have strongly endorsed this deal known as 
the inf treaty the senate is expected to ratify the treaty this 
spring 
but in the aftermath of the inf deal the alliance has fallen 
into disagreement over whether to press immediately for eastwest 
negotiations to reduce a large soviet edge in shortrange nuclear 
missiles west germany which is most directly threatened by these 
weapons wants such talks to start soon most of the other nato 
allies do not 
the brussels nato summit was not expected to discuss this 
quandry in detail much less find a solution instead a key aim of 
the meeting was to turn the publics attention to other aspects of 
eastwest relations including human rights and nonnuclear arms 
talks 
the nato members and the seven warsaw pact nations have been 
working for a year to agree on the framework for a new set of 
negotiations to establish a more stable balance of conventional 
forces in europe 
these talks likely to begin this fall would replace a narrower 
set of eastwest negotiations on cutting troop levels which began 
in 1973 after 15 years these talks have not produced a single 
agreement 
nato members hope the new negotiations would focus more directly 
on warfighting equipment as well as troops these talks also would 
encompass the full european area from the atlantic to the ural 
mountains the old troop talks were limited to the central front 
even though the western allies acknowledge that it may take 
years to reach a meaningful agreement on conventional forces they 
hope the drive to reach the bargaining table will put nato back on 
the diplomatic offensive

children at a hare krishna commune have 
been subjected to sexual abuse and forced into communal marriages 
according a court petition filed by a former sect member seeking 
custody of her children 
the petition was filed with the state supreme court which gave 
no immediate answer tuesday to the appeal by christina mills a 
former hare krishna member who claims her children are in danger at 
the religious sects west virginia commune 
mills alleges that new vrindaban the nations largest krishna 
community is fraught with polygamy child molestation and sexual 
abuse her lawyer told the court tuesday 
mills now a legal secretary in san antonio texas is asking 
the high court to remove her three children ages 2 3 and 6 from 
their fathers care at new vrindaban 
these children have no protection today but in this court 
lawyer david gold told justices 
the northern west virginia community is the target of several 
federal and state investigations 
a family law master had ruled that the children were in jeopardy 
at the commune but a circuit judge stayed that order at the 
request of the childrens father dennis gorrick mills is 
appealing that stay 
gorricks attorney james lees said the family law master has 
issued a gag order on the case and he could not discuss it 
members of the commune have faced criminal charges including 
murder and manslaughter charges against fringe members of the 
commune and child molestation charges against two former commune 
teachers the sects leader kirtanananda swami bhaktipada 
recently was found innocent of arson charges although another 
commune member was convicted in the case 
the krishnas have denied any wrongdoing and have accused 
authorities of harassment 
mills petitions make a broad range of allegations against the 
krishna community 
gorrick has been simultaneously married to the petitioner 
and other women said marriages being ordered by the swami 
according to the petition 
children at new vrindaban have been subject to sexual abuse by 
the very teachers entrusted with their safety and wellbeing said 
abuse includes the repeated and systematic oral and anal homosexual 
rape of school children at said school by the headmaster 
according to the court petition 
parents who have confronted the swami about said sexual abuse 
have been advised by said swami that sex is sex the petition 
states 
authorities at new vrindaban regularly contribute to the 
delinquency of minors by forcing girls to drop out of school 
and marry as young as the age of 12 years the petition 
states 
gorrick whom mills calls the communes chief fundraiser has 
directly caused or contributed to the alleged practice of using 
commune children as young as 11 to solicit donations according to 
the petition

vietnam on wednesday returned to the 
united states what are believed to be remains of 17 american 
servicemen missing in action in the vietnam war a us official 
said 
the vietnamese also turned over written reports on three other 
missing americans said lt col paul mather leader of a us 
military team that received the remains in a ceremony at hanois 
noi bai airport 
the return was the largest in two years and the fourth largest 
since the war ended in april 1975 with a communist victory over the 
usbacked south vietnam government 
the largest return was in august 1985 when 26 sets of remains 
were returned 
mather said some of the remains received wednesday involved 
cases of highest priority to the united states 
mather said a us honor guard saluted under chilly overcast 
skies as the metal caskets of remains each draped with a folded 
american flag were loaded onto a c141 transport plane for the 
flight to hawaii the names attached to the remains were not 
released 
they will be analyzed there by the army central identification 
laboratory to see if they belong to any of the nearly 1800 
americans listed as missing in action from the vietnam war 
mather said some of the names that the vietnamese provided 
along with the remains and written reports are among a list of 70 
that the united states considers of highest priority 
retired gen john w vessey acting as a us presidential 
emissary handed over the list of names during a mission to hanoi 
in august 
the united states says that in these discrepancy cases 
there is compelling evidence that vietnamese authorities at some 
level know what happened to the missing men evidence includes 
photographs of captured americans who never emerged from prisoner 
of war camps 
mather said the remains were mostly of airmen most missing 
airmen were shot down during bombing missions in north vietnam 
the vietnamese told mather they would start the next round of 
technical talks on mias on march 12 during these talks which 
hanoi has agreed to hold six times annually experts of both sides 
discuss ways of retreiving remains locating warplane crash sites 
and related issues 
wednesdays turnover was the third since hanoi agreed during 
vesseys visit to break a deadlock and resume efforts to account 
for american mias 
the united states pledged then to look into vietnams own 
humanitarian problems an official us medical team flew to hanoi 
on wednesday to continue that mission said the spokesman of the 
us embassy in bangkok ross petzing 
three previous medical teams have studied the plight of disabled 
war veterans and other humanitarian cases and made recommendations 
on how private us charitable organizations can aid rehabilitation 
programs 
washington has encouraged private assistance but refused 
vietnamese requests for direct us government aid the united 
states has withheld diplomatic recognition and official aid to 
protest vietnams military occupation of cambodia

a judge who orders some juvenile offenders to 
go to the library and read as a condition of probation says he 
harbors no illusions that it will help everyone hed settle for 
one out of four 
i understand that a good number of young people will laugh at 
this baltimore circuit judge john carroll byrnes said in a 
recent interview some will try but will fall by the wayside 
when they get back in with their buddies in their environment and 
others simply wont be able intellectually 
but im convinced that a significant minority once coerced 
into reading will be so attracted by the experience that it will 
change their lives im optimistic that we can do it if we can 
reach 25 percent of the youthful offenders we see id call this 
plan a roaring success 
the judge who splits his time between juvenile court and the 
citys circuit court said he has made reading a part of probation 
since he came on the bench about five years ago an ad hoc 
committee of librarians educators and parole and probation 
officers was formed a year ago and hopes to have a formal list of 
suitable titles basically from the junior high school level by 
the end of the year 
some of the suggested titles include i am the darker brother 
by arnold adoff westmark by lloyd alexander anna to the 
infinite power by mildred ames curse of the blue figurine by 
john bellairs sounder by william a armstrong and are you 
there god its me margaret by judy blum 
byrnes also said he has restricted television viewing as a 
condition of probation in some cases its interesting no 
matter what you say before that they shudder when i come to the 
one about television he said

felix the ferret was scheduled for 
execution this week but a public outcry resulted in a pardon from 
the mayor 
we are going to ferret out a solution said farmers branch 
mayor john dodd who spared the animal monday 
the fuzzy pinkeyed ferret was caged at the citys animal 
shelter 
farmers branch police officer rodney wallace spotted the animal 
friday during patrol when he opened the door of his car and 
whistled the ferret jumped into his lap and snuggled against him 
wallace took the ferret to the animal shelter in the dallas 
suburb and attached a note to his cage that said please do not 
destroy if no one claims it i want it back 
because of a city ordinance prohibiting exotic animals 
officials said the ferret would be destroyed if his owner was not 
found as news spread of the ferrets plight the animal shelter 
was deluged with requests to adopt the creature 
animal control officer mike worsham said his department could 
not take responsibility for placing felix for adoption because 
there is no approved vaccine for ferrets and the animals sometimes 
bite 
but dodd promised monday to cut through the red tape the 
mayor said he spoke to the owner of an animal rehabilitation center 
about taking the animal the center has a state license to keep 
wild animals which will prevent the ferrets death

federated department stores inc announced today 
its board had accepted a multibilliondollar acquisition bid by 
rh macy amp co inc over a competing offer from campeau corp 
but campeau refused to give up its quest for federated the 
nations fifthlargest retailer 
federated and macy signed a definitive agreement to create a new 
company macysfederated inc said jim fingeroth a spokesman for 
macy which has nearly 100 department and specialty stores 
the agreement provides for macy to begin a cash tender offer of 
7450 a share for about 80 percent of federateds 896 million 
outstanding shares or a total of 525 billion fingeroth said 
the remaining federated shares would be exchanged for stock in the 
new company 
campeau had offered 68 a share in cash for all federated 
shares or 61 billion 
after the agreement was announced campeau said it would proceed 
with a 66 cash tender offer for federated 
macys bid is not competitive and we intend to prevail in the 
marketplace a campeau statement said it is now up to 
federateds shareholders to decide 
trading in federated stock was halted on the new york stock 
exchange prior to the federated announcement after trading 
resumed its stock rose 50 cents per share to 6750 
macys bid came to light monday as federated directors met to 
consider whether to accept the campeau offer 
campeau began its bid jan 25 offering 47 a share the bid was 
rejected as inadequate and campeau sweetened the offer several 
times before arriving at the 68 bid 
late last week federated officials decided to negotiate an 
agreement with campeau and the torontobased developers offer was 
still on the table as the macy bid was considered 
macy originally offered 7380 per share and then increased its 
bid before the agreement was signed 
wall street analysts said tuesday the rival bids were attractive 
for different reasons 
campeau is sitting there with cash and macys walked in the 
door with some cash but the opportunity for the company to enjoy 
future growth as opposed to campeaus potential breaking up or 
dismantling of the company said thomas tashjian an analyst with 
seidler amdec securities inc in los angeles 
he referred to the fact that campeau sold off most of allied 
stores corps divisions after he bought the company in december 
1986 
new yorkbased macy which is privately held is the nations 
10largest retailer 
a federated acquisition represents for macys a chance to 
control some of its major competitors such as bloomingdales and 
to increase its market share at the same time said michele davis 
of the investment firm oppenheimer amp co 
they can position bloomingdales at one price point and macys 
at another price point such that they dont compete head on with 
each other she said 
the deal also would give macy more outlets for its extensive 
line of private label merchandise said monroe greenstein of the 
investment firm bear stearns amp co inc 
campeau was fighting for federated because it does not want to 
lose the opportunity to gain the foothold into major us shopping 
centers that federated stores would provide greenstein said 
moreover that entree could go instead to macy board member a 
alfred taubman himself a shopping mall developer greenstein said 
the agreement between macy and federated called for the new

bands of youths hurled bombs burned 
cars and trucks and shouted antigovernment slogans wednesday 
during a general strike called to disrupt parliamentary elections 
at least eight people were injured 
teenagers and children several appearing younger than 10 years 
old stopped a city garbage truck in downtown dhaka smashed it 
with clubs and set it ablaze 
we set fire to ershads throne the youngsters chanted 
referring to president hussain muhammad ershad 
demonstrators stoned and taunted police burned election banners 
along with at least one scooter and a taxi 
the opposition called the strike to protest thursdays 
parliamentary elections many here believe the elections have more 
potential for violence than for halting the stalemate between 
ershad and his foes 
eight people were reported hospitalized with injuries from small 
bombs and two were in serious condition police and hospital 
officials said 
but no major confrontations erupted between police and 
protestors and the city was calm overall 
in the southern port city of chittagong witnesses said at least 
50 people were injured in clashes between protestors and police 
the witnesses who spoke on condition of anonymity said protestors 
threw bombs at the office of the local municipal corporation and 
damaged several vehicles 
in the capital the strike appeared successful shutting down 
shops and businesses and chasing from the streets the bicycle 
rickshaws that make dhaka traffic a nightmare 
but the strike appeared to have little effect outside dhaka 
other than stopping trucks and buses from running 
it was the 24th strike called by the opposition since nov 10 
when it began its campaign to oust ershad 
in a move to compromise with his opponents ershad dissolved the 
330seat parliament last december 3 years before its term was to 
expire and scheduled new elections but opposition leaders have 
said no election conducted under ershad can be fair and they are 
urging a voter boycott 
at least 33 people have been died since nov 10 either in 
clashes by police gunfire or in campaignrelated violence 
sheik hasina of the opposition awami league said wednesday that 
she expected only 5 percent or 10 percent of the 478 million 
voters to cast ballots 
more than 900 candidates from 102 political parties are running 
for parliament eighteen candidates all from ershads jatiya 
party have already been declared elected for lack of opposition 
and voting in one district was canceled because of the slaying of a 
candidate 
in addition to the parliamentary election municipal elections 
will be held in the cities of dhaka chittagong khulna and 
rajshahi 
in similar polling for town and village councils across the 
country three weeks ago more than 100 people were killed in 
battles between supporters of candidates 
ershad seized power in a bloodless coup in 1982 and won election 
in 1986 he ordered 9000 army troops and about 290000 local 
police and paramilitary troops deployed to ensure security for the 
elections

the state department is preparing to notify 
all us banks where the panamanian government has deposits not to 
engage in any transactions with the regime that seized power in 
panama last week a lawyer for a panamanian opposition group said 
today 
william d rogers an attorney for the arnold amp porter law firm 
said the panamanian government is believed to have deposits in five 
us banks and that law suits are being drawn up to ensure bank 
compliance with the measure 
rogers told a news conference the state department action would 
require the banks to make disbursements only to the ambassador who 
represented the deposed government of president eric arturo 
delvalle 
later state department deputy spokeswoman phyllis oakley said 
the department was preparing documentation certifying that persons 
designated by delvalle are the legitimate representatives of the 
panamanian government 
but she did not say what the legal consequences of the 
certification were or why it was being prepared 
ambassador juan b sosa who has maintained that delvalles 
ouster was unconstitutional said he had no precise figures on the 
amounts of money in the panamanian accounts but estimated the 
number to be 50 million 
in new york lawyers for delvalle sued in federal court today to 
block a new york bank from turning over millions of dollars to new 
government in panama 
a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order blocking 
the republic national bank of new york from transferring an 
estimated 10 million 
a hearing on the matter is slated for monday before us 
district judge lloyd f mcmahon 
the lawsuit seeks to establish title to the funds held in the 
republic national bank account and to prevent their transfer into 
the hands of a military dictatorship which has attempted to 
seize power and overthrow the lawful authorities of the republic of 
panama according to court papers 
in washington sosa said the state department is seriously 
considering withholding from panama the next payment on the fees 
the united states gives panama for use of the panama canal he 
estimated that figure at 8 million 
ms oakley confirmed that a request from the delvalle government 
to put the funds in escrow had been received and that the state 
department was consulting with other agencies on how to proceed 
delvalle fired military strongman manuel antonio noriega last 
thursday but the defense chief ignored the order and rallied his 
allies in the national assembly against the president on friday 
the assembly voted to oust delvalle and installed education 
minister manuel solis palma in his place 
noriega has been indicted on drug smuggling charges by two 
florida grand juries and has been under heavy diplomatic economic 
and political pressure by the reagan administration to step aside 
and open the way for civilianled constitutional rule 
among the banks listed by rogers which would be affected by the 
order are marine midland irving trust bankers trust and the 
republic national bank he said all have headquarters in new york 
every dime we can find is in those banks rogers said he 
added that any bank which ignores the order could be liable for 
whatever payments it makes to the current panamanian government 
the coalition of opposition leaders believes that the panamanian 
government is facing a grave cash flow problem and is extremely 
vulnerable to economic pressure from the united states 
unlike other countries panama cannot cover its cash shortages 
by printing new money because the dollar is the national currency 
sosa said international opposition to the new government was 
evident earlier this week when he claimed only eight ambassadors 
showed up for a state of the union address from the western 
hemisphere he said only cuba and nicaragua attended

driving through the streets of this 
diplomatic capital one would never guess that the leaders of the 
western world are in town to chart the future course of the nat0 
alliance 
but then brussels tends to take its summits in stride 
there are no banners no curious onlookers and few flags to bear 
witness to the presence of president reagan and 15 other government 
leaders for the twoday nato summit that began wednesday 
except for occasional motorcycle escorts leading official 
limousines on a weaving course through traffic the citys normal 
routine has not been disrupted noticeably 
security is tightest for reagan who is staying in the 19th 
century chateau stuyvenberg on the outskirts of the city next to 
the royal palace the chateaus wooded grounds are patrolled by 
guard dogs and mounted police 
it is a fortress said one police official who spoke only 
on condition that he not be identified everything is tiptop in 
order 
brussels is a stolid middleclass city that for decades has 
played host to the european economic community the north atlantic 
treaty organization several offices of the european parliament and 
numerous international lobbying groups 
strict security for highly placed officials is a routine and 
unobtrusive element in this city of about 1 million people 
brussels handled its last summit for the eec only three weeks ago 
the pace of the city is geared toward international meetings 
taxi drivers ask their customers whether they prefer a normal or a 
fast trip out to the sprawling nato headquarters in the quiet 
suburb of evere 
the only sign of summitinduced chaos was seen wednesday at the 
nato press center where an estimated 2000 journalists jostled 
each other for copies of official statements draft beer and 
interviews with the few official sources willing to brave the crush 
reflecting the belgian taste for good living beer began to flow 
from the press center taps at about 11 am 
a minor incident occurred when a nato security agent tried to 
grab a microphone from an american television network crew member 
while the nato leaders posed for a group photograph 
a us security agent accompanying reagan stepped in with the 
admonition do not manhandle journalists and the nato agent 
backed off 
police spokesman jacques devaux said 500 uniformed belgian 
policemen were working around the clock with uncommon vigilance 
to protect every nato leader a brussels newspaper said they were 
being reinforced by about 500 state security force personnel 
days before the summit opened wednesday police guards were 
reinforced and additional metal detectors were installed at 
zaventem international airport areas where summit leaders were to 
arrive were swept repeatedly for explosives but none was found 
the summiteers who brought their own security forces along 
were staying in hotels and embassies scattered throughout the city 
overall security was being coordinated at a command center in the 
interior ministry 
police detained 20 antinuclear protesters for identity checks 
after they tried to demonstrate outside nato headquarters without a 
police permit

the government said wednesday 
it wont release a recording of the conversation between a control 
tower and a south african airways jumbo jet that crashed nov 28 in 
the indian ocean killing all 159 people aboard 
the announcement was made by supreme court justice cecil margo 
head of an international board that began meeting monday to 
investigate the cause of the crash on a flight from taipei taiwan 
to johannesburg 
the boeing 747 went down minutes before it was due to refuel in 
mauritius 
reports at the time had quoted mauritian officials as saying the 
pilot reported fire or smoke in the cockpit 
south african officials took over the investigation from 
mauritian aviation authorities and no further information was 
released the south african officials said at the time that quotes 
from the recording would not be released because they might be 
misunderstood and some people might believe they were being accused 
or blamed 
margo said the recorded conversation was indistinct in parts and 
experts had disagreed about what was said so no official 
transcript or sound from the recording would be released 
margo said the board had decided wednesday that the cockpit 
voice recorder flight data recorder and other pieces of the jet 
must be recovered at all costs from the crash site 14520 feet 
under the ocean north of mauritius 
aboard the jet were 71 south africans 47 japanese 30 
taiwanese and one or two passengers from australia mauritius 
hong kong the united states holland britain germany denmark 
and south korea only 11 bodies were recovered

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers 
throughout the nation 
feb 29 
the albuquerque nm tribune on gen manuel antonio noriega of 
panama 
gen manuel noriega panamas drugrunning strongman seems 
still to be in control of his troubled nation 
washington has been trying for months to figure out a way to 
depose noriega who recently was indicted in miami on charges of 
drug trafficking obviously the us government was involved in 
president eric arturo delvalles attempt to dismiss noriega from 
command of panamas defense force 
the maneuver may eventually contribute to an erosion of support 
for noriega among the countrys military officer corps but so far 
most of those in the echelons below noriega either are in cahoots 
with the general or too afraid to buck him 
noriega also faces strong opposition from the public many of 
whom rioted last summer because of the countrys declining economy 
and reports of corruption at the top 
noriega has got to go and the united states should do all it 
can to hasten that event this should include an economic squeeze 
by washington and other capitals that could cause increased 
resentment against the general

baltimore sun on military spending 
when a secretary of the navy jumps ship or walks the plank it 
is fitting that he made a big splash 
james e webb has done just that by unleashing a petulant attack 
on defense secretary frank c carlucci a veteran public servant 
who has taken on the tough thankless job of bringing pentagon 
spending and planning into the realm of reality 
in the end carlucci ordered the scrapping of 16 aging frigates 
as part of a 12 billion cut in fiscal 1989 navy spending this was 
a sensible decision in keeping with plans for a lean but tough 
defense establishment 
webbs spectacular manner of departure may have one beneficial 
effect it could trigger a defense debate that most washington 
politicians would prefer to put off until the november elections 
the next president and the next congress need to avoid sharp 
peaks and valleys in military spending and to devise a defense 
strategy that is compatible with the nations resources 
commitments and priorities

for sins of sexual misconduct 
with this latest scandal the tendency among much of the public 
may be to condemn all radio and television religious ministries 
that would be understandable but it also would be a mistake 
some of these programs a few dating back for 40 years or more 
have a clean record of service and financial accountability 
nevertheless they often are smeared with the same broad brush

world of television evangelism need our compassion but they also

the mcpherson kan sentinel on the arrest of an absentee 
senator 
we had thought that house speaker jim wright had sunk to the 
bottom depths in congressional decorum a couple of months ago when 
he had the effrontery to make time stand still in order to gain 
passage of a bill he wanted 
but after senate majority leader robert byrds actions last 
week wright is barely running a close second 
we have often thought that congress resembled a circus more than 
it resembles the worlds greatest deliberative body but byrd made 
it complete with keystone kops when he ordered the arrest of 
republican bob packwood in order to get a quorum 
we hope of course that byrds tactic was worth such 
despicable conduct because byrd has certainly degraded both 
himself and the senate

theres a variation of the popular tv game show jeopardy 
that you can play by calling your local internal revenue service 
offices ask them a technical question about the 1986 tax law 
changes that go into effect this year 
whats the jeopardy part well one fourth of the time the 
answer will be wrong 
but if you rely on that answer when you file your return and 
underpay your tax as a result youre still subject to a penalty 
and interest for underpaying 
a year ago the new tax witholding forms turned out to be 
so arcane that the irs had to waive deadlines and develop new 
forms 
its hard to figure out how a law that was so widely understood 
and welcomed as an effort to make the tax code more fair logical 
and efficient could have spawned such confusion

that former us ambassador to switzerland faith ryan whittlesey 
mishandled some entertainment funds 
she was said to have entertained american friends with privately 
donated money that was intended to be used to fete foreign 
officials the justice department said there was no evidence to 
produce a viable criminal case 
that wasnt good enough for metzenbaum he wants to come up with 
something politically damaging to the reagan administration

sioux falls sd argus leader on president reagans budget 
however else he is remembered ronald reagan will go down as the 
biggest spender in the history of the presidency 
the 11 trillion national budget he proposed recently would 
only increase military spending about 2 percent 
in addition reagan has an agreement with congress to run up 
only 136 billion more debt during the next budget year in fiscal 
1987 they accumulated 148 billion in debt 
minor concessions like that will not erase the fact that reagan 
more than any other president has led the nation into what seems 
like a bottomless pit of overdue bills 
of course reagan is not entirely to blame every democratic and 
republican representative and senator who has served in congress 
since reagan took office in 1981 must shoulder part of the blame 
for the nations spending problems 
reagan the candidate who promised to balance the budget has 
failed financially he has less than a year remaining in his term 
not enough time to balance the budget 
the good news is that this is an election year taxpayers and 
voters have the opportunity and an obligation to hold 
presidential candidates accountable on that issue

the orange county calif register on the supreme court parody 
decision 
when the us supreme court hands down a unanimous decision you 
might figure it was a cutanddried case not so with last weeks 
decision upholding hustler magazines disgusting parody of the rev 
jerry falwell 
while the court seemed to grant almost absolute protection to 
speech that is intended as satire it left blurred the line that 
distinguishes fact from fiction parody from portrayal 
at issue was a 1983 takeoff of a wellknown liquor advertisement 
in which famous people describe the first time they tasted the 
product in hustlers version falwell was depicted as having sex 
with his mother in an outhouse 
outraged the televangelist and founder of the moral majority 
sued publisher larry flynt for 45 million for libel invasion of 
privacy and infliction of emotional distress 
a lower court had no trouble discerning that the parody was 
fiction thus falwell did not have a case for libel but it 
awarded him 200000 for emotional distress 
it took the supreme court to rule that awards for emotional 
distress require proof of factual falsehood the standard for 
libel and now the court rules draw a distinction between 
satire which is absolutely free and seriousness which is not 
free speech should mean just that in the marketplace of 
ideas and public opinion truth almost always will win out

charleston wva daily mail on foreignheld patents 
the us patent and trademark office issued 89385 patents last 
year a stunning 466 percent of them went to people who are not 
us citizens 
americans are inventing more things than they used to say 
officials at the patent office but nonamericans are inventing at 
a faster pace 
in the past two decades the share of us patents awarded to 
foreigners has more than doubled from the patent offices figures 
the chief competitors of the future will be the japanese who 
claimed 17288 patents and the west germans who registered 8030 
it seems likely that more of the next generation of americans 
will be paying license fees and more inventors in other nations 
will be sitting back collecting royalties

the asheville nc citizen on jimmy swaggart 
so one more television evangelist falls jimmy swaggart is one 
of the biggest but the country has become accustomed to seeing tv 
ministers stumble because of worldly pleasures 
the only remarkable thing about the swaggart case is the extent 
to which everyone is focusing on his physical sin that of 
consorting with a prostitute in the eyes of his church and his 
followers that was his greatest offense and they already have 
begun forgiving him 
give swaggart credit he knew what he had to do he prostrated 
himself before the elders of the assemblies of god denomination 
his congregation his tv audience and god himself swaggart blamed 
no one else 
he admitted sinning took full responsibility and begged 
forgiveness most of his sympathizers were not just touched they 
were overwhelmed 
amid all this glorious healing it seems almost unkind to note 
that swaggart did not admit his sin until he had no choice until 
it was reported by a fellow tv evangelist and competitor whom 
swaggart had helped discredit and drive out of business 
he did not confess until his worldly empire was at stake where 
were swaggarts humility and repentance during all those months or 
years before he was found out

palm beach fla post on the supreme courts parody decision 
the supreme court decision in the case of falwell vs flynt is a 
reassuring vote of confidence in the principle of freedom of speech 
in a decision significant for its unanimity the justices said 
the rev jerry falwell may not collect 200000 in damages from 
publisher larry flynt and hustler magazine for a parody 
there is no question the parody was putrid it also was painful 
for moral majority founder falwell 
still to condemn it because it breaks all boundaries for sleaze 
is one thing to rule it is libelous is another 
if a public figure cannot prove he has been libeled he cant 
recover damages for even the most extreme embarrassment 
in this case that would have meant proving the parody contained 
statements known by the author to be false which could be 
considered true its impossible to imagine that anyone considered 
the parody true

that description applies to the hustler spoof because it could

many of us committed to the first amendment would feel more

the sun westerly ri on the long supreme court vacancy 
twothirds of a year have gone by from the time a supreme court 
vacany occurred until judge anthony kennedy was sworn in as the 
ninth justice 
the question whether it was worth the wait will be variously 
answered depending on ones opinion of kennedy and the prior 
nominees who were rejected 
no one however can dispute the assertions that kennedy was a 
compromise candidate after the administration had failed with judge 
robert bork and douglas ginsburg 
the senate deemed bork too controversial for his narrow 
constitutional stance ginsburg not only flawed in character but of 
inadequate judicial stature 
kennedy in contrast to his predecessors before the senate in 
its process of advice and consent was readily approved perhaps 
in part out of relief that a conservative yet not rigidly 
doctrinaire nominee was at least offered but in any case approved 
some liberals especially womens rights advocates still have 
their doubts about how justice kennedy will perform on the whole 
however he appears to be an excellent choice and it is good to 
have a full court again after a long hiatus

the oshkosh wis northwestern on educational testing 
while it is edifying that wisconsin leads the rest of the nation 
on american college testing act scores wisconsin ranks near 
the bottom in the percentage of students taking that or the 
scholastic aptitude test sat 
that does not mean that the high score is somehow invalid but 
it does suggest that it may be artificially high in comparison to 
other states where the average is lower but the percentage of 
students taking the test is higher 
as ratings experts have long counseled do not read too much 
into the test scores data it cant be used to prove the quality of 
a states educational product 
it may point to some extra efforts if the average fluctuates 
greatly from one year to the next but it is not universally taken 
and thus there are too many other factors involved in assessing the 
quality of education which those tests can not depict

billions of dollars in bank deposits are being 
taken out of panama for safer havens in the wake of the political 
turmoil following the drug indictment of military strongman gen 
manuel antonio noriega financial experts say 
some of that money has wound up in miami where federal 
regulations adopted earlier this decade allow offshore banks to 
escape the scrutiny that domestic banks undergo 
panama in the 1980s had come to be known as the switzerland of 
latin america offering banking secrecy and stability to the 
regions investors and depositors banks there are unfettered by 
high taxes or cumbersome rules providing a safe haven for both 
legitimately and illegitimately earned money 
but a deposit flight began last year when street demonstrations 
broke out in panama accelerating after noriegas indictment last 
month 
this certainly has destabilized panama as a banking center 
said gonzalo valdesfauli senior vice president and manager of the 
miami office of londonbased barclays bank 
valdesfauli said some foreign banks are moving their operations

that it was closing its panama office at the end of april and said 
its offshore business has already been transferred to branches in 
miami and the bahamas

a judge has given postal inspectors the 
goahead to seize mail orders for fat magnet a pill nationally 
advertised as the lazy way to lose weight 
us district judge terry hatter jr issued a preliminary 
injunction tuesday against the company after assistant us 
attorney george wu argued it may be fraudulently promoting the 
pill which it claims absorbs fat and flushes it out of the body 
the pill does not have federal drug administration approval 
the us postal service had requested the injunction which 
allows the postal inspectors to continue seizures they began three 
weeks ago a decision on the charges will be made at an 
administrative hearing in washington dc within 60 days 
postal inspector jim harbin said the postal service already has 
seized between 8000 and 10000 pieces of mail addressed to the 
company in beverly hills and will keep the mail including checks 
for purchase of the product until a fraud hearing is held 
attorneys for fat magnet said the product not only works but is 
a food for special dietary use a category recognized as between 
food and drugs that does not require fda approval 
we certainly agree that this product has not been approved by 
the fda said kirkpatrick dilling a company attorney its not 
necessary 
dilling said the pills two main ingredients fiber and purified 
bile do not qualify fat magnet as a new unapproved drug 
but wu responded that there are questions about how well fat 
magnet works if it works at all and serious consumer safety 
concerns about its use

like rip van winkle north 
tarrytown has been asleep to its heritage for years and will 
awaken to a new and better life if its name is changed to sleepy 
hollow some residents say 
its a part of history that were sleepy hollow said chris 
skelly a member of the village of sleepy hollow committee its 
not a madeup name it gives us the potential to be famous because 
everyones heard of sleepy hollow 
in the washington irving story sleepy hollow was the town where 
the headless horseman rode rip van winkle another irving 
character slept for 20 years in the catskills 
skelly said irving for whom nearby irvington was named didnt 
make up the name but reached back to 17th century dutch 
descriptions of the area as slaeperingh haven and slaeperingh 
hol or sleeping harbor and sleepy hollow the names meant it was 
easy to dock there and spend the night 
now skelly and others want to bring the dutch name back to 
distinguish north tarrytown from neighboring tarrytown and try to 
revitalize the village of 8000 beset by financial and social woes 
residents will decide the matter during village elections march 
15 
opponents of the measure such as edna belanich a founder of 
concerned citizens against changing the name of north tarrytown 
say it would be confusing and costly and wouldnt accomplish 
anything 
itll be a panacea not a cure she said history will not 
pay the bills or solve the problems we can keep history in our 
hearts 
skelly says history can go a long way to attracting new 
business particularly tourism to the village which boasts the 
sleepy hollow cemetery an old dutch graveyard and philipsburg 
manor the home of an early english settler 
we are not a suburb of tarrytown he said were in 
different towns we have different histories we are the older 
more historic village and the name should reflect that 
a report done by mayor janet gandolfo estimated the cost of the 
name change to range as high as almost 40000 including a new 
seal new badges for police and firefighters and new administrative 
costs 
but mrs belanich said the cost would be higher because it was 
difficult to determine hidden expenses 
and its not necessary she said they think changing the 
name will solve our financial problems and the social problems 
they just dont want to be associated with them 
the village suffered a major racial disturbance in 1986 when 
problems in the hispanic community brought in officers from several 
neighboring communities and led to a countywide evaluation of 
hispanic problems 
financially the village has been running in the red since it 
agreed to lower the property tax assessment for the general motors 
plant which had threatened to sue 
originally called beekmantown the village became north 
tarrytown in 1874 three years after tarrytown was incorporated 
skelly said north tarrytown felt threatened by the town of mount 
pleasant so it aligned itself with tarrytown 
now were just tarrytowns poor relation we dont get enough 
attention and we deserve it because were worldfamous said 
skelly its a very powerful name and image its a potential 
gold mine

new home sales fell 9 percent in january 
pushing sales activity to its slowest pace since the end of the 
last recession the government said wednesday as the housing 
industry continued to stagger following the october stock market 
collapse 
a downturn in housing has often been the harbinger of the onset 
of a recession but analysts said they believed falling mortgage 
rates offered the hope of a rebound in home sales in coming months 
in january the commerce department said that sales of new 
singlefamily homes fell for the third consecutive month dropping 
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 535000 units 26 percent 
below a year ago and the slowest pace since the last recession was 
ending in december 1982 
in a second lackluster economic report the commerce department 
said orders for manufactured goods fell 06 percent in january to a 
seasonally adjusted 2126 billion 
while this was the first decline in five months analysts noted 
that it followed an unusually large 2 percent december increase a 
gain which reflected a big jump in demand for jet airplanes 
analysts said the onemonth setback did nothing to change their 
view that american manufacturers are continuing to enjoy a sales 
boom led by increased demand for exports 
analysts said they were surprised by the sharpness of the 
decline in home sales especially since sales had already fallen by 
68 percent in december and 34 percent in november 
the decline in new home sales followed other reports showing a 
big decline in construction starts for new homes in january and the 
third consecutive monthly decrease in sales of existing homes 
it looks like housing is bearing the brunt of the stock market 
decline but i believe lower interest rates can solve a lot of 
problems in this industry said bob villanueva director of 
economic forecasting for the national association of home builders 
analysts noted that fixedrate mortgages have fallen into the 
singledigit range again averaging 987 percent last week 
compared to 106 percent when the year began 
james christian chief economist for the us league of savings 
institutions said with mortgage rates moving in the right 
direction sales for all of 1988 should rebound to around 650000 
units only 3 percent below the 1987 sales pace 
but other analysts said it remained to be seen whether the drop 
in mortgage rates will be enough to attract new buyers they noted 
that sales have been strong for the past three years and a lot of 
pentup demand has been exhausted 
we simply dont have the demand for housing that we had in the 
first part of the recovery said michael sumichrast an economist 
and publisher of a construction industry newsletter the south 
which accounts for almost half of all new homes sold is still weak 
and you wont see any significant improvement until that area turns 
around 
analysts however said they were not ready to forecast an end 
to the current economic recovery 
we are seeing a shift away from economic growth driven by 
housing and other domestic sectors and toward growth in 
manufacturing and other export sectors said warren lasko 
executive director of the mortgage bankers association 
the 9 percent decline in new home sales in january was the 
steepest decline since a 109 percent drop last may the big 
decline in sales was accompanied by a sharp rise in prices 
the median or midpoint price of a home shot up 97 percent to 
120000 while the average home price rose to 149000 an increase 
of 105 percent 
economists said that while home prices have been outpacing rises 
in overall inflation in recent months the january surge was skewed 
upward by the fact that sales rose in the northeast a highpriced 
section of the country while they were down sharply in the 
lessexpensive south 
sales dropped 244 percent in the south to an annual rate of 
177000 units sales were off 137 percent in the midwest to a rate 
of 88000 units 
sales rose 23 percent in the northeast to an annual rate of 
91000 units but this big increase followed a much larger 53 
percent december decline sales edged up 06 percent in the west to 
an annual rate of 179000 units

the falling of a piece of rock from 
the crumbling body of the sphinx has caused an avalanche of debate 
over the future of the 4600yearold monument and egypts other 
ancient treasures 
the principal casualty of the uproar has been ahmed kadry 
formerly chairman of the egyptian antiquities organization 
kadry lost his job after accusing his boss culture minister 
farouk hosni of staging the falling rock incident to reflect badly 
on kadrys stewardship of the sphinx and the other relics of 
egypts rich past hosni did not reply to the accusation 
the limestone slab fell from the sphinxs right shoulder on feb 
7 six days after a sandstorm buffeted giza plateau 
a restoration plan is in the works the sphinx has been fitted 
with sandbags for support and scaffolding to help in the early 
stages of the effort and a committee of experts has taken rock 
samples for analysis to help decide what steps to take 
the sphinx which is 66 feet high and 160 feet long has the 
head of a pharaoh and the body of a crouching lion many 
egyptologists think the face is that of chephren son of cheops and 
builder of the second pyramid on giza plateau next to cheops great 
pyramid 
a similiar accident six years ago brought down kadrys 
predecessor fouad oraby and a sphinxrestoration project that 
kadry began as antiquities chairman remained unfinished when the 
latest rock fell 
zahi hawass general director of the pyramids area and 
archaeology adviser to hosni will direct the latest restoraton and 
conservation efforts 
the earliest restoration of the sphinx began 3600 years ago 
two hundred years from now all our monuments will be 
finished hawass told the associated press 
in the past the monuments were safe from many factors that 
destroy them because they were buried in the sand the monuments 
were not subjected to pollution the environment tourists the 
things that are ruining them now 
the emergency work on the sphinx should be finished by late 
march with fallen pieces of limestone replaced and weak places 
beneath the neck and shoulders treated hawass said made of weaker 
limestone than other parts the neck long has been considered a 
chronic problem 
after the emergency work experts will draw up an overall 
restoration plan hawass said 
a major problem said omar elarini cairo representative of the 
washingtonbased national science foundation is that previous 
restorers have not learned why the sphinx continues to decay 
in a nutshell we have been looking at symptoms of the 
problems not the problems themselves he said 
we have been treating it as a rock carved 4600 years ago but 
the limestone is 40 million years old our approach should be to 
look at an object of 40 million years 
one of the problems facing the team will be how to rid the 
monument of salt which is visible on many portions of the body 
shawky nakhla chief restorer for the antiquity organization 
said restoration efforts in the 1940s and 1950s added to the 
sphinxs salt problem 
they used cement and a lot of salt started appearing he 
said we dont know if a high water table level below the sphinx 
is a real cause of the salt problems or whether the salt is coming 
out of the limestone itself

pat robertson won a onesided 
preference poll victory in alaskas republican caucuses nearly 
doubling the support given vice president george bush party 
officials said today 
robertson the former television evangelist claimed 47 percent 
of the votes compared with bushs 24 percent in a poll of 2020 
precinct delegates sen bob dole took third with 20 percent 
the preference poll was not binding though it gave an 
indication of the feelings of the delegates who will attend 27 gop 
district conventions march 1826 at those meetings 400 delegates 
will be chosen to attend the state convention in late april when 
the states 19 gop delegates will be named to attend the national 
convention 
a hint of robertsons strength was suggested tuesday when party 
spokesman linda shafer noted that republican regulars had noticed 
new faces in the precinct caucuses that began saturday 
in other earlycontest states robertson supporters have signed 
up thousands of new party members to participate in caucuses 
there were people new to the political process said shafer 
you could tell by their political platforms things like 
antimarijuana and antiabortion that they were church folks 
many of the delegates had been expected to back robertson 
shafer said but robertson had competition on the religious front 
a baptist preacher the rev jerry prevo organized members of his 
anchorage church to attend the caucuses and support bush 
the caucuses were open to any registered republican 
precinct and district delegates have been known to shift 
allegiances but the gop delegates to the national conventions 
never have abandoned their chosen candidates state republican 
chairman jim crawford said 
crawford said the alaska gop is trying to link up with other 
western states in hopes of gaining clout especially in selecting a 
vice presidential candidate 
the democratic partys delegate selection similar to that of 
the republican party is scheduled to begin in alaska with precinct 
caucuses in 10 days

a week ago eric arturo delvalle was reviled as 
a figurehead president of panama whose chief purpose was to provide 
a democratic fig leaf to the military forces who ran the country 
now delvalle the meek has become delvalle the martyr in the 
reagan administrations view he could become a panamanian version 
of philippines president corazon aquino the lightning rod for 
democratic opposition to former philippines president ferdinand 
marcos 
much of the reagan administrations strategy toward panama over 
the past few days has been built around delvalle and his claim to 
be panamas constitutional president 
he is an integral part of the us chipmunk strategy toward 
panama the state department wants to keep gnawing at panamas 
economy at military strongman manuel antonio noriegas claim to 
legitimacy and his support at home and abroad 
noriega is the chieftain of panamas armed forces and 
according to a federal indictment handed up in miami a cocaine 
smuggler 
eventually in the administrations hopes noriega will find his 
hold on power has evaporated and pack up 
in defying noriega and ordering him stripped of power devalle 
provided a democratic symbol around whom panamanians could rally 
delvalles image as a powerless front man dates back to when he 
took office in the fall of 1985 noriega was unhappy with the 
president at the time nicolas ardito barletta because of an 
independent streak and he forced barletta from office 
delvalle was sworn in as president under the most unpromising of 
circumstances in effect he had to behave according to noriegas 
wishes or he would end up like barletta he carried that burden for 
two years 
a mystique has developed around delvalle since he tried to fire 
noriega and wound up out of office himself rather than flee the 
country after his dismissal he went into hiding issuing 
proclamations to his countrymen making videotaped messages and 
frustrating efforts by noriegas forces to locate him 
one of his chief allies these days is gabriel lewis a former 
ambassador to washington who is now a captain of the antinoriega 
campaign in exile 
to hear lewis tell it delvalle had wanted to break with noriega 
for five months but was reluctant to do so because of confusing 
signals from washington 
lewis says noriega has been suspicious of delvalles intentions 
for some time and kept telling the president dont act against 
me because the gringos are behind me 
this was based on what noriega felt were reassuring visits by 
emissaries from washington including assistant defense secretary 
richard armitage 
a turning point occurred in early january lewis said when 
panamanian opposition leaders gathered in miami and delvalle sent 
an envoy 
the emissary told us that if we gave him delvalle assurances 
that we would support him he was ready to act and dismiss 
noriega lewis said 
we sent him back a message lewis said he said the message 
was we have heard that many times we want deeds and not words 
if you fire noriega and his cronies we will give you support 
contacts with lewis and other noriega opponents continued with 
some messages being passed by delvalles dentist in florida 
another turning point took place in early february when two florida 
grand juries charged that noriega was a key figure in an 
international drug smuggling ring 
with an end to the ambiguity in washingtons position the 
opposition front suggested that delvalle travel to washington to 
announce his break with noriega before the organization of american 
states 
delvalle agreed but had second thoughts he reasoned that 
firing noriega at oas headquarters in washington might be seen as 
acting on instructions from the united states lewis said 
but was delvalle getting cold feet 
at lewis instigation sen edward m kennedy dmass called 
delvalle to give him encouragement on feb 17 delvalle was in 
miami and invited assistant secretary of state elliott abrams to 
visit him 
if delvalle was ousted for trying to fire noriega abrams 
assured him the united states would support him as panamas 
constitutional president lewis said 
eight days later in an important moment in panamas tumultuous 
history delvalle acted

a man who has been on the lam for nearly 
four years with a pair of 3ton elephants says hell come in from 
the cold if he is assured that tory and duchess will not be 
returned to two men he alleges brutalized them 
arlan seidon raised the indian elephants from infancy and then 
sold them to edward drake in may 1984 he and the 7foothigh 
beasts disappeared in a tractortrailer 
he surfaced last week when he called a newspaper from an 
undisclosed location to say hed surrender if guaranteed that the 
elephants will not be returned to drake and his father richard 
i want to make sure where they are going to i dont feel that 
im going to spend this much time trying to protect them so they 
end up back with the drakes seidon told the starledger of 
newark 
i know i sound like a crazy old man but im not he said 
the elephants owners and the president of a national animal 
trainers group say the animals were not harmed and both sides 
accuse each other of lacking an elephantlike memory about the 
incident 
edward drake says seidon sold him the elephants for 80000 in 
1981 when the drakes owned an exotic animal ranch in tehachapi 
calif about 200 miles north of los angeles 
drake said tuesday that seidon acted as his booking agent for 
animal shows after the sale but began cheating taking money and 
finally the elephants while a circus was in new jersey 
seidon told the starledger he exercised the terms of the sale 
contract by repossessing the elephants when the drakes fell behind 
in their payments 
while waiting for money at a colts neck township farm seidon 
said he discovered the animals had wounds caused by hooks piercing 
their skin during training on may 4 1984 after a superior court 
judge in monmouth county ordered the elephants returned he fled 
with them 
his attorney estelle strauss said tuesday her client never 
stole money and that he only wanted to help tory and duchess 
the elephants condition was never aired at the trial said 
ms strauss he had an agreement that he could repossess the 
animals if they were abused his position has not changed 
but edward drake who like his father is now out of the animal 
business said seidons story about the elephants treatment is 
so farfetched its unbelievable 
john cuneo president of the illinoisbased national congress of 
animal trainers and breeders said the drakes did not abuse their 
animals they had beautiful elephants i even wanted to buy 
one he said 
cuneo said anyone concerned about an animals condition can 
alert state federal and private monitoring authorities 
seidon has forsaken his fordland mo farm and his career 
preparing animals for circus and television appearances to care for 
his 25yearold elephants who eat about 200 pounds of hay a day 
ms strauss said she does not know where or how seidon conceals 
the elephants he calls her periodically to check on his case she 
said 
she said he would come forward to face criminal charges 
thirddegree theft carrying a sentence of up to five years in 
prison a 100000 fine or both if he wins a safe haven for the 
elephants the attorney filed a court motion last week to overturn 
the judgment awarding the animals to the drakes 
county assistant prosecutor alton kenney said he was not ready 
to discuss any deals for seidon and had not heard from ms strauss

the communist party said wednesday a 
sweeping political purge of two decades ago showed manifestations 
of antisemitism but it added that most party members took no 
part in the religious bias 
more than 9000 jews lost official positions in the 1968 
antizionist purge and an estimated 1200020000 emigrated 
more than half the jews then living in poland 
the acknowledgement of antisemitism by the party newspaper 
trybuna ludu carried the authority of an official statement it 
also was repeated by the staterun news agency pap and reported 
prominently on state tv and radio 
but one leader of the 1968 student protests which sparked the 
purge said the newspapers article did not go far enough in its 
condemnation of antisemitism and that it repeated past slanders 
against jews 
it amounts to drawing wool over peoples eyes said adam 
michnik a writer and prominent leader of polands antigovernment 
opposition 
the article in trybuna ludu the official daily of the polish 
united workers communist party was timed to coincide with the 
20th anniversary of the 1968 events 
discrimination against jews in the guise of antizionism 
which had begun after the june 1967 israeli victory in the middle 
east war accelerated sharply after march 1968 student 
demonstrations around the country against censorship 
the purge which began within the party soon spread to the 
government army academia press and other official institutions 
the newspaper said some conservative nationalist party factions 
at the time took advantage of the jewish ancestry of their 
political rivals 
they did not realize then that they were being manipulated by 
various political factions which in different ways made use of 
their actions 
some western histories have charged that students were provoked 
by conservative factions using them to provide a pretext for a 
purge 
poland was home to about 35 million jews before the war who 
represented about 10 percent of the population estimates vary but 
the number of jews in the country now is believed to be between

negotiators on wednesday launched their latest and 
possibly last round of afghanistan peace talks and the un 
mediator said he was confident of forging a settlement to end 
soviet involvement in the country 
this was a good session pakistans acting foreign minister 
zain noorani said as he emerged from the first closeddoor meeting 
late wednesday we are cautiously optimistic 
pakistan is representing the afghan guerrillas in the talks 
afghanistans foreign minister abdul wakil told reporters that 
his meeting with mediator diego cordovez was very nice 
cordovez has been the gobetween since the indirect negotiations 
began nearly six years ago because pakistan refuses to recognize 
afghanistans sovietbacked government the delegations sit in 
separate rooms with cordovez shuttling back and forth 
before the talks opened cordovez told reporters he believed 
both sides had the political will to work out an agreement 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev announced last month that if 
a settlement were signed by march 15 the withdrawal of an 
estimated 115000 red army troops from afghanistan could begin by 
may 15 
the soviets intervened in 1979 to back the kabul government in 
its war with moslem guerrillas 
pakistan wants any settlement to be accompanied by formation of 
a transitional government replacing the present one headed by 
president najib 
it argues that only a broadbased government could prevent new 
bloodshed in a country where war has already claimed more than a 
million lives 
cordovez said the new talks would last as long as necessary 
to reach an agreement and added perhaps it will be signed 
earlier than you think 
he said some difficult problems remained but said he was 
sure they could be resolved soon 
cordovez didnt say what those problems were but reports have 
suggested they focus on the timetable for the soviet withdrawal and 
the timing of the cutoff of military aid to the warring sides 
the united states last year gave an estimated 700 million worth 
of military assistance to the 200000 insurgents fighting the 
soviets and the smaller afghan forces 
noorani said pakistan will decide next week whether it is 
prepared to sign a settlement with the present afghan leadership 
the decision will come after consultations sunday between prime 
minister mohammed khan junejo and political leaders including 
those from opposition groups 
pakistan has argued that under current conditions the more than 
3 million afghan refugees in pakistan and another 2 million in iran 
could not return home 
cordovez said civil strife is part of the way of life 
there and he said there was a posibility that it would 
continue but he added that he believed that the people of 
afghanistan are tired of this conflict that they want peace 
cordovez said he had been in contact with representatives of 
several countries including the united states the soviet union 
the european community and australia to discuss humanitarian aid 
to afghanistan after a settlement 
i have the feeling that there will be a broad international 
effort he said 
the sense of optimism was not shared by iran which is not 
participating in the talks tehran has refused to participate as 
long as the moslem resistance is not invited 
iranian ambassador sirous nasseri told reporters that iran 
attaches no significance to the settlement as it is being 
forumulated here he said the main problems were related to 
formation of a government acceptable to all afghans and the phasing 
of the soviet pullout 
i doubt very much that this could be solved here he said

a harvard student who contends she is 
being excluded from the breeding grounds of power is challenging 
the membership policies of nine exclusive allmale student clubs 
in her complaint before massachusetts commission against 
discrimination lisa j schkolnick argues that the fly and eight 
other final clubs may be violating state laws prohibiting 
sexual discrimination in public institutions by refusing to admit 
women 
schkolnick said in a recent interview that she picked the fly at 
random as the target of her suit and considers it representative 
of the other clubs the commission a quasilegal entity has the 
power to investigate cases award damages and seek injuctions 
the clubhouses are located in some of the most expensive real 
estate holdings in and around harvard square discreetly shielded 
by tall hedges and unmarked doors some have separate entraces for 
women visitors 
they were originally called final clubs to distinguish them from 
waiting clubs less exclusive now extinct organizations evolving 
from fraternities to eating clubs in the past century they became 
social meeting places by the 1950s past members have included both 
franklin and theodore roosevelt and several members of the kennedy 
clan 
harvard formally severed ties to the clubs in 1984 after 
members refused a university demand to admit women but 
schkolnicks case rests on the argument that the clubs remain an 
integral part of student life and cannot be considered private 
the issue has become a major topic of debate on campus 
the undergraduate student council last week narrowly rejected a 
proposal to endorse schkolniks cause but voted to reimburse 250 
in office costs to a lawyer who offered to help her without a fee 
harvard law professor alan dershowitz expressed moral support 
urging council members to back schkolnick 
i think its the first major challenge to what have been very 
entrenched institutions at harvard dershowitz said in an 
interview these finals clubs are the minor leagues for the power 
clubs in the major cities the allmale ones 
dershowitz a former yale student compared the clubs to yale 
groups so secret i didnt even know about them until i 
graduated and to princeton universitys two remaining allmale 
eating clubs now appealing a state order to admit women 
barbara bolten vice president of public relations in the boston 
chapter of the national organization for women said we support 
the philosophy of what shes doing totally and i hope she wins 
schkolnick a 21yearold philosophy senior from princeton 
nj said she was the target of a rash of crank calls some 
obscene others frightening for several weeks after she filed 
her complaint dec 14 
she suggested that the clubs serve as oldboy networks to the 
detriment of women 
these are power centers and these people are being fed into 
powerful positions and women are being excluded she said im 
going to be a lawyer one day and i could have used some of these 
positions that members are exposed to 
the clubs in turn deny that their members gain undue advantage 
through networking and argue they are strictly private 
organizations which should be allowed to decide on membership 
there are some people in the clubs established in business 
but its definitely not an institutionalized process through which 
you secure interviews through alumni said stan novak former 
president of the fox final club 
novak who graduated last year was the only one of several 
final club members polled on the controversy willing to go on the 
record judith malone a lawyer retained by the fly declined 
comment 
the clubs do not publicize their membership rolls but several 
students estimated that more than 10 percent of harvards 
undergraduate males belong total undergraduate enrollment is about 
6400 
novak said membership didnt help him in his job search 
the fact that after being president for a year i was still 
sitting around from june till jan 1 that will give you an idea 
about how effective alumni ties are said novak of 
barrington ri

the supreme court was urged on wednesday to 
block states from recouping the costs of keeping criminals behind 
bars by seizing money which prison inmates receive in federal 
benefits 
lawyers representing the reagan administration and a former 
prison inmate attacked an arkansas law that let authorities seize 
for state use an inmates social security or veterans 
administration benefits 
they said the law similar to those enacted in four other 
states conflicts with federal laws specificially barring any legal 
action aimed at diverting benefits away from designated recipients 
congress could have made an exception for state institutional 
care argued justice department lawyer richard j lazarus but 
congress has not done so here in our view that is simply the end 
of the issue 
thomas m carpenter a little rock lawyer representing former 
state prison inmate george bennett also contended that the 
arkansas law must fall 
the issue before the high court is not whether those inmates 
with available money may be charged for their imprisonment but 
whether states may get at money the inmates receive in federal 
benefits 
the impact of the justices decision expected by july has been 
blunted somewhat by laws passed by congress in 1980 and 1983 
withholding or limiting benefits otherwise due imprisoned felons 
the justices asked few questions and what had been scheduled as 
a hourlong argument session was over in 35 minutes 
bennett had served 11 years of a 21year sentence at a pine 
bluff prison for seconddegree murder when he turned 62 he started 
receiving 275 a month in social security retirement benefits 
bennett was released from prison in late 1984 but is seeking to 
recover 3600 in benefits confiscated by the state 
the arkansas legislature in 1981 had passed an inmate care and 
custody reimbursement act under it state authorities may seek 
court approval to seize an inmates estate income from any source 
similar laws have been enacted in michigan ohio oklahoma and 
tennessee 
reagan administration lawyers had told the justices in briefs 
submitted previously that the rationale used by the arkansas 
supreme court in upholding the 1981 state law would seem to 
validate the attachment of social security and va benefits paid to 
persons confined in state mental hospitals or in other institutions 
where they are provided care by the state 
they said it is important for the arkansas law to be invalidated 
so the growing number of states asking prison inmates to help foot 
the bill of their imprisonment will not seize federal benefits 
arkansas attorney general steve clark told the justices 
wednesday that arkansas merely was trying to prevent windfall 
benefits for prison inmates who receive their food clothing and 
medical care at state expense 
clark said congress intent of protecting people from the 
rigors of poverty was not frustrated by the arkansas statute at 
all 
responding to clarks contention that the state had not 
created any kind of hardship carpenter said his client could 
make good use of the money wrongly withheld from him 
carpenter described bennett as a 69yearold man who cant get 
a job and who would be destitute if he had not been cared for by 
relatives 
the case is bennett vs arkansas 866124

a nineday sitin by minority students at 
hampshire college ended wednesday with the signing of a 16point 
agreement designed to encourage racial harmony at the small private 
school 
the acceptance of our demands by the administration is both an 
acknowledgment of institutional indifference and neglect and of the 
immediate need for redress anita fearman a spokeswoman for the 
protesters told a gathering of 150 students 
the group watched as college president adele simmons and two 
other administrators signed the document outside the dormitory 
office occupied by an estimated 40 protesters since feb 23 
the sixpage settlement provided for a dean of multicultural 
affairs an adviser for the group that occupied dakin house office 
and at least 4500 in yearly funding for the group 
the adminstration also agreed to take no disciplinary action 
against the students and to allow them to make up work they missed 
during the sitin 
i think the institution won simmons said after the signing 
for the last several years weve been working to improve student 
life and this represents a finishing of the old agenda 
a number of the things they asked for were already in place 
but i think the occupation strengthened the institution she said 
dean of students trey williams said the occupation had taken a 
toll on many at the liberal arts school where about 100 of the 
1100 students are minorities 
the students are exhausted the president is sick but its 
better that it took us only one week than forever he said 
the occupation was prompted by what students described as the 
schools longstanding indifference to their concerns 
they were claiming this is a multiculturally diverse 
community which isnt true said protester penny predmas 
college officials said the allegation was a surprise given the 
schools image as a progressive alternative to the sort of 
traditional liberal arts education offered at nearby amherst mount 
holyoke and smith colleges hampshire students design their own 
courses of study and graduate after passing three divisional 
examinations requiring them to complete individual research 
projects and some classwork 
were way in front in transforming curriculum to be much more 
global said faculty dean penina glazer but were lagging in 
recruiting of minority students and were trying as hard as we 
can 
the agreement came two weeks after the end of an occupation at 
nearby university of massachusetts that was sparked by campus 
racial violence that takeover ended when chancellor joseph duffey 
agreed to increase funding of minority student programs and other 
demands 
a university disciplinary hearing began tuesday into allegations 
that five white male students assaulted two black male students on 
feb 7 said spokeswoman jeanne hopkins 
protesters at hampshire said racial violence is rare on their 
campus but said there have been several instances of harassment 
and discrimination since a cross was found burning on a building 
lawn 11 years ago 
the protesters said however that the sympathy shown them by 
students and faculty during the occupation had changed their minds 
about warning minorities away from the school 
i really would tell them to come here said predmas 
a few white students watching the signing ceremony said they 
supported the protesters aims but disagreed over the wisdom of 
occupying the dormitory office 
there basically was a lot of friction said paul trunnell 
the feeling was either youre in or out either you support us 
or you dont well no two of us agreed on this campus but its 
important that we band together to solve these sorts of problems

democrat jesse jackson didnt have a paid 
staff much money or very high hopes in overwhelmingly white 
vermont but his campaign pulled off a strong secondplace finish 
in tuesdays presidential primary 
it has a tremendous significance on a symbolic level 
garrison nelson a university of vermont political science 
professor said wednesday this is exactly what jackson hoped 
for he can now say he appealed to more than just blacks going into 
super tuesday 
jackson finished with 26 percent behind massachusetts gov 
michael dukakis whose 15person paid staff and 60plus volunteers 
helped him capture 57 percent of the vote vice president george 
bush won the gop primary 
this is a homegrown campaign where people have worked all the 
time constantly on the issues said chris wood of the jackson 
campaign were working on issues that jackson is talking about 
wood said many of those who worked for jackson also were active 
in grass roots organizations supporting lowincome vermonters and 
the states financially distressed dairy farmers many also have 
protested apartheid in south africa 
jackson raked in three times as many votes tuesday as he did in 
1984 when he won 78 percent of the vote 
according to unofficial results with 100 percent of the states 
262 precincts reporting dukakis had 57 percent jackson 26 
percent rep richard gephardt 8 percent sen paul simon 5 percent 
and former sen gary hart who won vermont in 1984 4 percent sen 
albert gore jr was not on the ballot here 
on the republican side bush received 49 percent sen bob dole 
39 percent former television evangelist pat robertson 5 percent 
and rep jack kemp 4 percent 
political observers had predicted a tight race between jackson 
and gephardt for second place but jackson stole the show 
he ran a strong second in the states largest city of burlington 
and actually beat dukakis in 27 smaller communities and tied him in 
two 
it depended really on volunteers said eric davis a 
political science professor at middlebury college they werent 
putting up lawn signs they werent doing mailings to get almost 
30 percent of the vote just on grass roots says something about 
jacksons appeal 
jacksons campaign was propelled by the alliance of the rainbow 
coalition of vermont and the progressive coalition and its most 
prominent member burlington mayor bernard sanders 
sanders a socialist endorsed jackson during one of his recent 
visits to the state jackson was one of the few candidates to 
actively campaign in vermont in the last days before the election

banks recorded their least profitable year 
since the great depression in 1987 but a top federal regulator 
said wednesday he sees better days ahead 
the nations federally insured commercial banks earned 37 
billion last year on assets of 3 trillion down from 175 billion 
earnings in 1986 said l william seidman chairman of the federal 
deposit insurance corp 
that amounted to a return on assets of only 013 percent last 
year and was the lowest level since the fdic which insures 
deposits of up to 100000 was established in 1934 
the yeartoyear drop in earnings was due entirely to large 
banks adding to reserves to cover anticipated losses on loans to 
third world countries seidman said nine of the 10 largest banks 
and 17 of the 25 largest reported a loss for 1987 
absent the extraordinary reserving for developing country 
loans net income would have been roughly equal to 1986s 
level seidman said in the fdics bank profile for the fourth 
quarter of 1987 
seidman said he believed there was a good chance that banks 
could avoid further large additions to reserves for bad third world 
loans and said the outlook for 1988 is cautiously optimistic 
barring any new shocks loan loss provisioning should be lower 
than usual this year and profitablity at money center and regional 
banks will be much improved seidman said predicting that bank 
profits this year could return to about the 1986 level 
he also said office occupancy rates and other signs appear to 
indicate that the economy of the southwest which accounted for 
more than half of last years bank failures may have hit bottom 
and be on the rebound but he cautioned that much of the regions 
health depends on oil prices remaining stable or rising 
the oilproducing states of texas louisiana and oklahoma 
accounted for 95 of last years 184 bank failures the most 
recorded since 1933 twentyeight banks have failed in the first 
two months of this year 16 of them in the three oil states 
the number of federally insured commercial banks which is 
shrinking because of failures and mergers dwindled from a peak of 
about 14500 in 1985 to about 13700 last year the lowest number 
since 1971 
the results for all of 1987 masked a more positive fourth 
quarter despite loan loss provisions of 77 billion for the 
quarter banks posted a 32 billion profit 25 percent higher than 
the last quarter of 1986 
seidman said banks were especially strengthened in the fourth 
quarter by a flood of new deposits as investors after the oct 19 
stock market crash pulled their money out of stocks and put it into 
insured bank accounts 
the crash also triggered a surge in loan demand from stock 
brokerages and other financial service firms the fdic chairman 
said and because the federal reserve pumped money into the 
economy in response to the crash banks are enjoying lower interest 
rates 
another encouraging sign seidman said was the drop from 1609 
to 1559 during the last half of 1987 in the number of banks on the 
fdics problem list 
in addition the number of banks losing money fell for the first 
time since 1980 the fdic estimated that 2366 banks were 
unprofitable last year down from 2784 in 1986 and 2453 in 1985 
in a report earlier this week the fdic said its insurance fund 
held steady in 1987 despite the heavy load of bank failures the 
fund finished the year at 183 billion up modestly from 1825 
billion at the end of 1986 
the slight gain was posted despite a provision for the 
secondlargest bank rescue ever by the fdic shareholders of first 
city bancorporation of houston are scheduled to vote friday on a 
restructuring package that would involve nearly 1 billion in 
government assistance

the supreme court on wednesday made it more 
difficult for people to win lawsuits against a city government 
based on claims that lowranking officials violated their rights 
but the decision in a st louis case yielded no clearcut 
majority view and left some key questions unanswered 
by a 71 vote the justices threw out a 15000 award st louis 
was ordered to pay james j praprotnik a fired city architect 
but only four of the seven justices voting to overturn the award 
joined in the courts main opinion creating the possibility that a 
future case could prompt a different result 
justice sandra day oconnor who wrote the courts main opinion 
said generally only the highest ranking city officials can commit 
constitutional violations that make the city liable 
in the case of st louis that is limited to the mayor city 
aldermen and the civil service commission she said 
cities may not be held liable unless those who claim their 
rights were violated prove the existence of an unconstitutional 
municipal policy oconnor said 
a city cannot be sued successfully based on the claim that 
highranking officials failed to override a subordinates decision 
that violated someones rights she added 
simply going along with discretionary decisions made by ones 
subordinates is not a delegation to them of the authority to 
make policy oconnor said 
she also said that state law and not a jurys examination of 
the facts in a particular case determines who the policy makers 
are in a city 
justice william j brennan in a separate opinion said 
oconnors opinion turns a blind eye to reality in assuming who 
makes policy in a particular community 
brennan said oconnors opinion ultimately would permit 
municipalities to insulate themselves from liability for the acts 
of all but a small minority of actual city policy makers 
brennans opinion was joined by justices thurgood marshall and 
harry a blackmun nonetheless all three voted with oconnor and 
three other justices to throw out praprotniks 15000 award they 
said a st louis official who transferred praprotnik to a job that 
led to his firing lacked policymaking authority 
oconnors opinion was joined by chief justice william h 
rehnquist and justices byron r white and antonin scalia 
justice john paul stevens dissented voting to uphold 
praprotniks lower court victory justice anthony m kennedy who 
only recently joined the court did not take part in the decision 
praprotnik was a midlevel manager in st louis community 
development agency when in 1980 he became embroiled with his 
superiors over the proposed installation by the city of a 
controversial sculpture 
praprotnik was suspended for 15 days by a superior for having 
accepted outside employment without prior approval but after he 
appealed to the city civil service commission he was reinstated 
with back pay 
then in 1982 he was transferred to another city agency and his 
job responsibilities were reduced he was fired in what the city 
said was a budgetcutting move on dec 30 1983 
praprotnik then sued under a federal civil rights law charging 
he was shunted to a deadend job and then kicked out because of his 
appeal to the civil service commission for his suspension back in 
1980 
a jury awarded him 30000 the 8th us circuit court of 
appeals reduced the amount to 15000 while ruling he was fired for 
exercising his constitutional rights 
the appeals court said the city was liable even though the jury 
exonerated the individual officials sued by praprotnik 
the justices on wednesday ordered further lower court hearings 
for praprotnik to determine whether he still has a viable case 
in another ruling the justices by a 44 vote ruled that an 
airline may be forced to continue to collect union dues from 
workers after its contract with employees has expired 
the court upheld rulings that forced trans world airlines to 
continue the dues checkoff for replacement employees during a 
strike by flight attendants in 1986 twa also was forced to collect 
dues from the strikers once they returned to work 
the ruling was not accompanied by any written opinion or by any 
indication of how each individual justice voted

the commerce department said wednesday that 
orders to us factories for manufactured goods fell 06 percent in 
january the first decline in five months but private economists 
said the setback was not serious 
the report said orders for both durable and nondurable goods 
dropped to a seasonally adjusted 2126 billion in january down 
125 billion from december when orders had posted a huge 2 
percent increase 
it was the first setback in orders since a 14 percent drop in 
august but economists discounted the decline contending that it 
reflected a swing in the volatile transportation category 
transportation orders declined 88 percent in january erasing 
an 89 percent december increase which had reflected a big jump in 
orders for passenger jets 
without the large swings in transportation factory orders would 
have climbed 08 percent in january following a 09 percent 
december rise 
manufacturing has been enjoying steady increases over the past 
year as american producers enjoy booming export sales spurred by 
the decline in the value of the dollar 
lawrence chimerine president of the wefa group a private 
forecasting firm said that the january factory orders showed more 
strength than analysts had been expecting 
he said manufacturing demand is holding up well despite a large 
increase in business inventories during the final three months of 
the year the big inventory rise has raised concerns that orders 
will need to be cut until the backlog of unsold goods is reduced 
the inventory scare may be somewhat overblown if it was that 
serious we would probably see orders weakening more sharply he 
said while the economy is not booming manufacturing is still on 
an upward trend and we are likely to miss a recession 
the reagan administration is counting on continued strength in 
export sales to provide almost half of the expected growth in the 
overall economy this year 
the january decline in manufactured goods included a 15 percent 
drop in demand for durable goods an advance report a week ago put 
the january decline in durable goods at 28 percent orders for 
nondurable goods items not expected to last at least three years 
rose 05 percent in january erasing a 05 percent december decline 
demand for military equipment fell 38 percent in january 
following a 71 percent drop in december 
orders for nondefense capital goods a key category which 
reflects industry plans to expand and modernize rose 26 percent 
in january following a 126 percent december advance 
shipments of manufactured goods fell 17 percent in january to 
2077 billion following a 2 percent december increase

bernhard goetz jr has inherited 140550 
from his fathers estate but the man known as the new york subway 
gunman has huge legal bills that will quickly eat that up and 
more his attorney says 
that wont go very far in defending him on anything said 
joseph kelner an attorney defending goetz in three civil cases 
asking a total of 63 million in damages 
goetz 40 was sentenced last october to six months in jail and 
five years probation for carrying an unlicensed gun which he used 
to shoot four teenagers on a subway in december 1984 three of the 
four are suing him for injuries and punitive damages 
goetz who claimed the shootings were in selfdefense is free 
on 5000 bond while his case is appealed 
his father bernhard willard goetz sr died in 1984 and his 
estate was recently settled in orange county probate court after 
payment of taxes there was 562200 to be split between the 
younger goetz his brother and two sisters 
the estates attorney jerome bornstein said wednesday that all 
money had been distributed to the heirs within the past few days 
the elder goetz moved to orlando in 1963 from rhinebeck ny 
where the family owned a dairy a bookbinding company and real 
estate he joined his brothers fritz and ludwig in developing a

new rules are being prepared to help farmers 
pay off loans owed to the farmers home administration including 
provisions that allow the agency to write off some of the debt so 
that families can stay on the land officials said wednesday 
joe oneill an fmha spokesman said the new rules probably will 
be ready by june in many cases overburdened borrowers could have 
much of their debt written off trimmed back to reflect their 
assets in hopes of keeping them in business 
however oneill said he had no estimate of how much debt the 
fmha might write off under the new rules 
theres just no way of knowing he said itll be each 
individual case all the way through 
at the end of the 1987 fiscal year on sept 30 oneill said 
261291 fmha borrowers owed the agency about 26 billion of that 
127671 were delinquent owing 66 billion including principal 
and interest 
the new rules are a result of a bill passed by congress in 
december calling on the fmha an agriculture department agency that 
serves as a lender of last resort for the nations farmers to 
go easier on borrowers who are behind in their payments 
the new law requires the agency to do whatever possible to 
restructure loans in order to keep fmha borrowers in business 
our attitude is going to be different fmha administrator 
vance l clark told the new york times we want to make the new 
act work and were going to have a lot of room to maneuver to 
restructure these loans 
lynn hayes an attorney with the farmers legal action group in 
st paul minn said im thrilled they are apparently taking 
this legislation seriously and are trying to make it work 
her group has been active for years in challenging fmha policies 
aimed at tougher enforcement of agency collection policies 
including a 1983 lawsuit that led to a suspension of foreclosure 
actions until regulations were redesigned to let borrowers know 
their alternatives 
congress partly at the prodding of the activist organizations 
agreed that fmha should slow down and overhaul its policies 
as a last resort the new rules would let fmha write off debts 
in excess of a borrowers assets oneill said for example if a 
farmers assets were 150000 and debts totaled 500000 the 
writeoff could be as much as 350000 if the fmha determined the 
farmer could handle the remainder by staying in business 
it makes sense then to keep that person in business and 
write off the difference between what they owe and their assets 
if the government stands a chance of retrieving more by keeping 
that farmer going oneill said were trying to carry out the 
intent of congress in the agricultural credit act of 1987 as 
closely as we can

the state departments legal adviser said 
wednesday that the senate should not revise the arms pact with the 
soviet union to bind future administrations to the current 
understanding of its intent 
i dont think it is necessary or desirable to do that kind of 
thing legal adviser abraham d sofaer said in an interview with 
the associated press 
but an aide to sen alan cranston dcalif said that based on 
discussions cranston has had with senators from both parties he 
expects there to be language in the ratification resolution 
addressing the treaty interpretation issues 
few people disagree over the meaning of the intermediaterange 
nuclear forces treaty signed at the ussoviet summit in 
washington last december calling on the superpowers to destroy 
their nuclear missiles with ranges of 300 miles to 3000 miles 
the heart of the dispute rather is interpretation of the 1972 
antiballistic missile treaty sofaer is the author of the broad 
interpretation of the abm treaty which would allow wider testing 
of components of president reagans strategic defense initiative 
known as star wars 
cranstons legislative aide gerry warburg said the language 
expected in the inf resolution would contain a more broad 
statement concerning the intepretation of treaties generally 
including the abm pact 
cranston along with sen sam nunn dga the chairman of the 
senate armed services committee and sen joseph biden ddel a 
member of the senate foreign relations committee have been 
discussing the issue with secretary of state george p shultz but 
have not reached agreement warburg said 
sofaer said inclusion of restrictive language in a resolution 
ratifying the inf treaty would not be binding on the soviet union 
and could complicate rather than resolve the issue 
i know that they are not going to get a settlement of the abm 
dispute this way sofaer said 
it is a potential problem for inf ratification and i think 
overwhelmingly people support inf ratification he said 
sofaer noted that shultz had sent the senate the 31volume 
negotiating record of the inf pact and also had agreed that any 
testimony by administration officials would be authoritative 
and reflect the presidents understanding of the treaty 
those practical things have been achieved sofaer said 
while the senate can bind the administration to a particular 
interpretation of either the inf or the abm treaties he said it 
cannot bind the soviet union unless the treaties are renegotiated 
the treaty reflects two relationships he said it 
reflects a relationship between two sovereign nations and then it 
also reflects the relations betwen the united states executive 
branch and the senate 
when you talk about the meaning of a treaty you are talking 
about the international relationship you are talking about what 
binds the two nations he said

an american artist said wednesday he 
signed an agreement with the soviet union to launch what could be 
the first sculpture in space a huge ring with peace written on 
it in different languages 
arthur woods said he signed the agreement last week with dmitri 
poletayev a representative of the soviet space agency glavkosmos 
to launch the sculpture in 1990 or 1991 
he said the ring with a diameter of 20 feet would be 
transported on a proton rocket to the mir space station from which 
it would be deployed 
woods will be responsible for financing the launch and 
sculpture at an estimated cost of 300000 funding is to come 
from private contributions of at least 35 each said woods who 
calls the project orbiting unification ring satellite or ours 
this project is a gesture of getting the public involved in 
something that could send a sentiment of world peace into space 
said woods 39 
woods said he asked nasa if it wanted to launch a similar 
sculpture but had not received a reply 
woods said the ring would be a prototype for another project 
in the works a 3300footdiameter sculpture that he hopes will 
be put in orbit by the year 200 he said it would be visible from 
earth 
woods said the sculptures would be made of a foillike substance 
which would be inflated in space and then become rigid when exposed 
to sunlight he said the technology known as isrs for inflatable 
space rigidized structures had been developed by a swiss company 
contraves he said he was collaborating with contraves on the 
projects 
woods said he grew up near cape canaveral and worked there for 
two summers while he was a student he moved to switzerland in 1974 
and describes himself as a painter and sculptor

sen edward m kennedy dmass on wednesday 
unveiled a 266 million democratic plan to bolster the governments 
emergency food programs saying we cannot afford to do less to 
battle hunger 
kennedy chairman of the senate labor and human resources 
committee said the bill would increase funding for federal 
programs for food stamps school breakfasts child care food and 
summer food service 
we have to ask what the cost of not doing this will be 
kennedy said at a news conference 
sen patrick j leahy dvt said the question of hunger is a 
moral issue and a test of americas conscience 
rep leon panetta dcalif introduced companion antihunger 
legislation in the house 
kennedy said domestic hunger had been largely eradicated by the 
late 1970s but that the recession of the early 1980s coupled with 
sharp cuts in social programs under the reagan administration has 
brought it back at record levels 
the emergency hunger relief act of 1988 would focus on the 
governments food stamp program a program started under kennedys 
brother john f kennedy in 1961 the senator argued that benefits 
for many families are running out well before the end of the month 
for a typical family of four the bill would increase benefits 
by about six meals per month per person 
eligibility modifications would add about 1 million people to 
the food stamp program kennedy estimated there now are 186 
million recipients 
the bill also would 
allow other nonprofit organizations besides schools and local 
governments to operate the summer food service program the current 
limitations have denied thousands of children nutritious lunches 
during the summer when schools are closed the lawmakers said 
kennedy said an estimated 170000 additional children would be 
receive benefits under the plan 
extend the temporary food assistance program and authorize 50 
million annually for the distribution to the needy of corn wheat 
and other surplus commodities 
increase to 10 million a year the authorization for the 
community food and nutrition program which funds soup kitchens and 
relief centers the current authorization is at 3 million annually 
increase school breakfast funding by 3 cents per meal so 
children can have eggs on most mornings 
the bill calls for 266 million in new spending in fiscal 1989 
and 675 million in 1990 
we could obviously do more but we cannot afford to do less 
kennedy said the measure is designed to be a new declaration 
of war on hunger and this time we intend to see that the war stays

a teenager testified wednesday that his 
14yearold friend plotted the murder of a classmate saying he 
wanted to know what it was like to kill someone 
robbie peterson 16 told a hushed courtroom how he was twice 
shown the body by rod matthews and even accompanied matthews and 
another friend to a pizza parlor to eat after viewing the victim 
matthews 15 went on trial wednesday as an adult for the murder 
of shaun ouillette 14 
the body remained near a lonely wooded hilltop for three weeks 
before another friend wrote an anonymous letter to police 
rod said not to say anything peterson said he said it 
could happen to us he said you never know 
norfolk county assistant district attorney peter casey told the 
jury of 12 men and four women that matthews plotted the death of 
his schoolmate for more than a month 
he was deliberate in the plan and put it into effect 
efficently and effectively he said 
in opening arguments defense attorney john philip white jr 
said his client suffered from a psychiatric illness of major 
proportions and was not in contact with reality 
white said matthews was affected by his use of ritalin a 
stimulant used to calm hyperactive children 
peterson testified matthews began talking about killing someone 
around halloween 1986 he refined his plan to lure a victim to a 
deserted area known as the pits then beat him with a baseball 
bat peterson said matthews also planned to cut off his victims 
legs and toss them 
i said why he said he wanted to know what it was like to kill 
somebody he said just for the heck of it said peterson 
the teenager testifying in a barely audible voice told how 
matthews named several potential victims before settling on 
ouillette an overweight high school freshman 
he said he ouillette would be the least missed that he 
didnt have that many friends peterson said 
peterson said he had warned other potential victims not to go to 
matthews home although he knew of matthews plan to lure 
ouillette into the woods with the promise of fireworks peterson 
said he only suggested to ouillette that he have matthews bring the 
fireworks to school 
peterson said the day of the murder he saw matthews walking down 
the street with a baseball bat and asked if he killed ouillette he 
said matthews hestitated before admitting to the killing then 
agreed to take peterson to the murder scene after leaving a large 
knife in petersons room 
peterson said matthews explained how he walked in ouillettes 
footsteps in the snow then hit him with a bat 
he said shaun fell down and said help me and rod hit him 
again 
ouillettes mother jeanne quinn sobbed as she heard the 
description of her sons murder matthews was expressionless 
white portrayed his client as a youth from a troubled home 
obsessed with personal hygiene and fascinated by fire he told of a 
note matthews wrote to a health teacher a canton high school which 
warned of his plans to kill 
according to white the note read in part my problem is that 
i like to do crazy things lately i want to kill people i hate 
and i want to set houses on fire 
white said the teacher made note of the letter on a file card 
but did nothing until after matthews was arrested

a state judge has accused the cuomo 
administration of blacklisting construction companies that fail to 
comply with affirmative action rules and then allowing the 
companies to buy their way off the list 
quoting from a section of federal law defining extortion state 
supreme court justice harold hughes said he was referring the case 
to federal and state prosecutors and to the states commission on 
goverment integrity for review 
the ruling in a lawsuit filed by a paving contractors group 
against the state was made public wednesday 
in the courts view a judge is under a duty to report 
potential criminal activity that comes to light in the course of a 
proceeding pending before him said hughes this is especially 
so when government officials are involved 
hughes did not charge that crimes had been committed and he 
said his referral to the prosecutors had been recommended by the 
states attorney in the case 
administration officials denied wrongdoing or that a blacklist 
existed 
it would appear to be somewhat of a strange decision and our 
counsels will be reviewing it with the state attorney generals 
office said anne crowley a spokeswoman for gov mario cuomo 
the suit was filed by the new york state asphalt pavement 
association a group representing 34 contractors against state 
department of transportation commissioner franklin white and state 
office of general services commissioner john egan 
it asked that white and egan stop imposing restrictions on 
member companies other than what was written in law 
in denying a state motion to dismiss the associations lawsuit 
hughes said one construction company to get off the blacklist had 
agreed to pay 150000 to a notforprofit organization or other 
support entities whose purpose is to provide support to the 
states disadvantaged minority womens business enterprise 
program 
compelling contractors to enter into such agreements constitutes 
unethical and possibly criminal conduct the judge said 
the lawsuit stems from an attempt by white one of the highest 
ranking blacks in the cuomo administration to crack down on 
contractors who are not meeting state and federal requirements for 
hiring minorities who have established front companies that 
falsely claim to be minority owned or who have engaged in criminal 
activity such as bidrigging 
white spokesman timothy hulbert told the albany times union that 
the judges ruling was inflammatory and inappropriate 
there is nothing illegal about barring contractors from doing 
business with the state if they have violated state laws or 
regulations hulbert said such action was taken only on a 
casebycase basis and no blacklist was maintained he said 
hulbert also said there was nothing illegal about having the 
companies pay money to improve minority hiring programs as part of 
any agreements for them to get back in the states good graces

the armys claims that it 
does not plan the highestlevel of experiments at a proposed 
biological testing laboratory drew skepticism wednesday from utah 
gov norm bangerter 
bangerter who toured the western desert installations current 
biological test lab wednesday told reporters that officials had 
given him a different message than he received when he met with 
defense department representatives last month in washington 
he said officials had told him then that theres a high 
likelihood theyre going to be bl4 the highest level of biosafety 
containment if they really think theyre going to do bl4 thats 
what they ought to clear for the governor said 
however army officials maintained wednesday the proposed 53 
million lab at dugway proving ground had plans only for bl3 
experimentation dugway spokeswoman kathy whitaker stressed that 
the new labs mission would be defensive testing soldiers 
protective gear against various biological agents 
the plan is to do bl3 work were overbuilding for the added 
safety it gives us she said noting that the proposed facility 
would feature three pressurized labs and doublelayered walls over 
1540 square feet 
dugway director of material test col wyett colclasure said 
another reason for building the new lab complex to bl4 guidelines 
was cost 
while the project cost 600000 more as a bl4 than bl3 
complex trying to upgrade the facility later would cost much more 
he said colclasure did not say how much more however 
colclasure said the soviet unions endeavors in biological 
testing made the project a neccessity 
i believe the soviets are working very diligently on a 
biological warfare capability we must be sensitive to that he 
said 
the army released an environmental impact statement on the lab 
complex in january saying that construction and operation of the 
facility posed no danger to employees the public at large or the 
environment 
the present bl2 level test facility at dugway was established 
in 1952 although it has been modified over the years the facility 
has become inadequate for presentday testing needs because 
operators are unable to conduct the full range of tests required 
officials said

sen jesse helms withdrew objections wednesday 
to senate confirmation of army maj gen william f burns to head 
the arms control and disarmament agency in a move linked to the 
lawmakers battle against the new ussoviet arms treaty 
helms rnc told the senate he never had any objectios to 
burns or to his qualifications which he said are excellent 
the senator said he had delayed action on the burns nomination 
in order to provide ammunition for his fight against the new 
intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty which bans us and 
soviet missiles with ranges of 300 miles to 3000 miles 
he announced he has wrested a promise from the reagan 
administration to promptly release two reports bearing on alleged 
soviet violations of arms control treaties and the effectiveness of 
proposed verification of soviet compliance with the new treaty 
but helms demanded the administration also prepare a third 
report confirming whether or not the soviet union has violated 
the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty and make it available 
before the senate acts on the inf pact 
i would strenuously object to the senate moving on this treaty 
until we get this information helms told reporters i think 
the senate would go off halfcocked if it had no capability to 
assess these violations they would be simply swept under the rug 
in an atmosphere of euphoria 
complaining the administration has ignored a treaty provision 
calling for such a review of compliance every five years helms 
drafted legislation declaring the united states is violating the 
abm treaty 
he first offered it as an amendment to pending legislation 
restricting the use of lie detectors in private businesses then 
withdrew it saying he will offer it later if necessary 
helms contended a review of soviet compliance would require the 
united states to protest at least one material breach of the abm 
treaty by russia 
the united states has long complained that the soviets may be 
violating the abm treaty by building a radar system at krasnoyarsk 
in the central soviet union 
helms made public an exchange of letters with president reagan 
and colin l powell reagans national security adviser in which 
the senator stated that burns appears to be an excellent 
nominee 
but he also complained that the arms control agencys failure to 
produce the three reports clouds the current hearings over the 
inf treaty 
he said he has also received reports from witnessess that 
large quantities of documents were shredded late last week in 
arms control and disarmament agency offices under investigation 
by the fbi and ga0 the government accounting office is the 
investigative arm of congress 
replying for reagan powell said burns has given personal 
assurances he will cooperate fully with the fbi and gao 
investigations but powell did not comment on the alleged shredding 
of documents as such 
he said the arms control agencys report on treaty violations 
will be sent to congress on march 8 and that the report on treaty 
verification will be delivered march 14 
but powell said the administration believes it has until next 
october before reviewing soviet compliance with the terms of the 
abm treaty 
helms called that a ruse and said the review was required to 
be completed last oct 2 he said he believes the review has been 
delayed so as not to interfere with senate ratification of the inf 
pact 
burns is currently principal deputy assistant secretary of state 
for politicomilitary affairs he served for four years as the 
pentagons representative at the ussoviet negotiations on the 
inf treaty 
he would succeed kenneth l adelman who announced his intention 
to retire last july

the united nations today voted 1431 for 
the united states to submit to binding arbitration on whether it 
can shut down the plo observer mission 
the united states did not vote and israel cast the only 
negative vote 
assembly resolutions are expressions of international will but 
are not legally binding and there is no mechanism to enforce them 
they are often ignored or defied 
israeli ambassador benjamin netanyahu said the palestine 
liberation organization is a terrorist group that has no place in 
the united nations 
netanyahu stalked out of the chamber when the plo 
representative zehdi labib terzi said israels vote showed 
contempt for the world body and the norms of civilized behavior 
soviet ambassador aleksander belonogov said in an interview 
after the voting that the dispute with the united nations was a 
selfinflicted wound on american prestige and peace efforts in 
the middle east 
the assembly also voted 1420 for a resolution asking the world 
court in the hague for a ruling on whether the united states has 
the right to refuse arbitration neither israel nor the united 
states voted on the measure 
the arbitration would be conducted by an independent 
threemember panel with the united states and the united nations 
each appointing one member and the third appointed jointly 
the united states which has not yet moved to close the plo 
mission said it considered the emergency meeting of the 159nation 
assembly premature and unnecessary 
the united states has rebuffed arbitration on the same grounds 
it remains the intention of this government to find an 
appropriate resolution to this problem in light of the charter of 
the united nations the headquarters agreement and the laws of the 
united states us ambassador herbert okun told the assembly 
after the vote 
the resolutions were sponsored by the soviet union which 
accused the united states of lawlessness several soviet allies 
and satellites members of the movement of nations professing 
nonalliance with either superpower and the philippines a us 
ally 
the resolutions say closing the mission would violate the 1947 
treaty under which the united states became un headquarters the 
pact provides for binding arbitration 
the plo has nonvoting observer status in the general assembly 
and exercises considerable influence at the united nations which 
regards it as the only legitimate representative of the palestinian 
people many of whom live under israeli occupation 
the plo mission a fourstory townhouse on manhattans 
fashionable upper east side has a staff of three political 
officers and two secretaries 
scores of organizations and nations including most of americas 
closest allies said during the threeday emergency session that 
closing the mission would undermine the independence of the world 
body 
many said the move is further eroding the already diminished 
us prestige at the world body others warned it could cripple 
american peace efforts in the middle east 
the state department agrees with the united nations that the 
antiterrorism legislation ordering the mission closed violates the 
headquarters agreement but attorney general edwin meese iii 
reportedly said he plans to enforce the measure anyway he is 
expected to announce his decision later this month 
the state department closed down the only other plo office in 
the united states an information office in washington in what 
turned out to be a futile attempt to forestall the legislation 
underlying the bitter confrontation over the mission is the 
nagging question of what the united nations can do to achieve peace 
in the middle east 
the world body has repeatedly called an international peace 
conference that would include the plo and the soviet union among 
others the united states which wants direct talks and israel 
which refuses to deal with the plo resist this plan 
several speakers in the assembly debate noted that the united 
states has never accused anyone accredited to the mission of 
terrorism or expelled anyone attached to the mission 
in december the assembly passed a resolution 1451 asking the 
united states not to close the plo mission israel which regards 
the plo as a terrorist group bent on the destruction of the jewish 
state cast the only negative vote

two scandinavian relief workers came home 
to the emotional embraces of their sobbing families on wednesday 
and recounted their harrowing abduction in lebanon and 25 days of 
fear and captivity 
jan stening of sweden and norwegian william jorgenson greeted 
their wives and children at a downtown vienna hotelslightly more 24 
hours after being freed by their unknown kidnappers 
jorgenson said he feared he would die in the ordeal that began 
with his feb 5 abduction 
my only thought was of my wife said jorgenson pausing to 
collect himself as his daughter sessil began crying his wife 
gerd and son kurt also were at the news conference 
stening 44 and jorgenson 58 were working with the 
viennabased un works and relief agency that cares for some 
280000 refugees in lebanon when they were kidnapped 
giorgio giacomelli head of the viennabased agency giacomelli 
said both men were in relatively good shape 
its the end of a very sad story which luckily had a happy 
conclusion giacomelli said 
in beirut on wednesday a group called the holy warriors of 
freedom claimed responsibility for the jan 27 kidnapping of west 
german engineer ralph schray and said it may release him soon 
the claim was made in a typewritten arabic statement from the 
group which is believed to be headed by a brother of two men 
already linked to a 1985 hijacking and to the kidnappings 
the statement was released to a western news agency in beirut 
along with a photograph of schray the picture showed a bearded 
schray in blue jeans and a dark blue sweater looking directly at 
the camera 
giacomelli noted the other kidnap victims in lebanon and said 
their plight tempered the happiness over the return of stening and 
jorgenson 
including schray there are 23 foreigners missing after being 
kidnapped in lebanon since march 1985 they are nine americans 
four frenchmen three britons a west german an italian an 
irishman an indian and two unidentified men 
the longest held hostage is american terry anderson chief 
middle east correspondent for the associated press he was 
kidnapped march 16 1985 
our common joy doesnt allow us to forget other colleagues who 
are still missing we hope they will join us again soon 
giacomelli said 
among those missing is us marine lt col william r higgins 
who was abducted feb 17 in south lebanon 
a statement released by the abductors the organization of the 
oppressed on earth said israels crackdown on palestinian unrest 
in israelioccupied territories and the middle east trip of 
secretary of state george p shultz make us more determined to 
try this criminal higgins 
both the united nations and the united states have denied that 
higgins who served with the un peacekeeping force in south 
lebanon was a cia spy 
higgins 43 was abducted near south lebanons port of tyre on 
feb 17 he heads a 76man un observer group that monitors truce 
violations on the lebanonisrael border under a 1949 armistice 
agreement 
stening said at a morning news conference in beirut that four 
gunmen kidnapped the two un workers near south lebanons 
provincial capital of sidon as they were driving from their base in 
the southern port of tyre to beirut 
the two men were moved to various locations in lebanon 
the first word about the release of stening and jorgenson came 
in a handwritten arabic statement delivered to a western news 
agency in beirut late tuesday the statement was accompanied by a 
picture showing the two men it said after they were proved 
innocent they were released 
most of the un relief groups services to the refugees were 
suspended after the abudctions giacomelli did not say if they 
would be resumed 
at one point during his captivity jorgenson said he was 
convinced he and stening would be killed when what looked like an 
explosive was brought into one of the rooms where they were held 
jorgenson said their clothes were cleaned and the two men were 
given a chance to wash the day before they were released 
on tuesday with his new freedom jorgenson said he started 
smoking again 
im a free man and i can cough when i want to he quipped

a growing amount of tax money withheld from 
workers paychecks is being misused by employers often never 
finding its way to the government the internal revenue service 
said wednesday 
the total of these delinquent social security and income taxes 
rose by 49 percent from 1982 through 1987 to almost 373 billion 
said william m wauben irs assistant commissioner for collections 
about 338000 employers have failed to pay or account for that sum 
because withheld taxes account for 69 percent of all federal 
revenues even a slight decline can have a devastating 
impact on the government wauben said at a news conference 
the irs also announced that although fewer individaul taxpayers 
are filing their returns early this year the pace is picking up 
through feb 26 302 million returns had been filed down 49 
percent from a year ago but last week the irs received 67 
million up 3 percent from the same week in 1987 
the irs speculates that taxpayers are delaying filing this year 
because of all the changes caused by a sweeping tax revision 
enacted in 1986 
the number of returns qualifying for refunds is down 45 
percent to 755 million this year but the average refund has 
risen to 793 from 735 a year ago 
wauben said employers failure to forward taxes withheld from 
workers checks often is caused by ignorance of the law although 
in some cases withheld taxes are kept out of greed often as not 
he said the problem is traced to a failing companys efforts to 
stay afloat 
when employers find they are no longer able to keep their 
business operating on the cash available and they are unable to 
borrow from a bank or other lending institution some begin using 
the funds withheld from their employees wages as their own 
wauben said 
employers are required to turn over withheld taxes to the 
government at least once a quarter some big companies pay the irs 
every three days most employers file these employmenttax returns 
weekly or biweekly 
an employers misdeed does not necessarily cause a problem for 
workers even though workers withheld taxes might never be turned 
over to the government their accounts will be credited by the 
government so long as they file an income tax return 
the rise in delinquent withheld taxes is attributed to the fact 
that total payrolls and social security taxes have been increasing 
steadily wauben said there has been a disproportionate increase in 
areas of the southwest where oil prices and real estate values 
have dropped sharply 
wauben said a new irs program aimed at another route of tax 
evasion has produced good results this involves the practice of 
some employers of wrongly classifying some employees as independent 
contractors 
that means the employer does not withheld social security and 
income taxes from these workers although they are required to make 
quarterly estimated tax payments but many such workers understate 
their earnings and some dont even file returns the irs says 
during a twoyear study in 26 areas of the nation irs 
collections officers audited 1196 employers suspected of 
misclassifying workers as independent contractors as a result 
9004 delinquent quarterly employmenttax returns were filed and 
the irs hit 92 percent of the audited employers with tax bills 
averaging 3000 
because of those findings the irs has assigned nearly 400 
collections officers to concentrate on investigating similar cases

construction workers stayed off the 
job throughout nicaragua for the third day wednesday to demand 
higher wages and to protest the sandinista governments new 
economic measures 
the opposition general workers confederation said 4000 workers 
had been on strike since monday paralyzing 53 construction 
projects nationwide the labor ministry said the strikes involved 
600 workers at 12 work sites 
the workers are demanding a 200 percent salary increase and an 
end to wage scales that are fixed for almost all jobs construction 
workers earn the equivalent of 412 a month apprentices make 266 
these salaries dont meet the basic food needs said carlos 
salgado secretarygeneral of the general workers confederation in 
an interview 
citing runaway inflation the government announced a series of 
economic measures feb 14 a new version of the currency the 
cordoba was issued and valued at 10 to the dollar prices set by 
the leftist government for most products soared 
the old currency was fetching 20000 to 1 on the legal exchange 
and more than 50000 to the dollar on the black market 
president daniel ortega said the measures were intended to fight 
inflation which he said was running at 1300 percent unofficial 
estimates put the figure at 7000 percent 
under a new wage scale salaries range from the equivalent of 
50 a month to 753 the price of a pound of meat rose from about 
1 per pound to 350 eggs went from just over 1 a dozen to 250 
angel reyes palma regional director of work inspection for the 
labor ministry called the construction workers strike illegal 
he said a legal strike requires a petition and naming of a 
special judge to determine the merits of the case 
they want to boycott the economic measures and while they 
stay on strike there is no negotiation reyes said 
strikes were illegal in nicaragua under a state of emergency the 
government imposed in 1982 shortly after the war with the 
usbacked contras heated up the restrictive measures were 
withdrawn in january as part of the governments compliance with a 
regional peace plan

republican presidential candidate george bush 
picked up 24 delegates in new york this week by virtue of his 
opponents failure to file delegate slates in eight of the states 
congressional districts 
and successful challenges to nonbush delegate slates in other 
districts if upheld by the courts could leave the vice president 
with at least two dozen other delegates running unopposed 
the board of elections on tuesday wiped two slates of delegates 
supporting bob dole off the the april 19 primary ballot one day 
after stripping the kansas senators slate and one backing new york 
rep jack kemp from the ballot 
the petitions were rejected mainly because they did not contain 
the required 1250 signatures of registered republicans or were 
signed by republicans living outside the congressional district the 
petitions were filed for 
while bush slates remain on the ballot in 33 of the states 34 
congressional districts kemp will be able to field delegate slates 
in only 12 districts dole in 11 and robertson in nine 
having delegate slates on the ballot is allimportant in new 
york where registered republicans will not vote for any of the 
candidates but for the delegates who pledge to support them at the 
national convention in new orleans 
the candidates that the delegates back will be listed next to 
the delegates names on this years ballot 
at stake in new york are 102 delegates three from each 
congressional district the republican state committee will 
designate 34 other delegates after the primary 
the vice presidents campaign has managed to get 10 dole slates 
knocked off the ballot as well as six slates supporting pat 
robertson and five backing kemp

a mentally ill prostitute who sold his blood 
even though he is infected with aids was acquitted wednesday of 
charges of attempted poisoning 
jurors said they had decided that joseph markowski lacked the 
intent required for a conviction under state law frustrating 
prosecutors who said the 29yearold drifter can go out and do 
this again 
what this has told us here today is that the law in the state 
of california does not make it a crime to sell aidscontaminated 
blood and thats unfortunate said los angeles county district 
attorney ira reiner 
markowski a homosexual prostitute who has tested positive for 
the aids virus nodded to his attorney guy obrien as the jury 
found him innocent of two counts of attempted poisoning 
he had been accused of selling his tainted blood for 10 to 
plasma production associates last june 22 and of trying to do so 
again june 25 one of the ways aids can be spread is by transfusion 
of infected blood or blood products he would have faced up to 
seven years in prison if convicted 
im delighted and im a little surprised by the verdict 
said obrien who had argued that markowski homeless and 
destitute had sold his blood in desperation 
i was afraid the jury wouldnt have the courage to follow the 
letter of the law i thought the fear of aids would preoccupy 
the jury 
markowski originally from michigan was first arrested june 23 
after screaming kill me kill me i have aids in a hollywood 
bank while attempting to grab a security guards gun police found 
on him a receipt for the plasma center 
deputy district attorney antonio barreto jr argued at trial 
that markowski knew his blood was tainted he said the drifter sold 
it knowing it might contaminate the plasma pool but didnt care 
juror bill ferguson of echo park said that even though markowski 
knew what he was doing he was doing it for money not to poison 
right now you have to prove specific intent you have to be 
able to prove that a person went down there willfully to poison the 
supply that was not the case in this case ferguson said 
the legislature has been sitting on their duff in this area 
for some time said barreto we need legislation on this he 
can go out and do this again today as long as he said i just did 
it for the money 
prosecutors tried last year to have a law passed that would make 
it a felony to knowingly sell or donate aidscontaminated blood 
the assembly failed to approve it and reiner said he will push for 
it again this year 
mr markowski is today free to do what he did when he was 
arrested for the crime reiner said will he do it again 
perhaps all he needs to do now is adopt an alias 
markowski had allegedly admitted to police that he sold his 
blood because he needed money and didnt care about the public but 
superior court judge ronald coen ruled the statement inadmissible 
because police had not read markowski his rights to remain silent 
and wait for an attorney 
the detective who interrogated markowski said he committed the 
error because he was so shocked by what markowski had done 
deliberations began monday after a 10day trial before coen 
jurors returned the verdict tuesday after deliberating for seven 
hours but it was sealed until wednesday because obrien was unable 
to make it to court 
reiner originally charged markowski with attempted murder but 
coen dismissed those counts saying the law required a specific 
intent to kill that was not present 
obrien said markowski suffers from mental illness and carries 
the aids virus but has not developed the disease the attorney said 
markowski will be placed in a halfway house 
the longterm prognosis at this point is not good id say the 
outlook is guarded he said

of several such incidents in the area authorities said wednesday 
the dog a german shepherd mix had been dead for five or six 
months animal control officer john holmes said

several dead dogs in the crumbling pawtucketcentral falls station 
three years ago holmes said he found a hanged dog in the same

convinced they had won a 2 million 
sweepstakes offered by a california mailorder company kathy and 
dale work bought a pickup truck and a new car and were about to 
quit their jobs then they learned they hadnt won a thing 
i guess it seems like were a couple of country hicks said 
mrs work wed made all kinds of plans i dont know what were 
going to do now 
the united states purchasing exchange a company based in the 
pacoima district of los angeles that sponsored the sweepstakes 
said mrs work has not won anything at least not yet 
the us postal service said wednesday it had received 
complaints about the company and had forwarded them to the federal 
trade commission for investigation 
a man who answered the telephone at a uspe telephone number said 
the sweepstakes is still in progress and that mrs work is one of 
thousands with a chance at the top prize said to be more than 2 
million the man would not give his name and would not respond to 
other questions 
mrs work is not the first person to be confused by the 
sweepstakes debra long of pearl city mich woman told reporters 
she recently quit her job and vacationed in las vagas before 
learning she had not won 17 million as she thought 
michael flitcraft a chardon ohio truck driver said he 
thought he had won the contest after receiving a letter from the 
company on monday 
david carlin of loeb amp loeb a new york law firm representing 
uspe issued a statement that disputed the michigan womans claim 
but did not comment on mrs works claims 
it is been reported that a prize in excess of 1 million was 
won by miss debra long of pearl city mich in a sweepstakes 
sponsored by united states purchasing exchange carlins 
statement said miss long reported that she was notified by a 
certified letter from the company and she subsequently confirmed 
her winnings in a telephone conversation to the company on feb 15 
presidents day 
it appears that miss long is involved in a trick or hoax 
perpetrated by unknown parties because the company does not notify 
winners by certified mail the companys offices were closed on 
presidents day the company does not request bank account numbers 
from winners nor does it require the other information miss long 
claims was requested of her 
mrs work said the company also had requested her bank account 
numbers 
richard eppstein president of the toledo chapter of the better 
business bureau said the bureau has received at least 20 
complaints about uspes contest over the last few years 
the mail is just chockfull of these kinds of sweepstakes 
eppstein said and they are so worded that some people think 
they have won something when they have not 
we have received a lot of complaints about the company mostly 
from people who had not received merchandise they ordered from the 
company said linda russo occupational support specialist with 
the us postal service in california 
dave plottner of the regional office of the federal trade 
commission in cleveland declined comment on whether the agency is 
investigating uspe 
mrs work who lives in stony ridge 10 miles southeast of 
toledo said she she received a letter from the company in october 
that read we are pleased to inform you that you have been 
designated to receive certified bank checks from the united states 
purchasing exchange for 1894876 your winnings in our 
multimillion dollar sweepstakes when you are the grand prize 
winner 
a few weeks later another said her winnings stood at 2024464 
then she received what she thought were two checks one for 2 
million and one for 24000 she was asked to endorse them and send 
them back to the company along with her social security and bank 
account numbers 
at that point the works thought they were millionaires 
however the companys mailing said certified bank check for 
this amount will be drawn and issued to kathy work upon 
verification that the kathy work entry has been selected by the 
independent judging organization as the prizewinner in accordance 
to the rules and regulations set forth and established 
the mailed material does not indicate when the sweepstakes 
winner will be announced mrs work said 
mrs work who has three children and runs the country girl 
beauty salon in her home said she planned to close her business 
and her husband considered quitting his job as a crew chief at 
manville corp in waterville 
it doesnt look good but im happy inside she said i

a bill to require licensing of restaurant 
reviewers has been introduced in the legislature after an owner 
complained that her establishment was savaged by a critic who 
didnt know a bolognese sauce from bottled tomato sauce 
lawmakers give the measure little chance of passage because of 
concerns that it would violate the first amendment right of free 
speech however the restaurant industry says debate over the bill 
helped accomplish its main purpose 
we wanted to provide a message to reviewers the public and 
some editorial people that some of the persons providing the 
reviews are less than capable carroll j hughes executive vice 
president of the 700member connecticut restaurant association 
said wednesday 
hughes persuaded lawmakers to draft the bill after lucille 
trzcinski coowner of casagrande restaurant in wallingford 
complained that two grossly inaccurate reviews last month 
caused her business to drop 1520 percent 
hughes said he gets a dozen complaints a year from restaurant 
owners about reviews no state licenses restaurant critics he said 
we have to stand helplessly by while people are allowed to 
make unfounded unsubstantiated and gratuitous remarks mrs 
trzcinski told a legislative committee tuesday the damage that 
these reviews do numbers in the millions of dollars it is our 
business and it is our livelihood 
alan neigher an attorney who specializes in media law called 
the proposal preposterous 
its nothing more than a temper tantrum by some lobbyists and 
their clients who dont have an elementary understanding of what 
the role of free speech in a free economy is about neigher said 
the courts have repeatedly struck down attempts to license the 
press 
mrs trzcinski who has operated casagrande with her husband for 
11 years said her restaurant previously received high marks from 
some of the toughest critics in the state for its northern italian 
cuisine 
she complained that two recent reviewers made numerous mistakes 
even when praising aspects of her menu 
one mistook a fine loin of veal for a veal pattie and complained 
about her bagna cauda an elegant oilandanchovy dip because he 
was expecting a more pedestrian dip she said 
another incorrectly suggested that her bolognese sauce was 
tomato based and flavored with cheese when its actually a pork 
sauce flavored with a little tomato mrs trzcinski said 
i would say he probably couldnt recognize a proper bolognese 
because hes familiar with ragu she said 
the reviewer also made an ethnic joke about the restaurants 
having a polish chef she said 
the reviewer who uses the pen name r alan richards in 
restaurant reviews for the new haven register said he thought his 
review was fairly positive and blamed the dispute over the 
bolognese sauce on semantics and misinformation supplied by a 
waitress 
licensing opinions is kind of silly said richards who has 
been reviewing restaurants for seven or eight years neither he nor 
the new haven register would reveal his real name 
j charles mokrisky an attorney and the parttime food critic 
who complained about the bagna cauda defended his opinion 
i call em the way i see em said mokrisky who calls 
himself a food fanatic 
under the proposal restaurant critics would have to be licensed 
through the department of consumer protection a critic could be 
fined 500 for reviewing without a license 
the proposed license requirements include experience in 
foodservice operation and management graduation from a recognized 
culinary arts degree program or a combination of at least six 
years of experience and formal training 
i have sympathy for her said rep john wayne fox 
cochairman of the general law committee that held a public hearing 
on the bill but i just was not convinced it was a serious enough 
problem that we as a legislature ought to regulate it

ballet fans beware a california 
legislator is trying to make the west coast swing a spacesaving 
variant of the jitterbug the official state dance 
under state sen quentin kopps bill the west coast swing would 
join the ranks of gold serpentine rocks the desert tortoise 
dogfaced butterfly and the sabertoothed tiger all officially 
recognized symbols of the golden state 
gold is the state mineral serpentine the state rock desert 
tortoise the state reptile dogfaced butterfly the state insect 
and the sabertoothed tiger the state fossil 
west coast swing is an intricate dance requiring a great deal 
of coordination good timing and intelligent application kopp a 
san francisco independent wrote to fellow lawmakers recently 
according to oakland businessman walter harmon who approached 
kopp with the idea of honoring the dance west coast swing is a 
variation of the jitterbug a jazz dance 
the variation was developed because it takes up less room than 
the freewheeling jitterbug and thus more couples can dance on a 
smaller floor said harmon 
its a very complex very beautiful dance said harmon 
legislative liaison director for the united states swing dance 
council 
he also claims it is the only indigenous california dance to 
survive in essentially its original form and is thus worthy of 
historical recognition and preservation

john ehrlichman a former white house aide 
who spent time in prison for his role in the watergate scandal 
says his assignment covering the impeachment trial of gov evan 
mecham for rolling stone magazine is a match made in heaven 
im working on a novel and it has an impeachment scene in it 
so i was going to come over and and take a look at this anyway 
ehrlichman said tuesday its a readymade opportunity to 
observe secondly its a subject that intrigues me i certainly 
have some feel for the underlying issues 
ehrlichman a former topranking official for president richard 
nixon resigned from his white house post in april 1973 and was 
convicted in 1975 for obstruction of justice conspiracy and 
perjury in the attempted coverup of the watergate burglary 
ehrlichman 63 spent 18 months at swift trail camp a 
minimumsecurity federal prison south of safford ariz and was 
released in 1978 
he now lives in santa fe nm and is working on his seventh 
novel a story about a fictional us president 
ehrlichman said he sees few correlations between the problems of 
nixon and mecham 
here is a fellow mecham with a criminal proceeding an 
impeachment and a recall all going on at the same time all pretty 
much bottomed on the same facts said ehrlichman i think its 
very different from watergate it raises all kinds of interesting 
legal questions about double jeopardy and things like that

more than 60 antiapartheid demonstrators were 
arrested wednesday following a peaceful protest in front of the 
south african embassy 
the arrests followed a rally protesting the south african 
governments decision to outlaw public dissent which led to the 
arrest last week of nobel peace prize winner archbishop desmond 
tutu in johannesburg 
randall robinson a leader of the free south africa movement 
which has organized similar protests at the south african embassy 
since 1984 told a crowd of about 300 people that the demonstration 
marked the beginning of a new phase of the battle against 
apartheid 
the rally was held down the street from the embassy to avoid 
violation of a district of columbia ordinance prohibiting 
demonstrations within 500 feet of foreign embassies 
following remarks by members of congress representives from the 
national organization for women the aflcio and other groups a 
group of messengers approached the embassy 
among those arrested were rep john lewis dga del walter 
fauntroy ddc us civil rights commissioner mary f berry and 
robinson who heads transafrica a washingtonbased lobbying group 
on africa and the caribbean 
robinson said the free south africa movement would continue to 
push for complete disinvestment of us firms in south africa and 
urge congress to enact stronger sanctions 
he said america needs to move the un security council toward 
global sanctions and a president who will take the lead with our 
allies to totally isolate south africa 
robinson said he hoped the new wave of protests would force 
presidential candidates to take a public position on south africa 
he said only jesse jackson has been vocal on the issue thus far

prodded by the food and drug 
administration pharmaceutical companies agreed wednesday to avoid 
any advertising that claims aspirin can help prevent a first heart 
attack despite a report in a medical journal that drew this 
conclusion 
fda commissioner frank e young announced the agreement after he 
met for more than an hour with company representatives who came to 
his office in this washington suburb after he sent a letter 
reminding of the fdas power to regulate 
at a news conference young said he had told the manufacturers 
that if they promoted their products for a use not supported by an 
fda analysis they could be guilty of mislabeling and this 
mislabeling can lead to regulatory action by the fda 
he said the manufacturers agreed to exercise voluntary 
restraint and to refrain from further promotion of aspirin as 
a protection against first heart attack but young insisted that 
the action was not in response to ads that already have run 
the commissioner said he was so busy in his job that he 
never read listened or watched advertising and thus did not know 
if any ads run that violated the fda position have been run 
he also said that no one had brought such ads to his attention 
william c macleod director of consumer protection at the 
federal trade commission which regulates drug advertising refused 
repeatedly at the news conference to say if his agency had taken 
any action regarding ads by aspirin manufacturers nor would he 
confirm that inappropriate ads had been run 
young said the meeting was prompted by the publicity surrounding 
a study published jan 28 in the new england journal of medicine 
in the study more than 11000 physicians over the age of 40 
took one aspirin every other day while another group of physicians 
took placebos or fake aspirin at the end of 57 months the study 
showed that those taking aspirin had a 47 percent fewer heart 
attacks 
while refusing to say if the action was prompted by any ad that 
has run young said the drug manufacturers had agreed to 
voluntarily refrain from further promotion of the study results 
in a feb 24 letter young invited the drug manufacturers to 
attend a meeting at his fda office to discuss the aspirin findings 
he wrote of his concern that the dissemination of certain 
types of information is clearly premature until the fda has 
analyzed the aspirin study and established appropriate labeling 
for use of the overthecounter medication for the prevention of 
first heart attacks 
the invitation letter also cited the federal law that forbids 
mislabeling of drugs 
young said he told the manufacturers that all ads making any 
claims for uses of aspirin not approved by the fda were to be 
halted 
from this time forward any ads in the pipeline will not be 
grandfathered escape enforcement said young 
both young and mcleod repeatedly declined to say if any 
advertising was being canceled as a result of the fda action and 
the agerncy did not identify the drug manufacturers attending the 
meeting 
most of those leaving the private meeting refused comment an 
exception was dr edward henry of squibb pharmaceutical products 
who would say only were all in agreement it was a very good 
meeting 
marieclaude stockl public affairs director for bristolmyers 
said in a statement later we agree with the fda that the final 
results need to be reviewed by the agency before communicating the 
use of aspirin for primary heart attack and our actions to date 
have been consistent with that position 
several drug companies have produced ads that promoted the use 
of aspirin to help prevent a second heart attack these were based 
on a 1985 study that was analyzed by the fda this earlier study 
has been incorporated in the agencys professional labeling 
statement on aspirin 
but the study announced in january was the first to show 
evidence that aspirin could help prevent a primary or first heart 
attack 
young said his concern is that the aspirin study involved a 
narrow group all physicians in good health and that an analysis 
of the study had not been completed 
the fda said the aspirin therapy is not appropriate for everyone 
and could do more harm than good for some young said the study 
showed that some subjects experienced stroke 
he also said the aspirin therapy could harm the health of people 
with high blood pressure gout kidney or liver disease or peptic 
ulcer aspirin also can cause intestinal bleeding he said 
this study used a healthy population of phsycians who could 
take their own blood pressure and who knew how to recognize 
intestinal bleeding said young and widespread use by patients 
without medical supervision could lead to serious complications 
young said it will take about six months for the fda to analyze 
the study and then publish new professional labeling for aspirin

ford motor co will comply with a court order and 
withhold profitsharing checks scheduled to go to about 1850 
workers who are behind on child support payments the automaker 
said wednesday 
were not a stakeholder in this its strictly between the 
individuals involved and wayne county said ford spokesman mike 
moran 
the order was issued by circuit judge richard kaufman on 
tuesday four days after friend of the court of wayne county filed 
suit to obtain profitsharing money in an effort to improve child 
support collection 
friend of the court which is involved with domestic relations 
cases and is affiliated with circuit court has an obligation to 
insure compliance with child support orders said its director 
gerhard f ritsema 
the checks are to be distributed tuesday and are expected to 
average a record 3700 more than 160000 ford employees received 
the previous record profitsharing checks of 2100 in 1986 
according to the court order friend of the court will have 
eight weeks to settle the 1850 cases 
ritsema said eight weeks would be sufficient for wayne countys 
35 circuit court judges to decide how much of each profitsharing 
check will be given to the agency adding that he hoped some people 
would opt to settle without a hearing 
about 155 million in child support was collected in 1987 but 
80 percent of the 225000 parents supposedly paying child support 
are in arrears ritsema said he said the agencys action against 
ford employees could bring in as much as 4 million 
kaufmans action disappointed many ford workers four employees 
told the judge that child support already is being deducted from 
their pay they said the agency should increase the deduction from 
their regular paychecks instead of going after their profitsharing 
checks 
the profitsharing check is what weve realized after going 
eight years without a raise and turning ford motor company 
around said robert morris jr a 10year ford employee 
friend of the court is considering increasing the amount 
deducted from regular paychecks ritsema said but he said any such 
action would be in addition to pursuing profitsharing money 
friend of the court in washtenaw county has also moved to obtain 
profitsharing money from ford workers who are behind on child 
support payments moran said 
he added that ford has rejected all 150 names on a list 
submitted by the southeastern michigan county agency saying that 
not enough data was supplied for the automaker to verify the 
agencys claims

the army said wednesday it had stopped random 
drug testing for civilian workers to comply with a court ruling 
but was asking the justice department to appeal the judgment 
the service in a brief statement said it would limit its 
civilian drug testing for the time being to those instances in 
which there is a reasonable suspicion that a specific employee is 
under the influence of drugs while on duty 
testing on a random basis however has been halted for now the 
service added 
the move follows a decision in us district court in washington 
on tuesday in which a judge ruled that random drug testing amounted 
to an unreasonable search prohibited by the constitution 
us district judge thomas f hogan said random checks of 
employees in socalled sensitive positions could not be justified 
by safety concerns because the urine test used by the army did not 
indicate whether an employee was using drugs on the job 
the army has asked the department of justice to appeal the 
ruling the service said in its statement the army has also 
requested that justice ask for a stay of the judges order during 
the appeal process 
hogans ruling had no effect on the right of the armed forces to 
conduct random drug tests of activeduty personnel

federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan 
told congress on wednesday it should consider trimming social 
security and other entitlement programs as it searches for ways to 
reduce the federal budget deficit 
saying that such guaranteedbenefit programs account for 
nearly half of total outlays greenspan held out little hope for 
major deficit reductions in other areas although he did propose a 
15cent gasoline tax 
several rounds of deficitreduction efforts already have taken 
care of the easy cuts greenspan told the senate budget 
committee which is considering president reagans 109 trillion 
budget request for the fiscal year that begins oct 1 
greenspan said entitlement expenses which include social 
security medicare medicaid and various forms of welfare will 
rise dramatically in the early 21st century because of the 
increase in the beneficiary population 
sen kent conrad dnd told greenspan baby boomers are 
going to be in for a big surprise when its time for them to start 
collecting social security baby boomers is the phrase given to 
the bulge in population from those born after world war ii and into 
the mid1960s 
greenspan who as a private citizen chaired a bipartisan 
commission that helped overhaul social security financing in the 
early part of this decade did not specify exactly which programs 
he would cut 
but he said the effect of cuts in entitlement programs made now 
would be amplfied in years to come he noted that some 38 million 
americans or about 15 percent of the poplulation are collecting 
social security retirmenet or disability benefits 
despite the political problems associated with trimming benefit 
programs such as social security greenspan told the committee 
all the alternatives are known the choices are political not 
economic 
i wish you well and i dont think you need me to tell you how 
to go about it he said 
the reagan administration has projected a fiscal 1988 budget 
deficit of 14674 billion the congressional budget office 
however says its likely to be about 157 billion substantially 
above the 144 billion target called for in the grammrudman 
budgetbalancing law 
president reagans budget recommendations for 1989 projects a 
1989 deficit of 1295 billion 
social security spending is projected to reach 2147 billion 
for the year compared with 2024 billion for 1987 
other health and human services programs including medicare and 
medicaid spent 5051 billion in the first four months of 1988 
compared with 4943 billion in the same period of 1987 
interest payments on the 22 trillion national debt are 
expected to total 21006 billion in fiscal 1988 accounting for 20 
percent of total federal spending 
greenspan suggested that not much more could be expected in the 
way of deficit reduction from further defense cuts or general tax 
increases 
defense spending is approaching maintenance levels 
greenspan said and as to new taxes he testifed there are 
upside limits to the share of income that can be taxed 
for several decades the overall federal tax bite has been 
fairly flat at a bit less than 20 percent of gross national 
product this stability is not a coinicidence but is indicative 
of the publics aversion to rising tax burdens 
however he suggested that a new 15centagallon levy on 
gasoline prices would help ease the deficit in a small way and 
might even promote more energy conservation 
in other testimony greenspan said 
even if the fed wanted to drive down interest rates sharply at 
this time we would find we would fail because markets would 
likely resist such a move and would run away from us 
trade deficit improvements led by higher import prices and 
surging exports would continue even at current exchangerate 
levels of the dollar 
there was some danger of increased inflation in the coming 
months but higher prices do not appear to be on the order of a 
magnitude that should cause concern 
there are no secret agreements among industrial nations 
involving interest rate levels in the united states that might be 
needed to support the goal of a stabilizing the us dollar at its 
current rate of exchange

pat robertson wants to drop his libel suit 
against a former congressman who questioned his war record because 
going to trial now would sacrifice his presidential campaign 
his lawyer said wednesday but robertsons accuser declared hes 
chickening out of the trial just like he chickened out 37 years 
ago 
former rep paul mccloskey rcalif who has accused robertson 
of using his fathers political influence to avoid combat duty in 
the korean war has said in recent weeks he wouldnt settle the 
suit unless robertson paid the costs which mccloskey estimates at 
400000 of defending against the suit 
the trial set to begin on tuesday when robertson hopes to do 
well in delegaterich southern primaries would force him off the 
campaign trail for three weeks attorney douglas rigler said 
in dropping the lawsuit robertson does not intend to back away 
at any time from his denial of the charges that mr mccloskey 
made rigler said 
he said that it is quite possible that mr robertson will be 
asked to pay a substantial amount of court costs to cover the 
expenses of taking depositions from more than 50 witnesses 
but rigler said he would likely appeal any such decision by us 
district judge joyce hens green he also suggested the 400000 
defense estimate of costs may be an artificial figure that 
includes lawyers fees that robertson should not have to pay 
mccloskeys lawyer george lehner said that if anything the 
defense estimate of its costs is artificially low 
lehner said he will ask the judge to order robertson to go to 
trial on tuesday or force him to pay court costs as well as 
attorneys fees 
rigler said robertson will ask dismissal of the lawsuit because 
he is being asked to sacrifice his presidential campaign in order 
to vindicate his personal honor 
robertson in south carolina said wednesday he wanted to press 
ahead with the suit but couldnt be in court and out campaigning 
for the republican presidential nomination at the same time 
if the judge will give me about another month id love to go 
into it robertson said 
the judge in january refused robertons request to postpone the 
trial until june 20 
i cant understand why a respected judge did it rigler 
said we think it is unfair 
under rules of civil procedure a plaintiff cannot drop a case 
without the defendants consent once the lawsuit has been answered 
or without a court order dismissing the case 
mccloskey commenting wednesday on cbstv said the 
courtrooms a great place to learn the truth now that hes up with 
the truth to be told and testimony under oath hes backing off 
i think the truth ought to be told i dont know any better 
place to get the truth than in the courtroom he invoked the 
process he ought to go through with it mccloskey said 
the lawsuit was filed in 1986 following publication of 
mccloskeys allegations that robertson used the influence of his 
late father sen a willis robertson dva to avoid combat duty 
in the korean war 
mccloskey a decorated marine combat veteran who was aboard a 
troop ship from which robertson was removed in 1951 during a 
stopover in japan also charged that robertson later served as the 
booze officer to a rear echelon unit after he did go to korea 
a number of former marines have come forward since the lawsuit 
was filed to support mccloskey though other witnesses deny that 
robertson invoked his fathers political influence to be get his 
temporary reassignment to a special training unit in japan 
mccloskey said wednesday that one reason he made the charges was 
that he feared a person who had avoided combat might try to make 
amends by becoming more warlike in later years 
when you get a president in office who has evaded combat in 
his youth and all his advisers are saying look tough against the 
soviets i think there is a tendency to try to prove your 
manhood late in life he said 
a man like robertson wants to take on the commies anywhere 
they are anywhere in the world mccloskey said its a little 
dangerous to have a man like that in the white house 
rigler invited mccloskey to submit the dispute over robertsons 
war record to an independent arbitrator saying if he refuses to 
agree to arbitration it is mr mccloskey who is afraid to have a 
determination of the facts 
lehner said tuesday that robertsons attorneys rejected the idea 
of arbitration last fall when he informally suggested it

fingerprints found in a book about poisons match 
those of a woman accused of killing her husband by putting cyanide 
in a nonprescription drug according to court papers released 
wednesday 
a memorandum filed by us attorney gene s anderson also said 
stella nickell had failed a liedetector test on whether she was 
the excedrin killer and that she apparently forged her husbands 
signature on life insurance applications 
mrs nickell is charged in the deaths of bruce nickell 52 and 
susan katherine snow 40 both of auburn both died in june 1986 
after swallowing tainted capsules of extrastrength excedrin 
authorities have not suggested any other links between the victims 
mrs nickell was indicted in december on two counts of causing a 
death by product tampering and three counts of tampering with a 
product involved in interstate commerce she has pleaded innocent 
mrs nickell checked out a book on poisoning from a library in 
mid1984 without returning it and pages on cyanide poisoning in a 
book titled deadly harvest that was found on a library shelf 
bore 84 fingerprints and three palm prints belonging to mrs 
nickell court documents said 
the prosecutors memo said the defendant and her husband bruce 
nickell had experienced intensified marital discord just 
before his death an assertion strongly disputed by ms nickells 
courtappointed defense attorney 
in accompanying documents federal public defender thomas 
hillier ii also disputed the governments claim that the polygraph 
test was conclusive 
the maximum penalty on each death count is life and the other 
charges carry maximum terms of 10 years trial has been set for 
april 18 
the prosecutors memo filed in support of the governments 
motion that mrs nickell remain in custody pending trial and 
accompanying documents had been sealed by us district judge 
william s dwyer because of concern that release of the information 
might make it harder to obtain an unbiased jury 
the seattle times seattle postintelligencer and morning news 
tribune of tacoma appealed the order which was overturned monday 
by the 9th us circuit court of appeals 
tainted capsules of pain relievers were found in both victims 
homes and in bottles on the shelves of two stores in the suburbs 
between seattle and tacoma 
mrs nickell had sued excedrins manufacturer bristolmyers 
and two stores where tainted capsules were found after an insurance 
carrier refused to pay benefits on her husbands death 
shortly before he died nickell obtained a life insurance policy 
that would pay his wife 31000 if he died of natural causes and 
136000 for an accidental death 
in september and october 1985 ms nickell applied for two other 
life insurance policies for a total of 40000 with she and her 
husband each the beneficiary of the other 
handwriting examination has definitely concluded that bruce 
nickell did not sign what purports to be his signature 
andersons memo says bruce nickells fingerprints were not found 
on either insurance application 
stella nickells fingerprints were found in one of the two 
applications and handwriting analysis conclusively established 
that she signed her husbands name to one application and probably 
signed his name to the second application

a state prosecutor and a former un human rights 
delegate from nicaragua announced their defection wednesday and 
accused the sandinista government of torture keeping political 
prisoners and rigging the judiciary 
ivan villavicencio said he had been an appeals prosecutor in the 
district of managua the capital since march 1983 
norman jose miranda a foreign ministry official for eight 
years was an alternative representative at the un human rights 
commission in geneva during 198587 and said he left nicaragua to 
avoid holding the same post this year 
the two men called a news conference to announce their 
resignation timed to coincide with the un commissions 
annual session 
both said they remained sandinista supporters but were 
disillusioned with the leftist governments deception of the 
nicaraguan people 
they said they moved to the united states where they have 
family and friends in the last three months and would resign 
officially shortly 
villavicencio said nicaraguan jails hold 8600 political 
prisoners and said torture is used against peasants opposing 
government policies 
he said a reprehensible permanent alliance exists between 
police and judicial authorities and judges are pressured to convict 
on the basis of fabricated charges the government is pushing a 
pilot project to hand over the administration of justice to 
political commissars he said 
miranda said nicaragua is undergoing a stalinist social 
drama 
he said the nicaraguan delegation at the human rights commission 
in fact took instructions from delegates of allies such as cuba 
the sandinistas came to power in nicaragua in a 1979 revolution 
that toppled dictator anastasio somoza usbacked rebels have 
been fighting the government since 1981

the decision by gop presidential hopeful pat 
robertson to seek dismissal of his libel suit against a congressman 
who questioned his war record calls into play an arcane provision 
of civil procedure in federal courts 
rule 41 governs the dismissal of lawsuits by plaintiffs once the 
defendant has answered the complaint 
a plaintiff can obtain dismissal of the suit voluntarily if he 
gets a signed stipulation from the defendant 
without such a stipulation as in robertsons lawsuit against 
former rep paul n mccloskey jr rcalif the plaintiff can ask 
for a courtordered dismissal 
robertsons lawyers said wednesday they will ask us district 
judge joyce hens green to order dismissal of the case under this 
provision which provides that the case can be dismissed upon 
order of the court and upon such terms and conditions as the court 
deems proper 
robertsons lawyer douglas rigler said his client expects to 
be ordered to pay mccloskeys court costs to cover the expenses of 
taking depositions from witnesses 
but rigler said he doesnt believe his client should pay such 
costs or attorneys fees and he would likely appeal such an order 
if it were made by us district judge joyce hens green 
mccloskeys lawyer george lehner says the judge has the 
discretion to order robertson to pay both his clients court costs 
and attorneys fees lehner says if the judge refuses his request 
to go to trial on tuesday he will ask her to order robertson to 
pay both court costs and attorneys fees which he says total more 
than 400000 
rigler conceded that an award of attorneys fees is always a 
possibilty but he said robertsons lawsuit doesnt fall within 
that category of cases in which such an award is appropriate 
such cases includes lawsuits that are brought in bad faith or to 
harass the defendant 
the judge has already refused to dismiss the case in mccloskeys 
motion to dismiss the case ruling that robertson is entitled to go 
to trial on his charges that he was libeled by the former 
congressman 
robertson charges that mccloskey defamed him by charging he used 
the political influence of his late father sen a willis 
robertson dva to avoid combat during the korean war

iraq and iran battered each others 
capitals with longrange missiles for a third day wednesday and the 
first iraqi rockets of the 7yearold war crashed into qom seat 
of the iranian religious hierarchy

ayatollah ruhollah khomeini once made his home the 87yearold 
revolutionary patriarch has lived for several years in jamaran a 
northern tehran suburb 
the iraqis said they fired eight surfacetosurface missiles 
wednesday two of them into qom bringing the total for three days 
to 24 iran said it hit baghdad with three missiles for a total of 
eight in the same period

official islamic republic news agency it does not make any 
difference for a people who seek martyrdom whether they are killed 
by missiles tanks or artillery

and an 80yearold woman wounded in tehran 
western military analysts believe iraq uses sovietmade scudb 
missiles fitted with strapon boosters enabling them to reach 
tehran which is 290 miles from the border qom is roughly the same 
distance from the frontier 
irans weapons also are scudbs provided by its arab allies

miles from the border

a group of citizens asked for a ruling 
wednesday on whether president kurt waldheims war record warrants 
murder charges and waldheim ordered the seizure of a magazine that 
published the complaint 
the leftwing weekly falter printed a text of the complaint by 
the 300 austrians along with three articles critical of the 
president who has been accused of committing war crimes while 
serving as a german army lieutenant in the balkans during world war 
ii 
under article 63 of austrias constitution the president cannot 
be prosecuted unless both houses of parliament approve 
waldheims office said he instructed the state prosecutors 
office to impound copies of the magazine on grounds the issue 
damaged his honor 
police said late wednesday they had not yet received a judges 
order to act 
waldheim says he is innocent of war crimes 
walter oswalt a journalist and spokesman for the group making 
the complaint said it was delivered to the prosecutors office 
wednesday morning a spokesman for the office said privacy laws 
prevented him from confirming such a document was received 
gerhard litzka spokesman for the justice ministry said 
prosecutors must investigate any such complaint and tell the 
ministry whether there are grounds for legal action 
as grounds for an investigation of possible charges the 
complaint cited a law that says both those who commit crimes and 
those who assist in them can be held responsible for criminal acts 
it quoted extensively from the report last month by an 
international panel of historians saying waldheim was in close 
proximity to nazi atrocities knew of them and did nothing to 
stop them the historians said they found no proof that the former 
un secretarygeneral committed war crimes but left the question 
of guilt open 
waldheim has said the historians exonerated him from the 
accusations of war crimes which arose during the presidential 
election campaign two years ago 
the complaint also quoted from an interview printed feb 25 by 
the munich daily sueddeutsche zeitung with manfred messerschmidt a 
west german historian who served on the panel 
messerschmidt who has legal training said steps could be 
considered in connection with waldheims role in the fate of six 
british commandos executed by the nazis in greece in 1944 prime 
minister margaret thatcher ordered british authorities last month 
to reopen an investigation of the case 
israeli historian yehuda l wallach said feb 9 he thought the 
panels report could serve as the basis of an investigation of 
whether to prosecute waldheim

a national lawyers group wednesday joined a 
challenge to federal sentencing guidelines that require judges to 
impose prison terms of particular lengths for certain crimes 
the guidelines established by a congressional commission 
violate the constitutions separation of powers doctrine says a 
friendofthecourt brief filed by the national association of 
criminal defense lawyers 
the association joined a challenge filed by assistant federal 
public defender stewart abrams who represents a woman with no 
criminal record who under the guidelines must receive at least 6 
years in prison for smuggling cocaine 
a judge may go outside the guidelines which create a 43level 
system of punishment based on the crime and defendants record 
only in extreme cases 
us district judge james king chief of the southern district 
of florida said all 15 federal judges in his district will rule 
together on the matter to avoid discrepancies from courtroom to 
courtroom no hearing date has been set 
it will be the first time the judges have sat together since 
they considered the immigration of 125000 cubans to florida during 
the 1980 mariel boatlift 
the sentencing guidelines have been challenged on constitutional 
grounds three times in the southern district of california since 
feb 18 with different results said nacdl representative benson b 
weintraub 
in the test case beverly bogle 21 was arrested after her 
arrival at miami international airport from jamaica on nov 11 with 
19 kilograms of cocaine she was carrying for someone else abrams 
said 
she was not profiting from it he said she was doing it 
for a person she perceived to be a friend 
ms bogle pleaded guilty to importing cocaine and has been 
jailed while awaiting sentencing march 25 
under the antidrug abuse act of 1986 congress set a minimum 
sentence of five years in prison for the offense 
however the us sentencing commission created in 1984 set a 
guideline ranging from six years and seven months to eight years 
and one month in prison for the crime abrams said the guidelines 
apply to crimes committed after nov 1 
in ms bogles case the federal probation office wants to use 
the commissions guidelines abrams said

federated department stores inc on wednesday 
chose rh macy amp co over a rival suitor agreeing to a marriage 
that would put famous retailers such as macy bloomingdales and 
bullocks under one enormous corporate roof 
a rejected campeau corp said it would proceed with its bid for 
federated the nations fifth largest retailer 
federated said in a joint statement with macy the nations 10th 
largest general retail concern that the two companies had signed a 
definitive agreement to create a new company macysfederated inc 
macy operates 96 stores in 14 states while federated has 650 
stores including bloomingdales bullocks and filenes in 36 
states 
federateds choice of macy over campeau came as no surprise 
analysts noted that the macy bid offered federated the 
opportunity for future growth while campeau would bring with it a 
history of having bought and broken up allied stores corp 
no matter who ends up controlling federated the new owner is 
expected to sell its gold circle discount stores and ralphs 
supermarkets 
several of federateds department store chains which include 
burdines i magnin richs abraham amp straus and lazarus also 
are expected to be sold after a purchase by either macy or campeau 
abraham and straus and richs were considered likely candidates 
for a sale by macy because they are direct competitors with macy 
stores in new york and atlanta respectively 
the agreement provides for macy to begin a cash tender offer of 
7450 a share for about 80 percent of federateds 896 million 
outstanding shares or a total of 525 billion the companies said 
the remaining federated shares would be exchanged for stock in 
the new company 
federateds current management would have a strong voice in the 
new company filling 40 percent of the seats on its board of 
directors 
campeau a torontobased real estate developer and retailer 
through its allied stores division owns the jordan marsh sterns 
ann taylor and maas brothers chains 
the retailer said in a statement that macys bid was not 
competitive and we intend to prevail in the marketplace 
late wednesday campeau said it was amending its previously 
announced 66 cash tender offer it said it would pay 75 per share 
in cash for 80 percent of federateds shares and after a merger 
would pay 44 per share for the remaining 20 percent 
campeau said its latest proposal which was to expire march 15 
had a combined value of 68 per share and a total value of 61 
billion 
the amended campeau bid was announced after the close of trading 
on the new york stock exchange where federated stock fell 1 a 
share to 6675 
earlier campeau repeated a charge that the macy offer was 
highly speculative because of the unknown value of the stock macy 
is currently privately held and it is difficult to know how much 
its shares are worth 
wall street analysts said they found it hard to predict what 
shareholders would do given the problem of putting a value on the 
stock portion of the offer 
if you dont know that its really tough to figure out which 
is a better deal said joseph ronning a retail industry analyst 
with brown brothers harriman amp co 
macys bid which came to light monday was originally for 
7380 a share in cash plus stock but the offer was increased 
before the agreement was reached 
macy was taken private by a management group in a 36 billion 
leveraged buyout in 1986 its stores rang up 521 billion in sales 
during the fiscal year ended last aug 1 
federated chairman howard goldfeder said at a news conference 
wednesday he would resign after helping macy chairman edward 
finkelstein implement the merger 
goldfeder said he expects to be paid 306 million when he 
leaves the company under a golden parachute approved by 
federateds directors similar departure payments are due other top 
federated officers 
the nations four largest retailers are sears roebuck and co 
with 3021 billion in sales during fiscal 1987 k mart corp 
2563 billion walmart stores inc 1596 billion and jc 
penney co 1398 billion

federal regulators failure to require 
volkswagen of america to make public reports of sudden acceleration 
in audi 5000 cars appears to be a case of intentional deception a 
new york congressman said wednesday 
rep george hochbrueckner dny in letter to the national 
highway traffic safety administration and volkswagen demanded the 
documents be turned over to congress bypassing the agency 
responsible for the audi investigation 
as a result of nhtsas apparent cooperation with volkswagen 
the public has been denied the opportunity to study significant 
evidence which might highlight the ineffectiveness of a shiftlock 
device in the audi 5000 to curtail sudden acceleration incidents 
hochbrueckner wrote i find this deceptive behavior a shocking 
departure from the established practices in these matters 
nhtsa in january 1987 ordered a recall of 255336 197886 audi 
5000s for installation of a device to fix reported throttle 
problems on the cars 
the agency has received 1750 complaints of alleged sudden 
acceleration in audi 5000s resulting in 1269 accidents 430 
injuries and five deaths 
hochbrueckner said nhtsa requested the incident reports in june 
1987 however the documents were never turned over to nhtsa which 
instead received summaries from vw hochbrueckner said calling the 
arrangement unprecedented 
volkswagen issued a statement in response saying that nhtsa 
has not given us any special concessions neither have we been 
relieved of any of the burden of responding to the agencies 
requests for information 
a nhtsa memorandum filed in the audi case said that at vws 
request the source documents were reviewed by nhtsa personnel 
and the summaries were found to be accurate summations of the very 
bulky source documents 
an nhtsa official said wednesday there had been other instances 
in which the agency had requested summaries of complaints rather 
than the complaints themselves the official speaking only on 
condition he not be named was unable to say how common the 
practice was 
volkswagens spokesman at its us headquarters in troy mich 
joseph bennett did not return calls for comment 
hochbrueckner asked volkswagen to give congress all the owner 
reports consumer complaints surveys investigations field 
reports or other sources received or authorized by volkswagen or 
of which volkswagen is otherwise aware during and after the 
recall 
congress has no power to compel the documents be turned over 
said andy kennedy an aide to hochbrueckner 
volkswagen said it will comply with congressman 
hockbreuchners request for the data by making available to him all 
the data which we furnished to nhtsa on the same schedule

leftist guerrillas killed 14 people in 
three raids this week part of the rebels biggest offensive yet in 
colombia authorities and news accounts said wednesday 
about 100 rebels attacked pelaya town about 250 miles north of 
bogota on tuesday night alfredo araujo said in a broadcast

the union representing 6700 northwest 
airlines flight attendants instructed members wednesday to begin a 
slowdown by doing everything by the book 
the attendants have remained on the job since a deadline for a 
new contract passed friday 
keep them busy keep them guessing keep them confused jeff 
musto a spokesman for teamsters local 2747 said in a recorded 
message on the union hotline 
remember you have to have all luggage stowed before you can 
give permission to close the front boarding door i think you get 
the idea he said 
northwest spokesman redmond tyler said the airline operated 
normally wednesday we have seen no evidence of any disruption or 
attempt at disruption he said 
no talks are scheduled the main stumbling block to a contract 
is a company proposal to delay the promotion of lowerpaid workers 
to the higher bracket 
linda mcmahon operations manager for the five aaa travel agency 
offices in minneapolis said she had not noticed any effect on 
business or service from slowdown tactics 
i havent heard any specific complaints at this point i was 
certainly apprehensive when i heard about the guerrilla warfare 
this morning everything seems to be going pretty much as usual 
ms mcmahon said 
the threat of a strike has not deterred many travelers from 
flying northwest she said 
a lot of times there isnt comparable service on another 
carrier they will take their chances that northwest will be 
operating because they want to fly nonstop ms mcmahon said 
many business travelers are making alternate arrangements in 
case of a strike but vacationers who bought discount tickets in 
advance have little recourse she said 
the unions representing the pilots and machinists who are 
trying to negotiate separate contracts have not said whether they 
would honor flight attendants picket lines

the house overwhelmingly passed a landmark 
civil rights bill wednesday that would broaden protections for 
women minorities the elderly and the handicapped but president 
reagan has vowed to veto the measure 
the civil rights restoration act considered by many lawmakers 
the most significant civil rights measure in 20 years was sent to 
the white house on a 31598 vote the senate passed it by an 
equally lopsided 7514 vote in january 
both chambers passed the bill by the twothirds margin needed to 
override a presidential veto but it was unclear whether the huge 
margins would hold up following reagans vow wednesday to reject 
the measure 
the restoration act was designed to reverse a 1984 supreme court 
decision that narrowed the scope of four major civil rights laws 
meant to prevent taxpayer financing of discrimination 
supporters of the act said hundreds of discrimination complaints 
had been dropped or restricted since the decision 
we have suffered far too long in waiting for this great and 
important day said rep john conyers dmich 
in letters delivered wednesday to several house republicans 
reagan said flatly he will veto the measure if it is presented to 
me in its current form 
in the letters sent from brussels belgium where reagan is 
attending a nato summit the president said the bill dramatically 
expands the scope of federal jurisdiction over state and local 
governments and the private sector and poses a particular 
threat to religious liberty 
in the case brought by grove city pa college the supreme 
court held in a 63 opinion that title ix a law barring sex 
discrimination in federally funded education programs applies 
only to specific programs or activities receiving federal 
assistance and not the institutions of which they are part 
the restoration act clarifies that entire institutions and 
government agencies are covered if any program or activity within 
them receives federal aid the broad coverage also applies to the 
private sector if the aid goes to a corporation as a whole or if 
the recipient principally provides education health care housing 
social services or parks and recreation 
the bill also says farmers getting crop subsidies people on 
food stamps and other individuals receiving federal assistance are 
not required to comply with the antidiscrimination statutes 
sponsors of the restoration act said congress always intended 
broad civil rights protections on the theory that those who dip 
their hands in the public till should not object if a little 
democracy sticks to their fingers as rep augustus hawkins 
dcalif put it 
but opponents claim the bill goes far beyond restoration like 
reagan they complained that it is too intrusive into the private 
sector and religious organizations 
the wording of the law is going to bring about unintended 
consequences like you could never imagine said rep george 
gekas rpa 
house leaders provoked controversy by bringing the senates 
version of the civil rights bill directly to the floor wednesday 
bypassing house committees and limiting amendments to one gop 
substitute for the entire bill 
we need a voting rights act for congressmen sputtered rep 
henry hyde rill 
but other members said there had been more than 40 committee 
hearings on the grove city bill since 1984 hawkins chairman of 
the house education and labor committee and a senior member of the 
congressional black caucus said 2500 amendments had been offered 
over the years 
all the compromises that can possibly be made have already 
been made certainly all the ideas that could ever have been 
thought of have already been expressed said hawkins the time 
to act is now 
the gop substitute sponsored by rep james sensenbrenner 
rwis would have limited the bills impact on corporations and 
allowed more educational institutions to escape compliance with the 
sex discrimination ban on religious grounds 
sensenbrenner said he offered it in a spirit of 
reconciliation to end the fouryear congressional ordeal over the 
bill but it was defeated 266146 
an antiabortion amendment adopted by the senate says nothing in 
the bill or in existing law requires institutions to perform or pay 
for abortions the amendment invalidates 1975 regulations that bar 
discrimination against women who have had abortions or sought them 
and require college health plans to treat abortions like other 
temporary disabilities 
feminists considered the amendment a setback but did not 
actively oppose the civil rights bill in the house the national 
righttolife committee called the amendment a great victory 
saying wednesday that congress has emphatically rejected the 
legal doctrine that antiabortion policies are a form of sex 
discrimination 
the restoration act applies to the four civil rights laws 
affected by the supreme court ruling title ix of the 1972 
education amendments barring sex discrimination in federally 
funded education programs the 1964 civil rights act barring 
racial discrimination in federallyassisted programs the 1973 
rehabilitation act barring discrimination against the handicapped 
in any program or activity receiving federal aid and the 1975 age 
discrimination act barring employment discrimination against older 
people 
the house passed the restoration act in similar form on a vote 
of 37532 in 1984 shortly after the court decision the bill was 
bottled up in a senate committee until last year

nato leaders on wednesday demanded huge 
cutbacks in warsaw pact tanks and artillery that cast a shadow 
over europe and endorsed president reagans efforts to negotiate 
strategic arms reductions with the soviet union 
defining strategy for a new set of eastwest negotiations nato 
leaders said soviet conventional forces pose the threat of a 
surprise attack and must be slashed to rectify an imbalance in 
military strength 
the soviet cutbacks would entail for example the elimination 
from europe of tens of thousands of warsaw pact weapons relevant to 
surprise attack among them tanks and artillery pieces a nato 
communique said 
meeting behind closed doors at alliances heavily guarded 
headquarters the leaders of the 16 alliance countries attempted to 
accentuate agreement they did not want to highlight differences 
about the pace of modernizing shortrange nuclear missiles left in 
europe after the elimination of longerrange weapons covered by a 
new ussoviet arms treaty 
british sources speaking on condition of anonymity said nato 
foreign ministers late wednesday agreed on compromise language for 
a final declaration thursday on the modernization issue 
the summit participants will call for the shortrange nuclear 
missiles to continue to be kept uptodate where necessary the 
sources said a statement that avoids the word modernization 
to which west germany objects 
according to his spokesman reagan quoted benjamin franklin 
telling the nato leaders if we do not all hang together we will 
assuredly hang separately 
security was so strict that a nato guard attempted to eject a 
reporter who asked reagan a question as the leaders posed for a 
family photo 
emphasizing alliance unity reagan said there are no great 
fundamental differences there i have never seen such harmony and 
togetherness as we have 
reagan mixed nato summitry with middle east peace efforts he 
ordered secretary of state george p shultz to make a whirlwind 
return to the middle east after the summit windup thursday night to 
continue his efforts to set up arabisraeli peace talks 
first shultz will stop in london to see jordans king hussein 
and on friday will visit israel egypt and syria returning to 
washington early saturday morning 
the nato meeting is the alliances first summit since 1982 
accompanied by their foreign ministers the leaders gathered at 
a long walnutbrown oval table in a conference room shortly after 
noon to hear an opening statement by lord carrington natos 
secretary general 
for a minute or so carringtons remarks were obscured by a loud 
hum on the translation earphones causing foreign officials and 
their aides to pull the earplugs out briefly and switch channels 
for a clearer sound 
carrington said reagans effort to secure a 50 percent cut in 
us and soviet longrange missiles has the alliances full 
support 
he spoke of soviet leader mikhail gorbachev as a man who is 
ready to reduce some tensions but expressed concern about the 
kremlins military might and the denial of basic human rights and 
freedom to the peoples of eastern europe and the soviet union 
the leaders held nearly three hours of formal talks in addition 
to a luncheon and dinner and issued a communique demanding that 
the soviet union reduce its advantage in conventional or 
nonnuclear forces 
the document highlights an issue of broad agreement within the 
western alliance directing the focus away from west germanys 
reluctance to move ahead with an alliance decision to modernize 
shortrange nuclear weapons 
west germany which is most threatened by shortrange weapons 
is pressing for talks with the soviets to reduce the kremlins 
large edge in those weapons 
most of the other nato leaders including the united states and 
britain oppose such talks now fearing they could lead to demands 
for eliminating all of the weapons leaving europe exposed to the 
soviets superior conventional forces 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said most of the leaders 
in their private remarks touched on the issue of modernizing the 
shortrange weapons everybody has some feelings about that 
issue some more supportive than others 
a white house official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
west german chancellor helmut kohl spoke most directly on the 
issue but that even his remarks were muted 
on the question of conventional forces there is no dispute in 
nato that the warsaw pact has an advantage about 3to1 in tanks 
and artillery and nearly 2to1 in combat aircraft and troops 
including reserves in the soviet union moscow contends that 
eastwest conventional forces are roughly equivalent 
lt gen colin powell reagans national security adviser said 
the conventional arms negotiations will perhaps be more difficult 
than any of the nuclear arms talks that have been held so far 
because were talking about large asymmetries were talking about 
a large imbalance between our forces and those of the warsaw pact 
reagan repeatedly denied there were any differences in the 
talks but powell in an interview with nbctv suggested otherwise 
he said that with 16 leaders certainly there will be 
differences and there will be heated debate and discussion from 
time to time 
however powell said there was a sense of unity that was 
overwhelming 
and any minor dispute that might exist or some of the debates 
that are going on as to how one should characterize the 
modernization issue with shortrange nuclear forces pales in 
comparison to the overall sense of unity that was conveyed at the 
meeting today he said 
in a sixpage statement on conventional forces the nato leaders 
said 
the soviet unions military presence in europe at a level far 
in excess of its needs for selfdefense directly challenges our 
security as well as our hopes for change in the political situation 
in europe 
thus the conventional imbalance in europe remains at the core 
of europes security concerns 
the document sets the stage for negotiations to begin in earnest 
this fall in vienna austria with representatives of the warsaw 
pact consisting of the soviet union and six east european allies 
our aim will be to establish a situation in europe in which 
force postures as well as the numbers of deployments and weapons 
systems no longer make surprise attack and largescale offensive 
action a feasible option the nato statement said 
the new set of negotiations would replace 15 years of talks that 
have failed to produce agreement nato wants the new talks to 
encompass the full european area from the atlantic to the ural 
mountains whereas the old talks were limited to the central front

the united states is taking legal action to 
prevent panamas militarydominated regime from withdrawing 
panamanian government funds from us banks a lawyer representing 
opposition forces said wednesday 
meanwhile assistant secretary of state elliott abrams raised 
the possibility that the united states will withhold the next 
payment due to panama for tolls fees and services for panama canal 
operations 
the two developments indicated reagan administration interest in 
accelerating a campaign of economic denial against the panamanian 
regime dominated by the chief of the panamanian defense forces 
gen manuel antonio noriega 
william d rogers a lawyer for ousted panamanian president eric 
arturo delvalle told a news conference about the alleged us 
effort to freeze panamanian government funds deposited in american 
banks 
although no firm figures were available 50 million was said to 
be involved 
the state department had no comment on the reported action but 
other officials speaking only on condition of anonymity confirmed 
that the measures outlined by rogers were being taken 
asked about the us position on that issue abrams told the 
cable news network we know who the legitimate government of 
panama is if the government of president delvalle says to american 
banks dont pay money to noriega then all those banks are going 
to come to the state department and say whos got the authority 
here noriega or delvalle 
were going to answer that question delvalle is president of 
panama and noriega has been fired and he does not have legitimate 
authority here 
rogers of the arnold amp porter law firm said the administration 
action was being carried out to ensure that the banks may make 
disbursements only to the panamanian ambassador who served under 
delvalle juan b sosa delvalle was ousted last week after he 
tried to fire noriega and has been in hiding in panama 
rogers said the state department was issuing formal 
certifications that it regards sosa as the accredited 
representative of the recognized government of the country 
state department deputy spokeswoman phyllis oakley said only 
that such certifications were being prepared she declined to 
specify their purpose 
at issue is the status of panamanian government deposits at five 
american banks the attempt by sosa and his allies to prevent the 
transfer of these funds to the new panamanian government is part of 
an ambitious plan of economic warfare aimed at toppling noriega 
delvalle was forced out last week after noriega under federal 
indictment on drug smuggling charges ignored delvalles attempt to 
replace him 
rogers said the banks believed to have panamanian government 
deposits are marine midland na irving trust co bankers trust 
co the republic national bank and the bank of boston 
every dime we can find is in those banks rogers said he 
added that any bank which ignores the order could be liable for 
whatever payments it makes to the current panamanian government 
marine midland and irving trust refused comment on the purported 
state department action another new york banking source insisting 
on anonymity questioned the legitimacy of the effort to block 
transfers of funds 
sosa said the state department is seriously considering 
withholding from panama the next payment due march 15 of the fees 
the united states gives panama for use of the panama canal he 
estimated that figure at 8 million but other sources said it was 
closer to 7 million 
mrs oakley confirmed that a request from the delvalle 
government to put the funds in escrow had been received and that 
the state department was consulting with other agencies on how to 
proceed 
abrams indicated that no such request had been received but that 
the united states would respond positively if asked 
if they ask us to pay the canal payments into a different 
account or delay it i think wed do that wed respond to 
president delvalle 
if he tells us he doesnt want that money going to noriega 
then were not going to give it to noriega 
several members of the house merchant marine committee which 
has jurisdiction over the panama canal called on president reagan 
to withhold the payment and threatened to legislate that step if he 
refuses to go along 
rep billy tauzin dla said they the panamanian 
authorities are in dire need of funds if this payment is denied 
to them the noriega regime will have great difficulty maintaining 
itself 
the legislators said nearly 80 million a year is paid to panama 
by the united states under terms of the panama canal treaties 
in new york lawyers for delvalle sued in federal court to block 
the republic national bank from turning over millions of dollars to 
the new panamanian government 
the lawsuit was dropped after the bank agreed to transfer the 
money estimated at 10 million to the federal reserve bank for 
safekeeping 
in related matters wednesday 
sen alfonse damato rny said the cia is conducting an 
internal investigation into allegations that it was the source of 
personal and political information on us senators forwarded to 
noriega 
the allegations of the cianoriega link were first made at a 
congressional hearing last month by jose i blandon a former top 
panamanian intelligence official us law prohibits the cia from 
engaging in domestic spying on american citizens 
two officials who identified themselves as being with the spy 
agencys office of the inspector general interviewed blandon last 
week damato said 
after meeting at the capitol with panamanian opposition 
political leaders damato and sen john kerry dmass said they 
will offer on the senate floor on thursday a progressive plan of 
increased economic pressure against the noriega regime 
ricardo arias calderon president of panamas christian 
democratic party said the campaign to restore democracy will 
prevail by combining peaceful people power in panama 
international public opinion and the growing economic pressure 
that is being exercised on the illegitimate regime of gen 
noriega 
financial experts in miami said billions of dollars in bank 
deposits have been taken out of panama for safer havens in the wake 
of noriegas drug indictment in miami last month 
this certainly has destabilized panama as a banking center 
said gonzalo valdesfauli senior vice president and manager of the 
miami office of londonbased barclays bank 
one unidentified top banking expert told the miami herald that 
from june to october panamanian banks lost 7 billion of the 36 
billion they held panama in the 1980s had come to be known as the 
switzerland of latin america offering banking secrecy and 
stability to the regions investors and depositors 
unlike other countries panama cannot cover its cash shortages 
by printing new money becuase the dollar is the national currency

gas inside an arab hospital wednesday forcing doctors to don gas 
masks and sending dozens of choking patients fleeing with their 
faces covered by arab headdresses 
soldiers clubbed a palestinian teenager suspected of throwing 
rocks at troops from a barricade erected about 10 yards from the 
hospitals emergency room 
an associated press photographer saw soldiers throw the youth 
head first down a flight of stairs then sit on his stomach while 
beating him with a wooden truncheon 
troops detained 20 arabs suspected of participating in 
demonstrations in ramallah israel radio said 
president reagan meanwhile ordered secretary of state george 
p shultz to return to the middle east on thursday for further 
talks with arab and israeli leaders 
in jerusalem police detained 27 israeli students from the 
bezalel art school after their parade for the jewish holiday of 
purim turned into a protest against the israeli handling of unrest 
in the territories 
defense minister yitzhak rabin defended israels policy of using 
blows to subdue arab protesters saying that of several thousand 
soldiers serving in the occupied territories only 2 percent to 3 
percent had commited excesses the itim news agency reported 
as a matter of policy the army does not release exact figures 
on troop deployment 
in ramallah eight miles north of jerusalem soldiers fired at 
least six tear gas canisters at palestinian protesters who used 
rocks and twisted metal to block a street outside governmentrun 
ramallah hospital and hurled stones at a dozen soldiers 
one smoking canister landed in the emergency room reception area 
and a second in a hospital courtyard 
two doctors donned gas masks and others held onions to their 
noses to counter the effects of the gas about 30 coughing 
patients including old men with canes used arab headdresses to 
cover their faces 
even the doctors couldnt breathe so imagine the effects on 
the patients inside many of whom are seriously ill said one 
doctor who declined to identify himself 
soldiers detained three youths outside the hospital dragging 
away one of them with a gash on his forehead and a blooddrenched 
shoulder

on tuesday three soldiers burst into the hospital fired tear gas 
and struck two doctors with their rifles as they searched for 
demonstrators the hospital director said 
an army spokesman denied soldiers entered the hospital or beat 
doctors in tuesdays incident

mosques as hideouts to elude arrest and as staging grounds for 
antiisraeli riots according to israeli officials and eyewitnesses 
also in ramallah wednesday police briefly detained three 
italian legislators who chained themselves to electric poles 
outside a refugee camp and distributed antioccupation leaflets 
israel radio said 
in the gaza strip palestinian organizers permitted merchants to 
open their stores for three hours a day following a threemonth 
commercial strike an arab reporter said 
but the army forced the stores to remain closed saying 
storekeepers were being intimidated and the army would only permit 
them to resume business when they did it of their own free will in 
the past soldiers repeatedly tried to force stores to open to 
break the strike 
on the diplomatic front rightwing legislators said jordans 
king hussein had gone back on previous understandings with israel 
by insisting the palestine liberation organization be involved in 
peace talks 
king hussein says the plo must be involved in the peace 
process and he wants a fullscale international conference likud 
legislator dan meridor a close aide to prime minister yitzhak 
shamir told israel television if thats progress i dont know 
what going backward is 
foreign minister shimon peres agreed the plo should not be 
included in talks 
shamir himself on wednesday accused jordan of siding with the 
most extreme elements in the arab world and said the ultimate 
goal of all arab leaders was to destroy israel 
he spoke to members of the conference of presidents of major 
american jewish organizations 
the haaretz daily reported that in order to prevent excesses by 
soldiers the army decided troops should not serve in the occupied 
territories for more than 1 months at a time 
the newspaper said the army believed frustration and anger built 
up during more than two months of serving in the territories had 
caused four soldiers photographed by cbs news to beat two bound 
arabs with stones last week 
shamir said he was considering further restrictions on media 
access in the occupied territories saying journalists have harmed 
israel he did not say what steps he might take soldiers now are 
authorized to temporarily close parts of the occupied territories 
to reporters 
shamir also called on american jewish leaders to quell any 
criticism of israel within their ranks saying it was nonjewish 
to join an antiisraeli front of nonjewish people

republican presidential hopeful bob dole 
implied wednesday there was a connection between vice president 
george bushs tenure as head of the central intelligence agency and 
speculation that panamanian strong man manuel antonio noriega was 
on the cia payroll that drew a sharp response from bush 
dole appeared with a dancing pineapple before a crowd of about 
300 at a windy rainthreatened rally in downtown new orleans 
at least twice dole implied that bush who was head of the cia 
from 197677 might have had some dealings with noriega 
theres some evidence noriega was on the cia payroll as far 
back as 1966 thats all i know dole said he would not discuss 
what the evidence was or what he knew 
bush campaigning in baton rouge la criticized dole for 
bringing up the subject 
i find it amazing that a united states senator will talk about 
cia matters i took an oath of office to protect sources and 
methods of intelligence and i would never discuss anything i was 
doing at the cia that would affect the national security bush 
said 
there has been one charge after another in this campaign and i 
have just decided not to respond to mr doles charges 
however bush pointed to noriegas recent indictment on federal 
drug charges 
i would point out that its the reaganbush administration 
under which mr noriega is being indicted in florida for drugs 
dole has grown increasingly critical of bush in the final days 
before the super tuesday round of caucuses and primaries in which 
the vice president has a comfortable lead 
i need to convince a lot of people in the next few days 
theres only one candidate tough enough to do the job and that 
candidates bob dole dole said 
dole said if elected he would force his desire for a lineitem 
veto into the courts 
when the appropriations bill comes down id lineitem veto a 
few things and send it back to congress then wed have a 
constitutional question dole said which would throw the issue 
into the courts 
if congress wont approve a balanced budget amendment dole said 
he would go to the american people and call a constitutional 
convention to get one 
dole also pledged to support american interests in the panama 
canal zone after the year 2000 when the united states is supposed 
to turn over control of the canal to the central american country 
i sure am glad i voted against the panama canal treaty that 
vote looks better every day he said

two big obstacles in the war on drugs are 
lowlevel bureaucrats who dont have their hearts in the effort and 
an overbearing congress two top administration officials contended 
wednesday 
attorney general edwin meese iii one of four cabinet officials 
appearing on a ninemember administration panel at the white house 
conference on a drugfree america asserted there is no problem of 
leadership at the top 
he called for more state and local financial assistance less 
congressional meddling and more determination by federal employees 
to get with the programs outlined by their superiors 
responding to written questions submitted by some of the 
estimated 2000 people attending the conference meese said there 
is no need for a federal drug czar to coordinate the battle 
i thik this idea has been so discredited there is nobody that 
really believes in that any more he said what has happened is 
there is a drug czar in the united states and that is the 
president of the united states 
meese acknowledged that with several different agencies involved 
youre going to have differences of opinion but he said there 
are mechanisms for resolving interagency disputes and that he is 
not worried about the organizational aspects 
however he continued i am extremely concerned about the 
fragmentation that goes on in congress the fact that we have 32 
different committees in the congress with cognizance over the drug 
problem so that too many of the leaders who are seated on the stage 
here are spending their time testifying in front of congressional 
committees instead of leading the forces that ought to be out in 
the field working on the drug problem 
william von raab commissioner of the us customs service said 
too many bureaucrats lack enthusiasm for fighting the drug war 
i have been flat out told by many bureaucrats that just 
because the president is supporting an effort it doesnt mean that 
money goes with it he said we dont need a bunch of 
bureaucrats that will deal with this war on drugs the way they 
dealt with the war in vietnam we need heart in this effort 
there are still too many people who work for us in my 
organization as well who still have their noses too deeply buried 
in their old books the customs chief said these are the 
conscientious objectors the shirkers and the fourth columnists in 
this war 
meese associated himself with those remarks but neither he nor 
von raab identified the people they were talking about 
responding to another question meese discounted any implication 
that he does not favor continued federal financing for federal drug 
treatment programs but he said state and local officials need to 
do more 
von raab said that starting march 15 the customs service will 
begin taking the passports of americans who try to reenter the 
country with drugs the passports are to be seized as evidence of a 
crime and forwarded to the state department said customs service 
spokesman edward kittredge 
among the other administration participants at the 
congressionally ordered conference was education secretary william 
bennett who embraced the longsimmering idea of making more use of 
us military forces to interdict the flow of drugs into the united 
states 
as the greatest military and economic power in the world we 
can do more to prevent criminals in foreign nations from growing or 
processing illegal drugs bennett said 
it is to be hoped we can do this in collaboration with foreign 
governments but if need be we must consider doing this by 
ourselves he said and we should consider broader use of 
military force against both the production and shipment of drugs 
congress has considered legislation since 1983 to authorize 
military intervention against drug shipments the measure has 
passed the house in one form or another on three occasions but has 
never passed the senate 
the latest congressional action on the issue called for the 
general accounting office to study the impact on military readiness 
of having the defense department play a lead role in the antidrug 
effort 
during wednesdays session new york mayor edward i koch was 
rebuffed when he attempted to ask a question about the role of the 
military in the drug war from the floor rather than submit it in 
writing as others were required to do 
what i saw was a lot of backscratching koch said later of 
the preceedings it is incredible that they would stifle 
debate and not allow questions from the floor it is a disservice 
to the mission 
but koch who said he was speaking for the us conference of 
mayors told reporters he liked what he heard from bennett and von 
raab especially the idea of using military forces against foreign 
drug dealers 
well take care of the communists later he said theyre 
not now seeking to invade the united states its the drug 
dealers

massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
fulfilled a boyhood ambition wednesday as he detoured from the 
beaten political campaign trail to make a pilgrimage to the boston 
red sox spring training camp 
he didnt forget politics also making a speech at a florida 
high school celebrating his victory in tuesdays nonbinding 
vermont primary and crowing in miami that we must be coming on 
strong folks when told that republican candidate george bush had 
criticized him in another southern state 
bush in mississippi said dukakis wanted to reduce the number 
of navy battleships which bush called a dumb idea 
well have a strong wellequipped navy but were not going 
to spend 36 billion on two super carrier task forces dukakis 
said 
the massachusetts governor began airing a new television 
commercial attacking rep richard gephardt and mocking gephardts 
populist slogan its your fight too 
the advertisement says gephardt is taking campaign contributions 
from big establishment power brokers and adds kinda makes 
you wonder is dick gephardt fighting your fight or theirs 
in winter haven unlike ordinary tourists the governor even got 
a turn in the big league batting cage although he had little to 
show for it 
the onetime freshman catcher on the brookline mass high 
school squad donned red sox jersey no 1 and took 10 swings against 
a batting practice pitcher he fouled off three balls popped one 
into the batting cage hit five grounders and whiffed once 
i want you to work on your swing advised outfielder dwight 
evans 
at least i made contact said the 54yearold governor he 
acknowledged to reporters im a little rusty as you can see 
the selfdescribed longsuffering red sox fan said its a 
great thrill to be here ive never been to spring training its 
something all boston kids want to do 
im very optimistic about the campaign and the red sox he 
said if we could both win our world series that would be a 
great 1988 
dukakis is doing well in many polls heading into tuesdays round 
of 20 primaries and caucuses primarily in the south but he said 
the red sox like himself should just keep working and dont pay 
any attention to the polls 
outside a high school in apopka fla dukakis said were 
going to do well across the south with a campaign emphasizing 
jobs good health care the environment things that people care 
about in the south and all over the country 
referring to rival albert gore jr the tennessee senator who 
has geared his campaign to the south dukakis said if you put 
all of your eggs in one regional basket it becomes a lot more 
crucial that you do exceedingly well 
he got an enthusiastic welcome at an assembly of apopka high 
schools 460member senior class but there were a few groans when 
dukakis defended his stands against aid to the contras and the 
strategic defense initiative 
when dukakis asked is it going to be star wars or housing for 
the homeless is it going to be mx missiles or housing for the 
homeless some of the teenagers replied star wars mx 
missiles 
nearly onefifth of apopkas students are in a marine rotc 
program and several seniors wore their dress blues 
dukakis also got a campaign boost in the super tuesday state of 
hawaii where gov john waihee has thrown the support of the 
states democratic party leadership behind him 
waihee had maintained an uncommitted stance until now 
i think the game is on the line tuesday we can stand on the 
sidelines and watch or we can get into the game waihee told a 
news conference wednesday in honolulu 
the announcement came with dukakis listening in from miami 
fla on a telephone conference call 
im sitting here glowing dukakis said he called waihee a 
man who has shown great wisdom in his choice of presidential 
candidates 
waihee said the dukakis endorsement has the backing of hawaiis 
sens daniel inouye and spark matsunaga and rep daniel akaka lt 
gov ben cayetano and other democratic leaders 
hawaiis super tuesday precinct elections will include a 
presidential preference vote that will be binding on at least 20 of 
hawaiis 28 delegates to the democratic party national convention 
before the dukakis endorsement party leaders said they had 
expected jesse jackson to gain a plurality in hawaiis precinct 
elections with dukakis and uncommitted splitting most of the 
balance

a senator complained wednesday that gov 
evan mecham sent an inappropriate letter proclaiming his 
innocence to every member of the arizona senate which is sitting 
as judge and jury at his impeachment trial 
an irate sen jesus chuy higuera arose at the close of the 
third day of the firstterm republicans impeachment trial and held 
up the letter 
i hope governor mecham understands the oath we have taken 
said higuera urging other senators not to read the document i 
hope mr mecham would understand its inappropriate to try to 
communicate with us 
the fivepage document was a copy of mechams statement from a 
saturday news conference during which the governor pleaded his case 
and claimed it was unfair to try him on impeachment charges before 
a criminal case can be resolved 
a cover memo on the governors official stationery accompanied 
each copy 
mecham 63 was impeached by the house on charges of concealing 
a 350000 campaign loan borrowing 80000 in state funds for his 
auto dealership and trying to thwart an investigation of an alleged 
death threat against a former aide 
he also also faces a march 22 trial march on charges of 
concealing the loan and a may 17 recall election 
one of mechams lawyers tom crowe told the associated press he 
considered the governors sending the letter appropriate 
its a political proceeding said crowe the senators have 
received communications from many people pro and con i dont see 
why the governor should be any different 
some senators who had voted to delay the impeachment trial said 
they had received notes from mecham thanking them for their support 
in recent weeks senators have asked that mecham stop making 
phone calls to their offices during the impeachment proceedings 
they said they consider the calls inappropriate and did not talk 
the governor who is suspended from office 
on tuesday a flap arose when it appeared that mecham had tried 
to contact a witness but the governor later said the phone call 
was placed by mistake 
during testimony earlier in the day an attorney for mecham 
suggested that the alleged death threat to a grand jury witness was 
a political matter not a crime 
mechams former security chief testifying for a second day 
said he considered the incident a potential felony and told mecham 
a crime could be involved 
the criminal nature of it was primary in my mind said 
department of public safety lt charles beau johnson i did 
not really think of it in the political sense 
didnt you also believe this could be a political matter 
defense attorney fred craft asked 
i dont recall that that crossed my mind johnson said 
johnson and another former member of the governors security 
detail have testified they were told that mechams aide lee 
watkins threatened in november that the governors former 
legislative liaison donna carlson might go on a long boat 
ride if she didnt stop testifying before a grand jury 
investigating mecham 
mecham is accused of instructing the head of the dps not to 
cooperate in the attorney generals probe watkins has denied 
threatening ms carlson and he has not been charged 
mecham who stayed away from the trial for a third day has said 
he didnt know all the details of the incident contended that he 
didnt know a potential felony was involved and blamed his security 
officers for not fully informing him 
i told him it was a felony to tamper with a witness johnson 
said i didnt say the words death threat but i said 
tampering with a witness i have no doubts about that i was 
not hiding anything from the governor 
he also said he thought the matter was being taken too 
lightly by the governor and his staff 
when you took it to fred craft did he take it seriously 
craft asked referring to himself craft was formerly mechams 
lobbyist in washington 
yes said johnson but i think the focus of your concern 
was embarrassment to the governor 
crafts participation as defense attorney as well as a principal 
in the disputed events raised protests from some senators 
republican majority leader robert usdane accused craft of 
misleading senators about his role when they agreed to let him join 
the defense his participation as a lawyer bars him from being 
called by either side as a witness although some senators believe 
they could call craft to testify 
earlier the trials presiding officer arizona chief justice 
frank x gordon said he would not allow the defense to introduce 
an affidavit intended to discredit a key witness by alleging he had 
an affair with an employee in 1982 
the prospective witness dps director ralph milstead has said 
the allegations are ridiculous 
i dont think its necessary to go into old past history about 
someones past sexual liaison and he denies it said gordon 
it has no value to prove anything material to these issues 
a twothirds vote of the senate would be required to convict 
mecham on any count and remove him from office the senate could 
by another twothirds vote then bar mecham from holding any state 
office again

an opposition leader said wednesday 
that gen manuel antonio noriega was purging his army of suspected 
opponents and doctors joined businesses in a general strike aimed 
at ousting the military strongman 
guillermo cochez a national legislator and vice president of 
the opposition christian democratic party told reporters that 
noriega apparently had fired two senior colonels and two majors 
suspected of being disloyal 
cochez said they included col marcos justines who as chief of 
staff was no 2 in the panamanian defense forces and next in line 
to succeed noriega 
for a second day the strike was marked by violence in a 
middleclass neighborhood near the banking district on tuesday 
security agents destroyed an opposition radio station in the 
neighborhood apparently because it broadcast an appeal for 
antinoriega demonstrations 
demonstrators gathered wednesday along the fourlane street in 
front of the station set up barricades of burning trash and set 
fire to a minivan and a car 
antiriot police chased the protesters into side streets and 
apartment buildings chunks of concrete were hurled down at police 
from at least two of the apartment houses 
police fired teargas grenades and pumped tear gas into the 
buildings from portable tanks filling the entire neighborhood with 
the acrid stinging fumes 
the officer in charge stood in the middle of the street and 
shouted to residents youll come out like cockroaches 
none did and reporters on the scene saw no one injured 
a spokesman for the panama canal commission said anonymous 
telephone callers warned tuesday and wednesday that a bomb was 
planted in commission headquarters 
spokesman franklin castrellon told the associated press the 
building was evacuated and searched both days but no bombs were 
found 
in washington meanwhile william d rogers a lawyer for a 
panamanian opposition group said the state department was taking 
legal action to keep noriegas regime from withdrawing panamanian 
government funds from us banks about 50 million was said to be 
involved 
assistant secretary of state elliott abrams raised the 
possibility that the united states will withhold the next payment 
due to panama for tolls fees and services for panama canal 
operations 
abrams also told the cable news network that if the government 
of president eric arturo delvalle says to american banks dont 
pay money to noriega then all those banks are going to come to the 
state department and say whos got the authority here noriega or 
delvalle 
were going to answer that question noriega has been fired 
and he does not have legitimate authority there abrams said 
cochez said he could not absolutely confirm the firings but 
several diplomatic sources said they also had heard the reports and 
tended to believe them 
justines was chosen by president devalle on feb 25 to replace 
noriega but devalles attempt to fire noriega backfired noriega 
supporters in the national assembly instead voted to oust delvalle 
justines then joined other ranking officers in pledging their 
loyalty to noriega who is under indictment in the united states on 
drug trafficking charges 
cochez said col elias castillo the army chief and the no 4 
man in the military hierarchy also was fired along with two 
majors moises del rio and fernando quesada 
i think the purge is good for the democratic process because 
it will show the other officers that he noriega is not interested 
in the institution but only in himself cochez said most 
officers are supporting noriega because they consider it an 
institutional problem 
the armed forces press office said it could not confirm the 
reported removals of officers 
noriega has headed the 15000member defense forces which 
includes the army navy air force and police since 1983 he was 
seen as the real power behind delvalles civilian government 
most of the capitals doctors appeared to have joined the 
nationwide strike against noriega which began monday 
ap reporters visited four hospitals and clinics around the 
capital wednesday and found them taking new patients only on an 
emergency basis 
the government which through official media has been calling 
the strike a complete failure tacitly admitted health care 
problems the health ministry issued a communique calling on all 
unemployed physicians to report to ministry offices for assignment 
calls to areas outside the capital indicated mixed participation 
in the strike 
in colon the countrys other major commercial center daniel 
delgado of the chamber of commerce said economic activity had 
proceeded almost normally monday and tuesday but he said the 
chamber called on members to join the strike for 48 hours beginning 
thursday 
in chiriquii province on the costa rican border the chamber of 
commerce reported a significant reduction in activity with 
virtually all branches of capitalbased stores and businesses shut 
down 
in chitre 90 miles southwest of panama city horacio rodriguez 
director of the association of executives said about 60 percent of 
the citys economic activity was shut down 
the national civic crusade an alliance of about 200 business 
labor professional and political groups claimed tuesday night 
that the strike had succeeded in shutting down 85 percent of the 
countrys economic acivity

president daniel ortega on wednesday 
proposed holding the third round of nicaraguan ceasefire talks 
without the countrys roman catholic leader saying the mediator 
had failed to produce results 
ortega said the talks scheduled for next week should be held 
in the nicaraguan town of sapoa near the costa rican border it 
was the first time the leftist sandinista government has agreed to 
talk to the usbacked rebels in nicaragua 
cardinal miguel obando y bravo has been mediating the talks on 
ending the 7yearold war 
ortega said his government decided to take the bull by the 
horns because obando y bravos mediation had not produced any 
results 
the cardinal himself had suggested some time ago that a direct 
meeting and in our country would be very important ortega said 
i told him that today i have decided to name the member of the 
national directorate of the sandinista liberation front and defense 
minister gen humberto ortega as the chief of the sandinista 
delegation he added the defense minister is the presidents 
brother 
the contra rebels sent a message to the cardinal earlier 
wednesday agreeing to his proposal to hold new talks on march 
1011 
the last round of negotiations broke off feb 19 in guatemala 
after the cardinal said the two sides had reached an impasse 
after making his proposal president ortega said in this 
manner we are testing whether there really exists the will to work 
for peace on the part of the socalled directorate of the 
counterrevolution since it can no longer give any excuses 
he referred to the directorate of the contra umbrella 
organization known as the nicaraguan resistance 
ortega spoke with reporters shortly after meeting with obando y 
bravo in the evening but there was no immediate comment from the 
cardinal 
the sandinistas previously refused to hold the talks in 
nicaragua saying the rebels should seek a government amnesty 
before being able to enter the country 
obando y bravo sent a letter to ortega earlier wednesday 
hammering at the need to resume ceasefire negotiations 
during the february talks the cardinal increased his role by 
proposing a peace agenda besides calling for a laying down of 
arms he asked the sandinistas to grant total political amnesty 
restore full press freedoms revise the military draft law and 
reopen talks with the opposition political parties that remain 
active inside nicaragua 
he also suggested the contras be permitted to enter designated 
ceasefire zones with their arms for a onemonth truce 
in their message wednesday accepting the new round of talks the 
contras reiterated their acceptance of the agenda proposed by the 
cardinal said jorge rosales a spokesman in miami for the rebel 
coalition known as the nicaraguan resistance 
the sandinistas maintain they will not discuss political issues 
with the contras they say amnesty will be granted after a 
ceasefire agreement is reached 
talks with the internal political parties broke off in december 
when opposition members insisted on constitutional changes 
the ceasefire and internal dialogue are outlined in a regional 
peace plan signed last august by the presidents of nicaragua el 
salvador guatemala costa rica and honduras 
the sandinistas want talks with the contras to center on the 
mechanics of how and where the rebels should lay down their arms 
the government asked obando y bravo last november to mediate the 
talks the church backed the successful sandinista struggle to 
overthrow the rightwing proamerican somoza dynasty in 1979 but 
later became a firm critic of the sandinista government 
the cardinal acted as gobetween until january when the 
sandinistas softened their position and agreed to hold direct talks 
with the rebels 
in other developments the defense ministry said wednesday that 
its intelligence sources reported increased us military activity 
in central america and american troop movement along its borders 
a us embassy spokesman in tegucigalpa honduras said no 
american troops were near the border with nicaragua the spokesman 
added however that engineeringtraining projects carried out 
annually in the dry season had temporarily increased the number 
of flights out of palmerola air base and the number of troops in 
honduras 
he spoke on condition of anonymity 
the ministry communique said ammunition and explosives were 
transferred recently from us military installations in panama to 
costa rica nicaraguas neighbor to the south 
the communique said 1000 us army troops including some from 
the 82nd airborne division were moved to the nicaraguas 
northeastern border with honduras it said special forces units 
were moved to the northwestern border 
thereve been no border troop movements the embassy 
spokesman said 
us troops that participate in combined honduranus exercises 
are prohibited by us law from going within 20 miles of the border 
with nicaragua

a study of massachusetts women who gave birth 
found that one in 500 was infected with the aids virus and 
researchers projecting their findings nationwide say several 
thousand aidsinfected babies could be born in the united states 
each year 
most surveys of aids infection have concentrated on male 
homosexuals drug addicts and others at high risk of catching the 
disease estimating the prevalence of the virus in the general 
population has been difficult

epidemic in women said dr rodney hoff nothing else comes

new home sales fell 9 percent in january 
pushing sales activity to its slowest pace since the end of the 
last recession the government said wednesday as the housing 
industry continued to stagger following the october stock market 
collapse 
a downturn in housing has often been the harbinger of the onset 
of a recession but analysts said they believed falling mortgage 
rates offered the hope of a rebound in home sales in coming months 
in january the commerce department said that sales of new 
singlefamily homes fell for the third consecutive month dropping 
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 535000 units 26 percent 
below a year ago and the slowest pace since the last recession was 
ending in december 1982

once again good news has intruded on the gilded 
dreams of gold investors whose hopes for wealth depend on fears of 
inflation or economic collapse 
the price of gold has fallen from 500 an ounce in middecember 
to 430 an ounce this week making it a particularly bad investment 
so far in 1988 
what went wrong is that too many things went right in the 
aftermath of octobers stock market collapse 
jeffrey a nichols president of american precious metals 
advisors inc ticks some of them off 
low inflation a stronger dollar stable world equity markets 
a stronger us bond market rising confidence in the economic 
outlooks around the world and very significantly in the last 
couple of weeks rising confidence in the federal reserve and 
chairman alan greenspan 
good news for the general public but bad news for gold bugs 
so with good times breaking out why is nichols still predicting 
that gold will reach 500 an ounce again within the next 12 months 
and go perhaps significantly higher 
an excess of supply that marked the first few months of 1988 is 
likely to end nichols argues 
he says the soviet union probably will sell less gold from now 
on because it has raised a large portion of the foreign currency 
reserves it will need for the year 
mining companies will ease up on the downward pressure they put 
on gold prices through their sales of gold for future delivery in 
forward contracts nichols says 
and the spate of gold loans is likely to ease up somewhat 
nichols said newmont mining corp dumped 1 million ounces of gold 
onto the market this year when it borrowed against future 
production and then sold the gold to raise cash and pay off debts 
acquired in a successful takeover defense 
although an additional 2 million ounces worth of gold loans are 
already in the pipeline nichols said the flood should diminish 
after that 
on the demand side investors in japan and elsewhere in the far 
east have taken a new interest in gold the japanese imported 40 
tons of gold in february alone nichols estimates the appetite for 
kilobars 31 ounces of pure gold is so great in the far east 
that he says fabricators cannot keep up 
indians imported 100 tons of gold last year even though it is 
illegal to bring gold into india because of foreignexchange 
controls nichols said declining to divulge where he got the 
information 
new gold coins from the american eagle and canadian maple leaf 
to the chinese panda are increasing investors and collectors 
interest in gold while various banks and investment houses have 
created accumulation plans that allow people to buy gold on 
schedule 
and there is always the chance of more bad news which of 
course is good news 
trouble in south africa tends to push up gold prices by 
threatening to cut off supplies at the source 
and any hint that the next president will be fiscally 
irresponsible would do wonders for gold 
even republicans can be fiscally stimulative as weve seen 
from ronald reagan but generally democrats have a reputation for 
not being fiscally conservative said john norris a citibank 
vice president in charge of precious metals 
if somebody like jesse jackson ever had a chance of being 
elected i think youd see gold really start to move up norris 
said

in the 1964 film topkapi peter ustinov and 
melina mercouri played thieves who descended into a museum in 
istanbul through a skylight to steal a jewelencrusted dagger 
that plot was repeated with stunning accuracy last month when 
burglars broke into manhattans colnaghi art gallery through a 
skylight shinnied down a rope and plucked 27 old master paintings 
and drawings off the walls 
the stolen artwork was valued at 6 million making it the 
biggest art heist in new york history the most valuable pieces 
stolen were two panels by the 15th century italian renaissance 
master fra angelico worth 4 million 
but unlike the cunning thieves in topkapi those who broke 
into the colnaghi gallery on feb 8 appear to have been unschooled 
burglars who had no clear idea of what they were stealing 
if so their fate is ironic their booty may be impossible to 
sell at anything resembling its face value 
art theft long romanticized as a genteel form of larceny is on 
the rise some law enforcement officials and other experts believe 
it may rank second only to narcotics trafficking in value of 
illgotten gains 
if youre talking about dollar value it probably is said 
one justice department official who specializes in crime 
statistics he stressed that he was only speculating since art 
theft is not recognized as a separate category in federal 
statistics he declined to give his name 
it began to increase in the late 50s and the early 60s when 
the art market began to rise said milton esterow editor and 
publisher of artnews magazine more and more thieves began to 
wake up and say hey theres a lot of money here 
if there was a lot of money then theres more now 
masterworks often cost many times the value of the mansions 
where theyre hung vincent van goghs painting irises set a 
record last november when it was sold for 539 million 
art thieves usually fall into one of three categories experts 
say 
one is the professional thief who is commissioned to steal 
specific works of art 
mr jones might have fallen in love with one of these 
paintings and he wants it so bad he can just taste it so he goes 
out and hires someone to steal it explained retired insurance 
claims investigator jim mellors who specialized in fine art claims 
in these cases mellors and others said the stolen item may 
wind up in a private collection for years or even generations 
and no money changes hands except the fee paid by the collector to 
the thief 
less common is the collector who steals art himself such as the 
philadelphia doctor who was arrested in 1982 for shoplifting 
hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of art from new york 
galleries for his lavish personal collection 
and then probably most common of all is the professional thief 
who steals art and tries to fence it sometimes the thief is 
knowledgeable about art often he is not as appears to be the case 
in the colnaghi breakin law enforcement officials say 
its no secret that thieves who are knowledgeable about art 
dont steal wellknown pieces said esterow who is the author of 
the book the art stealers 
detective thomas moscardini the new york police departments 
fulltime art crimes investigator agreed that the colnaghi thieves 
may have blundered when they chose works by fra angelico jean 
baptiste simeon chardin and other old masters 
i think it would be difficult to dispose of them because they 
were somewhat noted pieces he said youre dealing with 
15th16th century works of art and that in itself would bring 
some attention 
according to the experts smart thieves steal midrange art 
preferably works that are similar to others by the same artist 
these works can be sold to unscrupulous or unwitting dealers who 
dont conduct thorough background checks sometimes they are used 
in place of currency in drug transactions 
the international foundation for art research maintains a list 
of art reported stolen the list now contains 278000 items and is 
regularly sent to law enforcement agencies museums and galleries 
between 150 and 300 items are added every month 
in the case of a major theft like that from the colnaghi 
gallery the foundation puts out a worldwide alert complete with 
photographs of the missing pieces the glare of publicity makes it 
hard for a thief particularly one without connections in the art 
world to sell the stolen goods except at an extreme discount to a 
crooked dealer or to an insurance company 
what are you going to do with a fra angelico asked esterow 
how are you going to get rid of it except by making a deal with 
the insurance company 
esterows remark brings up one of the touchiest subjects for 
those who deal with art theft 
insurance adjusters routinely deny that they ever pay ransom to 
get back a work of art no no no they dont pay ransom said 
independent claims adjuster william smith who specializes in the 
fine arts they pay rewards which are a different thing they 
will pay to retrieve property under acceptable circumstances 
if for example an innocent party comes forward and gives them 
information that leads to recovery 
but others say that policy is not strictly followed 
in europe artworks have been held for ransom for the 
insurance company to pay said manhattan art dealer arnold 
herstand thats arranged frequently its even arranged in new 
york city thats fairly common 
in the colnaghi case the gallery has announced that its 
insurance company was offering a reward 10 percent of the value 
of the stolen pieces for their return 
final determination of eligibility for payment of the reward 
will be made by the donor not by the new york city police 
department or any other party the announcement said 
a spokesman for the gallery vice president alan wintermute 
said he couldnt say if the thieves were among those eligible for 
the reward which could amount to 600000 it was up to the 
insurance company he said 
the recovery rate for stolen art is probably no greater than 10 
percent experts say enforcement is spotty new york and los 
angeles each have one fulltime police officer investigating art 
crimes the fbi has one and the us customs service has one they 
represent the nations war on art crime 
it is a big business said charles koczka a retired us 
customs agent who was that agencys specialist in fine art crimes 
it has a minimal risk of being caught or if you are caught of 
going to jail and unfortunately if you are a victim youre very 
unlikely to recover your property

members of the mormon tabernacle choir and 
church president and prophet ezra taft benson attended the 
inauguration of arizona gov evan mecham himself a former mormon 
bishop mechams beliefs are closely tied to church doctrine his 
ties to church leadership strong so when a storm of turmoil 
engulfed the governor arizonas mormon community found itself at 
the center 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
steve benson has been a lifelong mormon 
active in church affairs he is the grandson of church president 
and prophet ezra taft benson few would question his devotion 
few except impeached gov evan mecham and some of his 
supporters 
benson happens to be the awardwinning cartoonist for the 
arizona republic and a relentless critic of the embattled 
governor mecham happens to be arizonas first mormon governor and 
an unwavering believer in conservative church doctrine 
in arizona these days politics and religion are mixing in the 
mormon community mormon critics of mecham have been scorned by 
other mormons who say they are not true to their religion mecham 
even once told steve benson his salvation was in jeopardy because 
of the biting cartoons 
sides have been taken and swords drawn said the cartoonist 
there have been instances of shunning letters have been written 
questioning ones devotion to the church whether one has the 
moral rectitude to remain in the flock 
with the turmoil have come fears that the brouhaha will damage 
the image of mormons whose roots trace back to the settling of 
arizona 
officially the church has remained neutral on the governors 
plight some members say the only mentions of mecham from the 
pulpit have been reminders of neutrality and the strife is limited 
to a small group of mormons 
is the church worried i think not its a matter that will 
pass in the next few months said phoenix attorney dave udall a 
church leader designated as the official spokesman 
still individuals within the community say passions run deep 
some say families have been split by the issues 
ed pagan a mormon who is a history graduate student at the 
university of arizona and who criticized mecham in a letter to the 
editor called the turmoil gutwretching for church members 
in a sense his platform and ideology have the veneer of 
unofficial church position said pagan whose criticism drew 
letters questioning his own faith there are those who say if you 
criticize mecham youre ultimately criticizing god 
an unofficial church newspaper the latterday sentinel has 
supported mecham and its editor crismon lewis is a sharp critic 
of the republics benson most of the church is extremely 
disappointed in him lewis said 
one cartoon that rankled mechams mormon supporters showed an 
angel atop the mormon temple in salt lake city utah at the end of 
the angels trumpet was a banner reading resign ev 
some remember the controversy that surrounded bensons 
grandfather during eight years as agriculture secretary under 
president eisenhower 
his grandfather was attacked so much by the press that he 
offered his resignation but eisenhower kept him said lewis 
now a couple of decades later youve got the grandson doing the 
same thing 
benson says his grandfather a personal friend of mechams has 
never pressured him to back off churchrelated pressure in 
arizona he said comes from an ultraconservative sect of the 
church not the mainstream 
some individuals and its not unique to my religion 
unavoidably mix religion with politics and as a result think any 
mormon who does not agree with a fellow latterday saint who 
happens to be governor is endangering his position in the church 
benson said 
its intolerant and its silly 
and benson has support among mormons even among some who 
support the governor 
hes got his job to do said republican state rep jack 
brown who voted against mechams impeachment he can do that and 
still be a good member of the mormon church 
mecham a 63yearold native of duchesne utah was impeached 
feb 5 by the arizona house of representatives on allegations of 
concealing a 350000 campaign loan misusing 80000 from a 
special fund and attempting to thwart an investigation of an 
alleged death threat involving a state official 
trial on the impeachment is under way in the state senate if 
convicted mecham would be removed from office he also faces a 
criminal trial on the campaign loan charge march 22 and a recall 
election set for may 17 
the ultraconservative governor took office 14 months ago and 
immediately plunged himself into controversy by rescinding the 
martin luther king holiday for state workers and making statements 
that have offended women homosexuals jews and japanese 
mormons believe church leaders receive divine guidance and some 
mecham backers have suggested political leaders do as well mecham 
himself has occassionally suggested hes received guidance from god 
to shirley whitlock active in the church and state leader of a 
conservative political group called the eagle forum mormons who 
dont support mecham have lost their religion 
i feel if there are other members of the church who do not 
support the governor they either have allowed themselves to be 
propagandized or are too liberal and dont understand their own 
teachings mrs whitlock said 
if members of the church cant see this man is trying to do 
his duty then theres false belief she said if they dont 
support the governor when he supports constitutional principles 
then they better do more studying 
passions ran high in the legislature too as the impeachment 
vote neared rep brown a former mormon bishop said he received 
letters from followers who tried to intimidate him 
rep mark killian a conservative republican from mesa a 
popular mormon area and site of the churchs arizona temple broke 
into tears as he blasted the governors behavior but voted against 
the impeachment because he didnt believe the evidence was strong 
enough 
udall the arizona church spokesman said he cringes when 
mechams religion is brought into the debate 
is religion really a factor i dont think it is he said 
and wed prefer not to be getting the attention 
brown said he worries about possible damage to the church 
but i think people basically understand that you have 
different kinds of people in the church and some are not 
reflective of the whole group he said 
its a concern said wayne arnett an attorney and mormon 
there will be those who know mecham is a mormon and think less of 
me because im a mormon 
most mormons mesa bishop bob goodman said are sorry the 
church has been involved in it 
ut i cant say its hurt any of my members goodman said 
and i cant say its hurt the church the church is just too 
strong for that

i think the american people are going to be looking for 
leadership 
you know my background combat pilot serving in the united 
states congress meeting a payroll building a business ambassador 
to china ambassador to the united nations running the cia at a 
tough time and head of the republican party and seven years 
standing shoulder to shoulder as vice president with a president 
for whom i have great respect 
the presidency is different its not like congress its not 
business its not like anything else when that cable comes in a 
planes been hit or an american ships been shot at or you have to 
punish a marxist or a terrorist dictator like gadhafi or have to 
take bold action to save american citizens lives at risk in a tiny 
caribbean country its different 
i think the president took the proper steps when he learned 
about the irancontra affair 
covert action should not be run by the nsc national security 
council it should be run by the cia i am worried about the 
erosion of presidential power mistakes were made but we must 
move ahead now 
lets try to hold the highest possible standards of ethics it 
is an honorable profession public life i want men and women 
of excellence to come and serve not to profit 
i think that i would be the best for getting this budget 
deficit down with a fouryear freeze that allows for the growth 
and inflation that will hold the line on taxes but doesnt freeze 
in bad programs 
i want to keep the united states strong offering the hope of 
peace and freedom when people go into that voting booth 
theyre going to be saying who has the values that we believe in 
who has the breadth of experience the ability to get people to 
work together and who has the integrity that we trust 
the question is what do we do in the future i believe that 
i have had more real life experience than anyone else running 
against me and i am proud to have stood with this president 
through thick and through thin through good times and bad times 
without cutting and running when the going got tough

i come from a small farming town i was born and raised in the 
values that come from deep roots deep faith and an abiding love of 
country russell kan may be a long way off from atlanta on the 
map but we share a lot of the same values 
we know the importance of family of neighbors helping neighbor 
of sticking together in good times and bad i learned that 
if you worked hard and really believed you could overcome 
hardships and build a better tomorrow and if your country called 
in war or peace you served 
thats how ive always tried to live my life and thats the 
kind of president our country will need to lead us into the 21st 
century 
values and leadership thats what this crucial election is all 
about and this year the south will play a key role in 
choosing the man who will sit across the table from mr gorbachev 
 
the people must look at the record and decide which 
candidate has demonstrated the strength it takes to stand tough to 
make the hard choices to forge a consensus that will lead this 
nation forward 
which candidates leadership got president reagans tax cut 
passed 
whose leadership stopped the liberals from repealing those tax 
cuts 
whose leadership put together the plan which saved social 
security from bankruptcy 
whose leadership produced a majority of votes in the senate for 
aid to the nicaraguan freedom fighters 
whose leadership lined up the votes to keep the presidents 
strategic defense initiative alive 
and whose leadership produced the 1985 farm bill to save the 
family farm 
bob dole led each one of the battles in the us senate and we 
won no other candidate in this race can match that record no one 
thats the true test of leadership not how many jobs weve had 
but what youve done in the jobs youve held and that speaks 
volumes for what youll do as president 
theres no instant magic formula to make the deficit vanish 
but with the right leadership we can start solving the problem 
theres no miracle cure to make freedom safe in a dangerous 
world but the right leadership can do it 
theres no quick fix to make america competitive again an 
opportunity society where all our people can rise as high as their 
godgiven talents will take them but leadership can make it happen 
theres no easy way out of the plague of drug abuse the decline 
in values and education the high cost of health care and so many 
other urgent problems but they can be solved 
these are all tough challenges its going to take tough 
dedicated understanding leadership to overcome them i believe 
that i can deliver the kind of leadership we need

no public policy decision we make in the next 10 years will 
be as important as the decisions we make about defending and 
nurturing and strengthening the bedrock of western values our 
families and our children 
there is no better school no better engine of economic growth 
or job training savings and investment than the traditional 
family there is no greater moral teacher disciplinarian help for 
the weak protector of the young or builder of character than the 
family 
our democratic friends urge us to look to government as mother 
and father but they have it exactly backwards 
i believe that america needs a rebirth of respect and compassion 
for the value and the dignity and the sanctity of each and every 
child and every human life 
i have pledged that as president i will help lead america to 
its highest standards of educational excellence not by expanding 
budgets or new government programs but through reforms that stress 
the abcs of education 
a restoring accountability by granting parents greater 
oversight and greater choice b renewing stronger emphasis on 
a basic core curriculum of english science math history and 
computer and vocational skills and expecting superior levels of 
achievement to be met c building and developing character 
weve put forth a threepart plan to stop the spread of aids 
first routine testing to help identify those infected second 
confidential sharing of this information by public health 
authorities with those in danger of infection and third common 
sense education that teaches right and wrong about the sexual 
behavior that spreads aids 
we must do everything we can to find a cure we must treat aids 
victims with compassion and give them care but we must also give 
the american people confidence that we have a plan and that we will 
stop aids now not later 
our liberal friends tell us that we need activist judges 
well i agree we need activist judges who actively support the 
constitution 
we live in a democracy and it is the right and the 
responsibility of the people and their representatives to decide 
fundamental questions of public policy it is not and must never 
be the right and responsibility of judicial elites to appropriate 
that right and responsibility to themselves

if we are to recapture the greatness of america we must go back 
to our fundamental faith in god and when we train our children 
it is absolutely crucial that we teach them the moral values of our 
society little children must once again be allowed to pray in the 
schools of america 
when our ancestors came to these shores there was one thing 
that was uppermost in the minds of the people they believed in 
individual selfreliance when they went across these plains 
when they made an empire out of a wilderness when they 
fought disease and battled enemies when they endured privation 
hunger and starvation they relied on their own initiative under 
god 
and if we are going to be strong we must recognize that we as a 
people can do it ourselves government doesnt give us our freedom 
government cant take our freedom away from us it is a gift of god 
given every one of us 
we have built in this nation with 200 years of labor a 
magnificent industrial base but over the last few years of this 
decade we have seen our industries slowly crumbling some of our 
basic industries going overseas to other nations 
recently i was in one of the southern states and i learned of 
1000 factories that have closed i learned of 300000 people who 
lost their jobs and they told me about them and they said are 
you aware that imports to this country of the particular product 
they were mentioning textiles from mainland china have risen from 
230 million yards to 18 billion yards are you aware they 
told me that from january of 1986 until november of 1987 that 
imports of textiles from the soviet union had risen by 7000 
percent 
if the communist countries want to help their workers thats 
fine but i think the time has come in america when we no 
longer are going to allow our basic industries to be destroyed and 
our people put out of work in order to enhance the standard of 
living of communist china and communist russia 
recently the congress of the united states refused to vote 
military aid to assist the freedom fighters of the contras in 
nicaragua i do not think it is in the best interest of the united 
states of america to permit the soviet union to establish a land 
base in the north american continent

reaganomics isnt economic theory its theft from our children 
its a felony against the future and it has played the 
hardworking taxpaying families of middle america for fools 
were not going to get our fiscal house in order with more 
voodoo economics and were not going to meet the challenges of the 
1990s by building walls around america we tried that 60 years ago 
and it gave us the worst depression in our history 
we need more trade not less one and a quarter million southern 
workers depend on exports for their jobs they know that if were 
going to make america no 1 again weve got to do more than wave a 
fist at our foreign competitors weve got to roll up our sleeves 
go to work and beat them 
they deserve a president who knows how to balance a budget and 
mop up republican red ink and has done it a president who knows 
how to build a strong economy and has done it a president who 
has been tested in the fires of debt and deficit and hard economic 
times a president with the strength the skills and the values to 
take charge of our economic future and get our nation moving again 
 
its going to take hard workers not highrollers to get 
america moving again 
and itll take star schools not star wars to conquer the next 
american frontier 
the world is changing we must change with it or well be left 
behind we must invest in research we must invest in new ideas 
and we must turn those new ideas into new products and new jobs for 
our citizens and new markets for america 
american workers know that were not going to beat the japanese 
and our other competitors by sitting on the sidelines were not 
going to beat them by pitting group against group and region 
against region were not going to beat them by investing in a 
fantasy called star wars and were not going to beat them unless 
weve got someone in the white house who looks a little farther 
into the future than the next vote on contra aid 
there are no shortcuts to greatness for america because the 
best america does not hide it competes the best america does not 
waste it invests the best america does not leave some of its 
citizens behind it works for everyone

if americans want leadership to trim and then tend to things as 
they are they will turn to the republicans our purpose and our 
appeal as democrats has always been to serve as an instrument of 
change 
the central issue of this campaign is whether americans will 
regain control of our own destiny in recent years that control 
has been lost to foreign powers and private interests 
first we lost much of our steel industry now we are losing 
whole segments of the computer industry first we were told that 
free trade permitted our farmers to sell abroad now they are being 
locked out of the european market we devalue the dollar hoping to 
sell our goods cheaper abroad and then trade barriers still bar 
the way and the trade deficit with japan roars on 
we refuse to accept the decline of america we are tried to 
hearing from those who say it is inevitable that we cant stand 
up for america anymore and we are determined that we can and will 
reassert this nations rightful role of leadership in the world 
economy 
on the central economic issues of this campaign there is hardly 
a dimes worth of difference between governor dukakis and senator 
gore and while i may disagree with jesse jackson in a number of 
important areas let me say in fairness that he is speaking to 
fundamental questions and he surely does have something to say 
about them 
the goredukakis approach is to distract the voters from those 
fundamental questions to divert the campaign to tactics or drown 
it in generalities 
this approach is a political danger for democrats the stale and 
standard rhetoric of a careful conventional politics will never 
bring us back the voters we need for victory 
but the true danger is to the nation we can no longer afford to 
ignore the larger forces that could constrict our economy and our 
future we have to revive americas productive might 
i am not willing to see america fall behind i do not doubt the 
energy the capacity the strength or the talent of the american 
people and i am certain that if they are given the chance this 
nation can and will continue to lead the world

we want a nominee who doesnt just appeal to a collection of 
narrow interest agendas we want a nominee who speaks common sense 
to voters at the grass roots level 
and my campaign is about bringing the democratic party back to 
the grass roots level i want to put the white house back on the 
side of the average working men and women in this country 
voters have asked themselves is the democratic party 
straying from its traditions well our traditions are economic 
growth jobs prosperity social progress with a movement toward 
social justice and a strong intelligent role for this country in 
the world 
now thats the tradition of franklin roosevelt harry truman and 
john kennedy thats the approach that im taking in my 
campaign 
this is a time for fundamental change in america 
we are facing a storm on the horizon we must understand it 
clearly we must become one nation united in clearly 
recognizing that in order to compete more effectively overseas we 
have to batten down the hatches and make some major changes in this 
nation 
we have to create the best schools in the world i look at 
children in all the states around this nation where i compete 
their eyes are just as bright their minds are just as sharp as 
those of the children of any nation on the face of this earth 
are we to be satisfied that by the time children graduate from 
high school in america on average they are two full grade levels 
behind their counterparts in other nations are we going to allow 
that to continue 
its time we had a president of the united states who didnt act 
the way ronald reagan does and every time a decision comes up ask 
what is going to best for the executives in the board room 
its time we asked the democratic question whats best for 
the guy on the assembly line the guy on the farm the woman behind 
the word processor the woman behind the typewriter 
this is the challenge we know from experience that if we 
follow policies that are designed to help the person at the grass 
roots level if we consistently have the guts and fortitude and 
leadership and courage to stand by them and follow policies to 
benefit them then in the long run that is going to lift the 
prospects of the entire nation

for more than a decade ive worked with others to create ideas 
that reform our public policies and systems many of our societys 
institutions require reform but reform is a threatening notion it 
threatens longestablished arrangements among individuals and 
institutions and powerful positions that some have fought long and 
hard to win 
reform cannot be imposed from the top down especially against a 
hostile institution it must percolate from the bottom up that 
means that ordinary people must provide the fuel for change 
soldiers nurses teachers workers are the key to reform and that 
reform can only begin when people begin to think differently 
we have to think differently about our relationships with the 
soviets and how we engage them in a new and different world 
we have to think differently about how we provide better medical 
care and for whom we should provide 
we have to think differently about how we educate our young 
people and what kind of education we are providing 
we have to think differently about how we manufacture goods as 
well as what kind of products we ought to be making 
we must raise nontraditional nonconventional questions in 
this election year because the united states has been desperately 
trying to preserve an elusive status quo for 25 years while an 
often brutally contrary world prevents it 
resistance to reform and change is resistance to a new 
generation and a new way of thinking and the resistance to me and 
my candidacy is in large part a resistance to a new generational 
understanding of a world where the old arrangements and old rules 
no longer work 
but its not simply an age question its an attitudinal divide 
 
although most in this race are of the same generation there are 
real differences in outlook and attitude among the candidates 
this campaign like every other presidential campaign is 
about power who will serve in the most powerful office on earth 
but its also about who has the power to elect our national leader 
traditional politics says that party leaders pundits and 
political experts should decide who the candidates will be but 
reform politics new politics my politics say lets let the people 
decide

we gather here in this new south with new challenges every 
generation has faced the challenge of securing for all citizens 
equal protection under the law to have the umbrella of law 
broadened so when the rains do fall all are protected 
in 1960 four students in greensboro at aampt north carolina 
aampt state university jacksons alma mater went to woolworths 
lunch counter they sat in to get hamburgers they got handcuffs 
they were challenged they were arrested they chose dignity even 
over degrees they heard the call of their day 
throughout that period young america did not just rest in false 
comforts or retreat through drugs young americans led the way 
and assumed a frontline position its not enough for you to vote 
for me young americans you must register vote run for office 
win and make a difference 
things will not change automatically and inevitably they will 
change because you work to make them change you must make it 
happen 
we do have a public accommodations bill and thats progress we 
do have the right to vote and thats progress we do have open 
housing and thats progress we do have equal access to education 
and thats progress but then there is the unfinished business of 
economic justice and world peace 
let us not forget the garbage workers in memphis had civil 
rights had the right to vote when they came home from work 
they did not have enough money to pay their basic family bills the 
agenda there was economic justice for working people who did not 
want welfare didnt want workfare they wanted to get paid for 
working the agenda was economic justice they were abandoned by 
law 
now we need the law to raise the minimum wage to establish a 
national health care plan for the american people we need to 
change the law and choose head start and day care over jail care 
and welfare 
we the people must come together we must struggle to raise 
the standard of living for working people stop drugs from coming 
in stop jobs from going out 
the challenge was to make certain that no one with a sheet and a 
hood would lynch us todays challenge is not the rope its 
dope coke crack heroin pcp every gain we ever made is 
threatened by drugs 
its a copout to just say to children just say no to drugs 
children do not buy 150 billion worth of drugs children 
do not grow the drugs do not run the cartels 
the money involved in drug smuggling is corrupting whole 
governments we must stop the flow of drugs into our country 
its corrupting our society if elected i will cut the supply 
of drugs but you the people must cut the demand for drugs

we have to see that jobs are there for people good jobs 
primarily through the private sector 
one of the things we have to do is deal with those who have 
fallen through the cracks 
we have something in our society called the underclass some 
people dont like the use of the term but it is real it is there 
there is no sense fooling ourselves 
we ought to give the people an opportunity we can do better 
as a nation were not just talking statistics were talking 
about people 
were talking about the young man desperate for a job 
the man whose business has failed who asked the question does 
anyone care only he really wasnt asking a question he was 
really saying no one cares 
i want a government that cares i want a government thats going 
to fight for opportunities for our people and stand up for the 
lessfortunate 
education has to receive much greater attention one of 
things that has been happening is that there has been a substantial 
shift away from grants to loans 
now there are problems with that one of the problems is that 
sometimes two of you who have loans fall in love and decide to get 
married and that means that you have to postpone that dream of a 
family and a home 
when you postpone that dream of a home you know what happens 
among other things for the lumber industry in the state of 
washington all kinds of other things happen its also more costly 
for the federal government believe it or not than grants because 
we have to subsidize interest for a great many years and we have 
to pay for defaults 
it also distorts what people do you have to make a decision 
to handle those loans do you become an elementary school teacher 
or do you become a lawyer our society needs a great many more 
good elementary school teachers today than we need lawyers 
longterm care lets talk about your grandparents your 
parents we have to take care of them if they need longterm 
residential care no other major industrial society on the face 
of the earth doesnt take care of parents and grandparents when 
they need most any care can we do it of course we can do it

jp stevens amp co months ago a rumored 
takeover target now finds itself fielding three rival offers from 
a managementled group industry competitor west pointpepperell 
inc and an undisclosed suitor 
west pointpepperell said tuesday it had offered to pay 56 a 
share for stevens or about 867 million in a negotiated buyout 
the textile company actually had delivered its offer to stevens 
late monday 
on tuesday the jp stevens management group led by chairman 
whitney stevens said it was increasing its own outstanding 
leveraged buyout offer to 55 a share in cash and securities or 
about 850 million 
stevens also disclosed it had received a third unidentified 
offer 
stevens stock jumped 625 a share to 5450 tuesday on the new 
york stock exchange west pointpepperell was unchanged at 3050 a 
share 
the management group offered to pay 40 in cash and 15 in 
securities for each of stevens 155 million common shares 
outstanding in a leveraged buyout 
the group led by the fifth generation member of the family that 
founded stevens in 1813 initially offered on feb 8 to pay a total 
of 43 a share in cash and securities or about 6665 million 
west point said its 56 a share cash offer was not conditioned 
on the availability of financing and indicated it was considering 
the sale of certain stevens assets to avoid antitrust concerns 
stevens indicated in a news release that its outside directors 
were reviewing the revised management proposal and had authorized 
the companys financial advisers to study the two outside proposals 
jim franklin a spokesman for stevens declined to comment 
beyond the news release 
a number of industry experts had predicted higher offers would 
emerge following the management groups initial offer which widely 
was viewed as too low 
stevens is one of the nations biggest textile producers 
concentrating on home fashion textiles such as sheets towels and 
carpets under the brand names ralph lauren laura ashley and pierre 
cardin the company also makes automotive products and industrial 
fabrics 
west point based in west point ga also is a major household 
fabrics maker producing brands such a arrow martex lady 
pepperell burberrys and cabin crafts 
joseph l lanier jr chairman of west pointpepperell said an 
acquisition of stevens would be a natural step in his companys 
shift toward consumer goods and away from commodity textiles which 
have lower profit margins and suffer from intense foreign 
competition 
west pointpepperell acquired cluettpeabody amp co in 1986 as 
part of the strategy 
stevens undertook a similar strategy beginning in 1984 moving 
out of apparel fabrics and shifting its manufacturing to home 
textiles such as sheets and towels the success of that effort is 
one factor that made stevens an attractive takeover target 
thats one of the great strengths of jp stevens lanier 
said in an interview its playing to our strength as we see it 
during the quarter ended jan 30 stevens posted an aftertax 
profit of 129 million up from 119 million a year earlier 
sales rose to 38148 million from 36167 million a year earlier 
in the fiscal year ended oct 31 stevens earned 56 million on 
sales of 16 billion this compared with a profit of 537 million 
on revenue of 168 billion in 1986 
west pointpepperell reported a profit of 255 million on 
revenue of 4809 million for the fiscal first quarter which ended 
dec 26 that was up from 209 million in profit and 4227 
million in revenue during a year earlier 
stevens said the securities portion of the management groups 
offer would include 10 in market value of junior subordinated 
debentures and 5 market value of preferred stock paying a dividend 
in cash or additional shares

apollo computer inc got a key jump on its 
competitors by developing a 70000 desktop personal 
supercomputer the company says is faster than anything else in 
the market industry analysts said 
two other companies also announced new supercomputers tuesday 
marking what promises to be a period of fierce competition among 
makers of sophisticated supercomputers used by scientists and 
engineers 
this seems to be the year for the socalled personal 
supercomputer said gary p smaby who follows the industry for 
piper jaffray amp hopwood in minneapolis i think its going to be 
an interesting horse race 
apollo said it was producing a workstation for scientists and 
engineers with supercomputer power that outperforms anything in its 
price range of 69900 to 130000 
analysts said the domain series 10000 returns the chelmsford 
massbased company to the forefront of the highly competitive 
field of small powerful workstations that combine extremely rapid 
number cruching with threedimensional graphics 
we think that this definitely positions them as the 
performance leader to beat in the new graphics supercomputing 
market said david burdick an analyst with dataquest inc of san 
jose calif 
for a company that has been stuck in the saragasso sea in the 
past couple of years it is very siginificant said donald bellomy 
of international data corp in framingham mass they had been 
the industry leaders in every aspect and had fallen behind in every 
aspect 
ardent computer corp a sunnyvale califbased startup 
announced its first product tuesday a graphics supercomputer in 
about the same price and performance range as apollos 
convex computer corp of richardson texas aiming at a pricier 
segment of the market unveiled a more powerful new line of 
minisupercomputers it hopes will cut into cray research incs 
domination of that market 
another recent startup stellar computer inc of newton mass 
is expected to announce a similar graphics supercomputer in two 
weeks and analysts anticipate a halfdozen more to follow 
scientists and engineers are making pretty interesting use of 
these computers smaby said the question is how big a market 
is there for a 100000 singleuser computer 
theyre all vying for market share leadership in one niche or 
another and not all of them are going to come out with gold 
medals he said 
apollo which pioneered workstations in 1980 said at a boston 
news conference that the new model speeds up complex numerical 
computations and its fourprocessor model allows several different 
programs to run simultaneously 
ardent said its graphics supercomputer would range in price from 
79000 for a oneprocessor model to 150000 for a fourprocessor 
model that will be available later this year 
ardent founded in 1985 is run by two prominent figures in the 
computer industry allen h michels the president and chief 
executive who previously founded convergent technologies and c 
gordon bell the vice president of research engineering and 
development who did pioneering work in a 23year career at digital 
equipment corp 
but analysts agree apollos 50000 workstations and 1800 
software packages already on the market give it a competitive 
advantage the company said it will begin selling the models in the 
third quarter this year and announce improved graphics system for 
the workstation later this year 
convex computer introduced a line of six minisupercomputers

gaf corp shareholders will have the chance 
to vote on a sweetened 14 billion leveraged buyout offer from a 
group led by chairman samuel j heyman but may get competing 
offers to consider 
gafs board of directors agreed tuesday to submit the offer to 
shareholders without endorsement after the group increased its 
bid from a previous 135 billion cash and securities package 
the company also instructed its financial adviser to seek out 
other potential purchasers and left itself the option of accepting 
any competing superior offer 
the heyman group on tuesday proposed to pay 46 in cash and 
junior securities with a face value of 650 for each of gafs 277 
million outstanding common shares 
in december the heyman group offered 135 billion or 40 in 
cash and 850 in securities per share 
that offer was a downward revision from its initial 23 billion 
offer made in september of 64 in cash and 250 face value in 
debt securities heyman revised the initial proposal due to rising 
interest rates stemming from unsettled conditions in the market for 
highyield junk bonds following the october stock market crash 
in order for shareholders to vote on the latest buyout offer 
they first first vote on an amendment to the company charter the 
amendment would allow shareholders to act in place of the board in 
considering a merger offer as the heymanled proposal has been 
presented 
a special committee of the board of directors had rejected the 
initial 64ashare proposal as inadequate gaf said it had decided 
to let stockholders decide based on the favorable opinion of the 
offer by salomon brothers inc the committees financial adviser 
the committee also instructed salomon to solicit other possible 
purchasers gaf said the committee said that if it receives an 
economically superior alternative proposal for gaf it could 
cancel its agreement with the buyout group 
we think the price is a fare and full price heyman said 
its seven times the price of the stock only four years ago 
gaf also said it had reached tentative settlements of lawsuits 
brought in connection with the buyout offer 
gaf stock rose 25 cents to 5025 a share tuesday on the new 
york stock exchange 
heyman who wrested control of gaf in 1983 after a bitter proxy 
fight to oust former chairman jesse werner has said that taking 
gaf private would give the company more leeway to pursue 
acquisitions without having to worry about shortterm shareholder 
value 
since taking over gaf heyman has led the company on 
unsuccessful but profitable attempted takeovers of union carbide 
corp and borgwarner corp 
heyman owns 28 million shares of gaf or about 10 percent of 
its outstanding stock

ten years ago a monterrey company 
promoting membership at a new pacific coast resort hotel offered a 
special deal buy now and your 10year lease will be renewed at 
the same price in 1988 
but inflation and the devaluation of the peso since then have 
made the deal even more special than anyone anticipated the 
average 70000 peso price for the leases in 1978 worth the 
equivalent of 3182 back then now equals just 30 
hotel clients in this northern industrial city are complaining 
that the company is balking at renewing the timesharing leases at 
the cheaper price 
they estimate that about 1000 people throughout mexico paid an 
average of 70000 pesos in 1978 to spend one week each year at the 
luxury hotel club maeva in manzanillo in the pacific coastal state 
of colima 
the hotel is run by casolar the tourism division of the huge 
monterreybased alfa conglomerate 
alfa fell into a severe economic crisis along with the rest of 
mexico in 1982 and has seen the value of mexicos currency plunge 
from 22 pesos to the dollar in 1978 to 2350 to the dollar now 
the peso devaluation has made the 70000peso fee equal to 30 
about the price of dinner for two in a nice restaurant but clients 
here say they took the gamble a decade ago when they invested in a 
hotel complex that was under construction 
we know its very little money now but remember nothing was 
built at the time it was an enormous risk said concepcion 
rodriguez de salazar who sold herself one of the contracts 10 
years ago when she worked as a casolar sales representative 
her son monterrey lawyer jorge salazar says casolar now wants 
to charge 10 million pesos 4255 to renew the contract 
salazar is handling the complaints for about 60 hotel clients here 
the company didnt have any idea that things were going to 
turn out as they did but the people that bought there didnt 
expect the company to decide whether or not it was going to 
comply salazar said 
martha barrios of casolar said on monday and tuesday that 
officials involved in the contract dispute were in meetings or out 
of town and not available for comment 
salazar said in a telephone interview late monday that his 
clients want him to negotiate with casolar but he has been unable 
to locate company officials 
these people had to sacrifice to pay the fee 10 years ago but 
they thought theyd get 20 years of vacations salazar said 
he said the pesodollar equivalent had nothing to do with the 
written contract the renewal offer was in the contract as well as 
the companys advertising he said 
we dont earn dollars or spend dollars or do business in 
dollars he said we still have faith in what a contract says

kaisertech ltd has taken the unusual step of 
suing its own chairman of the board in an attempt to recover 
profits made from his shortterm dealings in the aluminum companys 
stock 
the suit filed tuesday against alan e clore came a day after 
the reclusive british investor agreed to sell his 27 percent stake 
in kaisertech to texas oilman charles hurwitz a move that appeared 
to irritate kaisertech officials and signaled management turbulence 
at the oakland califbased company 
clore acquired his position at kaisertech after a lengthy 
takeover struggle last year hurwitzs intentions toward kaisertech 
remain unclear 
asked if it was considered unusual that a company would sue its 
own chairman kaisertech spokesman robert w irelan said its 
the first time weve done it 
kaisertech stated that its suit filed in a manhattan federal 
court resulted from clores disclosures in a securities and 
exchange commission filing on monday about his sale of stock to a 
hurwitzcontrolled company los angelesbased maxxam group inc 
kaisertech contended the sec disclosures showed clore and his 
affiliates made about 4 million in undisclosed profits via 
socalled shortswing trading trading done within a sixmonth 
period of kaisertech stock 
under federal securities law a company or its stockholders are 
entitled to recover such profits from a director or officer who 
engages in shortswing trading 
clore who usually resides in switzerland could not be reached 
for comment on the lawsuit which was part of a rapid series of 
events concerning kaisertech stock 
in los angeles the investment firm jefferies amp co said it was 
selling 139 million shares of kaisertech stock to maxxam for 
1668 million or 12 a share 
combined with the 62 million shares acquired from clore plus 
an option to buy his 82 million convertible preferred kaisertech 
shares acquisition of jefferies stake would give maxxam about 
onethird of kaisertechs approximately 45 million shares 
outstanding 
but wall streets reaction indicated skepticism about a possible 
takeover move in composite new york stock exchange trading 
kaisertech fell 12 cents a share to 1175 after rising 112 in 
the previous session 
kaisertech had stated monday it would have preferred that clore 
had sold his stock to a broader range of investors reflecting 
concern about what maxxam intended to do with its stake maxxam 
officials said it was premature to speculate on whether the comapny 
would attempt to acquire more kaisertech shares 
clores maneuvering to sell his kaisertech shares came against a 
background of heavy pressure on him to cut losses suffered in the 
october stock market crash 
if clore hadnt found a buyer by a monday deadline he could 
have faced default on loans he had obtained by using kaiser stock 
as collateral after the stock plunged in october lenders wanted 
repayment 
his sale of stock came as the company was rebounding from six 
straight years of losses kaiser has sold its chemical oil and gas 
businesses slashed debt and concentrated on its core aluminum 
business

the lorillard inc tobacco company sought to 
downplay discounts that its insurance company affiliate was 
considering offering to nonsmokers several years ago according to 
evidence in a lawsuit against three cigarette makers 
the contention was made tuesday as a federal jury heard 
testimony and read documents that allegedly show the tobacco 
industry sought to suppress information on the health dangers of 
smoking 
the suit filed by antonio cipollone of lakehurst claims 
lorillard philip morris co and liggett group inc are liable for 
the lung cancer death of his wife rose a 40year smoker 
cipollone alleges the companies failed to do enough research on 
cigarettes did not reveal what they did know failed to warn the 
public of health dangers and did not put a safer product on the 
market 
one document released tuesday dated march 3 1980 was written 
by chicagobased cna insurance co officials and discussed a 
recommendation for nonsmoker discounts according to marc z 
edell cipollones attorney 
at the time cna was owned by loews theatres inc which also 
owned lorillard loews has since sold the tobacco company 
it is recognized that the introduction of nonsmokers discount 
could prove embarrassing to loews and lorillard the memo 
stated in order to minimize the potential for embarrassment it 
suggested that cna and lorillard jointly prepare a carefully 
constructed statement saying the discount in no way supports or 
refutes the contention that smoking causes health defects 
cna should further refrain from advertising or otherwise 
promoting nonsmoker discounts it continued 
the issue also was discussed in a letter dated nov 5 1979 
from lorillard senior vice president and general counsel arthur j 
stevens to cna chairman edward j noha 
stevens wrote that when the cigarette manufacturing trade group 
the tobacco insitute heard of allstate insurance cos plan to 
offer a nonsmoker discount the institute sought help from cna in 
an effort to perhaps dissuade allstate from that course of action 
by supplying background data 
lorillard spokesman chuck wall said lorillard and the institute 
did nothing improper but merely were trying to counteract 
anticigarette propaganda 
according to another document released tuesday a tobacco 
institute official stated in 1972 that the industrys defense 
against cigarette critics included creating doubt about the 
health charge without actually denying it 
the internal memorandum describes the three major fronts 
litigation politics and public opinion where the tobacco 
companies had fought to defend itself 
the brilliantly conceived and executed strategy used in all 
three areas helped win important battles said the memo 
however it is only fair to say that it is not nor was it 
intended to be a vehicle for victory said the may 1 1972 memo 
from fred panzer to horace r kornegay president of the tobacco 
institute 
wall identified panzer as an institute vice president 
the document says the industry had followed a holding 
strategy consisting of 
creating doubt about the health charge without actually denying 
it 
advocating the publics right to smoke without actually urging 
them to take up the practice 
encouraging objective scientific research as the only way to 
resolve the question of health hazard

general motors corps plasticbody 
midengine pontiac fiero and the workers who make it have become 
the first victims of slumping popularity for sporty twoseaters 
michael losh pontiacs general manager said tuesday gm will 
stop making the fiero after the 1988 model and will close 
indefinitely the single fiero plant here sometime this summer 
idling 1109 workers 
the whole markets dead said industry analyst chris 
cedergren of jd power and associates blaming high insurance 
rates for a 30 percent drop in overall twoseater sales during 1987 
the slump has not spared japanese automakers who report slow 
sales of cars such as the sporty toyota mr2 and the mazda rx7 or 
europeans whose victims include fourcylinder porsches 
in addition to flagging sales fiero had suffered problems that 
included frequent engine fires which prompted gm to recall the 
entire 1984 mode production run late last year but losh and 
cedergren suggested the market killed the fiero 
we have seen a switch away from the high volumes of people who 
were willing to buy twoseat cars with limited luggage capacity 
losh said we led the world into this market segment and we may 
lead a piece of the world out of it 
fiero sales peaked at 101720 cars in 1984 and fell to 47156 in 
1987 sales for the 1988 model year which began oct 1 are less 
than 10000 41 below the same point in the 1987 model year 
but before it died losh said the fiero helped create a new 
performanceoriented image for pontiac he refused to speculate on 
whether the fiero plant might reopen to build a new pontiac or gm 
product 
union and city officials said they were surprised by the fiero 
decision despite the cars poor sales when the fiero is gone no 
pontiacs will be built in pontiac 
uaw local 653 president harold cox said his plant was one of the 
first at gm to accept japanesestyle team organization of workers 
under a contract that allowed the previously closed plant to reopen 
in 1983 to make the fiero 
were going to continue to try to persuade general motors to 
try to put something in there cox said its a slap in our 
face that they rewarded us this way 
gm already has closed a foundry another car assembly plant a 
heavyduty truck plant and a bus plant in pontiac and had cut 
production at the fiero plant several times putting more than 
1200 other fiero workers on layoff 
dealers said they also were surprised by the announcement and 
some expressed disappointment 
we dont have anything else in my opinion that would fit in 
that category said buzz sawyers owner of sawyers pontiac in 
lansing its like a cheap corvette 
pontiac spokesman reginald harris said gm will make sure parts 
are available for the fiero into the future 
gms contract with the united auto workers union forbids 
permanent plant closings that were not announced before the 
contract was signed last fall but permits laying off workers if 
sales slow 
the fiero plant is the third gm has decided to idle since then 
the first in framingham mass will return to production in may 
the second in kansas city mo will shut down april 15 idling 
1600 workers

the teamsters union is urging northwest 
airlines 6700 flight attendants to use whatever measures they can 
to slow their performance without breaking the law or company rules 
at this time we want to keep the company confused and very 
busy said a recorded message that answered a union telephone 
tuesday 
the recording urged tactics that included filing paperwork on 
each piece of broken equipment at each stop during a flight and 
slowing down everyday procedures the flight attendants have learned 
to shorten 
what theyre doing is not against regulations said jeff 
musto a spokesman for teamsters local 2747 its just following 
the rules 
the flight attendants who are working without a contract 
threatened to strike at 1101 pm last friday but no job actions 
have been taken against the company said william wren a northwest 
spokesman 
talks broke off at dawn saturday and no further negotiations 
were scheduled spokesmen for both sides said 
terry erskine northwests vice president for law and labor 
relations said monday an unusually high number of flight 
attendants called in sick over the weekend but he attributed the 
absences to attendants fears they would be stranded by a strike 
not to orders from the union 
were winding down operations here today letting the dust 
settle for the time being said musto theres still a 
possibility of a strike and were free to strike at any time 
musto added 
the main stumbling block to a new contract is a company proposal 
to delay the promotion of bscale workers to the higherpaid 
ascale bracket musto and wren said 
all northwest flight attendants were paid under one scale before 
a 1982 contract created the bscale musto said while all 
employees hired since then have started as bscale employees at 
rates of pay lower than the old system 
the 1982 contract called for bscale employees to jump to 
ascale levels in their sixth year of employment but the current 
company proposal would extend that wait until the ninth year of 
employment musto said 
such an extension would mean a loss off 16776 over the three 
years for the average bscale flight attendant musto said

a new jersey company is offering to inoculate 
computers against viruses or rogue programs that are designed 
to spread from computer to computer and damage data the computers 
store 
the viralarm system was announced tuesday by officials of 
lasertrieve inc of metuchen nj during a microsoft corp 
conference on a datastorage device known as cdrom short for 
compact disk readonly memory 
a statement issued by lasertrieve said that although the newer 
cdrom disks are impervious to corruption because information on 
them cannot be altered many computer users are concerned about 
protecting programs on hard disks or on conventional floppy 
diskettes 
viruses are creating a growing fear among computer owners and 
users authorities in israel recently announced the detection of a 
virus that if left to spread unchecked could have wiped out 
memory banks and disabled computers throughout the country on a 
given date 
previous antiviral programs only drew attention to changes 
noted the size of a program or monitored the dates of program 
changes and all were easily fooled by sophisticated viruses 
the statement said 
viralarm consists of a special program to protect another 
program creating a software barrier 
before anyone can use the protected program viralarm checks to 
determine whether the program has been altered since it was 
inoculated if there has been any change viralarm then blocks use 
of the altered program notifies the user and suggests a backup 
copy of the program be substituted 
the protection is available for individual personal computers 
and works for most of the operating systems now available the 
lasertrieve statement said

sales of new homes plunged 9 percent in 
january pushing the level of sales activity to its lowest point 
since the end of the last recession the government reported today 
the commerce department said that sales dropped to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 535000 units it was the third consecutive 
monthly decline and left sales 26 percent below where they were a 
year ago 
the january decline followed decreases of 68 percent in 
december and 34 percent in november as the housing industry 
continued to be the sector of the economy that has been hardest hit 
since the october collapse of stock prices 
consumers worried about the future following the record 
508point drop in stock prices stopped looking for new homes 
analysts believe 
housing is often the economic sector which turns down first 
before the start of a new recession but despite the weakness in 
recent months many economists remain hopeful that recent declines 
in mortgage rates will spur a rebound in sales and construction in 
the months ahead 
if the rebound doesnt occur then concerns about a possible 
recession this year could increase 
in another weak economic report the government said today that 
orders to us factories for manufactured goods fell 06 percent in 
january the first decline since a 14 percent drop last august 
however analysts said the january setback was not as weak as it 
appeared because it mainly reflected a huge swing in orders for 
aircraft which had helped push factory orders up 2 percent in 
december 
the 9 percent decline in new home sales in january was the 
steppest decline since a 109 percent drop last may it left sales 
at the lowest annual rate since december 1982 when the last 
recession was ending 
the big sales decline was accompanied by a sharp rise in prices 
with the median or midpoint price of a home climbing 97 percent 
to 120000 
the average price of a home rose to 149000 up 105 percent 
from december economists said such a big price surge is not 
uncommon during a period of falling sales because fewer but 
higherpriced homes skew the averages 
the sales decline was led by a 244 percent drop in sales in the 
south sales were down 137 percent in the midwest sales actually 
rose 23 percent in the northeast a rebound from a 529 percent 
drop the month before sales were up 06 percent in the west

january newhome sales hit the lowest point since the last 
recession and factory orders fell for the first time in four 
months the government said today in reports suggesting the economy 
weakened after the october stock crash 
the commerce department said sales of new homes plunged 9 
percent in january to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 535000 
units the third straight monthly decline that left sales 26 
percent below yearearlier levels 
the report reflected a significant downturn in the housing 
industry the area of the economy believed hardest hit since the 
collapse in stock prices five months ago analysts believe many 
homebuyers stopped looking after the collapse fearing economic 
uncertainty in months ahead 
housing is often the economic sector that declines first before 
the start of a new recession despite the weakness however many 
economists remain hopeful that recent declines in mortgage rates 
will spur a sales rebound 
the commerce department also said orders to us factories fell 
06 percent in january the first decline since a 14 percent drop 
last august and another possible sign of postcrash economic 
weakness 
but some analysts said the report was misleading because it 
reflected a huge swing in aircraft orders which helped push 
factory orders up 2 percent in december 
discounting the aircraft element factory orders would have 
risen 08 percent in january reflecting a higher demand for 
american manufactured goods caused partly by the weaker dollar 
which makes them more affordable abroad 
the reports today appeared to have no dampening effect on 
domestic financial markets where early stock and bond prices rose 
on tuesday the markets wandered aimlessly after the release of 
other economic statistics that gave no clear signals 
the commerce department said its chief barometer of future 
economic activity fell in january although an upward revision of 
decembers figure eased fears that the nation was headed for a 
recession 
the department also said construction spending fell an 
unexpected 29 percent in january the biggest decline in 10 
months evidence of weakness in all sectors of the building 
industry 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 116 points 
to 207046 slipping from the postoct 19 market crash high it 
had reached on monday it was equally quiet in the credit markets 
with the yield on the treasurys bellwether 30year bond edging up 
to 835 percent from mondays 834 percent

is a frog livestock people wouldnt leap to that 
conclusion a farmerlawmaker suggested wednesday arguing that 
frog farmers need tax protection 
farms for frogs should be exempt from local property taxes just 
as are any premises used for any livestock conservative 
michael colvin told a house of commons committee studying a local 
finance bill 
according to the bill livestock is defined as any mammal or 
bird kept for the production of food or wool or for the purpose of 
its use in the farming of land all other farm premises are also 
exempt from the taxes 
fine but where does the frog an amphibian fit in asked 
colvin who said his acquaintance with a frog farmer prompted him 
to raise the point 
the definition of livestock is most unclear times have 
changed in agriculture he said suggesting that the bill 
substitute creatures for livestock 
it would be a sad day if any government started imposing a tax 
on frogs said colvin 
local government minister michael howard pointed out that words 
arent everything under law after all he said snails are 
covered by the exemption for fish farms

customers who pay hundreds of dollars on 
fine china expect perfect curlicues flawless border lines and 
unblemished garlands 
perfection can be achieved electronically on a computer screen 
but thats not good enough for the designers at lenox 
in an era in which computers influence the shape of cars lay 
out balanced newspaper pages and even make a superstar out of max 
headroom lenox still has oldfashioned ideas about its designs 
every line squiggle or tiny dot in the prototype design is 
laboriously drawn by hand after weeks of research 
we start with a strategist who analyzes the marketplace 
said thomas r mcinerney lenoxs vice president of marketing 
some recent new designs for instance have been focused toward 
young cosmopolitan consumers who are less traditional a bit more 
urban he said 
once a direction has been established we draw up a design 
brief and the design department then takes that direction 
at lenox a design team of 17 people sits down to brainstorm 
eventually it comes down to a designer at a drawing board a blank 
circle waiting to be embellished 
lenox will not reveal the names of its designers for 
competitive reasons said lenox spokesman peter cheyney 
but the director of the design department explains some facts 
such as a source of inspiration 
we have a large library with books on architectural style 
furnishings fabrics he said we have color services who are 
constantly bringing us up to date with predictions for this 
seasons hot colors 
computers he said are not for us here a computer could be 
used to help with color separations or to work out the permutations 
of design but its more of a graphic tool 
lenox designs are done all by hand the design director 
said in some instances a computer can help with key outlines 
but it really comes down to the eye a computer will never 
substitute for a person here 
every few weeks the design team produces 30 to 60 patterns that 
are testmarketed of that group about six are selected for 
production 
the design team works closely with lenoxs sculptors to ensure 
that the design will fit on a plate 
the design is also checked with the factory to see if were 
doing something manufacturable the design director said 
lenox china is a division of lenox inc which is a subsidiary 
of the brownforman corp of louisville ky sales figures for 
lenox china products are included in the companys overall home 
furnishings report which also comprises lenox crystal products 
figurines and specialty products not all of which are produced in 
the united states 
the home furnishings category listed 1987 sales of 1942 
million compared to 1739 million in 1986 
in a year lenox will introduce about 60 new patterns once a 
design is approved it moves to lenoxs massive factory about 10 
miles outside of atlantic city where it is printed on decals and 
applied by hand 
the assembly line for the decal application process consists of 
all women who make small talk as they work 
for some reason guys dont like to do this tedious work 
said dorothy hickey in her 33 years with lenox she has risen to a 
spot of such seniority that she is entrusted with decorating first 
lady nancy reagans presidential china and giftware 
on a wet plate that already has been fired twice the women 
center the designs and smooth out air bubbles 
sometimes it still has a tendency to slide especially on the 
curvature of the plate said anna pinkney carefully positioning 
tiny flowers scattered across the china 
several feet away the process of applying gold and platinum 
borders is so exacting that workers are allowed to get up and 
stretch frequently 
it requires steady hands and steady nerves said a 23year 
lenox veteran henry wise as he spun a wheel to draw the gold off 
the brush and onto the china 
mrs hickey is especially proud of lenoxs design selections 
she keeps volumes of every design that lenox has produced from the 
popular autumn pattern that features tiny handpainted fruits 
to the more current presidential line monroe buchanan and 
mckinley 
after seeing hundreds of patterns mrs hickey laughs when asked 
if she has a favorite 
do you want to know what i picked for my own china i have the 
plain solitaire she said i just couldnt make up my mind what 
i wanted

eastman kodak co says it has sold 11 
billion of 10year notes making it the largest investmentgrade 
corporate debt issue in the united states 
the previous record was held by occidental petroleum co which 
issued 1 billion worth of investmentgrade debentures two years 
ago according to morgan stanley amp co kodaks underwriters 
kodak said it had planned to sell 750 million worth of bonds 
but demand was so great the amount was increased to the record 
level 
the 10year bonds were priced at par and carry an interest rate 
of 9125 percent the issue will be used to either retire about 1 
billion of shortterm loans or help finance the companys recent 
51 billion acquisition of sterling drug inc kodak said 
kodak has traditionally tried to stay out of the credit markets 
in 1981 the company had borrowed less than 100 million but its 
current debt totals 33 billion with much of that increase coming 
in the last two years

delvalle fired military strongman manuel antonio noriega last 
thursday but the defense chief ignored the order and rallied his 
allies in the national assembly against the president on friday 
the assembly voted to oust delvalle and installed education 
minister manuel solis palma in his place 
noriega has been indicted on drug smuggling charges by two 
florida grand juries and has been under heavy diplomatic economic 
and political pressure by the reagan administration to step aside 
and open the way for civilianled constitutional rule 
among the banks listed by rogers which would be affected by the 
order are marine midland na irving trust co bankers trust co 
and the republic national bank he said all have headquarters in 
new york 
every dime we can find is in those banks rogers said he 
added that any bank which ignores the order could be liable for 
whatever payments it makes to the current panamanian government 
the coalition of opposition leaders believes that the panamanian 
government is facing a grave cash flow problem and is extremely 
vulnerable to economic pressure from the united states 
unlike other countries panama cannot cover its cash shortages 
by printing new money because the dollar is the national currency 
sosa said international opposition to the new government was 
evident earlier this week when he claimed only eight ambassadors 
showed up for a state of the union address from the western 
hemisphere he said only cuba and nicaragua attended

lawyers for the ousted president of panama eric 
arturo delvalle sued in federal court today to block a new york 
bank from turning over millions of dollars to military strongman 
gen manuel noriega 
a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order blocking 
the republic national bank of new york from transferring an 
estimated 10 million 
a hearing on the matter is slated for monday before us 
district judge lloyd f mcmahon 
the lawsuit filed at federal court in manhattan by lawyers from 
washington seeks to establish title to the funds held in the 
republic national bank account and to prevent their transfer into 
the hands of a military dictatorship which has attempted to 
seize power and overthrow the lawful authorities of the republic of 
panama according to court papers 
noriega the military leader of panama was indicted on drug 
charges by two us grand juries in florida feb 4 
devalle sought to dismiss noriega feb 25 but was himself 
ousted by the national assembly the next day and has gone into 
hiding 
on tuesday devalle froze all panamanian assets outside the 
country and the united states which still recognizes devalle as 
the legitimate head of panama has supported the action

thousands of farmers wrestling with massive 
debts or being forced out of business may get another chance under 
new loan rules being drawn up by the federal farmers home 
administration the agriculture department agency said today 
joe oneill an fmha spokesman said the new rules probably will 
be ready by june in many cases overburdened borrowers could have 
much of their debt written off trimmed back to reflect their 
assets in hopes of keeping them in business 
however oneill said he had no estimate of how much debt the 
fmha might write off under the new rules 
theres just no way of knowing oneill said itll be 
each individual case all the way through 
at the end of last fiscal year on sept 30 he said 261291 
fmha borrowers owed the agency about 26 billion of that 127671 
were delinquent owing 66 billion including principal and 
interest 
new rules governing how the agency deals with farmers who owe it 
money could help prevent 100000 farms from going under the new 
york times reported today quoting fmha officials in washington 
agency officials also said thousands of farmers who went bankrupt 
over the past 10 years could find themselves back in operation 
the new rules are a result of a bill passed by congress in 
december calling on the fmha an agency that serves as a lender 
of last resort for the nations farmers to go easier on farmers 
who are behind in their payments 
the new law requires the agency to do whatever possible to 
restructure loans in order to keep fmha borrowers in business 
our attitude is going to be different said fmha 
administrator vance l clark we want to make the new act work 
and were going to have a lot of room to maneuver to restructure 
these loans 
lynn hayes an attorney with the farmers legal action group in 
st paul minn said im thrilled they are apparently taking 
this legislation seriously and are trying to make it work 
the new regulations would enable debtburdened farmers to stay 
in business through a number of loan restructuring options 
according to agency officials farmers would be offered the 
opportunity to pay off loans at a lower rate of interest over a 
longer period of time 
as a last resort the agency could write off debts in excess of 
a borrowers assets oneill said for example if a farmers 
assets were 150000 and debts totaled 500000 the writeoff 
could be as much as 350000 if the fmha determined the farmer 
could handle the remainder by staying in business 
it makes sense then to keep that person in business and 
write off the difference between what they owe and their assets 
if the government stands a chance of retrieving more by keeping 
that farmer going oneill said

members of the senate banking committee failed 
to unravel a tangled threeway dispute this morning that has 
blocked legislation to repeal the depressionera law separating 
commercial banking and the securities industry 
committee members after meeting more than two hours behind 
closed doors on tuesday struck a tentative deal that balanced the 
interests of banks securities firms and insurance companies 
according to senate aides who spoke on condition of anonymity but 
the agreement fell apart almost immediately 
the compromise would have given bank holding companies more 
securities powers but restricted their ability to expand into 
insurance the aides said however it fell apart when senators on 
opposite sides of the insurance issue realized they had a different 
understanding of the agreement the aides said 
sen william proxmire dwis the committee chairman called 
another negotiating session for later in the day an aide said the 
nature of the restriction on banks ability to enter the insurance 
business remained the sticking point in the talks 
legislation sponsored by proxmire and sen jake garn of utah 
the committees senior republican would repeal the 1933 
glasssteagall act which forbids commercial banks from 
underwriting and selling most securities it was passed in the wake 
of the 1929 stock market crash to preserve the safety of the 
banking system 
affiliates of bank holding companies would be allowed 
immediately to begin underwriting mortgagebacked securities 
commercial paper municipal revenue bonds and securities backed by 
consumer loans 
power to underwrite corporate debt would be postponed until jan 
1 and corporate stock underwriting by bank affiliates would begin 
in 1990 
sen donald w riegle jr dmich chairman of the securities 
subcommittee was advocating more restrictive legislation that 
would have required separate congressional votes in 1989 1990 and 
1991 before bank affiliates could underwrite corporate bonds 
stocks and mutual funds 
the tentative compromise according to the aides would have 
automatically phased in power over corporate bonds and mutual funds 
and required a separate vote in the future only on stock 
underwriting 
sen christopher dodd a democrat from connecticut where 
insurance companies are important employers was pushing an 
amendment that would prohibit statechartered banks owned by 
holding companies from further expansion into insurance 
opposition from banks to dodds amendment if passed could kill 
the entire bill aides said but some senators were reluctant to 
vote against the amendment for fear of retaliation from insurance 
interests within their states 
one version of the compromise on insurance as described by the 
aides would have allowed a state to permit its banks to underwrite 
insurance within the state even if the holding company that owned 
the bank was headquartered out of state however banks would not 
be allowed to locate in a state with permissive laws and then 
export insurance to other states 
a second more restrictive version of the compromise would 
require both the bank and its parent company to be located within a 
state before state officials could allow the bank to underwrite 
insurance 
proxmire and garn opened the allday session tuesday with a plea 
to fellow senators to ignore pressure from special interest 
lobbyists 
we are not here to merely broker a compromise between the 
various providers of financial services proxmire said 
garn looking at a hearing room packed with lobbyists said 
its time to forget all of you and your special interests and 
your greed 
the proxmiregarn bill has been endorsed by the heads of all the 
relevant regulatory agencies and by president reagan but it faces 
substantial hurdles even beyond the senate committee before it can 
be enacted 
reps john dingell dmich and fernand j st germain dri 
who will have jurisdiction over the issue in the house have 
expressed considerable reluctance about broadening bank powers too 
much

first republicbank dallas lost more than 8 percent 
of its deposits as customers withdrew 599 million in one week last 
month amid speculation about the financial health of its parent 
company regulators said 
the dallas bank is the lead institution of first republicbank 
corp whose officials said the situation subsequently appeared to 
be stabilizing 
the bank held average total deposits of 687 billion during the 
sevenday period ended feb 24 down 87 percent from 747 billion 
the previous week and down 15 billion from the period including 
dec 31 1987 
gerald fronterhouse chairman and chief executive of first 
republic said the oneweek outflow of deposits at the dallas bank 
was unusual but added that the banks funding situation 
appeared to be stabilizing 
during the week covered in the report by the federal reserve 
bank of dallas the bank holding company was the subject of 
published reports that takeover or bailout negotiations were under 
way and that its lead institution had suffered deposit outflows 
a 55member team supervised by the office of the comptroller of 
the currency began auditing first republicbank which lost 6568 
million in 1987 and finished the year with 392 billion worth of 
problem assets bank officials later denied that the negotiations 
were taking place 
fronterhouse said the dallas banks recent deposit loss 
reflects mainly the impact of earlier false rumors and extensive 
adverse publicity 
by the middle of last week the sources of funds for the 
dallas bank and for the corporation as a whole appeared to be 
stabilizing fronterhouse said

manufacturers of american auto parts are 
huddling with executives of 11 japanese car companies in an effort 
to whittle away at a 6 billion trade deficit between the two 
countries in the auto parts industry 
executives of the new jerseybased motor and equipment 
manufacturers association say the current meetings are 
unprecedented and offer an opportunity to cut the massive trade 
deficit between the two countries 
the meetings are being held wednesday and thursday between 
members of the us group and purchasing agents of companies 
belonging to the japanese automobile manufacturers association 
the meetings are aimed at putting more americanmade replacement 
parts under the hoods of japanese cars according to william a 
raftery president of the auto parts organization 
we believe the japanese recognize the seriousness of the 
situation and are prepared to do something about it raftery said 
between meetings wednesday 
japanese auto parts companies are shipping 5 billion a year in 
parts to the united states raftery said some of the parts go to 
us car companies others are destined for japanese cars that are 
sold in the united states or to japanese companies producing cars 
in the united states 
the japanese are buying more us auto parts now that they are 
setting up factories here but they are not purchasing nearly 
enough us parts raftery said the problem is that the 
japanese have been encouraging japanese suppliers to follow them to 
the us and open plants here that doesnt provide new jobs and 
it takes away us jobs 
when a foreign manufacturer opens a plant in the united 
states whether the company is japanese german or whatever they 
hire far fewer people than a similar american company raftery 
said 
when a foreign company builds a plant in the united states they 
import more of their parts and tend to be in the assembly business 
rather than the manufacturing business he said 
if the japanese are going to sell their cars in the united 
states and take advantage of the new car market in america they 
should give the us manufacturer the opportunity to provide parts 
for some of those vehicles as long as were price competitive 
he said 
only a very small percentage of japanese cars use americanmade 
parts while us companies are using japanese parts korean parts 
and taiwanese parts he said 
the japanese are buying a few hundred million dollars in 
auto parts from us companies while exporting billions of dollars 
in their own auto parts to america he said 
he said the japanese association is cooperating fully and has 
been extremely helpful in bringing these negotiations about

once a darling of the runninggear boom 
moss brown amp co stumbled on its way to becoming a 100 
millionayear business in the nations capital 
now its founder is starting over in a storefront 80 miles 
northwest of yellowstone national park 
the grain elevators and muddy pickup trucks in this tiny farming 
community are a far cry from the pricey georgetown section of 
washington dc where henry barksdales moss brown amp co built a 
reputation as a rising star of the running and outdoor clothing 
mailorder business 
in the heady days of 1984 barksdale was pictured on the cover 
of the washington post magazine and moss brown was named to inc 
magazines list of the 500 fastest growing companies in america 
but barksdales boom went bust in washington the victim some 
said of trying to run too fast and after working through a 
chapter 11 bankruptcy court reorganization his enterprise has 
emerged with a new name and a relatively clean slate 
as far as i know of everyone has been taken care of 
barksdale says of the customers who filed claims against moss brown 
for undelivered merchandise 
barksdales new firm appropriately called runwest inc has 
acquired the moss brown trademark but the company is a much 
smaller and perhaps less ambitious version of the original 
back in washington barksdale thought nothing of firing off 12 
million catalogs and churning out goretex running suits by the 
tens of thousands 
today in belgrade employees take a more leisurely pace 
quietly stuffing garments into mailing envelopes by hand while 
listening to music on a radio 
i feel really welcome here the 59yearold barksdale told 
the bozeman mont daily chronicle in a recent interview 
everybody is so open its sort of like when i was a kid growing 
up in st louis id forgotten that people were really like that 
while describing banks in washington as basically just 
computers barksdale says the vice president of valley bank of 
belgrade walked over and introduced himself the day barksdale moved 
in 
thats a different experience than youd have back in dc 
he said 
with 8 million in sales in 1984 moss brown was being hailed as 
the ll bean of the running set 
if we were doing 15 million a year in sales id probably 
still be there barksdale said but im not sure id be happy 
what happened to him in washington is a classic case of reaching 
too far too fast 
we made good money until 1983 when moss brown earned 
200000 in profits barksdale said then i decided to turn it 
into a big company 
from mailing orders in the back of his georgetown retail store 
barksdale moved the mailorder business into a 40000squarefoot 
warehouse in suburban alexandria va and he expanded the mailing 
list achieving those 10 million to 12 million mailings a year by 
purchasing or renting costly mailing lists from other firms 
these expansion moves added huge costs to the business without 
adding enough revenues to pay for them at a time when the running 
boom was beginning to fade 
we added customers faster than we were able to generate 
merchandise barksdale admits 
don chilcutt of direct media an edmond okla broker of 
mailing lists for mailorder companies agrees with that sober 
assessment 
barksdale was prospecting for new customers by leasing or 
buying millions of new names to add to his mailing list chilcutt 
said but his known buyers couldnt support the expansion 
you cant support a 10 million mailing with only 123000 
customers chilcutt said 
last march moss brown filed for bankruptcy protection having 
piled up 215 million in debts 17 million of it unsecured 
mark holmstrup an investigator at the city of alexandrias 
office of consumer affairs says his office received some 150 
complaints from customers of moss brown most coming at the end of 
1986 and in early 1987 
customers complained moss brown never sent the merchandise they 
ordered even though the company billed customers credit cards or 
cashed customers checks holmstrup says 
after mailing new catalogs to customers and offering credits to 
those who filed complaints barksdale contends his debts have been 
settled and he says he gets letters daily from people saying they 
are glad hes back in business 
but this time barksdale says hell be satisfied with being 
small in beautiful montana asked about his goal for the fledgling 
reorganized company he says hed like to see sales of 1 million a 
year by 1989 
i dont want to get that big anymore he said we made a 
lot of money and had a lot of fun but my wife would kill me if i 
make the business even as big as 5 million again

sears roebuck amp co said wednesday it was 
beginning a threeyear overhaul of its flagship merchandise group 
to make each segment of its retail business more competitive 
the restructuring which will trim an asyet undertermined 
number of people from the merchandise groups management will make 
sears stores more responsive to customer needs and wants officials 
said 
the apparel business will be run differently from the hardware 
business said spokesman philo holland you need different 
organizational structures to compete in different businesses 
michael bozic chairman and chief executive officer of the 
merchandising group said in a statement that the restructuring 
would reduce the number of management levels making each segment 
of sears merchandise business leaner and more independent 
we are competing in many diverse businesses each with its own 
unique structure and we have been essentially using one 
organizational format to compete in all of these businesses 
bozic said 
the changes we make will result in a company that is better 
structured to maintain its position as americas premier retailer 
officials said they had no estimate of the number of employees 
to be affected or the cost savings involved because they were only 
beginning the restructuring procss 
the ultimate size and structure will be determined by how we 
choose to compete in the different businesses we are 
restructuring holland said 
he said the reduction in management personnel would be achieved 
through attrition and a severance offer of two weeks salary for 
each year of service up to a maximum of 52 weeks 
employees at least 50 years old who have been with the company 
at least 10 years will also be offered early retirement benefits 
holland said 
the reorganization is widely seen as an attempt to revive 
sluggish sales and profits within the merchandise group which 
accounts for nearly 60 percent of the companys revenues

bond prices rose modestly in light trading 
wednesday as the government provided more evidence of economic 
sluggishness 
the treasurys key 30year bond rose point or about 375 for 
every 1000 in face value as its yield slipped to 831 percent 
from 835 percent late tuesday 
trading has been very light this week and analysts ascribe that 
to consternation about whether the economy is headed into a 
recession or simply slowing down 
william sullivan director of money market research at dean 
witter reynolds inc said the bond market was marking time 
until fridays scheduled release of february employment figures 
the employment figures are usually the first economic statistics 
released for any given month and they provide the most recent 
evidence available on general economic activity 
sullivan said one factor contributing to the mild bond price 
rise on wednesday was a new commerce department report that said 
sales of new homes fell 9 percent in january 
the report showed surprising weakness for the third month in 
row sullivan said 
a slowgrowing economy is generally viewed positively by bond 
traders because it usually means credit demand will be weak 
allowing room for interest rates to fall 
in another report the government said orders to us factories 
for manufactured goods fell 06 percent in january the first 
decline since august 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
governments rose 232 point intermediate maturities rose point 
and 20year issues rose 1132 point the financial information 
service telerate inc reported 
the movement of a point equals a change of 10 in the price of a 
bond with a 1000 face value 
the merrill lynch daily treasury index which measures price 
movements on all outstanding treasury issues with maturities of a 
year or longer rose 014 to 11393 the shearson lehman daily 
treasury bond index which makes a similar measurement rose 182 
to 119220 
among corporate bonds industrials and utilities rose point in 
light trading the investment firm salomon brothers inc said 
moodys investment grade corporate bond index which measures 
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years 
or longer rose 042 to 28613 
yields on threemonth treasury bills fell 2 basis points to 560 
percent a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point 
sixmonth bills fell 6 basis points to 585 percent and year bills 
fell 2 basis points to 616 percent 
the federal funds rate the interest on overnight loans between 
banks traded at 6 percent down from 6 percent late tuesday

the dollar strengthened in foreign exchange 
trading wednesday especially against the japanese yen partly 
because of a rumor that the reagan administration would tolerate a 
higher value for the us currency 
gold prices were narrowly mixed as of 4 pm est republic 
national bank of new york quoted bullion at 43025 a troy ounce 
down 20 cents from the price quoted late tuesday 
dealers attributed much of the dollars strength to a rumor that 
an unidentified senior us official had told japanese reporters 
the united states would allow the dollar to move higher following 
its protracted decline 
although this story was denied later many traders scrambled to 
buy the us currency causing it to rise in the most active 
trading of the week against most key currencies except the canadian 
dollar 
it was a bit more energetic today said albert soria vice 
president and foreign exchange manager of the swiss bank corps 
new york branch 
nevertheless he said the relatively narrow trading ranges for 
the dollar vs other currencies that have emerged recently would 
persist for awhile i dont see any breakout one way or the 
other soria said 
many foreignexchange dealers were focusing on the release later 
this month of us foreign trade figures for january to gain more 
insight into how to structure their trading strategies 
if those figures provide more evidence of a declining deficit 
as shown by statistics of the previous two months a moderate rally 
in the dollar would likely result 
if the january deficit widens dealers probably would sell 
dollars on the theory that the currency will depreciate further in 
value to stimulate american exports 
in tokyo the dollar closed at 12847 japanese yen up from 
12830 tuesday in london the dollar traded at 12927 yen by the 
time trading concluded in new york the dollar was worth 12940 
yen more than 1 yen higher than 12832 yen rate quoted late 
tuesday 
in london the pound cost 17680 cheaper than 17775 late 
tuesday later in new york the pound was worth 17673 cheaper 
than 17766 late tuesday 
other late dollar rates in new york compared with late tuesday 
included 16969 west german marks up from 16864 14030 swiss 
francs up from 13916 12570 canadian dollars down from 12578 
57385 french francs up from 57100 124825 italian lire up 
from 124325 
other late dollar rates in europe vs late tuesday included 
16945 west german marks up from 16855 14005 swiss francs up

guilders up from 18940 1247 italian lire up from 124435 
12558 canadian dollars down from 12570 
gold bullion rose in london to 42950 a troy ounce vs 42870 
late tuesday it was unchanged in zurich at 42950 in hong kong 
gold traded at 43396 vs 43380 
on the new york commodity exchange gold bullion for current 
delivery fell 20 cents a troy ounce to 43080 
silver bullion traded late in london at 624 a troy ounce down 
from 629 on the new york comex silver bullion for current

the financially troubled dunes casino 
hotel project here has been sold to a florida company with its own 
troubled history of lawsuits cash shortages and federal 
investigations federal documents show 
the royale group ltd a company in the hotel and real estate 
business recently bought out nearly all the stock in the dunes 
according to documents filed with the securities and exchange 
commission and the us bankruptcy court and reviewed by the press 
of atlantic city 
the dunes project at the southern end of the boardwalk stalled 
in 1979 when the owners ran out of money its bare steel girders 
have stood rusting ever since 
developer jack bona arrived in 1983 to rescue the casino but was 
forced to file for bankruptcy protection in august 1985 
since then bona has tried several other plans to raise money to 
pay off his debts including a sale of shares and private deals 
with investors all have failed 
royales chief executive officer since 1981 has been leonard 
pelullo a leader in the effort to restore a strip of art 
decostyle hotels on miami beach 
pelullo and bona have tried to keep the deal for the dunes 
quiet a royale group ltd vice president refers all questions 
about the sale to company attorneys who say they cannot provide 
details 
so far no one in royale has said anything about how the company 
plans to raise the approximately 250 million needed to complete 
the casino hotel 
royale has been trying to break into the atlantic city casino 
industry for a decade then called cavanaugh communities corp the 
company first bought marina land in 1978 but was unable to put 
together financing for a casino 
documents obtained by the press from the sec and us bankruptcy 
court say that boardwalk to bay inc a royale subsidiary has 
purchased 99 percent of the dunes stock from bona and has an option

by banks over the alleged failure to repay millions of dollars 
worth of loans the newspaper reported

new home sales dropped sharply and factory orders slipped in 
january according to government reports wednesday that reflected 
weakness in the economy 
bond prices strengthened in a typical reaction to news of a 
sluggish economy the yield on the treasurys key 30year bond 
slipped to 831 percent from 835 percent 
on wall street stocks rose marginally as the dow jones average 
of 30 industrial stocks edged up 083 to 207129 
in washington federal reserve chairman alan greenspan took 
another opportunity to calm concerns that the central bank would 
respond to political pressure and ease credit too much in an 
election year 
greenspan told the senate budget committee that even if the fed 
wanted to drive down interest rates sharply we would fail 
because markets would likely resist such a move and would run 
away from us 
greenspan also called for new efforts to cut the federal budget 
deficit including a 15cent gasoline tax and measures to trim 
social security and other entitlement programs 
in spite of the news of sluggishness on wednesday stock 
analysts said wall street was still taking courage from a report on 
tuesday by the commerce department on its index of leading economic 
indicators 
with an upward revision of the december figure for the index 
from a decline to a gain it no longer showed a string of three 
consecutive lower readings 
new home sales fell 9 percent in january pushing sales activity 
to its slowest pace since the end of the last recession the 
commerce department said wednesday 
a downturn in housing has often been the harbinger of the onset 
of a recession but analysts said they believed falling mortgage 
rates offered the hope of a rebound in home sales in coming months 
in a second lackluster economic report the commerce department 
said orders for manufactured goods fell 06 percent in january to a 
seasonally adjusted 2126 billion 
while this was the first decline in five months analysts noted 
that it followed an unusually large 2 percent december increase a 
gain which reflected a big jump in demand for jet airplanes 
analysts said the onemonth setback did nothing to change their 
view that american manufacturers are continuing to enjoy a sales 
boom led by increased demand for exports 
james christian chief economist for the us league of savings 
institutions said with mortgage rates moving in the right 
direction sales for all of 1988 should end up only 3 percent 
below the 1987 sales pace 
but other analysts said it remained to be seen whether the drop 
in mortgage rates will be enough to attract new buyers they noted 
that sales have been strong for the past three years and a lot of 
pentup demand has been exhausted 
we simply dont have the demand for housing that we had in the 
first part of the rcovery said michael sumichrast an economist 
and publisher of a construction industry newsletter the south 
which accounts for almost half of all new homes sold is still weak 
and you wont see any significant improvement until that area turns 
around 
banks recorded their least profitable year since the great 
depression in 1987 but a top federal regulator said wednesday he 
sees better days ahead 
the yeartoyear drop in earnings was due entirely to large 
banks adding to reserves to cover anticipated losses on loans to 
third world countries said l william seidman chairman of the 
federal deposit insurance corp

an evenly divided supreme court ruled 
wednesday that an airlines may be forced to continue to collect 
union dues from workers after its contract with employees has 
expired 
the justices by a 44 vote upheld rulings that forced trans 
world airlines to continue the dues checkoff after a strike by 
flight attendants in 1986 
such splits automatically uphold lower court rulings but set no 
national precedent the twa case carried little impact for most 
employers anyway because it involved an interpretation of the 
railway labor act which only applies to the airlines and railroad 
industries 
most private industry employers labor relations are subject to 
the national labor relations act 
nonetheless vicki frankovich president of the independent 
federation of flight attendants said we are extremely pleased 
with this result 
the ruling was not accompanied by any written opinion or by any 
indication of how each individual justice voted 
justice anthony m kennedy who only recently joined the court 
did not participate in the case 
twa and the independent federation of flight attendants had a 
threeyear contract that expired july 31 1984 prolonged 
negotiations followed but the union called a strike on march 7 
1986 
the strike ended on may 17 1986 when the flight attendants 
offered to return to work only some 200 attendants had stayed out 
for the entire strike 
twa hired 2800 new attendants during the strike and about 
1200 others either never joined the strike or returned to work 
during it 
the airline then cancelled the duescheckoff provision of the 
old contract meaning that it no longer would collect union dues 
but a federal judge upheld by the 8th us circuit court of 
appeals ruled that the airline must honor the old contracts 
provisions 
the appeals court said the railway labor act bars employers from 
unilaterally cancelling union security and dues checkoffs contract 
provisions any such changes must be made in negotiations between 
the employer and its workers the appeals court said

a pilots union filed suit wednesday to stop 
eastern airlines from transferring aircraft to orion air in the 
latest legal move to block the transfer of eastern assets by its 
parent texas air corp 
the air line pilots associations request for a temporary 
restraining order was made at federal court in washington 
orion a cargo carrier based in raleigh nc has asked the 
federal aviation administration for certification to fly 26 eastern 
planes on eastern routes by april 1 
i dont think there is any question that this is a blatant 
unionbusting attempt alpa spokesman ron cole said tuesday 
eastern spokesman robin matell declined to comment on the suit 
wednesday but a day earlier company spokeswoman karen ceremsak 
said the airline had contracted with orion to protect itself 
against alpa in the event that its pilots refused to cross picket 
lines during a possible machinists union strike 
eastern is in federal mediation on its contract with the 
machinists the largest of its three unions 
the unions earlier protested the spinoff of easterns northeast 
shuttle as a separate texas air subsidiary and the airlines 
yearold call for 490 million in labor cuts 
the carrier lost 182 million in 1987 following a 131 million 
loss in 1986 eastern cited those losses in firing 3500 workers 
last november and another 600 in january 
alpa charged there was evidence miamibased eastern may go 
through with the orion transfer which it said violates its 
contract even if a strike is averted 
meanwhile a group called the committee for positive action 
blasted rep richard gephardt dmo for his criticism of eastern 
management 
a letter dated march 1 and signed by 11 eastern reservation 
agents and airport agents from across the country accused the 
presidential candidate of trying to achieve political gain at the 
expense of our company and jobs 
during a miami visit last friday gephardt said eastern cared 
more about quick paper profits than its employees and that its 
management decisions reflect the dismantling of a great 
corporation
