president bush is weighing changes in campaign 
finance law to limit the multimilliondollar influence of 
specialinterest political action committees officials said tuesday 
bush indicated in a news conference that he has not made his 
final decisions on what he will propose thursday in the way of 
revamping the federal campaign finance laws 
but officials said he is considering a version of his previously 
announced wish for a ban on political action committee 
contributions which in the 1988 election amounted to 1513 million 
for congressional campaigns according to federal election 
commission records 
one administration official speaking only on condition of 
anonymity said other proposals bush is reviewing include 
barring members of congress from carrying over campaign fund 
surpluses from one election to the next members who win their races 
handily sometimes amass huge warchests by rolling over the funds 
from one year to the next 
setting up a system in which executive branch agencies would 
have to log calls they received from members of congress trying to 
sway them on a policy 
limiting the amount congressional incumbents could spend on 
mailings with their franking privileges critics say these 
mailings to constituents give the incumbents unfair advantage over 
election challengers at the expense of the taxpayers 
bush has made at least one decision according to unidentified 
officials quoted in wednesday editions of the washington post to 
seek legislation outlawing gerrymandering the drawing of 
congressional districts to favor one party 
bush would request a new requirement that districts be compact 
contiguous and respecting community boundaries in addition to 
current courtenforced requirements that a states districts 
contains equal numbers of people as nearly as possible 
instead of ruling out all pacs the options he is now considering 
would ban corporate or labor union pacs according to the official 
the options would allow those that are not connected to such groups 
socalled ideological pacs that are centered on a political 
philosophy or agenda 
the president also is looking at the possibility of lowering the 
current 5000 per candidate limit for pac contributions to 1000 
in the category of banned pacs if bush agrees to this option 
would be socalled leadership pacs those headed by politicians and 
used to dispense campaign funds to other candidates they also are 
used as a springboard for presidential candidates including bush 
who headed the one of the nations two most successful pacs in the 
years before his presidential bid 
bush told reporters that one proposal he will not adopt is a 
system of public financing for congressional campaigns as is now 
the system for the presidential elections 
i oppose public financing of these campaigns i think people 
should be able to attract private support and i think participation 
by individuals in a the political process through financial support 
is very very important bush said 
current law allows individuals to contribute a maximum of 1000 
per candidate in each election while pacs may give 5000 
some groups and members of congress advocate setting up a federal 
fund to pay for congressional races after the model now used for the 
presidential elections and supported by the voluntary 1 checkoff on 
individual income tax forms 
besides speaking against that idea bush said he would not reveal 
any specifics of his thinking on campaign finance reform before 
thursday when he speaks to a group of congressional interns at the 
library of congress 
white house spokeswoman alixe glen said the intention of the 
presidents plan will be to strengthn the parties increase 
competition and fairness in elections and to curtail special 
interest in campaigns 
i will have specific proposals he said adding they would be 
fairly far reaching because i want to see reform real reform 
if he calls on congress to outlaw leadership pacs he will be 
speaking against an increasingly influential funding mechanism that 
many presidential contenders use in their preannouncement phase to 
finance their travels around the country to whip up support 
officially such pacs are set up to help likeminded candidates 
for congressional or other offices and are not allowed to fund 
presidential campaign activity but there is little doubt that they 
serve immense benefit for politicians who are preparing a white 
house bid 
bushs pac called fund for americas future was the second 
largest of some 4000 pacs that file records with the federal 
election comission 
the bush pac raised 94 million in the years when it was most 
active the 198586 campaign cycle second only to the conservative 
congressional club founded by sen jesse helms rnc the 
congressional club and its affiliated groups raised 166 million 
the corporate pacs were led by atampts which raised 18 million 
federal election commission records show 
of laborrelated pacs the teamsters had the largest raising 
44 million that cycle among the trade associationrelated pacs 
the realtors pac raised 57 million and the american medical 
association pac just under 5 million 
in the 198788 election cycle bushs pac raised just under 2 
million as his presidential campaign geared up and fundraising 
efforts were diverted to it 
in the primary season bushs campaign received 862950 in 
contributions from specialinterest pacs

a wellpreserved ship believed to be a 17th 
century spanish galleon loaded with gold has been found in 1500 
feet of water near the florida keys according to a salvage company 
much of the wooden vessel and its cargo appears to be intact 
because of the pressure and temperature of the water 
its worth a fortune in history greg stemm a tampa 
businessman who hopes to recover the riches told the st petersburg 
times for an article published wednesday 
stemm believes the wreck is the nuestra senora de la merced a 
spanish colonial galleon believed to have vanished during the same 
hurricane 350 years ago that felled another galleon the nuestra 
senora de atocha 
the atocha laden with gold and silver was found by treasure 
hunter mel fisher in 1985 about 50 miles north of stemms discovery 
if stemms research proves correct the wreck he discovered could 
hold a treasure worth millions stemm 32 is coowner of a deepsea 
research company that discovered the sunken vessel in april 
seahawk deep ocean technology of tampa plans to disclose the 
details of its remotecamera exploration of the ship on wednesday 
archaeologist and treasure hunters are hoping photos prove its the 
merced sunk in 1622 
this is just like a time capsule because nothings been 
touched said dan s bagley a seahawk director 
by the end of the summer the salvors aboard stemms 85foot 
research vessel seahawk will begin a fullscale operation to 
retrieve the fragile artifacts and confirm the ships identity 
so far they have discovered a ships bell and a number of olive 
jars that could be filled with wine food and other commodities the 
project could take up to two years 
jim miller a state archaeologist said he has talked to the 
salvors about the importance of preserving the artifacts and other 
salvageable items from the wreck 
regardless of what vessel it is archaeologically its an 
extremely significant site miller said if you consider the 
historic value its very great the other side of that question is 
the monetary value

a federal appeals court tuesday overturned the 
conviction of former reagan administration aide lyn nofziger for 
illegally lobbying his white house colleagues months after he left 
the government 
in a 21 ruling the panel said nofzigers 1988 conviction must 
be set aside because it is not based on a finding that he had 
knowledge of each element of the offenses he was accused of 
committing 
the government was required to prove that he had knowledge of 
all of the facts making his conduct criminal said the decision 
written by us circuit court of appeals judge james buckley 
buckley was joined by judge stephen williams both are reagan 
appointees 
appeals court judge harry edwards a carter administration 
appointee dissented saying there was no basis for overturning 
nofzigers conviction 
asked at a news conference whether he thought he had gotten off 
on a legal technicality nofziger said absolutely no i think 
they came after me on a technicality 
james mckay the independent counsel who prosecuted nofziger 
issued a statement saying he will consider his options to pursue 
further appellate review of this decision the prosecutor could 
seek a review by the entire federal appeals court in washington or 
appeal to the supreme court 
president bush and other high level administration officials were 
clearly pleased 
bush asked at a state dinner honoring australian prime minister 
robert hawke what he thought of the ruling smiled broadly and said 
only im always glad when soembody is found not guilty of 
something 
secretary of state james a baker iii was more effusive calling 
the decision terrific 
vice president dan quayle said it was good news and bushs chief 
of staff john sununu said he had called nofziger to congratulate 
him and let him know at least some of his old friends hadnt 
forgotten him 
the case against nofziger president reagans white house 
political director in 1981 was the first major test of the 
revolvingdoor provisions of the ethics in government act the law 
imposes a oneyear ban on lobbying former government colleagues once 
an upperechelon employee leaves service in the executive branch 
nofziger said he was certainly pleased by the decision i 
think i was innocent from the beginning i still think i am 
innocent he said 
he was convicted feb 11 1988 of three counts of illegally 
lobbying top presidential aides on behalf of private clients after 
he left the white house one year into the reagan administration the 
clients were scandalplagued wedtech corp a maritime engineers 
union and the manufacturer of the air forces a10 antitank plane 
nofziger who is 65 was sentenced to 90 days in prison and fined 
30000 he said that defending himself cost a bundle a bundle 
with legal fees running over 15 million and i suppose more than 
that in lost income 
as a lobbyist accused of felonies you not only lose clients 
you dont get clients but he acknowledged he has been able to 
keep his business going while the case made its way through the 
courts 
asked about the revolving door provisions of the ethics law 
under which he was prosecuted nofziger said i dont think i am 
part of any revolving door syndrome 
people lobby in this town the main industry in this town 
besides government is lobbying he said 
the ethics law prohibits executive branch officials from 
knowingly acting as agents or attorneys before their old 
agencies within one year after leaving the government 
nofziger contended the word knowingly also applied to a 
prohibition against making oral or written communications to 
their previous government colleagues on matters in which the agency 
had a direct and substantial interest within one year 
prosecutors said the word knowingly referred only to acting as 
an agent or attorney 
this is not an idle grammatical inquiry said buckleys 
ruling if nofzigers interpretation is correct no one may be 
convicted unless it is proven that he had knowledge of each of 
the facts constituting the offense 
the court found that the wording was ambiguous 
canons of statutory construction require that an ambiguous 
criminal statute be interpreted in the defendants favor said 
buckley 
the prosecutors never alleged that nofziger knew his former 
colleagues had a direct and substantial interest in the matters on 
which he was lobbying them 
under the prosecutions theory if an exofficial tries to 
interest his former agency in a particular project in the mistaken 
belief that it had no direct and substantial interest in it he 
will have committed a felony punishable by up to two years in 
jail said buckley 
in his dissent edwards said the law was clear and that the word 
knowingly didnt apply to the provisions under which nofziger 
was convicted 
the majority has labored mightily to find an ambiguity said 
edwards but there is no ambiguity to resolve and consequently 
no basis for overturning nofzigers conviction he said 
i cannot comprehend my colleagues convoluted attempts to 
embrace nofzigers fancied ambiguity and their willingness 
to ignore clear legislative history and engage in overt 
legislating said edwards 
buckley and williams remanded the case to the district court 
for proceedings consistent with this opinion 
the district court should have dismissed the indictment filed 
by the prosecution said the decision 
a federal court jury found nofziger guilty of illegally using his 
influence by sending an april 8 1982 memo to thenpresidential 
counselor edwin meese iii 
the memo suggested that meese enlist the support of president 
reagan and others to persuade the army to give a nobid contract to 
build small gasoline engines to wedtech which in the last years of 
the reagan administration became the focus of a massive federal 
corruption probe while he was attorney general meese himself came 
under criminal investigation in connection with wedtech he wasnt 
prosecuted 
nofziger also was convicted of sending an aug 20 1982 memo to 
james jenkins meeses deputy urging the administration to put 
civilian sailors on navy vessels the policy was being pushed by the 
marine engineers beneficial association which paid nofzigers 
lobbying firm 100000 a year 
additionally the jury said nofziger illegally lobbied two 
national security council officials about continued production of 
the air forces a10 antitank plane which was made by fairchild 
corp

rene acuna is starving himself to 
protest a life prison sentence but hes on a wellworn road that 
state corrections officials say will end in courtordered force 
feeding 
i am innocent and i dont eat said acuna a cuban immigrant 
who speaks broken english 
acuna 37 of detroit stopped eating except for water and 
sugared coffee march 3 after he was convicted of conspiracy and 
delivery of two pounds of cocaine his sentence is life without 
parole 
acuna once carried 180 pounds on his 5foot 5inch frame as of 
friday he had lost 64 pounds his body swims in his prison blues 
his cheeks are sunken 
i see the food like a chair like a sofa the hunger when you 
have a reason to support your spirit and your mind you dont need 
anything more he said in a telephone interview from the hospital 
at the state prison of southern michigan near jackson 
but a series of court rulings across the nation have upheld the 
power of prison officials to force feed inmates on longterm hunger 
strikes corrections experts say no record is kept of how many 
hunger strikes occur each year in american prisons but they believe 
long ones are rare 
typically courts decide that prison authorities need to control 
their institutions outweighs prisoners rights to privacy and 
control of their bodies said ed koren staff assistant for the 
national prison project of the american civil liberties union 
obviously they have an interest in controlling the institution 
and when a prisoner does something like this he is embarrassing the 
heck out of them he said 
department of corrections officials label acunas hunger strike a 
publicity stunt and have doctors check him each day 
the department will go to court to get the authority to force 
feed him if his condition worsens said leo lalonde deputy director 
of the department of corrections adding that could be today that 
could be tomorrow 
michigan officials seek such authority about 10 times a year in 
order to safeguard the health of inmates who refuse food or medical 
care said chris dewitt spokesman for attorney general frank kelley 
acunas lawyers say his determination poses an ethical dilemma 
this is the stuff la law is written about what do you do 
when your client wants to die asked james neuhard director of 
the michigan appellate defenders office which will handle the 
appeal of acunas drug convictions 
i told him if he dies from not eating even if he is innocent 
his appeal will be stopped right then said sandra girard 
director of prison legal services of michigan inc 
in a new hampshire case inmate joseph calk decided to starve 
himself to death rather than serve a 180year sentence 
arpy saunders calks lawyer said the new hampshire supreme 
court allowed authorities to forcefeed calk to keep him alive so 
that he could face another charge pending in california 
it wasnt up to him to determine how long he should serve 
said saunders summarizing the courts ruling 
mark david chapman sentenced to 20 years to life for the murder 
of former beatle john lennon staged a hunger strike to call 
attention to starving children 
but the appellate division of the new york supreme court decided 
prison security needs outweighed chapmans claim that the right to 
privacy includes a right to refuse to eat 
one exception to that philosophy came in georgia where inmate 
ted prevatte won a lawsuit to prevent authorities from forcefeeding 
him but eventually ended his hunger strike aimed at winning 
transfer to another prison system said department of corrections 
spokesman john siler 
the georgia supreme court found forcefeeding was too great an 
invasion of an inmates right to privacy saying the state has no 
right to destroy a persons will by frustrating his attempt to die 
if necessary to make a point

cottrell a conservative was fined monday after pleading guilty 
to acting in a manner likely to endanger an aircraft or the people 
aboard 
at the magistrates court hearing the defense said cottrells 
fear of flying was the reason he refused to fasten his seat belt

member of parliament after he was told international regulations 
required all passengers to wear seat belts the court was told 
prosecutor neville casselmann said cottrell remained at the 
cockpit until the pilot shouted out we are landing

considerable time had a largescale phobia of flying it arose out 
of an incident 15 years ago when he was a passenger in a light 
aircraft forced to make an emergency landing he was badly shaken up 
by it 
he added that his client always sits near the emergency exits 
and never fastens his seat belt

workers in boats scooped blobs of congealed 
oil the size of basketballs and bigger from the delaware river on 
monday and tried to contain the 800000gallon oil spill the 
biggest of three weekend spills 
deepwater booms were installed to keep the heavy oil on the 
delaware from moving out to sea 
skimmers sent out after a uruguayan tanker ran aground early 
saturday couldnt handle the dense oil blobs and jammed coast guard 
capt larry murdock said monday a call was issued for more boats 
and 300 delaware national guardsmen were activated to help 250 
private contractor employees scoop the goey mess from the water 
however federal officials said shoreline damage in pennsylvania 
delaware and new jersey was almost nonexistent that was because the 
oil congealed and did not wash up like lighter oils spilled over the 
weekend in rhode island and texas and crude oil spilled earlier this 
year along the coast of alaska 
near newport ri the 420000 gallons of lighter oil that 
spilled from a tanker after it hit a reef had largely dispersed or 
evaporated by monday morning officials said conditions were 
much much better than yesterday said stephen g morin a state 
environmental official 
coast guard capt eric williams of the providence ri marine 
safety office said there was no evidence that anything but human 
error played a role in the spill 
he said there was no evidence of mechanical failure and noted 
that the ships captain iakovos georgudis told gov edward diprete 
he had made a mistake diprete said over the weekend that georgudis 
told him he erred in plotting the ships course 
a harbor pilot on his way to a rendezvous with the tanker tried 
to warn the ship it was heading into dangerous waters but his radio 
message came too late the new york times reported in tuesdays 
editions 
the newspaper quoted capt bruce b fisher chairman of the 
northeast pilots association of newport as saying that the harbor 
pilot capt david g leonard gave such an account to national 
transportation safety board investigators 
in texas most of the oil spilled friday in the houston ship 
channel by the collision of a tanker and an oil barge was 
concentrated in a smaller channel by wind and waves from approaching 
tropical storm allison allowing the use of huge vacuum machines to 
pick up the oil by monday afternoon about twothirds of the 6000 
barrels spilled had been recovered said coast guard spokesman bob 
morehead 
in washington the presidents press secretary marlin fitzwater 
complained monday that the oil industry was moving too slowly on 
oilspill cleanup technology and said the latest spills show the 
pervasiveness of the problem he said they also underscored the 
need for legislation to better define tanker owners liabilities 
fitzwater ruled out a moratorium on new oil drilling and 
exploration as some have urged in the wake of the spills 
master chief petty officer james kosch a coast guard spokesman 
said he doubted any investigations into the spills had reached 
conclusions kosch said its usually weeks before such probes reach 
preliminary findings 
in delaware murdock said there wont be any problems unless the 
oil spilled when the tanker presidente rivera ran aground somehow 
warmed to 95 degrees or higher and liquefied oil blobs were 
floating intact below the surface of the 60 to 65degree water he 
said 
yesterday we had a clump that had to be 30 gallons in one 
piece said david gartin operations manager for jampj spill 
service norristown pa it was about four feet by four feet and 
three feet deep we just broke pieces off and stuffed them in bags 
gartin said the oil was staying pretty much in the claymont area 
just south of the pennsylvaniadelaware border but tidal action 
moved the oil back and forth up and down the river and globs were 
spotted as far north as ridley park pa on the outskirts of 
philadelphia and as far south as new castle del about 30 miles 
downstream 
gartin said he doubted the oil will be cleaned up by the end of 
the week 
delaware wildlife officials worked to protect pea patch island 
in the river south of new castle which is home to several species 
of nesting shorebirds crews laid 1700 feet of oilretaining booms 
along the island 
as of monday only one bird had died said dick nugent manager 
of the tinicum national environmental center located near 
philadelphia 
the cause of the tankers grounding was under investigation drug 
and alcohol tests were performed on everyone involved in navigating 
the ship the results were not immediately available 
in rhode island sound only a few small patches of oil could be 
seen monday state and federal officials said 
the worst is over said debbie payton an oceanographer with 
the natonal oceanographic and atmospheric administration she 
estimated no more than 5 percent of the highly toxic oil remained 
floating on the water 
one of the heaviest patches of remaining oil was just east of 
block island but no booms were flown there because the islands 
most sensitive shore is on the opposite side officials said 
there had been some reports of lobsters killed and several small 
birds found dead but officials said those did not appear to be 
widespread 
agents from the fbi and three other state and federal agencies 
met with justice department attorneys to begin their investigation 
of the accident said us attorney lincoln almond 
the coast guard planned hearings tuesday into the rhode island 
and texas spills 
state beaches from jamestown almost to connecticut remained 
closed as a precaution although eastern beaches were open a 
statewide shellfishing ban remained in effect 
in texas heavy rain from the approaching tropical storm slowed 
cleanup monday but three more huge vacuum machines were brought in 
to help the cleanup for a total of a dozen on the scene morehead 
said 
the wind makes the water choppy and the rain is a pain in the 
neck but theyre still going ahead he said 
much of the area affected by that spill was industrial

its the prettiest contract youve ever seen said rondeau a 
former harvard medical school laboratory assistant who led the 
campaign that succeeded last year in organizing the 3500 workers 
over strenuous opposition from the university 
its got great economics and cooperative labormanagement 
relations and it addresses the concerns of working women she 
said

vote that the labor organizers won by 44 votes or less than 2 
percent of the total cast in the 15301486 decision 
harvard president derek bok a former law professor whose

good job at that she said

tangiye policharki afghanistan ap bearded turbaned men 
slowly guide their camels sheep and goats down the mountains and 
carry lambs on their shoulders along the rugged path 
women in colorful traditional dress and small children run beside 
the flock to keep the bleating animals from straying 
they travel along the potholed road past the artillery guns and 
tanks and through this military checkpoint undisturbed by the 
soldiers 
we are free people habibullah said as he unloaded sacks of 
goods from his kneeling camel we are the true spirit of 
afghanistan or maybe were what afghanistan used to be 
habibullah and the other 15 members of his clan are among the 
estimated 2 million koochi nomads who wander between winter and 
summer pastures pitching their hide tents in fields building fires 
and turning their sheep to graze 
the koochis which means wanderer in the pashto language have 
traveled the rugged hills and valleys of afghanstian for thousands 
of years they are ethnic pathans like most people in eastern 
afghanistan 
but unlike their brothers they never settled down 
most still divide their time between the warm lowlands around 
peshawar pakistan and the hilly fields of northern and central 
afghanistan 
the 11yearold civil war has made the journey more difficult for 
the koochis but it hasnt stopped them 
kabul the capital is a common stopping point for the koochis 
and their camel trains are as much a part of the urban landscape as 
the old bazaars the military outposts and highrise apartment 
buildings they halt in kabul at least once a year to sell camels 
sheep and goats at the meat market 
the koochi people are an important part of our homeland an 
important part of our tradition we respect them said sulaiman 
laeq the minister of clans and a politburo member 
the government has tried to provide them with education health 
and the benefits of progress such as helping them purchase trucks 
and organize a transport union 
but the koochis have made it clear they dont want to enter the 
modern world especially if it means owing alligence to the ruling 
peoples democratic party of afghanistan or any other government 
in the early days of the 1978 marxist revolution that touched off 
the civil war efforts were made to force the koochis to stop 
wandering and settle in the north 
the move backfired said the 37yearold habibullah some of the 
koochis took up guns and joined the moslem guerrillas in the battle 
against the sovietbacked government troops 
some are still fighting but most have returned habibullah 
said through a translator 
laeq and other party officials speak of the mistakes the 
government made while trying to bring progress to the koochis 
koochi men had never been asked to serve in the afghan armed 
forces but that tradition was reversed when the marxists seized 
power 11 years ago in a bloody coup 
by 1985 the government had modified its policy formally 
exempting the koochi men from government military service 
but the war has not been easy for the koochis 
they often step on land mines planted by the armed forces and by 
the soviets during their nineyear intervention 
and their travels frequently take them into battle zones near 
jalalabad an eastern city under rebel siege since early march 
this war has been very bad for our people says another 
koochi leader azizullah the bombs and rockets and land mines 
have killed so many of our people 
occasionally he says the rebels demand money to allow them to 
pass through guerrillacontrolled territory often the roads are 
neither open nor safe forcing the koochis to travel through the 
mountains and turning an easy oneday journey into a dangerous 
twoweek affair 
we are our own people we dont want to be on either side 
says azizullah we dont want anyone elses war

like many small new mexico towns 
lordsburg wants new jobs tourists and its businesses to grow 
but promoters never dreamed the hottest development deal here in 
decades would involve a manhattansize landfill that has thrown the 
town into the debate over the nations mounting solid waste problem 
immense isolated and sparsely populated the hidalgo county 
desert near mexico has been chosen by a maryland company for the 
commercial landfill the dump would accommodate up to 20000 tons of 
garbage a day from east coast cities 
the proposal was not exactly a secret a major construction firm 
driggs corp of capitol heights md acting locally as innovative 
environmental systems of new mexico had secured property in the 
area and in january asked the state for a landfill permit 
but elected officials and their constituents caught off guard 
when news of the proposal surfaced sent a shock wave of opposition 
that has since reverberated in every new mexico town and county as 
well as the capitol in santa fe 
clark smith mayor of this southwestern new mexico town of 3200 
people recalls that january morning when he saw a map of his town 
on the front page of a newspaper 
theres lordsburg on the map right there and driggs and i 
looked at my wife and said what is this my phone started 
ringing what is this what is this 
the 7300acre landfill site would sit on 36 square miles now 
occupied by lizards snakes mesquite brush and yucca the property 
is neatly and conveniently bisected by interstate 10 and the busy 
southern pacific railroad line 
the opposition moved fast turning trash into a major 
environmentalpolitical issue in new mexico and focusing attention 
on the states inadequate landfill regulations and the national 
quest for suitable landfill space 
when the 1989 legislature convened in midjanuary a bill was 
introduced to toughen the landfill law and block commercial dumps 
it received overwhelming support 
but the bill was vetoed by gov garrey carruthers who cited 
technicalities that he said would have forced the immediate closure 
of every landfill in the state but in march carruthers issued a 
moratorium outlawing all new commercial landfills except under 
special circumstances the state environmental improvement board 
adopted new regulations two months later 
hidalgo county responding to the public demand also imposed a 
landfill moratorium and initiated its firstever land use planning 
effort 
now that we are aware that they are looking at deserts for 
landfills we need to protect ourselves said county commissioner 
maura rico 
don sanchez driggs director of special projects who was the 
companys local representative and ralph golden executive vice 
president refused to be interviewed by the associated press citing 
fears of adverse publicity 
however innovative environmental systems director im ike 
smalley who retired last year from the state legislature after 38 
years said lordsburg residents never waited for a full explanation 
leading to misconceptions about the landfill and its potential 
benefits 
lordsburg would reap economic benefits including up to 150 jobs 
and a 3 million payroll 
few residents are tempted 
my first reaction was that no waste disposal operation of this 
size could possibly be a good thing for the community no matter 
how many jobs it creates said charlie hayes a school 
administrator and leader of the opposition 
smith also said he worries that new mexico could get a reputation 
as the nations dump a status some have conferred because of the 
waste isolation pilot plant the nations low and 
intermediatelevel nuclear waste repository near carlsbad 
and he fears what the landfill would mean to lordsburgs image 
with tourists 
people will come in and say children were coming into new 
mexico now this is where the worlds largest dump is

the department of housing and urban development 
faces some 650 million in loan defaults from nine mortgage 
companies whose practices now are under review a spokesman said 
monday 
three of the nine companies have been suspended indefinitely from 
doing business with the department three others have been placed on 
probation for six months and three more face examination of their 
projects hud documents show 
in addition frank keating hud general counseldesignate said 
escrow agent marilyn harrell of washington and agents in texas and 
alabama became the first agents that hud would bar from future 
government contracts the washington post said in tuesday editions 
the cases are part of a nationwide investigation of hud dealings 
with about 280 closing agents who handled government foreclosures 
ms harrell whose diversion of 55 million from the 
governments primary housing subsidy program earned her the nickname 
robin hud turned over her house to the department to cover part 
of the thefts and moved out on monday 
the mortgage companies have been involved in coinsurance 
programs at hud under which they earn lucrative fees for 
servicing loans for federally backed housing programs but stand to 
lose little if the borrower defaults 
the mortgage companies have to absorb the first 5 percent of the 
loss on the loans but hud takes 85 prcent of the remaining loss 
lenders were underwriting unsound loans overmortgaging 
properties failing to detect indications of troubled loans in a 
timely manner and were not taking adequate and timely actions to 
minimize mortgage defaults and coinsurance losses according to a 
hud inspector generals report issued earlier this year 
that report estimated that loans worth some 700 million were in 
default but bill glavin a hud spokesman said some of the 
potential losses have been recovered lowering the overall liability 
to 650 million 
that represents about 13 percent of the money loaned under the 
program he said 
the lenders suspended indefinitely were drg funding corp of 
washington dc puller mortgage associates inc of indianapolis 
and southwest funding group of houston the three on probation 
through nov 1 are benton mortgage co of knoxville tenn carnegie 
evans lp of greenwich conn and citadel mortgage co of san 
antonio texas 
the three lenders under review are american mortgages inc of 
bethesda md eagle housing mortgage group of dallas and tri 
capital corp of san francisco 
at the beginning of may hud placed a moratorium on the entire 
coinsurance program until sept 1 while the agency reviews the 
program 
to preempt a federal eviction ms harrell 46 spent the weekend 
hauling six truckloads of furniture from the house she purchased 
with her own money in 1986 including a white baby grand piano and a 
largescreen television set she moved in with her mother nearby 
ms harrell said she gave hud the title to her home in december 
when her contract as a closing agent for hud ran out and agents were 
asking about millions missing from her title company she said she 
also had transferred to hud the deeds to five other houses she paid 
for with huds money and used for various charities and homeless 
families 
last week ms harrell said two vans and a pickup truck used by 
her company were seized at her business office in clinton md

death penalty opponents are calling for new 
state laws to protect juveniles and the mentally retarded in the 
wake of supreme court rulings they say are medieval and barbaric 
to give up with ultimate finality upon a person even before 
they emerge from childhood is squarely in opposition to the 
fundamental premises of an enlightened juvenile justice system 
said american bar association president robert raven 
we strongly urge states to enact legislation which recognizes 
that minors should not be held to the ultimate sanction of 
death he said 
of the 37 states permitting capital punishment 15 now bar its 
use for anyone who committed the crime before age 18 
the court voting 54 said monday the constitution does not bar 
states from executing murderers who committed their crimes as young 
as 16 or mentally retarded adult killers 
in the case of the mentally retarded the justices said convicted 
murderers may demand that sentencing juries and judges consider 
their limited reasoning capacity as a factor weighing against the 
death penalty 
the court upheld the death sentences of a kentucky murderer who 
was 17 when he killed a missouri killer who was 16 and a texas 
killer who has the mental capacity of a 7yearold 
last year the court decided that 15 was too young for execution 
the justices expected to wrap up the current court term on 
thursday have yet to issue a decision in a closely watched missouri 
case in which the courts 1973 decision legalizing abortion is under 
attack 
the court must either announce a decision or schedule the case to 
be argued again during its next term beginning in october 
in other matters monday the court 
ruled 72 that skyrocketing punitive damage awards in personal 
injury lawsuits do not violate the constitutions ban on excessive 
fines the decision left open the possibility that such hefty awards 
violate dueprocess rights 
said police may stray from the precise wording of the famous 
miranda warnings given to criminal suspects voting 54 to reinstate 
an indiana mans conviction for attempted murder 
unanimously interpreted a key federal antiracketeering law 
broadly in a minnesota case to make it easier to use the law in 
civil lawsuits against businesses accused of fraud 
agreed to decide in an ohio case whether states may outlaw 
possession of lewd photographs and films depicting child nudity 
the court in 1982 said states could ban the promotion and 
distribution of such material but stopped short of allowing its 
possession to be a crime 
law enforcement authorities said the juvenile death penalty 
decisions will advance the fight against violent crime 
in an era of growing concern over the increase and seriousness 
of violent crime the courts decision reaffirms that state 
legislators the juvenile justice system and local juries not the 
federal courts can and should decide upon the proper age to impose 
the death penalty said attorney general fred cowan of kentucky 
clearly some 16 and 17yearolds in our society are fully 
mature and capable of plotting and carrying out the most heinous of 
crimes he added the court has obviously responded to societys 
demand to hold youths who are mature enough to commit horrible 
crimes responsible for their actions 
the courts juvenilekillers ruling affects about 25 of the 2200 
death row inmates across the nation 
as for mental retardation people who function at belowaverage 
intelligence comprise between 12 and 30 percent of all death row 
inmates according to one group opposed to the death penalty 
the rulings prompted widespread concern among activists for 
individual rights 
it is quite appalling that the supreme court would read the 
constitution as not banning the execution of children said 
henry schwarzschild of the american civil liberties union to let 
the society hang children is medieval and barbaric 
james ellis president of the american association on mental 
retardation said it now falls to state legislatures to assure 
that no individual with this disability is ever put to death in this 
country the execution of any such person would represent a tragic 
injustice 
michele coleman of the missouri coalition against the death 
penalty said the rulings give states rein to execute children 
but missouri attorney general william webster said the rulings 
will not prompt more executions of minors 
i think thats hogwash theres a lot of people that say its 
going to open the door thats ludicrous he said

former house speaker jim wright says hes 
leaving congress for good on friday ending speculation that he 
might seek reelection to the seat that ethics charges forced him to 
give up 
wright issued a statement saying he is gratified by supporters 
calls for him to seek reelection and political vindication in a 
special vote to be called after he steps down 
as deeply as i appreciate the devoted friendship which impels 
these sincere petitions i must conclude that i was right in 
announcing my retirement from congress the fort worth texas 
democrat said monday 
it is best for the institution and best for the people whom 
ive served that i step aside now and make room for others he 
said he said his nearly 35year house career will end friday and he 
will not seek elective office again 
the house ethics committee had charged wright with 69 violations 
involving whether he sidestepped house limits on outside income 
through bulk sales of a book he wrote and whether he improperly 
accepted 145000 in gifts from a business partner with a direct 
interest in legislation 
in an emotional speech to the house on may 31 wright said he 
would step down as speaker and resign his house seat by the end of 
june he was replaced as speaker by rep thomas s foley dwash a 
week later 
but wright had left open the possibility he might seek 
reelection to the house in an attempt to counter the ethics charges 
that made him the first house speaker ever to resign under fire he 
said last week he might run if there were an absolutely genuine 
draft of a bipartisan nature 
in washington however colleagues were privately aghast at the 
suggestion he might seek to stay on 
an aide speaking on condition of anonymity said a weekend poll 
showing homedistrict support for wright figured prominently in the 
decision not to run again he just felt like that was 
vindication the aide said 
sixtyfive percent of wrights constituents who were polled said 
they would vote for him again about 81 percent believed wright was 
doing an outstanding or good job in washington and 67 
percent said he gave up too soon in his fight against the ethics 
charges 
the poll which sampled 407 residents last week and had an error 
margin of plus or minus 5 percentage points appeared in sundays 
fort worth startelegram 
to seek and gain the splendid honor of a public endorsement one 
more time would be vainglorious wright said in the statement 
to do so without intending to serve for a prolonged period would 
be pointless to postpone the moment when another may begin would be 
a disservice 
had he run again and won wright still could have been subject to 
disciplinary action by the ethics committee which apparently 
decided to set the case aside after he announced his intention to 
resign 
wright said he has accepted five or six invitations to 
deliver speeches and is considering some limited business and 
professional relationships and writing opportunities he will 
maintain an office in fort worth he said 
he and his wife betty plan to attend a welcome home jim 
celebration thursday in fort worth sponsored by mayor bob bolen and 
former rep tom vandergriff dtexas

covering the news in china under the growing 
obstacles created by martial law requires more in the way of 
imaginative tactics by foreign journalists than derringdo 
reporting on chinas political crisis has become increasingly 
difficult as soldiers and police strictly enforce restrictions on 
the press 
newsgathering is basically banned under martial law except for 
the infrequent governmentorchestrated peasant rally or news 
conference 
but virtually all reporters in the capital and other chinese 
cities ignore the regulations coming up with their own ways of 
getting around martial law 
the most effective trick these days is to act like a dumb 
tourist says an asian photojournalist wear bright clothes and 
shorts and dont hide your camera 
if stopped by security personnel he says the best defense is 
to go on the offense ask them some questions its better than 
trying to run away 
martial law was imposed may 20 in beijing in a move to quell the 
studentled democracy movement that was finally crushed june 4 when 
soldiers killed hundreds of unarmed civilians in the capital 
under the vaguely worded decree foreigners are prohibited from 
entering or taking pictures at schools factories or 
organizations 
television networks face the greatest difficulties their 
equipment makes them easy to spot 
for television we dont have a story unless we have a picture 
that can convey the information says a cbs news official we 
get chased away all the time were very frustrated at not being 
able to shoot pictures 
coverage has been reduced to relying on governmentcontrolled tv 
news 
a great deal of what were doing is recording their material 
and reworking it said the cbs official were very much at 
their mercy 
foreign television networks can no longer send segments through 
staterun china central television to north america or europe via 
satellite 
they must now somehow get their videotapes to hong kong or tokyo 
we smuggled out our tapes did the double shuffle with the 
cassettes and that sort said vernon mann a correspondent for 
britains independent television network whose videotape was 
confiscated by police after he filmed on a university campus in 
chengdu central china 
our piece which would have greatly upset them was aired all 
over the uk united kingdom 
mann was expelled from china for the incident 
still photographers have an easier time one wrapped his camera 
in a jacket and put the bundle in his bicycle basket shooting 
frames as he passed soldiers guarding intersections 
another put aside his complex singlelens reflex camera and 
instead went out with the automaticfocus variety so all he had to 
do was point and push 
most photographers have resorted to taking pictures from cars 
some with darkened windows as they zip past soldiers on patrol or 
troops checking identification 
one cameraman from a european photo agency took a dramatic shot 
through the back window of a taxi of a man in handcuffs being led 
away by soldiers one guy saw me and i just hit my driver on the 
back and said lets get out of here he said 
print journalists face more subtle difficulties 
with most chinese frightened into silence by widespread arrests 
including the nationally publicized arrest of a man who talked to an 
american television crew reporters sources are drying up 
ive simply stopped telephoning people said one american 
reporter noting that he and most colleagues assume their phones are 
tapped i think of my chinese contacts first and foremost as 
friends and ive stopped making any attempt to contact them 
other journalists discover that acquaintances refuse to meet 
them a german reporter was turned away when he showed up at the 
doorsteps of some chinese friends he says now he does not even take 
notes on the streets preferring to keep his eyes open and later 
write down what he saw 
the few who do make appointments do so with great caution 
calling from public telephones instructing friends not to say their 
names in phone conversations making appointments by prearranged 
code and meeting sources furtively in discrete locations 
i only move around at night said a japanese reporter even 
though its easier for me to blend into a crowd than westerners i 
still stand out 
he says while many people who have helped him have gone 
underground he hasnt stopped seeing people because chinese have 
information you cant get otherwise 
he too says meetings are much harder to arrange you cant 
meet people in hotels they have secret cameras everywhere 
referring to footage taken by a hidden camera of a student leader 
feasting at the beijing hotel 
now he finds the only place he can interview people is in his car 
during the day when soldiers arent checking vehicles for 
fugitives 
the greatest danger in china now is that the people have lost 
their voice he said the reformists and intellectuals are all 
gone china have lost its goodheartedness

the strongest earthquake to hit hawaii in 
six years shook a sparsely populated area of hawaii island already 
ravaged by lava destroying two homes and generating a small tidal 
wave 
no serious injuries were reported 
authorities were investigating reports of damage to other homes 
monday said hawaii county civil defense administrator harry kim 
our first priority this morning is to check certain remote 
areas to make sure no one is trapped in their homes kim said 
early reports we are getting indicate no one is trapped 
the temblor caused by the 6yearold eruption of kilauea 
volcano struck sunday evening and measured 61 on the richter 
scale the us geological survey said 
it was centered west of kalapana a small coastal town on the 
south flank of the volcano said bruce turner a geophysicist at the 
pacific tsunami warning center in honolulu 
the quake was triggered by the release of pressure generated by 
the movement of underground magma or molten rock said bob 
koyanagi a seismic analyst at the geological surveys hawaiian 
volcano observatory 
reggie okamura a spokesman for the observatory said scientists 
had recorded numerous aftershocks the strongest measuring 40 on 
the richter scale was recorded sunday night he said 
kilauea lava has destroyed 68 homes in the kalapana area since 
its latest eruption began jan 3 1983 four homes were destroyed in 
may and last thursday a hawaii volcanoes national park visitor 
center burst into flames as lava crept beneath the wooden structure 
koyanagi said pressure became too great within the worlds most 
active volcano causing its south flank to move and triggering the 
earthquake 
the tidal wave which measured 228 inches high at honuapo 84 
inches at kapoho and 56 inches at hilo caused no damage turner 
said 
five people were injured by falling debris inside homes but none 
required hospitalization kim said crews were working to repair 
downed power lines 
it was the strongest earthquake to hit the state since nov 15 
1983 when a 66 temblor caused several million dollars damage on 
hawaii island 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude

major oil spills in rhode island delaware and 
texas provided a big challenge for the coast guard but the tasks 
differed sharply from the massive alaska spill that is still being 
cleaned up three months after it happened 
here we have a spill that we hoped wouldnt happen but we were 
prepared for it said coast guard spokesman rick meidt who worked 
on both the alaskan spill and the spill last friday at the mouth of 
narragansett bay off rhode island 
up there in alaska it was a spill that couldnt happen but it 
did he said 
the same pumps used to evacuate 40 million gallons of alaskan 
crude from the exxon valdez after it ran aground march 24 in prince 
william sound and spilled more than 10 million gallons were being 
used on the world prodigy in naragansett bay 
but they were pumping a far different substance 
while the alaskan crude continues to pollute shorelines as far as 
450 miles away from the original spill the 420000 gallons of 
refined heating oil that poured out of the world prodigy have 
largely evaporated or dissipated 
on the delaware river cleanup crews were contending with yet a 
different consistency basketballsized globs of oil from 800000 
gallons that oozed out of a uraguayan tanker saturday but that was 
also easier to clean up than the alaskan crude 
coast guard officials said shoreline damage downriver in 
delaware pennsylvania and new jersey was almost nonexistent because 
the oil was thick and was not washing up on the shore in alaska by 
contrast the soft crude seeped deep into beach sand 
in the galveston bay outside houston 250000 gallons of oil that 
spilled in the collision of a tanker and a barge was confined to a 
small shipping channel and most of the oil that washed ashore 
affected only industrial property 
weather conditions after both the alaskan and the recent weekend 
spills were mild but brought far different results off the rhode 
island coast the sun speeded up evaporation of the light oil off 
the rhode island coast 
in alaska what we needed was a storm to break up the oil 
said meidt 
he said booms also were used quickly and effectively in the east 
coast spill to contain and divert the oil in a way that was never 
possible after alaskas midnight spill 25 miles out in prince 
william sound 
this one was literally in the coast guards backyard said 
meidt we just went out and put a boom around it 
officials said a response system being reviewed as a result of 
the alaskan spill appears to be working well in handling the smaller 
spills but officials still need to know how the response system 
would work with a much larger spill 
david pascoe chief of the coast guards environmental response 
branch said that response of officials may have been heightened 
over the weekend because of the reviews they are conducting but he 
said there have been no policy or operational changes since the 
alaskan spill 
no equipment or personnel had to be moved from alaska for the 
latest spills he said 
the workload is also being handled differently 
exxon is paying thousands of workers to clean up oil in the 
alaskan spill private contractors volunteers national guardsmen 
and coast guard personnel are involved in cleaning up the latest 
spills but shippers have to pay the costs 
in each of the latest spills local coast guard officials were 
overseeing the cleanup said pascoe 
he said it was too early for the alaskan spill to have much 
impact on the way the coast guard or other agencies respond to 
spills but he noted congress is considering several measures to 
deal with spills in the wake of the alaskan disaster the oil 
industry last week announced its own plans for a cooperative 
response

fines because they did not report toxic chemical releases under a 
citizens righttoknow law that took effect last year says the 
environmental protection agency 
the epa announced its latest enforcement action monday against 
companies that failed to comply with the law saying that 165 
million in fines were placed against 42 companies in 20 states 
the agency previously took action against 43 other companies 
epa administrator william k reilly said the agency will continue 
to pursue civil penalties against companies that do not comply with 
the disclosure law 
we will not allow nonreporting companies to thwart the right 
of citizens to find out which toxic chemicals are being released 
into their communities said reilly in a statement 
the penalties announced monday ranged from 5000 to a high of 
262000 against a california electronics firm diceon electronics 
which allegedly failed to report toxic chemical releases at 
facilities in irvine and chatsworth calif 
the second highest fine was against international extrusion 
corp waxalachie texas which was assessed a 101000 penalty 
officials from the two companies could not be reached for comment 
monday 
nearly 20000 companies nationwide filed the chemical release 
disclosure reports which covered 1987 before the filing deadline 
last july the statistics recently provided the first detailed 
glimpse into the volume of toxic chemicals that are being released 
into the air water and soil by industry each year 
but the epa has estimated that about 20 percent of the businesses 
subject to the disclosure requirement may not have complied with the 
law during the first reporting period 
the second round of reports covering releases in 1988 are due to 
be filed at the end of this month 
in addition to seeking fines from the 85 companies the agency 
has filed formal notices of noncompliance against more than 1500 
other companies although no civil penalties in those cases have yet 
been sought 
epa spokesman luke hester said the amount of the fine proposed 
against any single company depended on the size of the business 
total quantity of a chemical not reported and quantities 
manufactured failure to report chemical releases can result in 
civil penalties of up to 25000 a day 
the companies may appeal the proposed civil penalties and request 
a formal hearing 
the other companies fined in the latest enforcement action were

president bush welcoming five dozen state and 
local officials into the gop says the political converts are just 
part of the droves of voters being shut out by a leftleaning 
democratic party 
bush who often extols the virtues of bipartisanship in dealing 
with congress reached back for some campaignstyle rhetoric monday 
at the white house event where the republicans paraded the 
partyswitchers 
the democratic party is leaving droves of voters behind as it 
moves over onto the more liberal side the left side of the 
political equation and now many of those stranded voters have made 
a move on their own to the republican party our party of family 
faith and the future bush said 
bush had a different sort of white house ceremony on tap today 
with plans to greet australian prime minister bob hawke with full 
military honors followed by a private meeting and in the evening a 
state dinner 
the emphasis was on politics monday when the exdemocrats trekked 
through the oval office to pose for official pictures with the 
president and hear their praises sung in the rose garden by bush 
gop chairman lee atwater and rep bill grant of perry fla who 
made his own switch to the gop in february 
youre tough grant told the state representatives judges 
sheriffs mayors and other officials at home he said youre 
being accused of being a traitor turncoat accused of betraying the 
voters by leaving the democratic party 
bush praised their political courage and promised to stand 
shoulder to shoulder with them as they seek reelection as 
republicans 
the switch is on to the party in sync with the american 
principles the switch is on to the republican party said the 
president 
bush employing the rhetoric he successfully used to hammer 
democrat michael dukakis in the presidential campaign said 
republicans were moving in the right direction 
the democrats are on the move too to the left and out of the 
mainstream he said 
atwater embroiled in controversy recently over a gop attack on 
new house speaker thomas s foley called the event absolutely the 
proudest single moment ive had since taking office 
he said the new republicans were just part of 118 elected 
officials who have switched to the gop since my chairmanship 
began in january 
and i know of no single example of a republican party official 
who has switched the other way he said 
charles evers outgoing mayor of fayette miss and brother of 
slain civil rights leader medgar evers said he switched parties 
because i dont like to be with losers the democratic party is a 
loser 
evers added that he didnt want to see an allwhite republican 
party he said he will try to encourage black voters in mississippi 
to register republican because blacks are better off with 
representation in both parties 
dennis steinberg an allenhurst nj dentist and environmental 
activist running for the state assembly was one of only a few 
politicians from north of the masondixon line identified among the 
new republicans 
he said he changed parties because of bushs promise to make 
ending ocean pollution a priority in his administration

though medical science still has no cure for 
aids federal health officials say new therapies and greater access 
to experimental drugs are extending and improving the quality of 
life of aids patients 
they say this is more reason than ever for people to be tested 
for aids 
a few years ago the diagnosis was a death sentence frank 
young commissioner of the food and drug administration told 
reporters monday in announcing fda action on two drugs for 
aidsrelated conditions 
now theres significant hope to prolong life by warding off 
the infections that invade the weakened immune systems of aids 
victims he said the good news is that there are more therapies 
that are coming to treat the disease early 
commercial approval was granted for the drug ganciclovir for 
treatment of an eye infection that can lead to blindness in aids 
patients about one in every four aids patients gets cytomegalovirus 
retinitis 
the fda also is allowing expanded premarket distribution of an 
experimental protien rerythropoietin to treat severe anemia that 
weakens nearly half of the 20000 patients taking the aidsfighting 
drug azt 
earlier this month the fda approved aerosol pentamidine to 
prevent pneumocystis carinii pneumonia which kills about 60 percent 
of aids victims 
these are important advances but the disease still remains 
demonic young said 
though there is still no cure or vaccine people need to know 
as early as possible what the diagnosis is so they can get the 
proper care 
the fda criticized by aids advocates for moving too slowly in 
getting promising drugs to patients has been moving the approval 
process more quickly while still assuring that experimental drugs 
are safe 
using a special treatment category formally instituted two years 
ago the fda allows premarket distribution of a drug that has been 
shown to be safe and may be effective with this status called 
treatment investigational new drug or treatment ind a drug can 
be distributed more widely while research on its effectiveness 
continues 
young said the fda has also been working with the national 
institutes of health to develop another avenue designed to give more 
aids patients access to experimental drugs this system would allow 
experimental drugs to be distributed to aids patients who do not fit 
the criteria demanded for a clinical trial young said it could 
allow access to drugs several months earlier than a treatment ind 
he said 
more than 100 drugs are being investigated for treatment of 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome and aidsrelated conditions he 
said so far four have been approved but only one zidovudine or 
azt is aimed at stemming the aids viral infection itself the 
other three ganciclovir aerosol pentamidine and alpha interferon 
are used to treat aidsrelated conditions 
the fda said that though studies have shown ganciclovir to be 
effective in retarding the sightthreatening infection extensive 
postmarketing studies are needed to determine whether patients on 
azt can also take ganciclovir both drugs are highly toxic syntex 
corp of palo alto calif will market ganciclovir under the trade 
name cytovene 
rerythropoietin is one of more than a dozen drugs with treatment 
ind status and the fifth aidsrelated drug to have reached this 
category ortho pharmaceutical corp of raritan nj is sponsoring 
the drug and will make it available free to patients while the 
studies continue

washington the latest oil shipping accidents in us waters are 
raising the likelihood congress will widen restrictions on drilling 
in promising areas off the shores of alaska california and other 
states oil industry analysts and lawmakers say 
the house appropriations committee is to consider wednesday a 
bill containing tough limits on oil development in the bristol bay 
area of the southern bering sea and in federally controlled waters 
off california new england and the florida keys 
rep frank pallone dnj predicted monday the legislation will 
pass the full congress this session in part because of publicity 
about oil spills over the weekend in the delaware river in 
houstons ship channel and near newport ri 
they just point out how delicate the nearshore environment 
is pallone said in an interview he wrote letters to several 
major oil companies earlier this month asking them not to bid for 
federal lease sales off the new england coast 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater said monday the 
latest spills show the pervasiveness of the problem but dont 
require new steps by president bush such as initiatives to limit oil 
exploration 
the latest spills were a significant blow to the oil industry 
which is still reeling from the devastating exxon valdez oil spill 
march 24 in alaskas prince william sound 
that accident the worst spill in us history almost 
immediately killed chances for congressional approval of legislation 
to open the arctic national wildlife refuge on alaskas north 
slope to oil and natural gas exploration 
a further consequence of the recent tanker accidents and public 
criticism of the industrys cleanup response may be a new ban on 
exploration in bristol bay a rich fishing area alaskas state 
government says is more vulnerable to spill damage than prince 
william sound 
theyll stop bristol bay exploration dillard spriggs 
president of the new york consulting company petroleum analysis 
ltd said monday its going to be hard to explore very much in 
alaska until the industry improves its public image 
although most of the capitol hill focus on offshore oil 
exploration has been limited to alaska california florida and new 
england movements to ban or slow down drilling have emerged in 
oregon washington north carolina and south carolina 
the oil industry long aware of political pressures to limit 
offshore drilling until recently sought to rely on its past safety 
record and assertions that less domestic drilling will mean more 
us reliance on foreign suppliers 
but since the valdez accident exposed the industrys inability to 
handle largescale spills oil companies have tried to take the 
offensive by promising to devote more money personnel and equipment 
to responding to major accidents 
the latest spills came just days after a special task force of 
oil executives announced plans to spend 250 million over five years 
to create a nationwide network of cleanup equipment and workers to 
handle a major spill on any coastal waterway the cleanup system is 
not expected to be working until next summer 
the american petroleum institute representing the major oil 
companies gave a muted response to the weekend spills it said 
although its proposed regional response centers will be designed to 
handle worse disasters the centers could have been called into 
action by the government if they had been in place 
the industry counters antidrilling arguments by noting that us 
dependence on foreign oil has risen sharply in recent years 
imported oil makes up about 45 percent of total us supplies and 
the foreign share is expected to grow unless major oil fields are 
discovered on federal land 
the industry and the bush administration say such reliance on 
foreign suppliers undermines us energy security and means more 
environmental risk from foreign tanker traffic 
bush is awaiting the recommendations of a task force he assembled 
in march to review potential environment damage from oil and natural 
gas drilling in federal waters off northern and southern california 
and the southern gulf coast of florida the group is to report by 
jan 1

abuse and mismanagement may be everywhere in 
the department of housing and urban development say investigators 
who confess they dont know where their probe will be headed next 
we have made the assumption that there is a problem within 
every unit within hud and until we learn that there isnt were 
going to assume that there is said rep christopher shays 
rconn a member of the congressional panel investigating the 
department 
so far the investigations have roamed from one unrelated program 
to the next and have been shotgunned from one part of the nation to 
another 
a sampling from around the country 
in denver us attorney mike norton says his office is 
investigating allegations that a suspended hud accountant embezzled 
some 1 million in housing funds 
in indianapolis auditors are trying to account for 176965 
arising from 11 property sales 
in philadelphia a pair of real estate brokers are awaiting 
trial on charges of defrauding hud of more than 900000 
in atlanta us attorney robert barrs office has filed a civil 
suit against two atlanta men the justice department says kept 
proceeds from hud real estate closings the lawsuit which contends 
hud lost 840000 in payments and 860000 in interest seeks 75 
million in damages 
in the maryland suburbs of washington dc a private escrow 
agent has confessed to stealing more than 5 million from hud her 
role was to help the department close on sales of repossessed homes 
by signing papers and accepting the buyers money for the property 
marilyn harrell nicknamed robin hud because she gave some of 
the stolen money to the poor told investigators her operation was 
simple she just didnt give the government its money 
on monday ms harrell turned over her house to the department to 
cover part of the thefts ms harrell and unidentified agents in 
texas and alabama became the first agents that hud will bar from 
future government contracts the washington post reported today 
quoting frank keating hud general counseldesignate 
investigations involve 11 other private escrow agents around the 
country and as much as 20 million of hud funds may have been taken 
this way according to paul adams the departments inspector 
general 
on another front revealed just this week hud has moved to halt 
losses from a loan program where some 650 million in mortgages are 
in default the department moved swiftly to suspend three mortgage 
companies indefinitely put three others on sixmonth probations and 
review the operations of still three more 
hud officials say a certain amount of fraud is to be expected in 
a 20 billion government agency involved chiefly in making loans and 
giving away money to help people get shelter and aid the nations 
cities 
but what began quietly as an inhouse investigation more than a 
year ago has since exploded into charges of influencepeddling 
betrayal and mismanagement by the people who once held the highest 
offices in the department 
former secretary samuel pierce jr has been criticized for his 
handsoff style of management his onetime top aide deborah gore 
dean invoked the fifth amendment when asked about her role in 
handing out hud grants to developers who sometimes paid sixfigure 
sums to bigname republicans to get favorable consideration for 
their projects 
geography made little difference money went to projects in new 
jersey as well as those in new mexico 
the problem was at the top said rep barney frank dmass 
another member of the house committee investigating hud deborah 
dean was in charge of america 
shays agreed 
people who were not fit to hold office were in charge of that 
agency he said monday mr pierce had a good resume he 
inherited an agency in disarray and left it worse than he found it 
there is always a problem in a democratic society of a 
pushpull said frank the people who are trying to politicize a 
program are pulling against the people who are trying to run it 
nonpolitically 
the difference with hud was there were no people with real 
authority to run it nonpolitically that you had people in charge 
at the top who just didnt care about the program

drug czar william j bennett rejects criticism 
that he has hired people inexperienced with drug issues saying his 
assistants understand the problem and what they dont know he finds 
out from his kitchen cabinet 
theres plenty of experience bennett said in an interview 
there isnt anybody who knows all of it all the people here know 
various pieces we call on our colleagues in the government all the 
time certainly on the hill too 
he can call on other experts to fill in some of the gaps said 
bennett director of the office of national drug control policy 
calling in the experts is fine he said you dont have to 
have everybody on staff ive been given a fairly small staff and i 
have to make it travel a long way 
rep lawrence j smith dfla chairman of the house foreign 
affairs committees task force on international narcotics and new 
york citys chief narcotics officer said in interviews that bennett 
will have difficulty drawing up a national drug strategy due in 
september with his current staff 
the comments echoed criticisms against bennett by some federal 
officials who spoke only on condition of anonymity 
hes not going to be able to draw up a comprehensive strategy 
and prevent turf wars and figure out how to minimize duplication 
without having people who have worked in the agencies and know how 
to do that smith said 
bennett himself without any real drug experience has 
surrounded himself with people who dont have any real drug 
experience and without that theyre going to be operating in a 
vacuum he said 
sterling johnson jr new york citys special narcotics 
prosecutor said there is no one that i know of with any real law 
enforcement experience on his team 
johnson said bennett has asked him to join his kitchen 
cabinet of unofficial advisers and hell probably do so 
i told him that i want him to succeed if he fails we all 
fail said johnson 
john walters bennetts chief of staff defended the offices 
experience saying more than half of its 60 workers have been sent 
there from every major federal agency involved in antidrug 
efforts 
some three dozen federal agencies including the drug enforcement 
administration the coast guard and the departments of education and 
health and human services are part of the war against illegal drugs 
some of the officials criticizing bennett come from agencies that 
opposed congress creation of his office which is charged with 
scrutinizing their budgets and priorities as it develops a national 
strategy 
that oversight role as well as traditional rivalry between 
agencies may be responsible for some of the complaints walters 
said in an interview 
frankly i am suspicious of some of the offers for help 
because those take the form of a desire to write the strategy for us 
from people in particular agencies on the hill and elsewhere 
walters said we want competent staff help but we do not want 
someone to do our job for us 
bennett also has generated criticism by deciding not to fill many 
permanent positions until his top two deputies are in place 
depending for now on temporary staffers detailed from other agencies 
his candidates for the deputy slots us marshals service 
director stanley morris for the supply reduction job and dr herbert 
kleber of yale university for the demand reduction job have not 
yet been nominated by the white house kleber is already on the 
payroll as a consultant 
bennett said he has urged the white house to act on the 
nominations and he presumed the need for thorough background checks 
was causing the delay 
but he added that he consults with both men regularly and the 
empty posts will not hinder preparation of an antidrug strategy

a freelance paleontologist was explaining 
to a group of 7yearolds what dinosaur bones looked like when he 
stumbled on the real thing 
the june 10 birthday party outing led by peter kranz to a housing 
construction site resulted in the discovery of what may be the most 
complete fossilized skeleton of the dinosaur age found in the 
washington dc area in a century said nicholas hotton a 
research curator of paleobiology at the smithsonian institutions 
museum of natural history 
kranz said he was describing fossilized dinosaur bones to the 
children when he found a chunk of dark carbon other fragments were 
uncovered then kranz sent the young amateurs home and called the 
smithsonian 
i was nervous about handling such a large specimen kranz 
said hotton exposed more of the find and confirmed its significance 
the find included a portion of the head and skeleton of a 20foot 
mosasaur a large seagoing predatory lizard that thrived during the 
late cretaceous period about 70 million years ago said hotton who 
has worked at the smithsonian for 30 years specializing in fossil 
reptiles 
for kranz the find is especially timely his book dinosaurs 
in maryland has just been published as part of an educational 
series by the maryland geological survey kranz teaches classes in

romania is tearing down a barbed wire 
fence it had constructed along the hungarian border in an apparent 
bid to stop people from fleeing the staterun mti news agency 
reported 
at a human rights conference in paris last week even the soviet 
union criticized its warsaw pact ally for putting up the fence 
the wire curtain and the concrete pillars were almost 
completely removed from saturday to monday mti said monday 
hungarian foreign minister gyula horn on a visit to austria 
said monday i havent heard it yet but the news delights me 
horn called for romania to reestablish an autonomous region to 
safeguard ethnic and cultural rights of its 17 millionmember 
hungarian minority many ethnic hungarians have fled romania 
complaining of persecution 
mti said the dismantling of the fence was announced by col janos 
pal commander of hungarian frontier guards in the oroshaza 
district 
during the first five months of this year 3231 romanians 
crossed illegally into hungary hungarian officials said 
about 30000 romanians have fled to hungary in recent years 
seeking refuge from chronic hardships and discrimination under 
president nicolae ceausescu 
relations between hungary and romania have been deterioratating 
as communist authorities in budapest prepare to embrace 
multiparty democracy and free elections next year ceausescus 
hardline government is going ahead with plans to raze thousands of 
villages to force assimilation 
mti reported june 20 that romania had completed a barbed wire 
fence 6 feet to 8 feet high along 90 percent of the countries 
common border 
a subsequent mti report said romanian authorities had piled sand 
on roads leading to the border apparently to block traffic and 
border guards had noticed a kind of steel car trap 
mti said romania started building the fence 1 years ago but the 
pace of construction was speeded up in march

the federal government cleared the way for 
strip mining in a national forest in ohio after a skimpy review and 
without independent documentation congressional investigators say 
no record exists which suggests that the office of surface 
mining conducted a thorough analysis before deciding a coal 
company had a legal right to strip mine in wayne national forest 
said a report by the house interior committees mining subcommittee 
the agency violated its own policy when it determined belville 
coal co could strip mine for coal on 5440 acres of the 
governmentprotected land in southern ohio the report said 
it is improper for the office of surface mining to have based 
this decision on considerations other than its stated policy it 
concluded it is inappropriate for a decision of this magnitude 
to have been based on a dearth of written independent agency 
analysis and supporting agency documentation 
interior department spokesman john wright on monday said a deputy 
assistant secretary was reviewing the wayne forest determination 
to see what prompted the decision how it was based the office 
of surface mining is part of the interior department

president bush and senates in illinois and california want 
penalties for desecrating old glory and a town that prides itself 
as flag city usa planned a rally against a us supreme court 
ruling permitting flag burning 
we take our patriotism very seriously in findlay said 
marjory buckingham organizer of a rally for flag and country 
planned for thursday in the northwest ohio city we feel that any 
desecration of the flag is wrong and people who burn flags should 
know how we feel 
the supreme court ruled wednesday that burning the american flag 
as a form of protest is protected by freespeech guarantees 
if there is a bedrock principle underlying the first amendment 
it is that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea 
simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or 
disagreeable justice william j brennan said in his opinion for 
the court 
the us senate reacted friday by passing legislation aimed at 
making desecration of the flag unlawful and the house may consider 
a similar resolution this week 
bush supports legislation prohibiting the desecration of the 
flag but has not decided whether to back a constitutional 
amendement his spokesman said monday 
press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush shares the views of 
members of congress and others who have all expressed their feeling 
that the flag should not be desecrated in any way 
bush who said after the ruling that flag burning is dead 
wrong told the new york times in an interview published today 
that he has asked attorney general dick thornburgh and chief of 
staff john h sununu to recommend ways to circumvent the supreme 
court decision 
bush said he was openminded about how to protect the flag 
lawmakers are divided on whether to offer legislation or seek a 
constitutional amendment 
in sacramento the california assembly voted 582 monday to ask 
congress to amend the constitution to outlaw flag burning 
what kind of message are we sending our children when we say 
its ok to burn the flag republican assemblyman tim leslie asked 
in a debate in which he described his fathers death during world 
war ii and displayed the flag used for his fathers services 
democratic assemblyman john burton who opposed the resolution 
said our country is great because we allow people to be wrong 
and do some stupidly outrageous things 
in illinois the senate unanimously approved a bill monday that 
would make it a felony to intentionally place the flag on a floor 
offenders could receive up to six years in prison the measure goes 
to gov james r thompson 
the bill was one of several proposed in response to an art 
institute of chicago exhibit that featured a flag on the gallery 
floor 
the bills sponsor democratic sen thomas dunn said placing the 
flag on the floor is the most insulting thing to do in this 
country 
the senate on friday also approved a resolution that calls for 
congress to take measures to protect the flag from desecration 
in findlay about 1000 people are expected to attend the rally 
ms buckingham said 
its a hard pill to swallow that the supreme court would pass a 
ruling that would support the burning of the american flag after 
americans have given their lives for it said thomas mazey 
commander of a veterans of foreign wars post in the ohio town

a strain of the aids virus thats widespread in 
west africa but is rare in the united states has infected at least 
four people in new york city authorities said 
the four confirmed and two unconfirmed but likely cases of hiv2 
infections represent the largest concentration of such infections in 
north america the new york times reported today 
they were discovered among hundreds of blood samples from people 
who sought to be tested for aids in new york city officials said 
the bad news is that yes hiv2 infection is here said city 
health commissioner dr stephen c joseph the good news is it 
apparently has not gotten into the blood supply 
hiv2 is not always detected by standard aids tests the finding 
means uncertainty for people who already have passed such tests and 
also means blood banks will have a tougher time making sure a 
donation is aidsfree 
but aids researchers say the number of hiv2infected people in 
the united states is probably small and mostly limited to immigrants 
from western africa the times said 
dr james curran director of aids programs at the federal 
centers for disease control said that while hiv2 cases are likely 
to become more common in this country it is not currently a great 
threat to the public 
curran said that outside new york there have been fewer than 10 
reports of hiv2 infections in the country 
the standard aids test is designed to detect antibodies generated 
by the hiv1 virus it is able to detect hiv2 between 45 percent 
and 90 percent of the time curran said citing figures presented at 
an international aids conference in montreal 
health officials say americas blood supply appears safe if an 
aids test is inconclusive blood banks discard the donation and 
blood banks routinely ask donors who are in high aidsrisk groups 
not to give blood or to donate it for research rather than 
transfusion 
health experts disagree on whether hiv2 is as dangerous as hiv1 
some studies suggest that fewer hiv2infected people go on to 
develop fullblown aids but researchers note that hiv1 has had 
longer to spread and develop and that the development of symptoms 
may take more time in an hiv2 infection

a tribunal of cubas highestranking military 
officers recommended early today that a highlydecorated general be 
courtmartialed for allegedly organizing rings that trafficked in 
cocaine ivory and diamonds 
the staterun news agency prensa latina said the 47member 
tribunal recommended after two days of hearings that division gen 
arnalfo ochoa be dishonorably discharged and lose all his military 
honors 
the panel called ochoas acts a serious blow to cubas 
international prestige and said they threatened national security 
it said a serious lack of moral character and corruption 
dishonest management improper use and pilferage of economic 
resources had been proved 
in testimony broadcast by staterun television monday witnesses 
told of officers under ochoas 198788 command in angola selling 
troops supplies on the black market smuggling diamonds and ivory 
and receiving kickbacks 
they also said he had helped colombian cocaine bosses use cuba as 
a way station for smuggling operations to the united states 
the witnesses three colonels two lieutenant colonels and two 
captains testified before the tribunal on sunday the day ochoa 
admitted guilt and accepted responsibility for his actions 
according to prensa latina 
defense minister gen raul castro brother of president fidel 
castro told the tribunal sunday that ochoas punishment should 
set an example 
some foreign ministry officials interpreted this to mean ochoa 
might face a firing squad but others speculated ochoa might be 
spared because of his combat service his long friendship with the 
defense chief and his high rank 
in their testimony the witnesses gave detailed accounts of black 
market dealings involving diamonds ivory sugar tv sets tape 
recorders coffee wheat dried fish and sides of beef 
most said they had believed the sales and conversion of the 
proceeds into dollars were geared to shoring up the troubled cuban 
economy they also said they believed the money was meant to improve 
the quality of life of the cuban troops in angola who were helping 
the marxist goverment fight guerrillas 
at least 200000 of the proceeds from those sales ended up in a 
panamanian bank account apparently managed by ochoa witnesses said 
they testified that part of the money went toward buying 
refrigerators stereo equipment juice extractors a bed and 
clothing for several officers including ochoa 
capt jorge martinez valdez ochoas assistant and one of the 
witnesses testified that he began moneylaundering transactions 
with panamanians and colombians as early as 1985 on behalf of ochoa 
he described direct contacts with leaders of the medellin cartel 
the worlds largest cocainesmuggling operation based in colombia 
martinez said that the colombians were under the impression that 
their cuban connection had official sanction 
the colombians thought that we were official representatives of 
cuba martinez testified in the visit to cuba they were put up 
at an official protocol house and a mercedesbenz was placed at 
their disposal 
martinez said the colombians during one of their three visits to 
cuba proposed printing dollars in cuba and even setting up a 
cocaine laboratory on the caribbean island he said the cuban 
officers involved only accepted helping the colombians push their 
product toward the united states 
martinez said he traveled to colombia on a false passport 
provided by the cartel and met with cartel head pablo escobar he 
said the drug lord talked about obtaining some groundtoair 
missiles for his own personal protection so he could defend 
himself against helicopters 
cuba has mounted an intensive public relations campaign against 
ochoa describing his alleged corruption in extraordinary detail in 
granma the official newspaper of the ruling communist party 
in a break from its usual reticence to report on internal 
affairs prensa latina has distributed extensive reports on the drug 
scandal 
ochoa was decorated for his service as a field commander in 
angola in 1987 and 1988 and is one of only five officers ever 
awarded the hero of the republic of cuba

a grant from a tobacco company is 
keeping the national womens hall of fame open and one of the 
nations leading feminists is incensed 
after launching an urgent fundraising drive june 13 the halls 
board of directors on monday announced that a 35000 donation from 
the philip morris companies and a 100000 gannett foundation grant 
would provide funds for five years 
but the decision to take money from philip morris whose products 
include cigarettes drew heat from molly yard president of the 
national organization for women 
smoking is a feminist issue yard said cigarettes are 
killing women womens organizations are going to have to stop 
taking money from the merchants of death 
the news of the donations brought hearty applause from a meeting 
of about 50 hall members led by board president jane e howland 
howland said she is a former smoker and i think everybody ought 
to quit but she said smoking is still legal in this country i 
might feel a little different if it was the mafia i might not as 
long as the money was there 
the hall founded in 1968 is located in an old bank building in 
this upstate new york village that bills itself as the birthplace 
of womens rights elizabeth cady stanton and 300 other women held 
the first us womens right convention here in 1848 and issued a 
demand for equal schooling and wages for women as well as suffrage 
the womens rights national historical park which commemorates 
that event is funded by the department of the interior 
but the hall a private nonprofit educational institute had 
overdrawn its operating account and was 68000 in debt before the 
drive 
philip morris spokeswoman posie disesa said the company made its

prosecutors praised supreme court decisions that allow the 
execution of teenage or retarded murderers but defense attorneys 
and civil rights groups said the rulings degraded the nation 
in two 54 votes monday the supreme court said the 
constitutions ban on cruel and unusual punishment does not prohibit 
execution of juveniles as young as age 16 or adults with the 
reasoning capacity of children 
georgia attorney general michael bowers noted that the court last 
year threw out the death sentence of an oklahoman who murdered at 
age 15 and said the rulings together provided a clear age 
delineation for prosecutors and lawmakers considering capital 
punishment 
lines have to be drawn somewhere bowers said on abctvs 
nightline program i do not think the line is drawn 
inappropriately 
henry schwarzschild of the american civil liberties unions 
capital punishment project in new york however called the decision 
barbaric and medieval 
if you were to open up the paper tomorrow and read that the 
french government or the british or some other civilized nation were 
holding 30 kids that were going to be executed youd think good 
god wrong dateline they mean iraq or bangladesh schwarzschild 
said 
of the 2200 convicted murderers on death rows in the united 
states at least 32 committed their crimes under age 18 
at least 11 states have one or more inmates under a death penalty 
for crimes committed before they were 18 according to state 
officials texas topped the list with nine followed by alabama and 
georgia with four each 
mike hoey a lobbyist for the missouri catholic conference said 
the ruling probably will make it more difficult to persuade state 
lawmakers to pass a measure setting 18 as the minimum age at which 
murderers can be subjected to capital punishment 
hoey who unsuccessfully pushed such a measure during the 1989 
session said many lawmakers think its political suicide to 
vote against the death penalty although voters who support capital 
punishment might be more lenient toward teenagers 
adolescents dont think out the consequences of their acts 
hoey said its an emotional turbulent time of their lives 
although they can do adult acts they dont think like adults 
the high courts ruling upheld death sentences for kevin 
stanford who was 17 when he abducted and murdered a gas station 
attendant in 1981 and heath wilkins 16 when he stabbed a kansas 
city mo area liquor store clerk to death in 1985 
wilkins crime was especially gruesome he stabbed nancy allen a 
26yearold mother of two in the back and chest and stabbed her 
four times in the throat after she pleaded for mercy 
missouri attorney general william webster said arguments that the 
ruling would lead to largescale executions of minors was 
hogwash 
theres a lot of people that say its going to open the door 
thats ludicrous said webster 
webster said that before a juvenile can face the death penalty 
he or she has to be certified as an adult go through a battery of 
mental exams and have their age considered as a mitigating 
circumstance by the judge 
william l touchette the attorney for paula cooper said the 
ruling probably will not affect her case she was 15 when she 
stabbed a retired gary ind bible teacher to death her case has 
drawn international attention and a call for clemency from pope john 
paul ii 
in its ruling the supreme court said convicted murderers have a 
right to demand that sentencing juries and judges consider mental 
retardation as a possible mitigating factor 
arguments on cruel and unusual punishment have been raised in two 
pending california cases with mentally impaired defendants said 
deputy attorney general dane gillette in san francisco 
in one case james richard odle of pinole was sentenced to death 
for the 1980 slaying of a woman and the killing of a policeman three 
days later 
defense lawyers have cited the brain damage odle suffered in a 
1973 auto accident and a later lobotomy operation that removed a 
portion of his brain in the second case melvin meffrey wade a 
mentally disturbed san bernardino man was condemned for the torture 
murder of his 10yearold stepdaughter in 1981

willie star the state department wants to talk 
to you 
tw willie star is listed as the ambassador to the united 
states from nauru a tiny dot in the western pacific and is next in 
line to become dean of the diplomatic corps in washington that is 
if hes still the ambassador and if he returns to the united states 
star presented his credentials to president carter on june 6 
1980 and then vanished for a long time he doubled as naurus 
ambassador to australia and was living in melbourne 
but while the state department couldnt find star he was quietly 
going about his business as the consulgeneral in guam about 1000 
miles northwest of nauru 
star reached by telephone from hawaii said he has been naurus 
consulgeneral there for about a year and seemed puzzled that the 
state department was looking for him 
i have to talk to my government he said today in response 
to questions 
but star wasnt sure about his diplomatic status in the united 
states asked if he is still naurus ambassador to the united 
states he answered i dont think so i dont know ill have to 
talk to my government and refused elaboration 
stars presence on guam half a world away from washington 
explains why hes little known in the capital city 
ive never met him but i understand hes in his 40s and that 
hes been an ambassador for some time said fred radewagen a 
parttime consultant for the government of nauru im told that 
hes articulate gregarious and quite intelligent 
the state departments manhunt began shortly after the retirement 
last month of swedish ambassador wilhelm wachtmeister who was dean 
of the diplomatic corps for three years 
under the rules of protocol the largely ceremonial post goes to 
the foreign ambassador with the most seniority based on the date 
when the envoys credentials were presented to the us president 
to be eligible an ambassador must maintain an official residence 
here 
that ruled out the diplomatic representative from western samoa 
who was next in line but doesnt live in washington next was the 
southwestern pacific nation of tuvalu but its ambassador had 
already been transferred elsewhere 
then came cypriot ambassador andrew jacovides who had barely 
succeeded to the deanship when he was summoned home for a job in the 
foreign ministry next on the list was turkeys sukru elekdag but 
hes retiring 
so up popped the mystery name of tw star who was listed as the 
only ambassador of the steaming hot island of nauru the third 
smallest country in the world after vatican city and monaco and 
surely on nobodys list as a vacation paradise 
the fewer than 9000 people who inhabit naurus eight square 
miles of coral just south of the equator must endure an average 82 
inches of rainfall annually they are consoled however by the 
wealth of their phosphate mines which produce 100 million a year 
in fertilizer exports 
although nauru does have swaying palm trees radewagen said 
theyve been digging a large part of the island and carting it 
away for years and now its so pockmarked and barren that it looks 
like the badlands of south dakota 
the state department sent a letter to star via the us 
ambassador in australia earlier this month informing him of his 
opportunity to become dean of the diplomatic corps provided he 
moves his residence to washington so far star has not replied 
meanwhile several cables have been dispatched to us embassy 
officials in canberra about the matter but they havent said much 
of anything reported one insider 
if star doesnt respond by the time jacovides leaves washington 
for cyprus in early july they said the job probably will be 
offered to the next in line ambassador jose luis fernandes lopes of 
cape verde 
one state department official who spoke only on condition that 
he not be identified said he has a hunch star completed his 
washington assignment some time ago and the nauru government never 
bothered to name a successor 
he is still on the books as ambassador but im not sure he 
really is the official said

the vatican has turned down an appeal by 14 roman 
catholic churches of an archdiocesan order to close by july 1 and 
five parishes that had planned to defy cardinal edmund szoka were 
reconsidering their opposition 
the vaticans sacred congregation for the clergy rejected the 14 
appeals filed in march as lacking foundation in law and fact 
archdiocese spokesman jay berman said monday the archdiocese has 
announced plans to close 30 churches due to declining membership 
there is a real discouragement among the people here that rome 
didnt care about the injustices that have happened sister jolene 
van handel said van handel is coordinator of the detroit catholic 
pastoral alliance a coalition of priests and laypeople opposed to 
szokas plan 
nine parishes had said they would remain open but some 
opposition eroded after a series of private weekend meetings between 
priests and szoka who ordered the closings in january after two 
committees made up of church and civic leaders recommended the plan 
two parishes that had planned to defy the cardinal said they now 
expect to accept the order and close by friday the pastor of a 
third congregation urged his parishioners to drop their opposition 
another pastor said monday he will try to convince his members to 
close and a fifth parish said it now was undecided 
wayne county circuit court judge james hathaway is scheduled to 
consider a request by 18 parishes for an injunction against the 
closings at a hearing wednesday

a palestinian inmate at israels desert prison 
camp killed two fellow arabs and israel radio said the attacker was 
retaliating for the prisoners alleged collaboration with israel 
the killings discovered today during the morning prisoner count 
raised to four the number of prisoners slain in the last two weeks 
at the ketziot prison in the negev desert 
in jersualem a spokesman for prime minister yitzhak shamir said 
the israeli leader planned to hold the first meeting on his peace 
plan in july with palestinian leaders from the occupied territories 
shamir spokesman avi pazner denied reports in the israeli media 
that shamir will meet with supporters of the palestine liberation 
organization which has rejected the plan 
in its report on the overnight prison slayings israel radio said 
the killer attacked the two victims because he suspected them of 
collaborating with israeli authorities 
the army confirmed the deaths but said police were still 
investigating the reason for the murders an army spokesman 
identified the victims as mahmoud abdul abedgalla and ali hijazi 
taaf both of the occupied gaza strip 
the spokesman who may not be identified under military 
regulations said a fellow inmate was arrested and confessed to the 
murders he gave no details on how or exactly why the men were 
murdered 
last week at the prison a 23yearold palestinian carried the 
body of mohammed faraj abu jadalla out of a tent threw it in front 
of a guard and said he strangled jadalla because the man 
collaborated with israeli authorities the news agency itim said 
earlier in the week another palestinian 19yearold samir 
mohammed antiz was found dead in his tent 
israel radio said antiz apparently was killed by fellow prisoners 
who accused him of collaborating with the israeli authorities 
also today a 17yearold palestinian died of wounds sustained in 
a clash with troops on saturday arab hospital officials and the 
army said the victim identified as tarek salih awad was wounded 
during a confrontation in the west bank village of idna 
the three deaths today raised to 539 the palestinian death toll 
in the 1yearold uprising against israeli rule seventy of the 
victims have been killed by fellow arabs as collaborators 
twentythree israelis also have been slain 
in the gaza strip troops opened fire on a group of palestinian 
stonethrowers today and wounded 13 people including four 
11yearolds arab hospital officials said 
an army spokesman said the military was investigating the 
incident 
also today israel radio quoted police as saying that ballistics 
tests showed a 20yearold bedouin shepherd fatally wounded friday 
was shot by one of seven jewish settlers held in connection with a 
settler raid on a west bank village 
police did not release the name of the accused the radio said 
the haaretz newspaper published a poll showing israelis are 
almost evenly divided on whether settler vigilante raids in reaction 
to arab stonethrowing attacks are justified 
the poll conducted by the tel avivbased pori institute said 
443 percent of the 1200 israelis questioned found the attacks 
justified and 446 percent did not 
seven percent said raids should depend on the circumstances and 
4 percent gave no answer no margin of error for the poll was given 
in his comments pazner said shamir would begin meetings with 
palestinian leaders from both the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
in july israel captured the territories in the 1967 middle east war 
from neighboring arab states 
shamirs plan calls for elections and limited autonomy in the 
occupied territories the plo and most palestinian leaders instead 
support an independent palestinian state 
there will be no plo supporters pazner said when asked about 
news reports that such people would be included he said palestinian 
leaders have agreed to attend but he would not reveal their names

a smouldering controversy among bible scholars 
has burst into the open over the long delay in publishing the rest 
of the dead sea scrolls 
although the firstcentury manuscripts were found 42 years ago 
fewer than half has been published and some researchers in ancient 
religious history say theyre fed up with waiting 
its disgraceful said historian morton smith of columbia 
university charging that the scrolls editors have sat on the 
material for years keeping it from other scholars and the public 
the scrolls contain portions of the old testament far older than 
any previously available it also contains documents about jewish 
life during the early days of christianity 
much of the material has remained only in the hands of a small 
team of scholars deciphering it 
david noel freedman professor of biblical studies at the 
university of michigan said 40 years is much too long to keep the 
material from public scrutiny 
only the scroll scholars and their friends know what is going 
on he said in a telephone interview theyve kept that work in 
the dark and a whole generation has gone by its long past time for 
some changes 
smith said the inaccessbility has caused him to postpone 
research ive just been disgusted he said 
this is an important body of material for understanding both 
intellectual and religious history he said for it to be kept 
secret from other scholars and general knowledge i think is simply 
outrageous 
renewed complaints about the matter were published in the current 
issue of the bimonthly biblical archaeology review which headlined 
an editorial dead sea scrolls scandal 
harvard universitys john strugnell who heads the scroll team of 
about 20 scholars said critics are unaware of the complexities of 
the work he also said the work is being speeded up 
they are ignorant of a project like this he said in a 
telephone interview from jerusalem they dont know the kind of 
material were working with we must deal always with small 
fragments that must be put together 
he acknowledged the work had gone too slowly for the first 20 
years mainly because of a lack of financing only three volumes of 
scrolls were put out during that period but nine volumes have been 
produced since l976 
we are producing he said its slow business but were 
getting faster an immense amount of work is being done 
freedman editor of a 30volume anchor series being publish by 
doubleday on books of the bible said that within a year or two 
after such manuscripts are found photographic slides should be 
available to any scholar 
for a single person to retain access to these materials is 
simply unacceptable he said 
the scrolls contain portions of every book of the old testament 
and are about 1000 years older than any previously available 
biblical manuscripts including the complete book of isaiah and much 
of lamentations 
there also are documents of the qumron community of ascetics 
known as the essenes including a still unpublished muchawaited 
letter from the head of the community the teacher of righteousness 
to jerusalems high priest 
we hope to have that out by the end of the year strugnell 
said thats a top priority 
in jerusalem israels department of antiquities under which the 
work is being done said it has set up a timetable in which the 
scholars had agreed to publish all of their materials by 1996 
amir drori head of the department said the scholars had been 
urged to share the workload with other researchers 
if someone does not complete his work on time we have the 
right to deliver the scrolls to someone else drori said 
the team of which strugnell is a part began their work about 
1954 he said that intitially there was insufficient funding 
available for it but he has found donors to fill that gap 
for the last five or six years weve been trying to get 
additional scholars on the project he said that should 
acclerate it

the convictions of three of new jerseys most 
powerful mafia members in a plot to kill reputed new york godfather 
john gotti and his brother are a major setback for the mob 
prosecutors said 
we have a hope of making organized crime a historic relic 
rather than something that preys on people in the community year in 
and year out assistant us attorney michael chertoff said monday 
a federal jury monday convicted louis a bobby manna of 
jersey city the reputed consigliere or no 3 leader of the 
genovese crime family restaurateur martin motts casella and 
enforcer richard bocci desciscio of plotting to kill gotti the 
flamboyant reputed boss of the rival gambino family and his brother 
gene 
they also were found guilty of arranging the 1987 new york 
restaurant murder of irwin schiff a 350pound moblinked 
businessman 
also convicted of racketeering conspiracy were the groups arms 
supplier former hoboken police lt frank dipsy daniello and 
laborers union official rocco j napoli john derrico 27 of 
hoboken a cook at casellas restaurant was acquitted on all counts 
but a gambling charge 
the jury returned the verdict on the morning of its fifth day of 
deliberations after a 3month trial 
us attorney samuel a alito jr said the convictions were 
particularly damaging because the genovese family dominated mafia 
activity in northern new jersey 
any organization that can plot to kill john and gene gotti from 
the rival gambino crime family is obviously a very powerful force 
said alito mannas faction has operated since the 1950s with 
virtual impunity he said 
the fbi tipped gotti to the plot he was targeted in a power 
struggle authorities said 
the government has said schiff may have been killed because he 
threatened to expose genovese activity or because he could no longer 
be trusted with a 25 million40 million mob moneylaundering 
operation 
the defendants barely reacted to the verdict announcements 
desciscio blinked and looked away as his wife ellen sobbed 
us district judge maryanne trump barry ordered that all the 
defendants except derrico be held until sentencing 
manna casella and desciscio face up to 65 years in prison 
napoli 75 or more daniello 40 and derrico five 
david ruhnke desciscios attorney said the verdict left him 
extremely disappointed 
i can understand the jury believing people were involved in 
gambling ruhnke said its very difficult to believe my client 
was involved in murder

venetians have decided to stay together 
defeating a referendum that called for divorcing the romantic lagoon 
city from a dependent bluecollar suburb on the mainland 
the referendum with balloting on sunday and monday was pressed 
for by officials in mestre a community that is administratively 
part of the city across the causeway but has little in common with 
the fabled place of singing gondoliers and smelly canals 
mestre politicians say the growing communitys needs are 
different from those of aging touristchoked venice and that 
mestres identity is overwhelmed by venices fame 
while citizens of mestre outnumber the citizens of historic 
venice 31 the measure nevertheless went down to defeat 58 
percent against separation 42 percent in favor 
lacking affordable housing young venetians have been steadily 
moving out of the lagoon city to mestre 
in 1951 historic venice had 175000 people while mestre had 
about 50000 
in 1987 venices population stood at 83000 while mestre has 
250000 
with souvenir stores far outnumbering butcher and grocery shops 
remaining venetians depend greatly on mestre for shopping 
ten years ago a group of influential venetians lobbied for a 
similar referendum that proposal was defeated with more than 72 
percent of the voters opposed to separation

rules for humane treatment of laboratory 
animals adopted by this city will serve as a rallying point for 
protection campaigns elsewhere says an animal rights activist 
the ordinance adopted unanimously monday evening by the 
cambridge city council will affect vertebrates used in studies at 
harvard university massachusetts institution of technology and 11 
other academic institutes and private research firms 
the council put teeth in the guidelines by creating a 
commissioners post to oversee and enforce the regulations 
a gaping loophole in the federal law is now closed gul agha 
who initiated the legislation three years ago when he was a 
researcher at mit said after the vote 
agha who teaches computer science at yale university said that 
as a researcher he saw lab animals subjected to insufficient 
ventilation physicial abuse rusted cages and starvation 
agha estimated that animal research is a 100 millionayear 
business in cambridge and said about 60000 animals annually are 
the subject of experiments 
the vote monday marked the first time a local jurisdiction has 
ordered such farreaching regulations on animal experimentation 
according to the cambridge committee for responsible research inc 
grassroots groups have begun organizing campaigns for similar 
measures in amherst mass san francisco and berkeley calif agha 
said 
researchers in general have not fought the ordinance maintaining 
that they already comply with state and federal regulations 
cambridge institutions are now carrying out high quality animal 
care said dr john moses chairman of the animal care committee 
at mit involvement by the city will help prevent further 
misunderstandings about the nature of that care by increasing 
public accountability 
the newly adopted legislation expands federal and state 
regulations concerning humane treatment of laboratory animals by 
including all vertebrates a vertebrate is any animal with a 
backbone or spinal column including mammals fish birds and 
reptiles 
current federal law deals with dogs cats and monkeys and 
excludes reptiles amphibians mice rats and rabbits said steven 
wise an animal rights attorney in 1987 the mayor named wise along 
with a physician and a veterinarian to come up with recommendations 
now contained in the ordinance the panel inspected several research 
laboratories in cambridge and found no significant animal abuse 
the position of commissioner of laboratory animals created by the 
ordinance can make unannounced visits to research sites conduct 
hearings and impose fines of 300 per day per violation

fbi agents who met with rep william h gray 
iii in recent weeks questioned him about a financially troubled 
accountant who had worked for the democratic congressman according 
to a report 
in todays editions the philadelphia inquirer quoted an 
unidentified source as saying that most of the specific questions 
that the agents asked gray concerned neil b godick president of 
godick amp co a philadelphia accounting firm that filed for 
bankruptcy in 1987 
godick has been accused of embezzlement by one of the creditors 
in the bankruptcy proceedings 
grays attorney abbe lowell said that godick worked for gray at 
various times between the late 1970s and 1986 as a personal 
accountant an aide in his congressional office and a campaign 
consultant who helped prepare federal election commission reports 
lowell would not talk about what the fbi and gray discussed nor 
would he confirm that godick had been mentioned in the interview 
gray met first with fbi agents on memorial day triggering 
reports that he was under investigation the reports came while gray 
was making an eventually successful bid to become house majority 
whip 
the justice department has said that gray is not the subject of 
an investigation 
gray declined to discuss his meeting with the fbi 
i have consistently attacked the leaks that have plagued this 
investigation gray said in a statement released by his office 
indeed i have called for the appointment of an independent 
counsel to determine the source of these leaks therefore it would 
also be hypocritical of me to comment on the substance of the 
inquirers story 
godick refused requests for an interview by the newspaper

marine biologists and the coast guard suspended 
efforts to herd two wayward dolphins out of the east river toward 
open water because the dolphins showed signs of stress 
the dolphins were getting very excited said coast guard 
spokesman jeff crawley and the attempts to steer them down river 
were not working when they were halted monday evening 
biologists and government officials were to meet today to discuss 
other methods to move the whitesided dolphins 
a lone dolphin was first spotted last tuesday by staff at 
metropolitan hospital and students and teachers at an upper east 
side school on monday the marine biologists trying to move that 
dolphin out to sea spotted a second dolphin swimming with the first 
the coast guard the okeanos ocean research foundation inc the 
national marine fisheries service and the state department of 
environmental conservation worked to try to herd the whitesided 
dolphins to open waters 
the marine biologists tried to lure the dolphins by placing an 
electronic device in the water with a highfrequency sound to 
attract them they had hoped the dolphins would follow their boat 
down the east river through new york harbor past the 
verrazanonarrows bridge to the atlantic ocean 
sam sadove research director at okeanos said sunday the first 
dolphin appeared to be in relatively good health although it was 
making sudden changes in its swimming direction possibly because of 
impaired sonar 
a humpback whale that strayed up the hudson river on new yorks 
west side last june turned and swam back out to sea a couple of days 
later when several coast guard boats gunned their engines banged 
pipes and sounded horns

train outside shanghai killing at least 24 people and seriously 
injuring 11 official reports said today 
an official of the citys foreign affairs office described 
mondays blast as an accident western diplomats in shanghai said 
there was no indication it was linked to this months military 
suppression of the prodemocracy movement 
the national television news showed tape of a gaping hole in the 
side of the train from the explosion which it said occurred in a 
toilet at the front of a thirdclass compartment

investigating the damage and talking to the injured 
explosions on chinese trains are not uncommon sometimes they are 
the result of peasants carrying dynamite for their farms or 
fireworks for new year celebrations

hundreds of unarmed civilians in beijing in crushing the 
prodemocracy movement 
on june 6 six people were killed in shanghai when a train 
smashed through a barricade set up by demonstrators 
three men convicted of setting fire to the train after the crash

gov norm bangerter says the university of 
utahs fusion experiments have gotten enough independent 
confirmation for the state to release 5 million for more research 
however the legislature gave control of the 5 million to a 
fusion advisory committee not the governor members of the 
committee who are scheduled to meet with university officials on 
thursday have complained the university has not shared enough 
details 
experiments at other universities have only partly duplicated the 
process by which utah chemist b stanley pons and british colleague 
martin fleischmann claimed to have achieved nuclear fusion at room 
temperature their tabletop experiment announced march 23 raised 
prospects of a cheap safe energy source but was derided by many 
physicists 
theres nothing in the legislation that requires it to even be 
fusion or to have commercial applications bud scruggs 
bangerters chief of staff said monday the governor wont put 
pressure on the committee but he will say he thinks the legislation 
is designed to kick in now 
hugo rossi director of the universitys fusion research said he 
is eager to go before the committee with a proposal for the 5 
million 
james brophy the universitys vice president for research said 
a collaboration agreement with general electric co is expected this 
week 
pons and fleischmann are in england working on a scientific paper 
and will not be at thursdays meeting but pons is expected to 
attend a july 11 meeting of the panel

the owner of a hot dog stand today 
testified that he saw the accused killer of prime minister olof 
palme behind the swedish leader moments before the shooting 
the testimony was one of the most damaging to the defendant 
christer pettersson since the trial began june 5 pettersson has 
denied the killing 
kiosk owner ljuvica nadik said he noticed someone walking 10 to 
15 feet behind palme and his wife lisbeth down a street after they 
left a movie theater on feb 28 1986 
im certain this is the man who followed them said nadik a 
yugoslav immigrant who occasionally was helped by a translator 
he remembered noticing that palme had no security guards and 
feeling disappointed that the couple were simply dressed 
asked how he could identify pettersson with certainty nadik said 
the image is very vivid with me ive been reminded so many times 
every time i watch television or look through a newspaper and there 
has been something about the palme murder i have seen the image of 
the man who followed them he said 
a second witness anders bjorkman testified that he saw the 
shooting from a distance of about 15 yards but he could not 
identify the gunman

max kowalski lived in the shadow of the swastika 
at auschwitz where the nazis were killing 10000 jews a day by 
1945 his father mother sister and brother perished but he 
survived until last weekend when the shadow reappeared on the 
door of his boarding house room 
police say it was the work of a fellow boarder an apparently 
unbalanced man with whom kowalski had quarreled in the past he went 
to the mans room to complain and a fight ensued when it was over 
kowalski 72 was dead on the floor in a puddle of blood 
ruben martinez zucarino 36 was charged with second degree 
murder detectives said he stabbed the old man repeatedly with a 
fork and scissors and hit him over the head with a religious 
statue he admitted having drawn the swastika they said 
max survived a monster said rabbi israel steinberg of the 
states human rights office its a shame he couldnt survive a 
bite from a mosquito 
kowalski a polish jew came to the united states in 1949 and 
settled with many other eastern european immigrants in the brighton 
beach section of brooklyn it was a simple but balanced life built 
on rituals such as a chat with the card players under the trees in 
asser levy park or a stroll along the boardwalk on the ocean 
kowalski lived with his wife in an apartment complex but rented 
a room in a house near the beach as a combination hangout and 
workshop he was a handyman who seemed to do half his work for free 
he fixed a closet in my house once but i couldnt force the 
money on him said harry zukoff a friend he would do anything 
for you i knew him 25 years a beautiful man 
but a few months ago another room on the second floor of the 
boarding house was rented by zucarino with whom kowalski quarreled 
over the condition of a kitchen area they shared when kowalskis 
son lenny went to visit his father on saturday morning he found a 
swastika and skull and crossbones written on the door with blue ink 
kowalski whose arm still bore the fivedigit identification 
number which the nazis branded on him had not noticed it and he 
quietly cleaned the markings off his door but as his son robert 
later said if somebody put a swastika up and you had numbers on 
tatooed on your arm you would be upset 
kowalskis friends were struck by the irony to survive hitler 
the greatest villain in history only to be killed a man whom they 
described as a garden variety antisemite 
brighton beach is still a fairly safe neighborhood but there 
have been other incidents these immigrants who have seen the worst 
the old world had to offer and wonder if the new one will turn out 
any better 
we came here to live not to fight with people said eva 
uszerowicz another auschwitz survivor with numbers on her arm 
but eventually the conversation kept coming back to kowalski and 
what a nice man he had been the one thing everyone seemed to 
remember was his attendance at funerals 
for a proper jewish funeral a quorum of 10 men is needed a 
minyan sometimes when the deceased is particularly old or without 
family 10 men are hard to come by but kowalski was always ready to 
drop whatever he was doing and go off to help form the minyan 
whether he knew the deceased well or not it was a mitzvah a good 
deed 
on monday afternoon at kowalskis own funeral there was no 
problem with a minyan about 200 people jammed into the funeral home 
the congregation included kowalskis landlady tuey chin who 
sobbed throughout the service in a city where landlords and tenants 
fight like hatfields and mccoys this was no small testament to max 
kowalskis spirit 
during world war ii six million people died because they were 
jews rabbi steven ziskind said in yiddish today you died 
because youre a jew

swiss police arrested khashoggi in april at the request of the 
us embassy and authorities are considering a us extradition 
request

here is the text of president bushs news 
conference tuesday 
i have a brief opening statement and then id be glad to take 
questions on wednesday morning the supreme court issued a decision 
which held that a person could not be convicted for desecration of 
our flag the american flag and because to do so would infringe 
upon the right to political protest now weve got to be very 
careful in our society to preserve the right to protest government 
action however i believe that the flag of the united states should 
never be the object of desecration 
flagburning is wrong protection of the flag a unique national 
symbol will in no way limit the opportunity nor the breadth of 
protest available in the exercise of free speech rights and i have 
the greatest respect for the supreme court and indeed for the 
justices who interpreted the constitution as they saw fit but i 
believe the importance of this issue compels me to call for a 
constitutional amendment 
support for the first amendment need not extend to desecration of 
the american flag and we are reviewing proposed language for a 
constitutional amendment we are beginning consultation with members 
of the united states congress who hold similar views and as 
president i will uphold our precious right to dissent but burning 
the flag goes too far and i want to see that matter remedied 
tom 
q mr president when you were last with us you said that you 
had tried to contact the leaders of china and the line was busy 
you were unable to get through in light of the fact that there is 
now a new party secretary have you renewed that try and also in 
light of what you just said have you planned to ask prime minister 
li peng to return the texas cowboy boots with the american flag on 
it that you gave him in china 
a i have no such plans but and i hope he doesnt ask for his 
bicycles back either but in terms of contacts we are trying 
through our embassy to have contacts we have contact their 
ambassador has access to and contact with our officials here and so 
there has been some exchange of views but i have not you know 
renewed a phone call request if that was your question 
q as a followup mr president do you intend to go ahead and 
send a peace corps team to china in the fall to teach english or 
will you go along with the chinese request that that be delayed

hundreds of burmese troops backed by 
mortar and artillery fire today attacked karen guerrilla positions 
near the thai border karen rebel sources said 
thai border patrol police said more than 50 mortar and artillery 
shells fell into thailand and burmese machinegun fire hit three 
houses and a buddhist temple in the border village of mae kone kane 
thai police returned the fire the border patrol said 
fierce fighting began before dawn as at least 800 government 
troops attacked the karen base of pa loo about eight miles south of 
the thai border town of mae sot said the guerrilla sources on 
condition of anonymity 
burmese troops pounded pa loo and the nearby camp at kaw moo ra 
with hundreds of mortar and artillery rounds they said both camps 
are separated from thailand by the moei river 
no casualties were immediately reported 
with about 8000 armed fighters the karens are the largest of a 
dozen ethnic groups that have fought for more than four decades for 
greater autonomy from rangoon 
since december government forces have seized five key guerrilla 
bases 
the guerrillas claim they have killed up to 2000 burmese and 
wounded another 4000 in the government offensive 
thai military sources said that up to june 15 about 185 burmese 
troops were killed and at least 470 wounded in attacks on pa loo and 
kaw moo ra that began in may karen casualties have been light they 
said with only six rebels reported dead and another 17 wounded 
in an interview on sunday at the karen headquarters of manerplaw 
rebel commmander bo mya said that his fighters would revert to 
broader guerrilla actions against targets inside burma following the 
loss of key border positions 
he dismissed suggestions that the rebels were near defeat but 
other karen officials based along the thai border said the 
insurgency was at its lowest point ever 
bo mya blamed recent burmese successes on the economic boost 
rangoon received from its trade ties with thailand the karens also 
charged that government forces have been permitted to enter thailand 
to attack their positions from the rear

a survey of more than 3000 adults suggests that 
if there was a sexual revolution in the 1960s most americans missed 
it 
the survey conducted in 1970 but published this week for the 
first time found that americans overwhelmingly disapproved of 
prostitution extramarital sex and premarital sex and were fiercely 
opposed to homosexuality 
the number of women jumping in and out of bed at random is 
exaggerated i think just as the number of homosexuals in the 
population has been exaggerated one of the studys authors 
eugene e levitt a psychologist at the indiana university school of 
medicine said in a telephone interview monday 
the survey which could help researchers understand how aids 
spreads was not released for so long because two of its authors 
fought over whose name should appear first on the title page said 
hubert j ogorman who edited the survey report to be published 
thursday 
the surveys other authors were albert d klassen of the 
university of north dakota and colin williams of indiana 
universitypurdue university at indianapolis 
this is the first major study that dealt with the morality 
aspect of sexual behavior said levitt and by the way it 
shows how bitterly antihomosexual the american people are 
more than twothirds of respondents said homosexuals should not 
be allowed to be judges teachers ministers doctors or government 
officials levitt said 
the study sex and morality in the us is the only survey 
of sex and morality taken in a representative sample of the us 
population before aids said charles turner a sociologist and 
director of the committee on aids research at the national academy 
of sciences 
its unique data that cannot be reconstructed its of great 
historical interest said turner who had prior access to the 
findings under a special arrangement with the kinsey institute for 
research in sex gender and reproduction at indiana university 
among the findings 
extramarital sex was described as always wrong or almost 
always wrong by 87 percent of respondents 
homosexual relations among people who dont love each other were 
described the same way by 88 percent of the respondents even among 
individuals who love each other homosexual sex was disapproved of 
by 79 percent of respondents 
eightytwo percent disapproved of teenage girls having 
premarital sex 73 percent disapproved of teenage boys having 
premarital sex 
seventy percent disapproved of adult premarital sex by women 
and 65 percent disapproved of adult premarital sex by men 
fewer respondents disapproved of sexual acts if the partners 
loved each other leaving little doubt therefore that many 
respondents still cherished the ideal of love as a basis for sexual 
behavior the authors said 
these data will be indispensible to any attempt to describe the 
effects of aids on american sexual morality and behavior ogorman 
of wesleyan university in middletown conn said in an introduction 
to the survey 
the survey had been nearly forgotten when researchers at the 
kinsey institute began to search their files for information that 
could help explain the spread of aids said june reinisch the 
institutes director 
in the course of this search we recognized the potential value 
of the unpublished 1970 survey data she wrote in a preface to the 
book 
klassen took until 1979 to prepare the findings for publication 
williams had been called in to speed the writing both demanded to 
be listed as the first author 
two years ago reinisch pushed a compromise in which klassen was 
listed first and williams was designated the official spokesman for 
the book 
the data have already allowed turner to estimate that in 1970 at 
least 20 percent of adult men had had homosexual contact at some 
time during their lives 
we havent had a good number for that said turner adding 
that such numbers are critical to understanding the aids epidemic

sacramental wine after the detroit catholic bookstore sold it to him

i was kind of shocked by the whole thing klotz said i was 
not out to break the law its not like i was selling it out the 
back door

public in may and was unaware his wholesale liquor license was 
insufficient to do it

president bush said today he would keep trying 
to get in touch with the leaders of china but acknowledged he had 
not been able to make contact in the last few weeks 
bush at a white house news conference said he had still not 
received a telephone call from beijing despite his efforts to 
discuss the recent turmoil in the worlds most populous nation 
but bush said there have been some exchange of views at a 
lower level and he stressed that the chinese ambassador here han 
xu has had easy access to senior us officials 
bush first disclosed his inability to make contact at a news 
conference last week he appealed publicly for a show of clemency 
but executions proceeded 
in his remarks bush was mildly critical of moves by the chinese 
to suspend peace corps visits to the country 
thats too bad he said one of the things that moved 
reform is contacts with americans i dont want to see those 
contacts cut off 
bush again avoided any heavy denunciation of the arrests and 
executions in china i reiterate my desire not to do damage to the 
people themselves 
he said us contacts with china had promoted economic reform in 
the country someday we will move the process of political reform 
forward he said 
in the meantime he said 30000 chinese now studying here will be 
going back there with a sense of what democracy and freedom is all 
about 
he said us ties had helped china move out of a period of 
cultural isolation and that this relationship is important 
repeatedly bush said good relations with beijing are in the us 
interest but he did not respond to two questions asking him to give 
specific examples 
at this moment bush said its impossible to have normal 
relations for very obvious reasons but i am going to do my level 
best to find a way to see improvement there 
and yet the president said he could not dictate to the 
chinese who should be leading the country 
since army troops fired on students june 34 in tiananmen square 
the leadership of the government and the communist party has been 
revised to remove leaders who showed some sympathy for democratic 
reform movements 
bush who headed the us liaison office in beijing and claims 
expertise in chinese affairs said he could not have predicted the 
recent turn of events 
but he said i guess the lesson is to go forward as best you 
can and to hold high the banner of values you believe in 
secretary of state james a baker iii in a speech monday night 
in new york was optimistic about longterm prospects for democracy 
in asia as in europe a new order is taking shape baker 
said in a speech summarizing bush administration policy on asia 
while the rites of passage will be painful china proves that 
it is an order full of promise and hope 
we and some other nations have suspended business as usual 
baker said but we and the rest of the world must not let our 
revulsion at this repression blind us to pressure for reform 
baker spoke for 25 minutes before 1000 guests at a blacktie 
dinner of the asia society a private group dedicated to improving 
american understanding of asia 
he outlined a proposal for a new association of asian countries 
to increase trade and investment and handle other regional issues 
ranging from cultural affairs to the environment 
baker said he plans to seek input on the form such an 
organization might take during a trip to asia that starts july 3 
baker will stop in tokyo to help plan multinational economic aid 
for the philippines in brunei he will attend the annual meeting of 
the association of southeast asian nations an economic organization 
of brunei indonesia malaysia the philippines singapore and 
thailand 
japans new foreign minister hiroshi mitsuzuka who met with 
bush earlier monday spoke at the dinner before baker 
he stressed the need for america to maintain a strong 
political economic and military presence and commitment to the 
region 
mitsuzuka also called chinas path toward isolation 
regrettable and appealed to chinas leaders to govern in a spirit 
of reconciliation and restraint 
meanwhile 11 americans were detained monday by chinese officials 
in kunming and charged with distributing religious tracts said adam 
shub a state department spokesman 
the americans were believed to be members of an evangelical

a john something might be happening in some department today 
that i know nothing about weve got an enormous bureaucracy weve 
got a tremendous bureaucracy that extends all around the world and 
there might well be some corruption out there thats going on that i 
would be responsible for but that i dont know about but i am not 
going to try to assign blame i want to look to the future and 
thats the way im going to handle that one 
yeah lesley 
q mr president youve spoken out emotionally obviously about 
the supreme courts decision on the flag i wonder if youd like to 
take this chance to speak out emotionally on their affirmative 
action decisions which make it harder for women and minorities to 
sue for discrimination 
a im not sure that i agree with your the hypothesis of your 
question as i said at a the last press conference formal press 
conference i was going to ask our attorney general and our general 
counsel to look into this matter and i am strongly committed to 
equal opportunity for all americans and i am advised that nothing 
in these decisions jeopardizes that principle or calls into question 
affirmative action or minority outreach efforts this was this is 
the opinion of the attorney general who i understand will be 
speaking on this at noon today 
the justice department has told me that the decision reflects 
interpretation of the civil rights laws by the court on technical 
subjects and were talking about burdens of proof and statutes of 
limitations but that is the advice i am getting and i will 
certainly support the attorney general 
q all right constitutional scholars say for instance that if 
a minority student is faces racial harassment at school at 
private schools they are no longer covered there are some 
situations where people cannot sue for racial harassment for 
instance and there are other sort of niggling things but its 
really the question of your emotional response because you jump out 
of the box on the flag 
a i have just given it to you affirmative action ive you 
know my position on that commitment to equal opportunity i hope 
people know my commitment on that but were getting into a 
technicality that neither you or i are competent to discuss and i 
am going you are going on the advice of who you call legal 
scholars and im going on the advice of the attorney general and 
a very fine general counsel so i think we have a difference on the 
interpretation of what this means and ive seen that some of the 
civil rights leaders disagree but i am committed and if the 
decisions actually turn out to hamper civil rights enforcement 
along the lines youre talking about obviously i would want to take 
steps to remedy the situation 
q but are you saying you wont support legislation 
a is this your third question come on lesley 
q im sorry 
a go ahead 
q are you saying you wont support legislation that 
a im saying that my advice from the attorney general is that 
legislation isnt necessary 
back here in the middle yeah 
q mr president youve expressed your strong feelings again on 
this supreme court decision on the flag burning but the supreme 
court is expected to make a decision this week on the abortion 
issue which is among the most emotional in the country and i 
wonder going into that decision if you view your role as a healer 
after this decision as simply to enforce the law what is your 
view going into that decision as the president and this very 
important emotional issue 
a it is an emotional issue and i am firmly positioned in favor 
of you know overturn of roewade and thats my position and im 
not going to change that position but i dont want to see it the 
divisiveness that that whole issue causes split this country and 
yet the decision is going to be i dont know what theyre going to 
decide but my position on it is very clear 
owen 
q during the campaign you came out many times for a 
constitutional amendment to balance the budget im curious why now 
youve moved so quickly to call for a constitutional amendment 
concerning flagburning which is solely a symbolic issue and yet 
you havent moved at all on balancing the budget in terms of a 
constitutional amendment which is substantive and which a lot of 
people in this country think would accomplish a lot more for the 
economy can you explain that 
a yeah oh easily let me take this opportunity to make a 
clarion call for a balanced budget amendment absolutely it has to 
be phased in but id like to see it 
q why do you have to be prompted to do that why do you give 
such a high priority 
a because my position is so wellknown on it owen 
q why do you give such a high priority to the issue of 
flagburning and you havent said anything until now about a 
balanced budget amendment 
a i said a lot about it all last year i thought you got tired 
of hearing it but i will repeat it and but if you want to know 
ive got to confess i do feel viscerally about burning the american 
flag and i dont and therefore i express it and i feel 
viscerally about fiscal sanity also but this decision just came 
down and it is one that causes i think the american people and 
certainly this president great concern and i think it can be 
remedied without doing violence to a persons right to protest 
yeah david and then charles 
q mr president youre going to poland in a few weeks and i 
wonder a lots happened since your hamtramck speech weve had free 
elections solidarity now may have a much bigger role in what 
happens in poland when you go are you interested in bringing some 
expanded debt relief financial aid walesa has been saying to the 
world that he really needs help now do you think you are in a 
position to bring it

president bush today said the soviet union 
knows we want to move forward on a nuclear weapons reduction 
treaty and applauded soviet leader mikhail gorbachev for visiting 
western europe 
the president spoke to reporters a day after five former 
secretaries of state and defense urged the administration to push 
for the treaty but warned that the united states does not know 
enough about kremlin intentions to justify extraordinary political 
or economic concessions 
bush said he had no timetable for a first summit meeting with 
gorbachev but said such a meeting did not need to wait for a major 
treaty agreement between the superpowers 
i dont think it should be something to sign but id like to 
think that the governing criterion would be that the world would see 
the meeting as successful something good coming out of it bush 
said 
bush speaking in general terms about arms negotiations with the 
soviets said they know we want to move forward with start an 
acronym for strategic arms reduction talks 
i feel comfortable about the pace of improvements in 
ussoviet ties bush said adding that a number of medical and 
cultural exchanges had helped improve the relationship 
were coming closer on some of these broad broadscale 
objectives bush said all i want to say is i think the 
relationship is going in the right general direction albeit we have 
tremendous differences with the soviet union still 
bush applauded gorbachevs recent visits to west germany and 
england and said he did not expect the kremlin to be uptight 
about his upcoming visit to poland a warsaw pact ally of the 
soviets 
mr gorbachev goes to western europe and he is well received i 
will go to eastern europe and i will be well received bush said 
the report released monday and signed by the five secretaries and 
six other exofficials also counseled bush to show restraint on 
developing spacebased defenses 
it concluded that gorbachev is more inclined than any of his 
predecessors to reach accords with the united states that further 
western interests 
but it added that us knowledge of current and future kremlin 
policy was too problematical to justify extraordinary political or 
economic concessions which we would otherwise not consider 
james schlesinger secretary of defense in the nixon 
administration criticized the soviet leader for agreeing last week 
to resume arms aid to iran he said it showed gorbachev is still 
seeking marginal advantage over the west and in that respect 
failing the test 
still the report urged the administration to push hard to 
complete the treaty to reduce longrange bombers missiles and 
submarines by 30 to 50 percent after a sevenmonth recess the bush 
administration resumed negotiations last week in geneva 
at the same time the united states and its nato allies are 
negotiating with the warsaw pact in vienna to reduce troops tanks 
artillery and other nonnuclear armories in europe 
the report said completion of a strategic arms reduction treaty 
will make it easier for the united states and its allies to obtain 
large and asymmetrical reductions in conventional arms and should 
not wait on success in the latter 
gorbachev already has made especially significant commitments 
to cut more men and arms than the west and to shift the role of 
soviet troops toward defense the report said 
i do worry said harold brown who was secretary of defense 
in the carter administration if start is pushed to the back 
burner it will not get done at all that would be a big mistake 
schlesinger and brown who held a joint news conference were 
joined in the report by former defense secretary melvin r laird and 
former secretaries of state cyrus r vance and edmund s muskie 
the other exofficials who issued the report were david abshire 
michael blumenthal arthur h hartman richard helms peter peterson 
and thomas watson 
on spacebased defenses they said the united states should be 
willing to recommit itself for 10 years to the 1972 antiballistic 
missile treaty and discuss with the soviets what kind of tests for a 
spacebased defense are permitted 
this could have the effect of constraining the program undertaken 
by former president reagan to develop a shield against soviet 
ballistic missiles combining sophisticated technology and nuclear 
weapons in space 
however the report also suggested the 1972 treaty could be 
amended or a new one concluded with the soviets through negotiations

not extend to activities that would deface the unique symbol of

q yes im in a position to discuss it inasmuch as some of what 
i want to do will require legislation that will not be have been 
completed but i called lloyd bentsen the chairman of the finance 
committee to thank him over the weekend for his stance in the 
finance committee in terms of support for poland and so we will 
have a package that im not prepared to discuss now in detail that 
i hope will help i know this will be a subject of great concern 
after my polish the visit to poland in the in our summit 
economic summit meeting 
but the problem is we would like very much to help poland i am 
very encouraged with whats happened in poland but i want to be 
sure that when we do offer the specifics and the specific plan to 
help poland that poland itself takes will have taken the steps 
necessary to have the money well spent i dont want to just push 
money down down the drain so i think along with what we can offer 
there will have to come from their side some reforms and that i 
want to talk to general jaruzelski about and obviously lech walesa 
and well see where we go 
charles and then john here 
q let me follow on the poland question both there and in 
hungary youre entering countries that are in a transition at a 
very delicate situation politically and visavis their own allies 
what cautions do you take and do you exercise going in there so as 
not to be a negative catalyst 
a i think being there is the significant thing it is important 
that the united states show its interest in these countries that are 
undergoing change you dont want to overexhort you dont want to 
overpromise you dont want to rally people to levels of political 
activity that might cause repression and so what i want to do is 
make clear where the united states stands in terms of our respect 
for freedom encourage reform as much as possible and then back 
to davids question offer some specifics where we can help on the 
economy our my views on differentiation have not changed over the 
last few years we will differentiate we will support those that 
move towards us economically politically and in terms of human 
rights and its more on those general themes that i will be talking 
to the hungarian leaders and the polish leaders 
q if i could follow 
a yes 
q do you send any signal at the same time to the soviet union 
or have you had any communication to them about the purposes of your 
visit 
a no but i would not expect them to be uptight about it mr 
gorbachev goes to western europe and is wellreceived and i will go 
to eastern europe and i will be wellreceived and i think it was a 
good thing his trip to germany ive talked to chancellor kohl 
about it personally and i dont get all into some state of 
competition when i see mr gorbachev get a good warm response in 
germany the nato alliance is together 
one of the things that came out of the brussels nato summit 
meeting was the fact that there is strong unity there and so its a 
good thing for him to go to western europe and its a good thing 
for the president of the united states to go to eastern europe and 
i want to see us move beyond containment i want to see a much more 
open europe and i think that this so the importance of the visit 
is along that line and its not going to be that were going to 
solve the problem of the hungarian economy or the polish economy 
john 
q let me ask another question about abortion and roe versus 
wade we may get that decision this week now i understand your 
position youre for a constitutional amendment regardless of which 
way the supreme court rules 
a ive yeah ive already 
q is that right now if the supreme court strikes down roe 
versus wade and sends this back to the states would it not be less 
divisive to let the states decide this rather than go through the 
whole long tortuous process of a constitutional amendment 
a john i hate to not respond to your question but the court is 
probably going to make a decision very soon and i would prefer to 
address myself to the question after the court has decided 
q it is still your position though sir that you favor a 
constitutional amendment regardless 
a ive positioned it my position on that abortion question has 
not changed 
yeah 
q mr president youll soon be proposing some campaign 
financing reforms what is it about the current system of campaign 
financing that makes you think some kind of broad reform is 
required and if broad reform is important why not go ahead and go 
all the way to public financing of campaigns or some kind of a 
limit on overall spending on congressional campaigns

ministry confirmed today 
west german officials also had asked iran to recall a bonnbased 
diplomat allegedly linked to the suspected chemicals deal but he had 
already left the country the ministry said 
a ministry spokesman hans schumacher said the request to have

the supreme court today let stand a ruling that 
cbs inc no longer enjoys trademark protection for the amos n 
andy radio and television shows 
the justices without comment refused to review a federal 
appeals court ruling that cbs abandoned the trademarks when under 
pressure from civil rights groups it suspended commercial use of 
the shows 
the asserted trademarks were challenged by stephen m silverman 
who wants to produce a musical play based on the amos n andy 
shows and their characters 
the case now returns to a federal judge in new york city who is 
to rule on other aspects of the dispute todays high court action 
does not remove all legal hurdles confronting silverman 
the characters of amos jones and andy brown were created in 1928 
by freeman gosden and charles correll who wrote and produced the 
amos n andy radio program one of the nations most popular 
gosden and correll were white but amos and andy and all other 
characters portrayed on the program were black 
cbs bought all rights to the show and its creations in 1948 and 
broadcast it until 1955 
in 1951 cbs began broadcasting an amos n andy television 
show using black actors 
the television series also attained great popularity and a 
generation of tv viewers came to know george kingfish stevens 
his wife sapphire lawyer algonquin j calhoun and the mystic 
knights of the sea lodge 
the television show was aired on cbs affiliate stations until 
1953 it continued in reruns and nonnetwork syndication until 1966 
when cbs responded to criticism that the show presented a demeaning 
portrayal of blacks 
silverman in 1981 asked cbs for permission to produce a play 
based on a script called amos n andy go to the movies the 
plays proposed title later was changed to amos n andy in 
hollywood and finally to fresh air taxi 
cbs refused permission and silverman sued in 1984 
the suit alleged that cbs had no trademark or other exclusive 
rights in the material contained in the first 20 years of amos n 
andy radio shows 
us district judge gerald l goettel ruled for cbs on the 
trademark issue he said the network offered a reasonable 
explanation for its decision to keep the programs off the air and 
asserted its intention to resume use at some indefinite future date 
but the 2nd us circuit court of appeals last feb 6 reversed 
that ruling 
the appeals court said the trial judge misinterpeted the federal 
trademark laws handling of abandonment 
more likely congress wanted a mark to be deemed abandoned once 
use has been discontinued with an intent not to resume within the 
reasonably foreseeable future the appeals court said 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for cbs said other appeals 
courts have ruled that an outside cause for suspension of use of a 
trademark precludes abandonment 
the case is cbs inc vs silverman 881804

ailing premier andreas papandreou today 
failed to gain communist support in forming a coalition government 
that would lead greece out of a nineday political deadlock 
negotiations between the premiers panhellenic socialist movement 
and the communistled coalition of the left and progress ended at 
noon without an agreement 
papandreou was forced to appoint a representative to negotiate on 
his behalf 
the 70yearold premier was admitted to general state hospital on 
thursday with pneumonia he contracted eight months after undergoing 
heart surgery hospital officials said he developed heart and kidney 
complications sunday and was on a dialysis machine for three hours 
a medical bulletin issued by his doctors today said he was 
continually improving 
papandreou is heading a caretaker government because no party 
received a majority in elections on june 18 to the 300seat 
parliament 
communist party leader harilaos florakis said tuesday that the 
socialist proposals were equally interesting as those made to 
him last week by the conservatives who finished first in the 
elections but failed to build a coalition 
florakis did not disclose the proposals the conservative new 
democracy party had proposed a government in which the leftists 
would control the justice and interior ministries 
florakis said that he would hold meetings with conservative and 
socialist representatives on wednesday when his alliance begins 
attempts to build a coalition government 
it appeared that the coalition had little chance of leading an 
alliance with either the support of the socialists or the 
conservatives 
if the three major parties cannot form a coalition government 
new elections will be called

a leak in the nuclear power system of a 
soviet submarine probably contaminated the vessel but not the 
environment a norwegian expert said today 
the submarine built in the 1960s billowed smoke and steam when 
its reactors cooling system broke down monday 70 miles from the 
coast of northern norway 
soviet officials say there was no radiation leak they say the 
reactor was shut down and no one was injured 
but knut gussgard acting chairman of norways committee on 
peacetime nuclear accidents said piecedtogether details of the 
accident aboard the echoii class submarine show a reactor cooling 
circuit most likely leaked radioactive water and steam into the 
vessel 
gussgard from the norwegian nuclear energy safety authority 
said by telephone that too little information is available to judge 
the effect of such radiation on the crew 
just before mondays accident submarine capt v ovisjinnkov was 
quoted as telling the soviet publication smena that soviet nuclear 
submarine crews are poorly trained know little about procedures and 
can handle fewer than half the situations they should master 
it was the second soviet submarine accident in three months on 
april 7 an advanced mike class nuclear submarine sank 207 miles 
away in the norwegian sea fortytwo soviet sailors died no 
radiation was reported 
last week the soviet cruise liner maxim gorky rammed the ice 
pack off norway none of the 950 passengers were hurt 
johan baarli of norways institude for radiation hygiene said 
preliminary water and air tests show no radiation from the echo ii 
accident 
but the tests would not measure radiation aboard ship baarli 
said in an interview 
reports said that with its reactor being kept cool with fresh 
water pumped from a soviet escort vessel the damaged submarine was 
sailing toward its home port in the northern soviet union 
we dont like the idea of them having to cool the reactor with 
water from another ship even with the reactor shut down if it 
loses all cooling the afterheat of the reactor could be enough to 
cause problems said gussgard 
officials of this nato member nation have criticized moscows 
slowness in warning them of potential danger and express concern 
about general safety of soviet submarines 
oslos defense minister johan joergen holst called monday for a 
special agreement requiring the soviets to inform norway of 
dangerous situations near its coast 
a soviet embassy spokesman told the newspaper dagbladet today 
that the soviets regretted the delay but had not considered the 
accident threatening enough to warrant a warning 
norway is concerned that 100 nuclear submarines operating out of 
the soviet north fleet base on the kola peninsula just over 
norways northern border may be dangerous even in peacetime 
the submarines including about 30 of the older echo ii design 
regularly pass through and patrol a narrow strategically important 
corridor to the north atlantic that follows norways coast a 
norwegian defense spokesman said

a i oppose public financing of these campaigns i think people 
should be able to attract private support and i think participation 
by individuals in the political process through financial support is 
very very important i dont want to see eroding out the eroding 
out of participation by americans in the political process so im 
opposing i will oppose and have opposed the public financing of all 
of these campaigns now there are proposals that im not prepared 
to discuss in detail though i see others have already started 
dicussing what i might do on thursday i will have specific 
proposals but and i think theyll be fairly farreaching because 
i want to see reform real reform and theyll be good proposals 
but im not prepared to go into what im going to do now except to 
say i will not support kicking the citizen out of the political 
process by saying hat a citizen cannot financially support the 
candidate of his or her choice 
q so if i could followup if the broad outlines of what you are 
going to do as reported are correct theres going to be some 
accusations that they help republicans more than democrats how are 
you going to respond 
a why would anyone make a charge like that against me when im 
looking at it as objectively as i can lets wait till you see what 
the what it what it what the proposals are i mean i would be 
outraged by a suggestion of that nature 
yeah 
q you and mr gorbachev are touring each others back yards in 
europe and now that youve finished your foreign policy reviews 
with regard to the soviet union have you moved any closer to 
perhaps meeting with the general secretary 
a that i wouldnt say closer that matter will be 
discussed again its having been discussed once by the secretary 
and foreign minister shevardnadze but i so i guess id id leave 
it right there 
there will obviously at some point be a meeting but i still 
feel id like the meeting to be seen as productive rather than just 
the meeting itself but i let me say this i feel comfortable 
about the wavelength were on with the soviet union now and i think 
they feel comfortable in the sense that i think they know we want to 
move forward with start they know that we are prepared to move 
swiftly forward with the conventional force rectifying the 
conventional force imbalance and indeed i got the feeling from 
talking to chancellor kohl that mr gorbachev was not hung up on the 
timetable that we set 
so were coming closer on some of these broad broad scale 
objectives and then there are some very nice smaller things their 
help that soviet ship helping with the cleanup and our kids from 
brooks going over to help with the burn our specialized burn unit 
really qualified people the best in helping with burns going to 
the soviet union and then the outreach at the time of yerevan so 
there are some atmospherics that i think are very very important 
and harmonious that will help when we sit down to hammer out the 
details on the strategic arms talks or on these other matters 
q could i ask you to follow up to perhaps define a little bit 
more what useful or progress would be in terms of a meeting 
are you setting a precondition as president reagan did that you 
need something to sign or is there 
a no i dont think it should be something to sign but i would 
like to think that the criterion the governing criterion would be 
so that the world would see the meeting as having been successful 
something good happening out of it and it doesnt have to be 
signing necessarily although ive been around this track long 
enough to know that you can always whip out something to sign a 
fishing agreement or something of this nature but so we could have 
that but im not saying that we that it should be hung up on a 
major treaty of some sort before i would sit down with mr 
gorbachev maybe well do it like this say hey lets get 
together and im interested in what he thinks about it and 
weve had some communication back and forth but all i want to say 
is i think the relationship is going in the right general direction 
albeit we have tremendous differences with the soviet union still 
and i still have guided by a certain sense of caution 
over here and then up here 
q mr president you made much during the campaign and after 
your election of your relationship with chinas leaders and yet 
for the past several weeks been unable to contact them and china 
appears to have ignored our calls for clemency and for dialogue 
sir do you not think the relationship was oversold 
a no i dont think it was oversold 
q then tell us what benefit weve gained from it

southwest of houston forecasters said rainfall eventually might be 
measured in feet 
we hope it wont become a reality but it is a possibility 
ron stagno of the national weather service in houston 
no relief was expected until late today because the system was 
moving so slowly only 6 mph to the north

city bus stuck in an underpass near downtown was barely visible in 
the water

50 miles north of houston 
maximum sustained winds dropped to 35 mph with 45 mph gusts along 
the eastern texaswestern louisiana coast the national hurricane 
center in coral gables fla said maximum sustained winds must be 
at least 39 mph for a depression to be a named tropical storm 
more than 10 inches of rain fell in the houston area during the 
24 hours that ended early today the weather service said the 
main thing is the rain said meteorologist larry vannozzi its 
a heavy rainmaker

where a tornado overturned trailers in rural hackberry today in 
texas authorities reported a tornado monday evening at smithpoint 
and double bayou

dozens of residents of two apartment complexes bordering a bayou 
it doesnt look like theres going to be any relief fireman 
lester tyra said the only way out is with an airboat

storm had its origins in hurricane cosme which moved from the 
pacific ocean across mexico last week the atlantic hurricane season

benzene aground in the houston ship channel three people escaped 
serious injury and the barge was not believed to be damaged coast

be a problem

a what weve gained is china has a much more open economic 
system than when the shanghai communique was signed quite a few 
years ago what weve gained is 30000 students right this minute i 
think the figure is studying in the united states chinese kids 
going back there with a sense of what freedom and democracy is all 
about what we have gained is helping china move out of a period of 
cultural revolution isolation and this relationship is important 
and i can continue to express my outrage about what happened in 
tiananmen square but and i will but i am determined to do my 
level best to keep from injuring the very people that were trying 
to help and im talking about the chinese people generally 
so weve gained a lot from this relationship and so have they 
and i still think that it is in the strategic interest of the united 
states im not talking about the old adage of playing the china 
card or something of that nature or playing the soviet card but if 
you look at the world and you understand the dynamics of the pacific 
area good relationships with china are in the national interest of 
the united states now its hard to have them its impossible at 
this moment to have what i would say are normalized relations for 
various very obvious reasons but i am going to do my level best to 
find a way to see improvement there that will help the chinese 
people 
q if i could follow sir 
a please 
q its your personal relationship with chinas leaders that im 
speaking of im looking for the benefit when you cannot even 
complete a phone call to deng xiaoping im wondering if the 
personal relationship is 
a the benefit is i understand the situation thats the 
benefit and leaders are changing all the time over there so i 
mean recently so weve got to deal with who is there we dont 
dictate to china about their leaders we express our concerns as 
other leaders have but let me be very clear in my view the united 
states has been out front weve been out front on the steps weve 
taken and i am very pleased that there has been broad support for 
the position i have taken and i heard it just today from the prime 
minister of australia one of the most knowledgeable men about 
china the australians you see have always had a theyve had 
been a little out front theyve had relations before we did and 
they have a rather almost a unique standing in china theyve done 
a lot of business with china theyve worked theyve had a lot of 
exchanges with china bob hawke feels that he knows most of the 
chinese leaders the ones that we had been dealing with and to hear 
him say be as supportiv as he was today was very reassuring to 
me 
yeah 
q mr president how concerned are you 
a yes jesse youre next 
q how concerned are you that the retreat the political retreat 
that weve seen in china in recent weeks could be duplicated in 
the soviet union 
a well i did not predict what would happen in tiananmen square 
and i dont know of any china expert scholar or otherwise who 
predicted that and i guess the lesson is go forward as best you 
can keep your eyes open hold high the banner of values that we 
believe in the united states we have a special responsibility 
around the world in terms of human rights and democracy freedom 
but keep your eyes open thats what ive learned from this 
q have you had any communications with secretary gorbachev on 
the situation in china 
a not on china maybe others in the administration not 
gorbachev personally but ive followed carefully the statements out 
of there and obviously the soviet union has tried to with 
gorbachevs visit to china tried to improve relations but i think 
thats on a little bit of a hold although maybe theyre more 
accommodating than we are right now 
yeah jessica 
q mr president womens groups have been very pleasantly 
surprised and saluting you for your statements yesterday about 
violence crimes against women and spousal abuse and a couple have 
asked the question whether you will be willing to take that message 
to mens groups one said those macho groups such as the nra 
the american legion the police chiefs of america and ask them to 
stop to get the word out to stop beating their wives and stop 
beating the generic thing not specific 
a hey listen im a member of the nra youre hurting my 
feelings as they say in china 
q and the question is whether you will take the message to mens 
groups instead of to the american association of university women 
a jessica i hope that the message that because of the line of 
work you all are engaged in i hope that message got to every 
group but i dont want to single out or acquiesce in a hypothesis 
here and 
q but you did say 
a say that the nra is against women or the other groups you 
singled out 
q but you spoke you talked about 
a come on jessie 
q but you talked about it to women who are very well aware of 
the problem your staffers here say they move their cars closer to 
the white house after dark and have someone walk out with them so 
women know about the problem my question is whether you will go and 
take the message to mens groups and ask their help in eradicating 
the problem 
a im trying to take the message to the whole country thats 
what our whole crime package is about absolutely anybody that 
wants to listen 
q now you said also that you wanted to 
a this is a followup yes

a well you have no choice tom if the chinese say theyre not 
welcome they cant come in and its too bad because one of the 
things that moved forward the reforms was contact with americans 
and i dont want to see those contacts cut off and im sorry that 
the chinese have made that decision i would like to have seen those 
young volunteers go to china and help teach english to the chinese 
and i like these student exchanges and i dont want to hurt the 
chinese people 
now i have expressed my concern about what went on in china 
ill reiterate my concern here today but i reiterate also my desire 
not to do damage to the people themselves because i believe that it 
was contact with the united states and others in the west that have 
moved the process of economic reform forward and hopefully some 
day will move the process of political reform forward 
helen 
q mr president while you were vice president millions were 
syphoned off from hud through selfconfessed influence peddlers 
many of which who were your friends the homeless grew by the 
thousands i have not heard one word of outrage about this from you 
you seem to absolve pierce who sat on this gold mine permitted 
this kind of abuse for so many years and not absolve him but 
you dont criticize him at all who was to blame where did the buck 
stop 
a that matter is being looked into by our very able dedicated 
secretary of hud and we are going to do everything we can to clean 
up any cronyism or see that matters of that nature not recur 
but youre always looking for winners and losers and i am not 
about to prejudge the secretary himself i assume that he would 
accept responsibility for what happened past tense in his 
department just as i would have to assume responsibility for 
something that goes on in my administration whether i know about it 
or not but lets not be trying to find winners and losers lets 
guarantee the american people that we are not going to have cronyism 
and special favors and giving contracts because of who you know 
lets keep it on the merits 
q the people were the losers in this the republican leaders 
apparently their influence peddlers and so forth were the 
winners where were you in eight years 
a i wasnt handling hud helen in eight years 
q i know you werent handling hud but 
a but if you want to assign look this will give you a little 
relief if you want to assign blame of the vice president for what 
happened over a past of eight years okay thats fine i accept it 
but what i want to do as president is see that we dont have any 
recurrence and i have total confidence that jack kemp is working to 
see that this does not happen again and i hope that the message has 
gone out loud and clear to every cabinet officer that we want the 
highest possible ethical standards 
q were you aware of any atmosphere thats all im asking 
a no 
q mr president 
a yeah brit 
q in light of your renewed concern about the display of proper 
reverence to the flag i wonder if you think it helps the situation 
sir for you and other political figures of both parties to make the 
flag the kind of instrument of partisan politics that it was in your 
campaign last fall with the visit to flag city and the tour of flag 
factories and flags at all the conventions and so on 
a i dont view that as partisanship i think respect for the 
flag transcends political party and i think what ive said here is 
american it isnt republican or democrat it isnt liberal or 
conservative and i just feel very very strongly about it and 
perhaps i havent been quite as emotional as i feel about it but i 
want to take this opportunity to say protest should not extend to 
desecration of the unique symbol of america and that is our flag 
follow up 
q you wouldnt dispute would you sir that your visit to flag 
city usa and your visit to the flag factory last year were for the 
purpose of advancing your political campaign 
a everything i did last year was for the purpose of advancing my 
everything i did politically advancing my election and of 
course im not going to say that but im not i didnt put it on 
the basis that republicans are for the flag and democrats are not 
john 
q mr president leaving aside the winners and losers question 
on the hud scandal isnt it fair criticism nevertheless that the 
laissezfaire sort of management exhibited by sam pierce was as a 
matter of fact encouraged by the president himself and that they 
really didnt pay attention to what was going on over there

a harbor pilot today said he radioed 
three warnings to the world prodigy to change course before the 
tanker ran aground and spilled 420000 gallons of oil 
but the pilot david g leonard told a coast guardnational 
transportation safety board hearing he could not be certain the 
message was received because there was a lot of radio interference 
at the time 
the 533foot greek tanker hit a reef at the mouth of narragansett 
bay on friday after failing to wait for the pilot to board and guide 
the vessel into port 
rhode island authorities are investigating whether the ship was 
past the point at which a pilot is required by state law 
gov edward d diprete testified that hours after the spill the 
captain admitted he was at fault the governor said he asked iakovos 
georgoudis why were you in that location which requires a pilot 
to be on board 
he said that was my mistake diprete said he made no 
bones about it 
leonard said he first talked with the ship about 430 pm friday 
and that the tanker reported it was about 2 miles from the point 
where leonard was supposed to meet it and guide it into the bay 
my first words were aim the vessel more toward the brenton 
light tower leonard testified that was not correct so i 
said head the vessel more toward the tower then i said keep the 
red buoy on your starboard bow 
the pilot said he repeated the warning twice but could not be 
sure it got through 
that transmission there was interference with a lot of 
smallboat traffic leonard said he said that interference is 
common during the summer and called on the coast guard to do 
something to free up vital radio channels 
most of the spilled oil had dispersed or evaporated by today and 
no longer posed much of a threat to the shore officials said 
its going to flush out by itself said coast guard petty 
officer mike gilmore overseeing the cleanup at hull cove in 
jamestown 
there had been reports of lobsters killed and several small birds 
found dead but officials said those did not appear to be widespread 
state attorney general james oneil seized the ships records and 
has begun criminal investigation he planned to convene a grand jury 
on wednesday

q please you want to be sure that your seven granddaughters 
have the same opportunities that your pride and joy george p has 
george p is one whom you take on fishing trips into the back rooms 
with the boys and to the research camp at the university of 
nebraska and things like that i wonder if youre planning to take 
some of the granddaughters on some of these kinds of excursions 
where youre doing the business of the nation to prepare them to be 
president 
a yeah when they get older than about 3 i will do that 
because now i know now dont you say it ill say it jenna and 
barbara are about 7 but thats a little young to go fishing in 
jackson hole with their grandfather and put up with marlin fitzwater 
and all of these people i mean i want them prepared for the real 
world im serious i want them prepared and i look forward to the 
day that those theyre the noelle who is just a couple of years 
behind george p she came up here we had her with us and she 
brought her cousin and we had a wonderful time and i want her to 
come back indeed theyll be with us this summer so but no you 
raise a good point and it isnt my affection for our oldest 
grandson is its just that hes there and hes ready and he plays 
ball and he does stuff and were going to the orioles game 
tomorrow i think it is and so but it is not discriminatory it 
is not discriminatory 
yeah 
q mr president if i could ask one last question 
a or wasnt i not supposed to say that what about the ball 
game come on 
q some things that you just cant 
q if i could ask one last question on the hud scandal 
a yeah 
q i think that many people would think its unfair to hold you 
responsible when you were vice president for the things that were 
going on at hud but some of the people who have been implicated in 
this scandal are very close to you im thinking of both frederick 
bush who was your key fundraiser in the campaign and paul 
manafort who was an adviser to your campaign and a partner of lee 
atwater your campaign manager have you made any effort to find out 
exactly what these people who are close to you were doing with hud 
or to express your views of it to them have you made any efforts in 
those regards 
a im not singling out any you know going say look for 
people that i know that may have done business with hud in the past 
what i am trying to do is do it generically say to the degree there 
was any breaking of the law obviously the people should pay the 
whatever the price is to the degree we can guard against any abuse 
for the future i want to go the extra mile to do that and one of 
the first things i did as president unnoted though it was was to 
meet with the inspectors general in here and encourage them towards 
independence and thorough investigation and so thats the way i am 
trying to handle that matter 
q as a followup does this affect your relationship with these 
people to know that they were involved apparently in influence 
peddling 
a well it doesnt improve things but on the other hand i want 
to be fair i want to be sure that i dont jump at conclusions as to 
what guilt is and what it isnt whether law was broken or were 
people just out there you know doing what was permitted i want to 
have the standard higher though even if its permitted i want to 
have the highest possible standard but i havent put it on that 
kind of a personal basis yet 
q mr president the senate has just passed a child care bill 
that would spend almost 9 billion in federal funds on child care 
your spokesman says that bill is a candidate for a veto do you 
intend to veto that bill and what are your objections 
a i want to see what comes down here but if there was one thing 
that was clear ive got to be careful of these gestures the way 
these rich little and these guys but if there was one thing that 
was clear one thing that was clear it was my position on child 
care maximum choice through credits and the abc bill does not fit 
what i think is the proper description for child care and to then 
for me to take the back seat and say im less concerned about 
child care because im unenthusiastic about the abc bill i dont 
accept that at all so i remain convinced that what i have proposed 
is the right way to go about it i would like to see what comes down 
here before i make further statements about what action i will take 
or wont take i want to know the final you know piece of 
legislation that hits this desk 
q but you would veto the bill as it stands now 
aive made my position clear on the abc bill 
yeah 
q sir you say you dont want to prejudge secretary pierce but 
doesnt the evidence of mismanagement and influencepeddling make it 
evident to you that there were major problems there at the very top 
a yes yes 
q and what can be done about that 
a well thats what the process thats what the secretary is 
trying to do right now is to make guarantees and put out 
regulations to see that these kinds of abuses a woman sitting in 
maryland ripping off 5 million from the american taxpayers thats 
wrong and that and i expect thats in the courts i dont know 
thats where it should be in my view 
yeah frank

kraft today said it is mailing 250 checks to 
hundreds of people who claim they won a 17000 van that was 
supposed to be the grand prize in a botched contest 
letters accompanying the checks say that the payment represents 
our appreciation for your understanding and good will and that the 
company is sorry for any confusion or disappointment the flawed 
game may have caused 
because of a printing error the ready to roll game pieces 
kraft offered last month in newspapers in the chicago and houston 
areas matched virtually all game pieces in packages of kraft cheese 
making hundreds possibly thousands of people apparent winners of a 
1990 dodge caravan 
the company nullified the contest june 12 after the error was 
discovered prompting at least two classaction lawsuits by wouldbe 
winners 
kraft usa spokeswoman kathy knuth said from company headquarters 
in suburban glenview that the number of people who mailed in 
matching game pieces for the van and other prizes is not available 
kraft is owned by philip morris cos 
the company announced the 250 consolationprize checks along 
with a modified contest in which kraft gave claimants until june 16 
to qualify for a july 14 drawing for four vans and other prizes

energy secretary james d watkins today 
announced a 10point plan to chart a new course for what he 
called the departments failed system of protecting the environment 
and public health from nuclear weapons production 
watkins also said he would press for senate confirmation of 
victor stello as his chief assistant for nuclear weapons even if 
investigations of stellos controversial background reveal some 
chinks in his armour 
bush announced the stello nomination as assistant secretary for 
defense programs last week 
in 1987 a senate panel conducted a hearing on whether stello as 
the staff chief of the nuclear regulatory commission was guilty of 
improprieties in connection with a commission investigation of the 
tennessee valley authority 
the probe included the question of whether stello improperly 
advised the manager of nuclear power at tva on how to respond to a 
commission inquiry about the readiness of a plant under 
construction stello denied any improprieties 
if he has some chinks in his armour so be it watkins 
told a news conference before flying to new mexico to tour a desert 
site on which the department is building the nations first 
permanment dump for waste generated by the weapons program 
he disclosed that the dump which was scheduled to open in 
september would not start receiving any waste until sometime next 
year 
watkins said stello has the knowledge experience and commitment 
to perform the job which watkins said is one the most important 
management spots in the department 
watkins said the stello nomination was part of a broader effort 
to improve energy department management of the nuclear weapons 
program which has been crippled in recent years by a series of 
mechanical failures and questions about safety 
the program conducted through 17 major weapons facilities in 12 
states produces plutonium and other nuclear materials for the 
weapons assembles the arms and conducts tests on them 
i am certainly not proud or pleased with what i have seen over 
my first few months in office watkins said as a result i must 
continue to implement measures that can lead the department to a new 
culture which takes pride in being good stewards of public lands 
 
among the measures announced by watkins 
creation of a set of environmental tiger teams to conduct 
independent assessments of whether the weapons plants are complying 
with federal and state laws 
changing the terms of department contracts with the private 
companies that run the weapons plants to put more emphasis on 
rewards for safety and environmental compliance 
accelerating the cleanup of the weapons plants by allocating an 
additional 325 million for the budget year beginning oct 1 
bringing the total for the year to 24 billion 
also today a group of 21 environmental scientific and church 
groups sued the energy department to try to force a broad public 
review of plans for modernizing the weapons plants 
the suit filed in us district court in washington said the 
department should be compelled to prepare a programmatic 
environmental impact statement a comprehensive analysis of the 
environmental and health effects of its weapons plant initiatives 
watkins at his news conference declined to comment directly on 
the suit except to say he was committed to ensuring full compliance 
with all environmental requirements 
the natural resources defense council an environmental group 
that announced the suit said the department is required by the 
national environmental policy act to prepare a public review of its 
modernization plans 
it is time doe came clean with the american public about its 
plans for what is really one of the nations largest and most 
dangerous industrial operations said dan w reicher an attorney 
for the group 
among the groups that joined in the suit are the environmental 
policy institute greenpeace the federation of american scientists 
the lawyers alliance for nuclear arms control inc and the 
physicians for social responsibility

the fullfigured look just didnt suit a woman who 
arrived on a flight from guatemala and federal agents found she was 
wearing four girdles stuffed with cocaine 
us customs service agents detained the 38yearold colombian 
woman monday while she stood in line for a baggage search at houston 
intercontinental airport 
an agent noticed she was very nervous and that she was wearing 
very bulky clothing said candace vice chief customs inspector at 
the airport 
we continued the inspection and discovered 163 pounds of 
cocaine secreted inside four girdles she was wearing ms vice 
said 
she said the woman was holding a ticket for a flight from houston 
to amsterdam 
she was apparently heading to holland because the value of 
cocaine is much greater there she said the cocaine would have 
been worth about three times more than the estimated 92000 it 
would fetch in the united states she said

to leave the country apparently for participating in the 
studentled prodemocracy movement the us embassy said 
eleven other americans detained monday in kunming and charged 
with distributing religious tracts were released and told to leave 
china by friday the embassy said it said the americans members of 
the latter rain ministry of litchfield ill would leave in the 
next day or so 
in tokyo group tours to china involving 43000 japanese have 
been canceled since martial law was declared in beijing in may and 
troops crushed the prodemocracy movement japanese officials said 
transport ministry official tokuji nakamura said the cancellations 
cost the agencies 60 million in sales 
in madrid spain european leaders today called for an embargo on 
arms sales to china and urged the world bank to postpone new loans 
to china to protest the governments crackdown 
the leaders of the 12nation european economic community at 
their twoday summit condemned in a statement the brutal 
repression taking place in china 
official chinese media reported today that the steering committee 
of chinas legislature would meet in special session thursday to 
endorse the communist partys tough stance on dissent 
also to be discussed are a draft law on tightening controls over 
rallies and demonstrations plans to discuss a longpending bill 
defining the rights and responsibilities of the press have been 
shelved 
the student demonstrations of april and may now called the 
period of turmoil called for greater press freedom and for 
several weeks the press enjoyed unprecedented leeway in objectively 
reporting events 
but since political hardliners gained the upper hand the press 
has reverted to its former role as mouthpiece of the party line 
the chinese gave no reason for their request last week for the 
peace corps postponement the us official said saying they just 
wanted to put the program off until a more appropriate time 
the decision was apparently triggered by continuing tension 
following the june 4 military crackdown in which soldiers killed 
hundreds of unarmed protesters in clearing central beijing of 
student protesters 
martial law remains in effect in most of the capital 
twenty americans had been scheduled to go to sichuan province in

their assignments in china which would be the 65th nation and first 
communist country with a peace corps program

ordered out of the country since june 4 for ther reporting on the 
situation

peoples congress would hear a report at its session thursday on 
quelling the counterrevolutionary rebellion 
the standing committee consisting of about 160 members meets 
every few months usually for about a week to discuss legislation 
to be put before the annual full session of the congress 
decisionmaking power in china rests with the party and the 
congress role has generally been limited to formal approval of laws 
and government appointments 
in recent years however it has been given more freedom to delay 
or revise legislation and to debate national issues

president bush reacting to a supreme court 
decision that protects the right of protesters to burn the american 
flag called today for a constitutional amendment that would 
prohibit desecration of the flag 
bush said support of the first amendment need not extend to 
desecration of the flag which he termed the unique symbol of 
america 
bush fielded questions on subjects ranging from international 
diplomacy to child care legislation to baseball in a freewheeling 
45minute news conference in the white house briefing room 
the president said 
he will carry a package of economic aid when he travels to 
poland next month but wants to first make sure that the communist 
government there will follow through on economic and political 
reform he said soviet leaders shouldnt be uptight about his 
journey to poland and hungary 
he still favors us contacts with china despite the continuing 
crackdown in beijing against prodemocracy leaders 
he has no plans to call for legislation to alter recent supreme 
court rulings on affirmative action that drew criticism from civil 
rights groups 
he intends to make sure that any wrongdoing at the department 
of housing and urban development is thoroughly aired and remedied 
he criticized legislation passed by the democraticcontrolled 
senate on child care but said he hopes agreement can be worked out 
on the subject 
bush opened his visit to the briefing room by declaring his 
support for a constitutional amendment that would negate last weeks 
54 supreme court decision the court held that burning the american 
flag as a form of protest is protected by the constitution 
bush said it was important to protect th freespeech guarantees 
of protest but he didnt want to extend that to the flag 
the courts decision provoked an emotional response in congress 
and elsewhere and bush said protection of the flag will in no way 
limit constitutional rights he said he favored a constitutional 
amendment over legislation because a law cannot correct in my 
view the egregious offense of burning the american flag 
a constitutional amendment must be approved by a twothirds vote 
of the house and senate and then ratified by 38 of the 50 states 
the day after the supreme court ruling proposed constitutional 
amendments were introduced in both houses of congress 
house speaker thomas foley dwash reacted angrily today when 
reporters suggested that republicans could make flag burning a 
partisan issue if democrats fail to support a constitutional 
amendment to overturn the ruling 
im sure people will play politics with any emotional issue 
foley said calling such partisanship reprehensible and 
disgusting 
foley expressed caution about a constitutional amendment 
i do not feel we should rush into an amendment to the first 
amendment of the constitution he said 
bush also he does not want to see contacts with the chinese 
government cut off despite a continuing crackdown in beijing 
against leaders of a prodemocracy movement 
im going to do my level best to find a way to see improvement 
there that will help the chinese people he said he said it was 
too bad the chinese have decided against a visit by peace corps 
volunteers this fall 
i believe that it was contact with the united states and others 
in the west that moved the process of economic reforms forward and 
hopefully someday will move the process of political reform 
forward 
bush said he does not expect his stops in poland and hungary next 
month to be disruptive to the communist world and said he does not 
expect soviet leaders to be uptight abnout his presence in 
eastern europe he noted that soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
recently went to west germany and was very well received there 
i think its important that the united states show its interest 
in these countries he said of the two eastern european nations 
currently undergoing delicate transitions to greater political 
rights 
he also vowed his administration would get to the bottom of 
scandals at the department of housing and urban development we 
are going to do everything we can to clean up any cronyism and see 
that matters of that nature do not recur he said 
bush said he would not try to assign blame for the problems at 
hud 
something might be happening in some department today that i 
know nothing about weve got an enormous bureaucracy weve got a 
tremendous bureaucracy that extends all around the world and there 
might be some corruption going he said 
bush said he had confidence in hud secretary jack kemp who also 
has vowed to clean up his department investigators are looking into 
alleged irregularities in housing programs in several states and 
congressional committess also are probing the operation of the 
department under samuel pierce who served as secretary for eight 
years under president reagan 
bush also said his advisers have concluded that none of the 
recent sypreme court rulings on affirmative action has jeopardized 
the principles of equal opportunity for all americans the court has 
made several rulings in recent weeks that civil rights advocates say 
undercut progress made toward equal rights and have said they 
intend to ask congress to write new protections into law 
bush said if the courts decisions turn out to hamper civil 
rightrs enforcement he would consider legislation 
but he had no such reluctance on the volatile flag desecration 
issue which the court addressed last week 
i believe the importance of this issue compels me to call for a 
constitutional amendment support for the constitution need not 
extend to the desecration of the american flag he said 
i do feel viscerally about burning the american flag he said 
bush also used his questionandanswer session before white house 
reporters to renew his opposition to abortion the court is expected 
to issue a ruling later this week on a case involving abortion 
bush an avid baseball fan declined to answer a question on 
whether cincinnati reds manager pete rose is being treated fairly by 
an investigation into his alleged gambling on baseball games

when it comes to shakespeare hamlet is still 
very much the thing 
in recent months britains two large governmentsubsidized 
theaters have tackled the prince of denmark and two other london 
plays are now on using hamlet as a central character 
it remains one of the worlds favorite plays and hamlets 
celebrated soliloquy has become universal whether in chinese si 
hai shi huo swedish att vara eller icke vara or english 
to be or not to be 
in paris patrice chereaus production recently swept the moliere 
awards the french equivalent of broadways tony britain has 
averaged eight major hamlet productions every year for the past 
three years new yorks public theater presented it in 1986 with 
kevin kline as the prince 
women have played him too notably the great french actress 
sarah bernhardt a century ago dame judith andersonand more recently 
diane venora at the public in 1982 
laurence olivier called it the best play ever written and 
his 1948 film portrayal was the only shakespeare work ever to win 
academy awards for best film and best actor 
others have tried to shape it to the times the great 
18thcentury actor david garrick hated the graveyard scene i 
swore he said that i would not leave the stage till i had 
rescued that noble play from all the rubbish of the fifth act 
the victorians left out hamlets lapses into vernacular along 
with anything else that might portray him as less than a perfect 
prince nowadays producers are more apt to drop the subplot 
involving the agents and friends of hamlets rosencrantz and 
guildenstern a trend which in itself inspired a whole 
muchapplauded play by british dramatist tom stoppard about two 
characters who find they do not exist outside the play 
in 1987 swedish director ingmar bergmans acclaimed production 
with his royal dramatic theater of stockholm had a weeklong run in 
britain and in september russian director yuri lyubimov will stage 
hamlet with a british company at the leicester haymarket theater 
drawn from scandinavian legend hamlet is about a prince who 
comes home from university to discover that his father has been 
murdered by his brother who has usurped the throne and married the 
queen he has widowed 
setting out to clean up the rot in the kingdom of denmark hamlet 
plunges into a jungle of intrigue thwarted passion and switched 
poisons he emerges triumphant only to complete the tragedy by 
dying in a sword fight 
at its most basic hamlet is a rattling good revenge yarn but it 
is also that rare play whose significance can continually be 
reshaped to meet a societys preconceptions thus audiences over 
the ages have seen hamlet as marxist capitalist pacifist 
militarist aristocrat populist freudian obsessive and man of 
action 
this troubles some actors including jonathan pryce who derides 
what he calls the hamlet industry they wonder whether the 
plays appeal is also its weakness whether by applying to 
everything and everyone hamlet risks being about nothing in 
particular 
is hamlet really such a difficult part to get right asks 
lynne truss in the listener magazine the answer seems to be that 
on the contrary it is awfully hard to get it wrong since any 
interpretation seems to be valid 
in recent years londoners have been treated to roger rees dry 
intensely cerebral hamlet at the royal shakespeare company peter 
stormares manic military hamlet for ingmar bergman and now daniel 
daylewis highly emotional and impetuous hamlet at the national 
richard eyres production continues the nationals tradition of 
doing a hamlet near the start of each artistic directors 
tenure daylewis best known for the films the unbearable 
lightness of being my beautiful laundrette and a room with 
a view has inherited a part played in 1963 by peter otoole and 
in 1976 by albert finney 
also on show are iris murdochs the black prince adapted 
from her 1973 novel and the revival of anton chekhovs 1887 
ivanov with alan bates as a penniless landowner who sees 
himself as a failed hamlet figure 
murdoch 69 first encountered hamlet as a school text when she 
was 15 she an insane passion for the work similar to that of 
bradley pearson the sardonic tax inspector of the black prince 
who comes alive when thinking or speaking of hamlet 
i became absolutely entranced by it and by shakespeare 
generally she recalled in an interview hes very good on 
politics and power a great source of inspiration to novelists 
from garrick and henry irving through john barrymore olivier and 
john gielgud to todays acting generation hamlet remains the hurdle 
every classical actor must overcome to attain true celebrity and 
they rarely agree on whether hamlet is an easy role or a difficult 
one 
its quite easy because its such an accommodating part which 
adapts itself to the personality of the actor argues michael 
pennington who played the role in 1980 at stratford 
but mark rylance who plays hamlet in the royal shakespeare 
companys current stratford production disagrees 
i find it utterly enigmatic as soon as one locates the role 
it changes the 29yearold actor said in an interview the 
challenge is to bring your own jumble of brain cells to the feminine 
and masculine qualities which are in conflict in the part a lot 
of people cop out of that 
eyre 46 first directed hamlet in an acclaimed london 
production in 1980 then returned to the play intrigued by its 
elasticity 
i came more and more to see the play as an archetype of growing 
up the model for a whole genre of storytelling which has taken over 
the novel and films too he said 
its about a man trying to accommodate to come to terms with 
a completely alien political and social world when he starts off 
hamlet is everyman but for the fact that hes a prince 
this panders to our various fantasy aspirations while at the 
same time it concurs with our sense of not wanting to grow up not 
wanting to be absorbed by an essentially alien world of 
realpolitik

president bush today welcomed australian prime 
minister robert hawke for talks focusing on the china crisis as well 
as a thorny dispute between their countries over grain exports 
the grain dispute in which australia claims that us subsidies 
to domestic growers are harmful to its markets has settled into a 
holding pattern both sides agree it should be decided at the 
current round of trade liberalization talks now under way in geneva 
said acting assistant secretary of state william clark 
clark told reporters after the president and hawke met that the 
two nations are in agreement that grain subsidies should be done 
away with but the bush administration is unwilling to take such 
steps until an agreement involving other countries is reached at the 
international forum 
in an arrival ceremony on the white houses south lawn bush said 
australians and americans share a pioneer heritage in the taming 
of two vast continents a heritage of democratic ideas and a 
heritage of common sacrifice in war and common efforts in peace 
the two leaders discussed among other issues the current 
repression in china which the united states and australia both have 
condemned 
hawke later gave the president a strong vote of confidence during 
a photo session in the oval office saying that his views are 
identical to those of bush in deploring and condemning the 
barbarism of beijing in violently suppressing the demonstrations 
for democracy 
however he said australia shares the administrations concern 
that it not take actions that would reverse chinas economic reforms 
while bush did not publicly mention the agriculture dispute 
hawke was outspoken in stating that he would bring up the matter 
australia dislikes the united states export enhancement program 
which provides subsidies to us grain growers 
clark said the united states contends its subsidy program is 
operated in a manner that doesnt harm traditional suppliers 
the australians say the subsidy program has cut into their 
exports to other markets and gives the us growers an unfair price 
advantage the united states maintains the program is aimed at 
countering only europes protectionist policies 
the subject was a matter of some controversy during vice 
president dan quayles recent visit to australia 
during the arrival ceremonies hawke addressed the matter saying 
mr president it is precisely because of the depth and the 
maturity of our relationship that the difference of views that do 
exist between us can be faced openly and honestly for example on 
some trade matters particularly aspects of agricultural policy 
i am quite confident that today we will be able to focus on 
ways to minimize if not entirely resolve such differences 
hawke said in a speech monday in washington that although damage 
to australia from the us policy has lessened over the past year 
or so owing to lower world grain harvests and a running down of 
stocks there remains a danger that competitive expoert 
subsidisation will agian damage australia when grain surpluses 
reemerge 
in addition bush said the two leaders would discuss shares 
strategic interests and hawkes strong support for banning chemical 
weapons a position bush strongly advocated during his presidential 
campaign 
you may be assured of our commitment to the early achievement 
of an effectively verifiable treaty banning these weapons bush 
said 
he also hailed australias bold leadership in foreign policy 
both close to home and far from your shores from the south pacific 
to africa australia is a force for economic growth and a beacon of 
democracy bush said

uncles usurpation of the throne and hasty marriage with his widowed

himself

characters in what is regarded as one of the most important 
passages in drama 
just about every school child has at one point or another 
memorized hamlets soliloquy and actors throughout the world 
explore its meaning in almost every language including chinese

to be or not to be that is the question 
whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer 
the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune 
or to take arms against a sea of troubles 
and by opposing end them to die to sleep 
no more and by a sleep to say we end 
the heartache and the thousand natural shocks 
that flesh is heir to tis a consummation 
devoutly to be wished to die to sleep 
to sleep perchance to dream ay theres the rub 
for in that sleep of death what dreams may come 
when we have shuffled off this mortal coil 
must give us pause theres the respect 
that makes calamity of so long life 
for who would bear the whips and scorns of time 
the oppressors wrong the proud mans contumely 
the pangs of disprized love the laws delay 
the insolence of office and the spurns 
that patient merit of the unworthy takes 
when he himself might his quietus make 
with a bare bodkin who would fardels bear 
to grunt and sweat under a weary life 
but that the dread of something after death 
the undiscovered country from whose bourn 
no traveler returns puzzles the will 
and makes us rather bear those ills we have 
than fly to others that we know not of 
thus conscience does make cowards of us all 
and thus the native hue of resolution 
is sicklied oer with the pale cast of thought 
and enterprise of great pith and moment 
with this regard their currents turn awry 
and lose the name of action

agriculture department analysts say watermelons 
may be making a comeback but have no firsthand figures to back it 
up 
thats because nobody at usda has counted watermelons since 1981 
although the annual production of honeydew melons is reported 
faithfully including the number of acres planted and harvested 
along with the crops yearly value 
watermelon output is probably four five or six times that of 
honeydew production which is concentrated in arizona california 
and texas commercial watermelon farmers are reported in more than 
two dozen states 
i dont know why they arent reported says gary lucier of 
the departments economic research service i asked that question 
too 
in a telephone interview on monday lucier said production 
information from the industry apparently will be relied upon heavily 
as usda develops a new marketing program financed by watermelon 
growers and handlers 
lucier and amy j allred another economist analyzed the us 
watermelon situation in a new report issued by the agency 
through 1980 us production was trending downward and 
domestic utilization was in a tailspin the report said 
domestic watermelon production gradually fell from 293 million 
hundredweight in 1960 to 261 million in 1981 the last year usda 
officially estimated production 
although national figures from the department are lacking some 
states continue to report production these show that production in 
those states have increased onefourth since 1981 including gains 
in florida south carolina and arizona 
favorable grower prices have contributed to the gains the 
report said in addition available state production data show 
that per capita use has increased onefifth since the 1980 low 
part of the per capita increase is due to an overall trend to 
more fresh produce in diets more watermelon imports and the 
convenience of relatively new icebox and seedless melons plus 
better produce marketing in retail stores 
a major step was taken in february when commercial watermelon 
growers and handlers voted in favor of a national promotion program 
authorized by the 1985 farm law the usda is in the process of 
writing final regulations and clearing the way for naming a 
29member national watermelon promotion board 
the boards program will be financed beginning in 1990 by an 
assessment on watermelons sold for human consumption the levy can 
be set at a rate of up to two cents per 100 pounds paid by first 
handlers and producers who grow five or more acres of melons 
a grower who also is a handler would pay assessments for each 
function the fees are refundable upon request but the national 
watermelon association hopes the plan will raise 1 million annually 
the association last week held its annual watermelon feast day on 
capitol hill and in the agriculture department itself including the 
appearance of this years national watermelon queen jennifer morris 
of southern pines nc 
according to the association the us watermelon industry with 
a farm value of 160 million produces two billion or more pounds 
of watermelon in nearly 30 states led by florida and followed by 
texas georgia california south carolina mississippi alabama 
indiana arizona north carolina oklahoma missouri maryland 
delaware and arkansas

agriculture secretary clayton yeutter says that 
if all requests he receives were honored the federal budget deficit 
would be two or three times its current level of more than 150 
billion 
yeutter told a meeting of the american seed trade association 
that around 75 percent of his mail comes from people asking for more 
federal assistance of some kind 
most of these letters are coming from members of congress of 
course reflecting concerns of their constitutents he said if 
the government were to honor all of those pleas for additional 
funding that 150 billion deficit that we have now would 
probably double or treble just based on agricultural requests 
alone aside from what the rest of the economy is asking for 
yeutter said there are many views as to whether american farmers 
have become addicted to federal subsidies he said his home state of 
nebraska last year had a net farm income of something over 2 
billion of which more than 1 billion came from the government 
thats pretty addictive he said

a belgian air force colonel accused of 
giving top secret belgian and nato documents to the soviet union was 
convicted of treason tuesday and sentenced to 20 years at hard labor 
col guy binet was sentenced by the military court to 20 years at 
hard labor and discharged from the armed forces he could have 
received life imprisonment but the prosecutor had asked for a 
15year sentence 
binet 54 had given secret belgian and nato military documents 
for which he received the equivalent of 105000 according to 
testimony at the trial which began earlier this month 
belgian defense minister guy coeme said at the time of binets 
arrest in september 1980 that the colonel was driven by profit 
motives rather than ideological reasons 
binets lawyers argued that he did not act for money that the 
sum he received had been placed in a bank in luxembourg and turned 
over to belgian authorities 
binet began spying for the soviet union in 1986 coeme said but 
an investigation revealed the first contact with soviet agents took 
place three years earlier

the soviet union used an eastwest human rights 
conference last week to sell itself as host for a followup session 
in 1991 
laboring under us and british threats to boycott the moscow 
conference if sufficient progress in human rights is not made the 
soviet delegation tried to dispel doubts about its sincerity 
the monthlong conference on the human dimension which ended 
friday was the first of three on human rights held in the framework 
of the 1975 helsinki accords 
ambassador yuri b kashlev said his delegation held more than 100 
meetings with journalists and human rights groups assuring a high 
profile and an open and straightforward position that drew 
positive response 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze set the tone in a speech may 
30 at the 35nation forum saying the affirmation of individual 
rights should be the objective of all countries 
a soviet official later paid his nations first clear homage to 
raoul wallenberg the swedish diplomat who saved thousands of jews 
in hungary in world war ii then disappeared after being arrested by 
occupying soviet forces 
we profoundly regret the death of this noble person said 
vladimir andreyev of the soviet prosecutors office wallenbergs 
fate he said is a somber page in our history 
over the following month the affable soviet delegation laid on 
news conferences and opened its doors to special interest groups 
with grievances about human rights abuses in the soviet union 
the soviets deny they fear a us boycott of the moscow meeting 
and say their attitude reflects the fruits of president mikhail s 
gorbachevs policies of social and economic reforms 
its not an artificial thing said kashlev even before the 
decision on the moscow conference we were the same open people 
its not just a trick to persuade somebody 
the united states agreed to attend the moscow conference in the 
expectation that progress in human rights would continue and that 
free access by protest groups be guaranteed said a ranking member 
of the us delegation who asked not to be identified 
we have agreed and were planning to go he said but 
we would have a very hard time sending a delegation if things moved 
backward 
the decision has been taken said the soviet ambassador 
there is no force in the world that will stop it the moscow 
conference from being held 
with or without the americans the process of democratization 
will continue kashlev said 
its not because of their pressure its our own internal 
development its gorbachev who does this not mr abram he said 
of morris b abram head of the us delegation in paris 
the stakes for moscow are high holding the third conference 
there amounts to an affirmation of soviet compliance with the 
principles of the helsinki final act subscribed to by the nations of 
the conference on security and cooperation in europe the conference 
includes all european nations except albania as well as the united 
states and canada 
the three human rights conferences were decided on at the close 
of a january meeting in vienna the second conference will be held 
next year in copenhagen and a final meeting is scheduled for 
helsinki in 1992 
the united states and west european nations have acknowledged 
broad soviet progress in human rights under gorbachev 
while east bloc allies romania and bulgaria were criticized for 
human rights abuses the soviet union was praised for progress and a 
new spirit of cooperation 
the soviets have taken some comfort that they are not the 
worst said the us delegate they have used a 
nonconfrontational more tolerant approach than weve seen 
before he said 
for quite a long time our position was hands off its our 
internal affair kashlev said we have changed completely much 
more than the west

agencies to expand efforts to open suburban boston housing to black 
families 
ruling in a lawsuit filed 11 years ago us district judge 
walter j skinner ordered the state to give the boston fair housing 
commission authority to issue subpoenas levy fines and start civil 
actions to attack discrimination 
skinner agreed with the charge in the lawsuit by the boston naacp 
that the us department of housing and urban development failed to 
use its grant programs to produce an adequate supply of affordable 
integrated family housing in the metropolitan area 
skinners findings dealt with hud practices between 1977 to 1982 
but he wrote the conditions exacerbated by huds pattern of 
inaction apparently continue to exist and are currently 
remediable 
the ruling made public monday is a blockbuster a whole new 
world said dianne wilkerson of the boston chapter of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people this ruling 
changes life for minorities in boston in some very major ways this 
is just amazing 
hud spokeswoman jacqueline roundtree said the department had not 
decided whether to appeal 
the ruling orders hud and the state to require owners of all 
governmentassisted housing in metropolitan boston to participate 
fully in antidiscrimination programs it also orders boston to 
create a clearinghouse with a list of federally assisted housing 
units 
in 1985 skinner dismissed the lawsuit saying he lacked 
authority to review and correct hud practices in 1987 an appeals 
court said skinner did have authority and ordered him to reopen the 
case

in the old jail where a mob 145 years ago killed church founder 
joseph smith and his brother 
mormon church president ezra taft benson gov james r thompson 
and more than 3000 others attended ceremonies marking the end of a 
restoration project at the site considered sacred by the worlds 65 
million mormons 
gordon hinckley first counselor to benson recalled the shooting 
of smith and his brother hyrum on june 27 1844 as part of an 
epic story of martyrdom 
few could foresee the future stature of the man whose blood 
stained the floor of this jail hinckley said we are grateful 
for the reconciliation that has come with the passage of time 
the jail has been restored to its 1844 appearance a statue of 
the smiths and six slate monuments inscribed with quotations from 
joseph smith also were unveiled

town as its home but nonbelievers persecuted the mormons over 
smiths claims that he had spoken with god 
joseph and hyrum were summoned to carthage to stand trial and 
were being held at the jail when they were murdered by the mob it 
is a sacred place to us said loren c dunn president of the 
restoration project 
two years later brigham young led church followers to their 
eventual home in salt lake city the church is spending 20 million 
to uncover church roots in illinois and restore the settlement at 
nauvoo now a town of 1100 people

national party chief fw de 
klerk said tuesday that european leaders he met on a recent tour 
understand south africa must go through a gradual process of reform 
de klerk designated the next president of south africa 
indicated that international pressure and economic sanctions on his 
country may ease as long as it is visible that were really 
working towards a negotiation situation 
at the airport news conference de klerk did not say how he 
planned to engage leaders of the disenfranchised black majority in 
negotiations to end the apartheid system of race discrimination 
he said he gave no concrete agenda to leaders he met in 
britain west germany portugal italy switzerland and the vatican 
neither i nor those whom i had discussions with attempted to 
make unrealistic demands or create unrealistic expectations de 
klerk said 
his overall impression from the tour is that there is 
realization that what happens here must be stepbystep and that 
there is realization that to really have successful renewal and 
change in south africa which will not affect the stability of this 
country the first step is to broaden and intensify the base of 
discussions as a phase even before what one could call a real 
negotiation phase 
opponents say pretoria uses minor reforms to shield itself 
against criticism and delay the advent of black rule in south africa 
at nearly every stop on his european tour de klerk was asked 
about the release of nelson mandela leader of the outlawed african 
national congress who has been imprisoned since 1962 under a life 
sentence for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the government 
asked about mandela on tuesday de klerk referred to the sept 6 
parliamentary elections after which he is expected to succeed 
president pw botha 
i want to win the election for my party and i wouldnt like to 
make particular statements as to what i in whatever position one 
might be will particularly do afterward de klerk said 
indicating mandelas release would lose him votes among rightwing 
whites 
botha suffered a stroke this year and has said he will retire 
after the elections 
also on tuesday west german labor minister norbert bluem said he 
had a tough encounter with botha with the president refusing to 
discuss condemned prisoners or allow him to visit mandela 
instead bluem said botha briefed him on economic progress in 
south africa 
bluem said he replied that human rights are not determined by 
improved living standards alone a man does not live on bread 
alone bluem said botha answered that he botha will decide 
which position is the right one 
when bluem asked to see mandela botha referred him to the 
minister of justice who was not on the west germans itinerary

the head of the national council of churches 
announced his resignation today in a dispute over the future of the 
countrys biggest ecumenical organization 
the rev arie r brouwer general secretary of the council since 
1985 said the organization is not ready to pursue the unifying 
goals he set for it 
the time is not ripe for it he said in announcing he will 
step down on friday 
the council which includes most major protestant and eastern 
orthodox churches in the country has been enmeshed in controversy 
for three years over departmental accountability and authority as 
well as financial difficulties 
brouwer who came close to being dismissed a month ago had 
pressed for closer integration of various council units against 
stiff resistance by some officials 
their dream was different than mine he said 
brouwer 53 a reformed church in america clergyman said the 
rupture was clarified for him by a 5757 vote over a move to dismiss 
him at the councils governing board meeting in lexington ky last 
month 
since the vote pressure for brouwer to step down continued 
i will be in prayer and fasting over the days and weeks to 
come brouwer had said after the vote 
brouwer riled some board members with a scathing report in 
lexington saying recent months had been a crucifixion a journey 
through hell 
he said the ecumenical atmosphere has been fouled with rumors 
innuendo and false charges poured forth from the bureaucratic 
rumor mill public media and religious press defending his own 
leadership style he said 
the problem is that i have dared to speak the truth to the will 
to power the powerful are not accustomed to such behavior and 
they are outraged they will not have it 
the main conflict had come over moves to make the council a more 
united body functioning as a communion of communions with each 
department sharing proportionately in central administrative costs 
that system was strongly resisted by church world service the 
councils relief arm and financially biggest operation the service 
had operated somewhat independently and with its own revenues 
a furor developed in mid1988 when the services executive the 
rev j richard butler resigned because of conflict with brouwer 
over integrating the service more closely with other council units 
as a result of the internal stress general recommedations of a 
reorganizational committee were approved at the lexington meeting 
consolidating the councils 11 units into four 
measures that would give member denominations more direct 
oversight of the council units were part of the plan specifics of 
which were to be worked out in september

attorney general dick thornburgh told a black 
audience today that the bush administration wont pursue legislation 
to overturn recent supreme court decisions on civil rights 
however thornburgh said he would monitor implementation of the 
rulings and take any legislative or executive action that might be 
required to resolve inequities 
the pursuit and promotion of civil rights in america is more 
than a legal obligation it is a moral imperative embodied in our 
national sense of fairness and justice thornburgh told the annual 
convention of operation push the civil rights group founded by the 
rev jesse jackson 
the high court adopting some positions advocated by the justice 
department under the reagan administration has restricted 
affirmative action programs and made it more difficult for 
plaintiffs to prove discrimination in the workplace 
the decisions have prompted calls from some lawmakers to consider 
legislation to overturn the rulings 
president bush told a news conference today his advisers 
concluded that none of the rulings has jeopardized the principles of 
equal opportunity for all americans he said if the courts 
decisions turn out to hamper civil rightrs enforcement he would 
consider legislation 
thornburgh in his first public pronouncement on the 
controversial cases said some viewed the decisions as a retreat 
in the battle for civil rights 
but thornburgh asked do these decisions stand in conflict 
with this nations fundamental commitment to ensure the provision of 
civil rights of all americans or do these decisions represent 
attempts by the court to finetune the complexities of enforcement 
of civil rights law in america 
thornburgh said the effect of the rulings would not be felt until 
they are applied in new cases but that president bush had asked him 
to monitor their implementation 
this responsibility is one i take very seriously and one that 
the department of justice will approach consistent with our 
commitment to the goals of fairness and equality in our quest for 
equal opportunity thornburgh said 
during a discussion following the speech several panelists 
expressed disappointment that thornburgh didnt favor immediate 
legislation to overturn the high court rulings 
in the past six days the supreme court has basically repealed 
title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 said julius chambers 
director of the naacp legal defense and educational fund inc 
it disappoints us to put it mildly to suggest that we must 
now wait to see how these decisions work in practice 
we ask the administration to express the same reverence for 
equal opportunity as for the american flag said employment rights 
lawyer nancy creiter referring to president bushs proposal for a 
constitutional amendment to overturn the high courts legalization 
of flag burning 
ralph g neas executive director of the leadership conference on 
civil rights an umbrella group of civil rights organizations 
nationwide had said the administrations response would be an 
important test 
president bush has repeatedly stated his commitment to civil 
rights and to minority outreach efforts however a decision to 
oppose legislation to overturn the recent supreme court decisions 
would be completely incompatible with such a commitment neas said 
before thornburghs speech 
indeed remedial legislation has become the no 1 priority for 
everyone committed to equal employment opportunity for all 
americans neas said 
thornburgh spoke at the invitation of jackson who hailed the 
attorney generals commitment to civil rights after the two met at 
the justice departent last winter 
the lights have been turned back on in the justice department 
and hopefully the dust will be cleared from the books jackson 
told reporters that day he was referring to the reagan 
administrations civil rights record which was roundly criticized 
by black leaders 
as he did after the meeting with jackson thornburgh has 
repeatedly expressed commitment to the full enforcement of civl 
rights laws and the full enjoyment of equal opportunity by all 
of its citizens 
but the attorney general has conceded he may have differences 
with civil rights leaders about achieving those goals 
william lucas whose nomination to head the justice departments 
civil rights division has split the civil rights lobby was 
accompanying thornburgh to the convention 
a black republican from michigan lucas nomination is opposed by

breasts on a city beach pleaded innocent tuesday saying a state law 
that permits men to go shirtless discriminates against women 
ten women were charged on saturday with exposure of person a 
violation under state law two defendants did not enter pleas and 
were rescheduled to appear wednesday 
the women dubbed the topfree 10 said the state law that permits 
men to go shirtless in public is unconstitutional because it 
discriminates against women 
because the law is unjust i plead not guilty kathie reilly 
told judge john manning regan in rochester city court he scheduled 
a pretrial conference for aug 1 
the women are repeating a 1986 protest in which seven women were 
arrested in a city park for going topless and spent a week in court 
trying to convince a judge that the state nudity law is unfair 
in 1986 judge herman walz dismissed the charges against the 
women saying they were expressing their right to free speech by 
exposing their breasts as a form of protest 
the women have been having topfree equality picnics for the

president bush said tuesday he would not exhort 
the polish and hungarian people on his visit to their countries next 
month to take actions that might invite repression bush said there 
was no reason for soviet president mikhail s gorbachev to get 
uptight about the trip 
i want to see a much more open europe bush said and i 
think that the importance of the visit is along that line its not 
going to be that were going to solve the problem of the hungarian 
economy or the polish economy 
at a wideranging news conference bush took a relaxed view of 
ussoviet competition and gorbachevs own travels to the west for 
instance bush said it was a good thing that the soviet leader 
went to west germany earlier this month 
its a good thing for him to go to western europe and its a 
good thing for the president of the united states to go to eastern 
europe bush said i want to see us move beyond containment 
bush will visit poland july 911 stopping both in the capital 
warsaw and in gdansk the port city on the baltic where the 
solidarity labor movement spurred economic and political change in 
the communist government 
bush will go on from there to budapest the capital of hungary 
for a july 1113 visit also designed to accelerate economic and 
political change in the most liberal of the soviet unions east 
european allies 
he will be the third us president to visit the region while in 
the white house the others were richard m nixon and jimmy carter 
bush said he would bring an economic package to poland and had 
discussed us legislation to carry out the undisclosed plan with 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the senate finance 
committee however the president stressed us support for the 
polish economy would require further reforms there 
in any event bush said in regard to both poland and hungary that 
being there is the significant thing it is important that the 
united states show its interest in these countries that are 
undergoing change you dont want to overexhort you dont want to 
overpromise you dont want to rally people to levels of political 
activity that might cause repression 
at the same time bush said the trip which precedes his 
participation in an economic summit meeting in paris with the 
leaders of britain canada france italy west germany and japan 
was not designed to send a signal to moscow 
i would not expect them to be uptight about it bush said 
mr gorbachev goes to western europe and is wellreceived and i 
will go to eastern europe and i will be wellreceived 
the pace of change in both poland and hungary has accelerated 
since bush scheduled his trip 
solidarity has won 99 of 100 senate seats in two rounds of 
elections as well as all the contested races for the lower house in 
hungary the communist leadership chose as party chairman rezsoe 
nyers a prominent advocate of democratic change and appointed him 
to a new fourman ruling body dominated by such advocates 
a us official speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
developments in both countries were welcomed and unlikely to affect 
bushs trip much however the official said there is a lot of 
nervousness in poland about whom gen wojciech jaruzelski the 
likely president in a new government will appoint to be prime 
minister 
its the sort of thing that happens when you get into a 
democratic system the official said democracy is less tidy 
and yet were relaxed about this 
in hungary he said the changes were expected the reform 
elements are clearly more in control the official said the 
situation looks like it will be relatively stable at least until the 
party congress in the fall 
bush described his intentions in the two countries this way 
what i want to do is make clear where the united states stands 
in terms of our respect for freedom encourage reform as much as 
possible and then offer some specifics where we can help on the 
economy 
we will support those that move toward us economically 
politically and in terms of human rights and its more on those 
general themes that i will be talking to the hungarian leaders and 
the polish leaders

salvadoran president alfredo cristiani has formed a national 
commission to talk to the fmln guerrilla movement 
we urge the fmln to stop the killing and talk to the 
commission said department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler

retired army colonel who had served as head of the public security 
academy an fmln death squad had admitted responsibility for the 
killing ms tutwiler said 
the nations attorney general and the minister of the presidency 
also were slain recently

a prematurely dropped anchor may have 
contributed to an 800000gallon oil spill in the delaware river 
that had hundreds of workers today gathering blobs of black 
jello that mechanical skimmers couldnt suck up 
the spill was one of three that occurred in us waters over the 
weekend 
more civilian and military workers were pressed into service this 
morning to clean up the delaware oil and the state sued in federal 
court to recover damages from the owners of the uruguayan tanker 
that caused the spill 
in texas tropical storm allison slowed the cleanup of a 
240000gallon spill in the houston ship channel off rhode island 
most of the estimated 420000 gallons of oil from a grounded greek 
tanker no longer threatened the shore 
officials in charge of the delaware cleanup were concerned about 
a forecast for 95degree heat which could liquefy the oil 
when weve got it in chunks we can pick it up when its 
flowing you cant pick it up with a pitchfork said coast guard 
capt larry murdock 
more than 500 people including 300 delaware national guardsmen 
and 22 boats were involved in the cleanup today in philadelphia 
coast guard spokesman david oney said this morning that delaware was 
sending 150 more guardsmen 
so far weve recovered 63826 gallons from the spill oney 
said 
in the search for the causes of the spills two coast guard 
hearings began this morning 
in texas the pilot of the tanker rachelb which collided with 
an oil barge owned by coastal towing co of houston testified that 
he was unable to make a proper turn from the bayport channel into 
the houston ship channel 
it could have been caused by too much sediment in the 
channel pilot michael gale said 
in providence ri capt david g leonard a harbor pilot 
testified that he radioed three warnings to the tanker that ran 
aground but could not be certain the message was received 
gov edward diprete testified that he asked the tanker captain 
iakovos georgoudis why were you in that location which requires a 
pilot to be on board 
he said that was my mistake diprete said he made no 
bones about it 
coast guard capt eric williams said no evidence of mechanical 
failure had been found 
along 20 miles of the delaware river workers in boats scooped up 
blobs of congealed oil larger than basketballs stuffing the goo 
into large trash bags skimmers dispatched after the uruguayan 
tanker presidente rivera ran aground saturday jammed in the dense 
oil blobs 
its like black jello its horrible said joseph monigle of 
new castle del as he watched workers from the shore 
a lawyer representing the insurance company covering the 
presidente rivera says the spill was caused by the crew dropping 
anchor prematurely as the ship prepared to dock at the sun oil 
terminal in marcus hook pa 
attorney a robert degen said after the ship swung around to pick 
up the anchor the decision was made to turn the ship around and 
head to marcus hook in the course of turning the ship around the 
bow struck the bottom 
coast guard officials scheduled a hearing wednesday in 
philadelphia on the spill 
federal officials said shoreline damage in pennsylvania and 
delaware was light because the oil congealed instead of spreading 
across the surface of the water winds and tides spared new jersey 
delaware fish and wildlife officers found about 25 canada geese 
soaked with oil monday near the mouth of the christiana river which 
feeds the delaware river coast guard spokesman david oney said 
in rhode island there had been some reports of lobsters killed 
and several small birds found dead but officials said those did not 
appear to be widespread some state beaches were being reopened 
today 
a statewide shellfishing ban remained in effect and seafood 
prices increased ron pariseau manager of handrigan seafood said 
wholesale steamer claims jumped from 55 to 85 a bushel during the 
past week while flounder went from 40 cents to 95 cents a pound at 
retail flounder filets that cost 449 a pound 10 days ago were 
selling for 599 a pound 
no more than five percent of the oil that spilled from the world 
prodigy after it hit a reef remained floating officials said monday 
the worst is over said debbie payton of the national 
oceanographic and atmospheric administration theres not going to 
be any more shoreline impacts like there were at the beginning 
in texas the storm slowed the cleanup but workers have been 
able to collect nearly 4000 or the 6000 barrels of oil 
in washington a spokesman for president bush accused the oil 
industry of moving too slowly on oilspill cleanup technology and 
said the three spills highlight the pervasiveness of the problem 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater said the 
administration has proposed legislation to give tanker owners 
first level of responsibility for paying cleanup costs he ruled 
out a moratorium on new oil drilling and exploration

willie star the roving ambassador from nauru 
was found tuesday on the us territory of guam and seemed puzzled 
by the recent hullabaloo in the state department over his supposed 
disappearance 
tw star known to his friends as willie is officially listed 
as ambassador to the united states from nauru a tiny island 
republic in the western pacific but hasnt been seen in washington 
since he presented his diplomatic credentials to president carter 
nine years ago 
the state department had been sending letters and diplomatic 
cables for several weeks in an unsuccessful attempt to find star 
rumored to be living in australia or the philippines to determine 
whether hes interested in becoming dean of the diplomatic corps a 
ceremonial post traditionally held by the senior resident ambassador 
in washington 
finally on tuesday an associated press reporter in honolulu 
located star by telephone at the pacific star hotel on guam in the 
western pacific where he said he has served as naurus consul 
general for the past year 
he sounded puzzled over the state departments search for him 
asked if he is still the us ambassador from nauru star 
replied i dont think so i dont know ill have to talk to my 
government then he hung up 
larry dunham of the state departments diplomatic and consular 
section laughed when informed of stars whereabouts as small 
nations sometimes do he said nauru had failed to follow the 
customary practice of informing the state department of a consular 
appointment 
this is unusual but everything about this case has been 
unusual dunham said 
ordinarily he said foreign governments inform the state 
department of consular appointments through their embassy in 
washington but nauru does not maintain an embassy here stars 
wife reached by telephone tuesday in guam said her husband had 
never lived in washington 
stars presence on guam apparently also went unnoticed because 
the territorys affairs are administered by the interior department 
the state department has no representative on guam 
mrs star speaking to a reporter in her husbands absence 
tuesday said star previously had served as naurus consul general 
in melbourne australia and the philippines capital of manila 
before he was moved to guam about a year ago 
the state departments manhunt for star began shortly after the 
retirement last month of swedens popular ambassador wilhelm 
wachtmeister who had been dean of the diplomatic corps for three 
years 
under protocol rules the honorary post goes to the foreign 
ambassador with the most seniority in washington based on the date 
the envoys credentials were presented to the us president 
the dean who receives no extra pay represents other ambassadors 
at ceremonial functions and in dealings with the host government 
over diplomatic immunity parking privileges and other collective 
concerns 
after wachtmeister retired the deanship passed to the next 
eligible ambassador andrew jacovides of cyprus who was promptly 
summoned home for a foreign ministry job next in line was turkeys 
sukru elekdag but he is retiring then the state department turned 
to star the ambassador from nauru who had been doubling as consul 
general in melbourne 
a letter was dispatched to star via the us embassy in canberra 
australia informing him of his opportunity to become dean of the 
diplomatic corps provided he takes up residence in washington 
star never responded the embassy had no luck finding him 
stan ifshin a state department desk officer for pacific island 
affairs said that the department will await clarification from 
nauru about whether star is still us ambassador i dont believe 
he is ifshin said 
if star doesnt take the deanship it probably will go to the 
ambassador from cape verde an island republic in the atlantic off 
the west african coast

judges are adhering to federal guidelines 
designed to end disparities in criminal sentences the chairman of 
the us sentencing commission said tuesday 
more than 82 percent of the sentences handed down by federal 
judges fall within the guidelines in effect since nov 1 1987 
william wilkins said at a news conference 
he said his conclusions were based on a random sample of 25 
percent of the guideline cases handled over a 16month period ending 
march 31 
more than 9 percent of the sentences were below the guidelines 
and nearly 3 percent above it he said adding that more than 5 
percent fell below the guidelines because defendants provided 
substantial assistance to the government 
wilkins a federal appeals court judge said the system was 
working well and represented a dramatic improvement over earlier 
sentencing 
the commission was established because federal judges were giving 
widely different sentences for similar crimes the law enacted by 
congress in setting up the panel mandated that defendants convicted 
of similar crimes receive similar sentences 
critics have predicted that guideline sentencing would bring 
the justice system to its knees inducing an avalanche of trials by 
defendants who previously would have pleaded guilty wilkins said 
however he said more than 90 percent of the more than 7000 
defendants sentenced under the guidelines pleaded guilty

hundreds of cambodian refugees who fled 
a camp controlled by communist khmer rouge guerrillas will be 
returned to the khmer rouge a thai security official said today 
in washington however state department spokeswoman margaret 
tutwiler said the thai government confirmed to us officials that 
the refugees will be allowed to remain in noncommunist resistance 
camps 
she said the action followed strong appeals from us officials 
to the thai government that the refugees not be placed back under 
khmer rouge control because their safety could not be assured 
the united states goverment continues to be strongly opposed to 
the return of these cambodians to khmer rouge control she said 
the estimated 600 refugees now are in a camp run by the 
noncommunist khmer peoples national liberation front 
the khmer rouge widely accused of human rights violations in 
areas under their control have asked that the refugees be returned 
but the un border relief operation has insisted the cambodians be 
allowed to decide where they want to live 
the refugees had fled the khmer rouge camp of kaiche after it was 
attacked in midapril 
it was unclear why there were conflicting accounts about the fate 
of the refugees 
the thai official speaking on condition of anonymity said that 
as a compromise the military decided the refugees should be 
moved to site 8 the only khmer rouge camp where the guerrillas have 
allowed aid officials to give refugees full medical and other 
services 
site 8 is north of kaiche which is along the cambodian border 
and in thailands eastern trat province 
the thai official did not say when the transfer would take place 
a western relief official also speaking on condition of 
anonymity called it a facesaving decision in which the 
military would avoid criticism for returning the refugees to kaiche 
yet still support the khmer rouge the largest of three guerrilla 
groups fighting cambodias vietnambacked government 
the official said some refugees have reasons to flee khmer 
rouge control 
the khmer rouge killed hundreds of thousands of people when it 
ruled cambodia from 1975 until vietnamese forces invaded and ousted 
it from power in late 1978 
the group fled to the border established camps just inside 
thailand and allied itself with guerrillas of the peoples national 
liberation front and of prince norodom sihanouk 
violations reported in khmer rouge refugee camps have included 
forcing children to porter arms through mine fields and denying 
people emergency medical treatment 
the relief official called the flight of the refugees to sok sann 
one of the largest escapes from a khmer rouge camp in recent years 
the refugees fled after gunners inside cambodia shelled kaiche 
and the nearby ta luan camp in april relief officials believe 
hundreds of people were hurt but the khmer rouge refused to allow 
any to be evacuated to outside hospitals 
in early may the guerrillas moved several thousand refugees from 
ta luan closer to the border evidently to prevent the united 
nations from carrying out a plan to move them to a new safer site

compromise plan but held the door open for further negotiations with 
the timber industry over protecting the spotted owl in oregon and 
washington 
andy kerr conservation director for the oregon natural resources

accept the compromise proposed saturday by gov neil goldschmidt and 
the states congressional delegation at a socalled spotted owl 
summit in salem

trees that could be cut on federal land in the two states while 
protecting some of the older forests where the rare northern spotted 
owl nests 
a statement issued by environmental groups said they could not 
accept the timber harvest figures in the compromise without more

congressmen to attach a rider to an appropriations bill that comes 
up in a house committee wednesday

a city councilman faced a recall 
election today for getting a tough new antismoking ordinance passed 
the ordinance sponsored by councilman richard chapman banned most 
indoor smoking in public places as of april 19 
it led a smokersrights group to gather enough signatures to 
force todays recall election the first involving an albuquerque 
city councilor 
critics have also charged that chapman votes his personal views 
and ignores the wishes of the people he represents 
hes got an insatiable ego and is arrogant and his usefulness 
has long since expired said frank bowden an organizer of recall 
campaign 
chapman 41 said he sponsored the bill because polls showed most 
people in albuquerque favored smoking restrictions he said he has a 
politicsforthepeople attitude but cant please everyone all the 
time 
chapman will lose his seat if a majority of the voters in his 
district choose to remove him in addition at least 1943 would 
have to vote against him half the number of votes cast in the 1987 
election in which he won his seat 
the american smokers alliance a national smokers rights group 
said chapmans defeat could deter local governments from getting on 
the antismoking bandwagon

the junk bond market already troubled by the 
prospect of an economic slowdown could suffer a heavy blow if 
congress adopts legislation forcing savings and loans to sell the 
highrisk highyield securities economists say 
nevertheless members of congress upset about the wave of 
corporate takeovers and leveraged buyouts are determined to push 
thrifts out of the lucrative but speculative investment 
the question is simple said rep jim leach riowa 
should the us taxpayer subsidize leveraged buyouts takeover 
artists and large corporate mergers 
leach is one of the chief backers of a provision sponsored by 
rep byron dorgan dnd in housepassed sampl legislation it would 
forbid thrifts from buying junk bonds and force those that already 
own them to sell within two years 
the senate version is more lenient it maintains the current rule 
restricting the junk bond holdings of federally chartered sampls to 11 
percent of assets it extends the limit to statechartered 
institutions but allows them to exceed it if they can come up with 
extra capital 
a housesenate conference begins work in two weeks to resolve the 
many differences including the provisions affecting junk bonds in 
comprehensive legislation to bail out out and reform the sampl 
industry 
highyield highrisk bonds which are often used to finance 
hostile corporate raids and management buyouts are nicknamed junk 
bonds because they have no or a low credit rating commercial banks 
already are forbidden to invest in the bonds but thrifts have been 
allowed to buy them since the early 1980s 
relatively few thrifts own junk bonds only 161 sampls in 36 
states a little more than 5 percent of all sampls according to a 
report this spring by the general accounting office congress 
auditing agency 
most of those have relatively small investments ten thrifts 
account for threequarters of the industrys investment and only 
seven have junk bond portfolios exceeding the senates proposed 
limit 
but those numbers according to economists understate the extent 
of thrift involvement in junk bonds and the potential ripple effects 
of dorgans amendment 
between 1985 and 1988 sampl junk bond holdings increased by 136 
percent to 132 billion representing about 8 percent of the 
entire junk bond market according to the gao 
economists warn that if the dorgan amendment becomes law junk 
bond prices likely will fall and investors including the sampls 
themselves will get stuck for the losses 
i think its going to be very painful for a lot of these 
thrifts said economist elliott platt of donaldson lufkin and 
jenrette investors who hold junk bonds are going to have to 
monitor this legislation very very carefully 
those who defend allowing thrifts to own junk bonds say such 
investments have been unfairly criticized for all practical 
purposes a thrift buying a junk bond is taking no more risk than a 
thrift making a commercial loan they say 
secondly they say junk bonds offer high returns and they allow 
sampls in economically troubled regions to diversify by purchasing 
bonds from companies in healthy regions and industries 
economist paul getman of the wefa group a bala cynwyd pa 
consulting firm said junk bonds have been among the most profitable 
activities for thrifts wefa studied thrifts and junk bonds for the 
alliance for capital access a group representing junk bond issuers 
and investors 
junk bond critics say the bonds have never been tested by a 
recession when losses from defaults are likely to rise offsetting 
profits from highinterest earnings 
they also say extensive junk bond investment by thrifts diverts 
money from home mortgages and could allow collusion between sampls and 
securities firms selling the bonds 
the largest sampl investor in junk bonds is columbia savings and 
loan association of beverly hills calif which owns about 4 
billion representing 35 percent of its portfolio 
according to published reports the securities and exchange 
commission has been investigating allegedly unlawful trading 
arrangements between columbia and drexel burnham lambert inc the 
nations largest underwriter of high yield securities 
junk bond holdings are one of the areas of most abuse said 
economist david jones of aubrey g lanston amp co a government 
securities dealer in new york i as taxpayer dont want to be the 
ultimate guarantor of a sweetheart deal between an sampl and an 
investment firm

while she was pregnant will be tried next month despite arguments 
by defense lawyers that drug laws do not apply to the unborn

president bush fielded questions on china 
abortion and flagburning with ease tuesday but was hardpressed to 
explain why his grandson and not his granddaughters gets to go on 
the presidential fishing trips 
when they get older than about 3 i will do that bush replied 
with a tone of consternation about why 13yearold first grandson 
george p bush was getting all the perks 
the president said george p plays ball and does stuff 
that his younger sister brother and cousins cant yet handle 
actually four of bushs seven granddaughters are older than 3 
including george ps 11yearold sister noelle and 7yearold twin 
cousins jenna and barbara 
unlike george p they havent spent the past two weeks camped 
out at the white house flying with their grandfather to fish in the 
grand tetons or donning a tuxedo to attend a kennedy center 
extravaganza 
neither have bushs three other grandsons who are ages 5 4 and 
3 
the question from jessica lee of usa today about the handsome 
teenager bush calls his pride and joy struck a nerve in what 
was otherwise an unflappable performance by the earlyrising 
president 
bush squeezed in the 9 am edt news conference on short notice 
before a ceremonial welcome for the visiting prime minister of 
australia 
bush was asked when it would be the girls turn to go fishing or 
on some of these kind of excursions where youre doing the 
business of the nation to prepare them to be president 
the girls are a little young to go fishing in jackson hole 
and put up with marlin fitzwater and all these people bush 
replied referring to his staff 
i want them prepared for the real world im serious said 
bush adding that noelle had a wonderful time on her last visit 
to the white house in april 
my affection for our oldest grandson is just that hes there 
and hes ready and he plays ball and he does stuff said bush 
were going to the orioles game tomorrow i think it is but it is 
not discriminatory it is not discriminatory 
prematurely revealing plans to attend the wednesday night 
baseball game in baltimores memorial stadium was one of the few 
slips bush made 
it was bushs 16th formal news conference and his first in nearly 
three weeks the relaxed president held forth for almost 45 minutes 
taking five last questions before finally heading out the door 
no bush said he wont ask chinese prime minister li peng to 
return the cowboy boots bush gave him in february embossed with the 
american flag 
and i hope he doesnt ask for his bicycles back either said 
the president 
bush made a speech monday decrying spouse abuse and other 
violence against women asked if he intended to take that message to 
macho groups such as the national rifle association bush shot 
back hey listen im a member of the nra youre hurting my 
feelings as they say in china 
he said the soviets shouldnt be uptight about his upcoming 
visit to poland and hungary just as he didnt mind the raves soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev got on his tour of west germany 
i feel comfortable about the wavelength were on with the 
soviet union now said bush 
he cited small things that make him feel that way the soviets 
dispatching a ship to help clean up the oil mess in alaska and bush 
sending the armys crack burn team to help victims of a pipeline 
explosion in the soviet union 
bush said he wont be rushed into an early summit with gorbachev 
just for appearances sake 
ive been around this track long enough to know that you can 
always whip out something to sign a fishing agreement or something 
of this nature he said 
but he added that if there was no major treaty in the offing 
maybe well do it like this say hey lets get together 
he was a little more demonstrative than he wanted to be when 
asked about the senatepassed child care bill that bush disagrees 
with 
ive got to be careful of these gestures the way these rich 
little and these guys he said referring to comics who have had 
a field day with both the bush syntax and body language 
bush dodged or tried to only one question when asked about 
cincinnati reds manager pete rose and his betting case 
baseball the national pastime has sound rules regarding 
betting on baseball games and i simply am not going to get into 
that one said the president

the west german government has agreed to a us 
request to expel an iranian diplomat involved in a german companys 
sale of poisongas chemicals to iran the bush administration said 
tuesday 
secretary of state james a baker iii told visiting west german 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher about the sales during a 
luncheon last week said state department spokeswoman margaret 
tutwiler 
genscher said he knew nothing about the incident ms tutwiler 
said 
the company to circumvent stricter west german export controls 
bought the chemicals from a business in india another 
administration official said 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity declined to 
name the west german company 
the diplomat in charge of the chemical acquisition was identified 
as said karim ali sobhani an official of irans trade mission 
ms tutwiler said it was understandable that west german 
officials dont know about every sale by every west german company 
she also said the united states was satisfied with the west german 
response but doesnt view the case as closed 
news of the incident comes as congress considers several 
proposals to enact sanctions against nations and companies that sell 
chemical and biological weapons 
the proposed legislation was prompted by revelations last year 
that west german companies sold libya equipment for production of 
chemical weapons west germany tightened its export control laws as 
a result of the ensuing furor 
iran and iraq used chemical weapons during their nineyear war 
that ended last year 
use of the chemical weapons prompted the united states to join 
with its allies in seeking to halt sales of any chemicals that can 
be used by third world countries as weapons

preliminary evidence indicates no 
wrongdoing in the second death of a sailor within 16 months in 
training pools at pensacola naval air station a navy spokesman said 
tuesday 
it appears the safety procedures were followed to the letter 
before fridays death of michael fedie 22 a naval aviation officer 
candidate from altoona wis said cmdr dennis hessler public 
affairs officer for the naval education and training command 
that wasnt the case with the march 2 1988 death of airman 
recruit lee mirecki 19 of appleton wis who drowned during an 
intense rescueswimmer drill navy officials were secretive about 
investigations that led to disciplinary action against five enlisted 
instructors and an officer in mireckis death 
in this case it is sort of looking like theres nothing like 
that so we are being more forthcoming hessler said but he 
emphasized that everything was still preliminary 
fedie collapsed in shallow water while walking from a pool after 
an abandonship drill a navy spokesman said in the exercise 
trainees jump from a 12foot tower wearing flight suits and boots 
and swim 15 yards underwater to simulate avoiding burning fuel on 
the surface 
as early as saturday the navy disclosed preliminary autopsy data 
that indicated fedie died of acute cerebral edema a swelling of the 
brain and excess fluid that can be caused by lack of oxygen 
hessler said fedie was conscious after being pulled from the 
water fedie was questioned to determine if he was coherent and was 
able to tell rescuers who he was and give his class number hessler 
said 
in response to a question fedie said he did not hit his head on 
anything and the preliminary autopsy also indicated no evidence he 
had hit his head hessler said 
but fedie then went into convulsions and lost consciousness 
hessler said cardiopulmonary resuscitation and oxygen were 
administered at poolside before an ambulance took fedie to the 
pensacola naval hospital where he died 
fedie was a strong swimmer and had passed a physical examination 
june 9 hessler said 
one possibility is that fedie may have had a preexisting medical 
condition that failed to show up during the exam hessler said 
final autopsy results are expected in a couple of weeks but hessler 
was uncertain if they would be made public

doubt 
tony aliengena said tuesday if he does meet the soviet leader he 
knows exactly what he will say 
hello comrade gorbachev im happy i flew to russia he 
pronounced in russian 
meanwhile the pilot and his family are staying in an exclusive 
hotel normally reserved for members of the communist partys central 
committee their friendship flight 89 was the subject of an 
article in pravda and they held a news conference tuesday in the 
foreign ministry press center where senior government spokesmen 
usually give briefings 
the youngster is scheduled to meet unidentified officials at the 
kremlin on wednesday he hopes to present gorbachev with a 
friendship scroll signed by 250000 american children 
were still expecting wonders were expecting various 
surprises said gennady alferenko director of the foundation for 
social inventions a soviet foundation that helped sponsor the 
flight 
after the news conference aliengena visited red square where 
two years ago west german teenager matthias rust got a very 
different reception rust gained worldwide attention and more than a 
year in soviet prison for piloting his small plane past soviet air 
defenses and landing in red square

president bushs visceral reaction to a 
supreme court decision on flag burning echoes the emotional response 
by the four dissenting justices and millions of other americans 
and as bush demonstrated in 1988 to the undying regret of 
michael dukakis defending the flag against wouldbe desecrators 
also is good politics 
the same emotion that moved justice john paul stevens to read a 
dissenting opinion in court last week and that bush cited in his 
news conference tuesday is on display in congress where republicans 
and democrats already are rushing to overturn the courts ruling 
bush in calling for a constitutional amendment to undo the 
courts june 21 ruling that burning the american flag is a 
protected form of political protest described the flag as a 
unique national symbol 
stevens like the president a decorated world war ii veteran 
used that exact language in the dissenting opinion he read from the 
bench in a voice filled with emotion 
he said if the ideas of liberty and equality that motivated 
war heroes are worth fighting for it cannot be true that the flag 
that uniquely symbolizes their power is not itself worthy of 
protection from unnecessary desecration 
stevens isnt concerned with the next election but that makes 
him unusual in a hotly debated issue which links the court the 
congress and now the president 
the presidents successful 1988 presidential campaign emphasized 
patriotic values and included a muchpublicized visit to a factory 
where american flags are made 
he also attacked democratic opponent michael dukakis the 
governor of massachusetts for vetoing a bill that would have 
required public school teachers in that state to lead daily pledges 
of allegiance to the flag 
the lesson has not been lost on democrats 
one democratic member of congress douglas applegate of ohio 
said of the supreme court ruling im mad as hell what in gods 
name is going on america should be outraged 
even new house speaker thomas foley dwash who later said he 
does not favor a constitutional amendment to outlaw flag burning 
called the decision deeply offensive 
but foley reacted angrily tuesday when reporters suggested that 
republicans could make flag burning a partisan issue if democrats 
fail to push for a constitutional amendment 
im sure people will play politics with any emotional issue 
foley said 
he added that trying to capitalize on the flagburning flap would 
be playing the most cynical politics for the most base and 
crass political purposes but he also said a house subcommittee 
would soon conduct hearings on the various congressional proposals 
in the senate a resolution opposing the decision passed 973 
the dissenting votes belonged to democrats edward m kennedy of 
massachusetts and howard metzenbaum of ohio and republican gordon 
humphrey of new hampshire 
humphrey one of the senates bedrock conservatives has 
announced he will not seek reelection 
the courts decision dealt with symbolic speech some may 
consider the presidents response a form of symbolism as well 
to date emotional reactions have overwhelmed substantive 
discussion 
just what and who did the ruling protect 
the court overturned the conviction of a man charged with burning 
a flag not with stealing that flag or trespassing or disturbing 
the peace or threatening anyones safety 
nothing in the constitution would protect him from those other 
charges 
people have a right to burn their flags as a means of 
selfexpression even if it offends most people the court said but 
that constitutionally protected right does not apply when its 
someone elses flag on someone elses property or someone else is 
endangered 
some day somewhere in america someone so disturbed by high taxes 
might take a miniature american flag into the backyard and set it 
afire 
should that be a criminal act 
five supreme court members who apparently would view that act as 
the equivalent of an angry letter said no 
four high court members who apparently would view that act more 
as conduct than expression said yes 
the constitutional amendment backed by bush would permit criminal 
prosecution of that backyard protester

a pioneering space probe suggested 
saturns largest moon might be covered with an ocean of liquid 
natural gas but scientists who bounced radar off its surface say it 
may have some dry land or an icy surface 
we interpret our results to mean that the surface of titan is 
highly variable planetary scientist duane o muhleman said in an 
announcement issued monday by the california institute of technology 
titan nearly twice as massive as earths moon is one of only 
three moons in the solar system known to have atmospheres the 
others are jupiters moon io and neptunes moon triton 
data from voyager 1 in 1980 suggested that methane and ethane 
components of natural gas condense in titans mostly nitrogen 
atmosphere and rain on the surface leading some scientists to 
believe titan might be covered by up to a mile of liquid ethane and 
methane 
muhleman and his colleagues bounced 360000watt radar signals 
off titan during three 5hour periods on june 3 4 and 5 
an ethanemethane ocean would have low reflectivity creating 
weak radar echoes instead they found strong radar echoes during 
one observation period and weak echoes during the other two while 
titan rotated on its axis that suggests titan has oceans in some 
places and a solid surface in others

president bush said tuesday that china remains 
a country of strategic importance to the united states but a 
normalized relationship is impossible so long as chinese 
authorities continue their harsh crackdown on dissent 
at a news conference bush also expressed regret over chinas 
decision not to accept american peace corps volunteers for the time 
being 
im sorry that the chinese have made that decision bush said 
meanwhile chinese authorities gave 11 americans associated with 
a religious order until friday to leave the country last saturday 
officials seized religious materials from the group 
bush in his appearance before reporters maintained the same 
posture on overall us policy toward china that he embraced after 
the crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators three weeks ago 
its impossible at this moment to have what i would say are 
normalized relations for various very obvious reasons but i am 
going to do my level best to find a way to see improvement there 
that will help the chinese people bush said 
on the other hand bush said he cannot ignore the strategic side 
of the relationship with china 
he said china is important not only because it is a neighbor of 
the soviet union but also because it is able to exert influence in 
such senstive areas as cambodia and the korean peninsula 
citing what he said were the gains in relations with china bush 
said tens of thousands of chinese have studied here 30000 
students right this minute and go back home with a sense of 
what freedom and democracy are all about 
the ties with china also helped that country end the isolation of 
the 196676 cultural revolution and contributed to the evolution of 
a much more open economic system bush said 
with some fanfare before the upheaval in china got under way 
this spring the two countries signed an agreement for a peace corps 
contingent to go to china this fall to teach english 
chinas decision to postpone the arrival of the volunteers is the 
latest indication of the decline in relations between the two 
countries 
bush said if the chinese say theyre not welcome they cant 
come in and its too bad because one of the things that moved 
forward the reforms was contact with americans and i dont want to 
see those contacts cut off 
as for the 11 american ordered to leave state department 
officials had been concerned that chinese authorities might detain 
them for carrying out religious activities in china 
they had been charged by police with distributing religious 
literature and were ordered to remain in kunming 
the group associated with the latter rain ministry of 
litchfield ill had gone to china on june 13 ignoring a state 
department warning that travel for americans to china might be 
dangerous 
they had planned to leave china in early july but chinese 
authorities curtailed their visas ordering them out of the country 
by friday 
a 12th american was not ordered out of china but his 
multipleentry visa was taken away ms tutwiler said

an elementary school principal who drafted his 
own 11point peace plan said tuesday he canceled a trip to egypt to 
promote the proposal because israel barred him from meeting plo 
officials 
assad saftawi attracted attention with his plan calling for local 
palestinians to negotiate an interim autonomy for the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip 
the plan brought positive reactions from israeli officials who 
said it indicated palestinians from the occupied territories are 
willing to start negotiations without the palestine liberation 
organization which israel designates a terrorist group 
the officials considered it a favorable response to prime 
minister yitzhak shamirs proposal for elections in the occupied 
lands to choose palestinians to negotiate with israel about 
selfrule talks on the final status would be left until later 
but saftawi headmaster of a school in the gaza strips bureij 
refugee camp told israeli officials he needed plo approval 
there is no way that my peace plan will be valid unless the plo 
looks at it and agrees on it he said 
but the israelis think that if they let me go and talk to the 
plo they will recognize the plo in a roundabout way 
saftawi 54 said he is canceling his trip to egypt since the 
main purpose was to meet plo officials 
he met monday with shmuel goren israels coordinator for the 
occupied territories and conferred last month with defense minister 
yitzhak rabin 
the rabin meeting was considered significant because of saftawis 
history as a proplo activist convicted in 1973 for belonging to 
yasser arafats fatah faction 
fatah official salah khalaf was quoted tuesday as criticizing 
saftawis plan the kuwait daily alwatan quoted khalaf as saying 
i think we differ with this blueprint because we consider any 
separation between the elections and comprehensive solution to be 
designed to serve israels interests 
an israeli military official said goren warned saftawi he faced 
prosecution if he violated israeli laws barring contacts with the 
plo 
we told him that if he wants to go abroad he can do it if 
he disobeys the law however he will have to take the 
consequences the official said on condition of anonymity 
every palestinian who asks for permission to meet with plo 
officials gets the same answer he added 
violators from the occupied territories can be sentenced to up to 
10 years in jail said an army spokesman israeli violators can get 
up to three years in prison 
the attorney generals office said tuesday it is investigating 
three israeli legislators for meeting with arafat those under 
investigation are communist party members meir wilner and tawfik 
ziad and abdel wahab darousha an israeliarab from the democratic 
arab party

berlins largest synagogue nearly destroyed by 
world war ii bombs will be rebuilt as the center of jewish worship 
and culture in the citys communist eastern sector organizers said 
tuesday 
the announcement was made at a news conference in east berlin 
attended by heinz galinski the leader of west germanys jewish 
communities along with members of east berlins jewish community 
they make up a group called the association for rebuilding which is 
coordinating restoration of the synagogue 
east german leader erich honecker laid the cornerstone for 
rebuilding the synagogue last year but workers soon discovered that 
nearly the entire building will have to be torn down and reassembled 
west germany has pledged about 500000 toward restoration of the 
building but more is needed said hermann simon secretary of the 
rebuilding association he said there were no final estimates of the 
cost 
east german officials are counting on most of the cost to be 
covered by donations 
about 173000 jews lived in berlin before the nazi holocaust 
today about 6000 jews live in west berlin and about 300 jews live 
in east berlin 
the berlin synagogue was burned during the nazis crystal 
night attacks of nov 910 1938 but a policeman saved the 
building by calling the fire department allied bombers virtually

lawyers working on a new legal hotline for foreign 
students received dozens of queries tuesday from chinese worried 
about possible danger when they return home after joining in 
antigovernment protests 
some of the callers asked how to get foreign passports or how to 
defect said kohei sugino a spokesman for the free telephone 
service sponsored by the tokyo bar association committee for the 
protection of human rights 
the hotline had 74 calls tuesday its first day and will 
operate for two more days sugino said 
most of the callers were chinese worried that their 
participation in antigovernment demonstrations might endanger them 
when they go home 
they are extremely uneasy because japan grants visa extensions 
on a casebycase basis sugino said 
the japanese ministry of justice has announced it will consider 
granting individual sixmonth visa extensions for students who have 
finished their studies and whose visas have expired as of june 21 
43 such students had applied but no one had yet been granted the 
special extension said a justice ministry official speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
since japan does not give blanket visa extensions china will be 
able to find out which students are seeking to avoid going home 
sugino said 
he also said some students were concerned about returning home 
even temporarily there are rumors going around that students 
visiting home must report on their political activities to obtain a 
chinese exit visa to return to japan 
sugino said the lawyers advised callers on japanese visa 
procedures 
government officials say more than 7700 chinese students are in 
japanese universities or colleges and another 120000 chinese are 
in japan for business or other purposes

democratic change is so far advanced in hungary 
that it is conceivable a majority of the hungarian parliament will 
become noncommunist in the next two to five years a state 
department official told congress tuesday 
the official curtis w kamman deputy assistant secretary of 
state for european affairs told a house foreign affairs 
subcommittee the bush administration does not believe house 
legislation to reward hungary with a fiveyear exemption from 
economic and trade restrictions is needed 
he explained that hungary has removed practically all 
restrictions on the ability of its citizens to travel abroad or to 
emigrate at will the objective of the restrictions 
kamman said that while both hungary and poland are building 
democratic institutions hungary has drafted a new constitution and 
has scheduled multiparty local elections for the fall and multiparty 
national elections next year 
it is conceivable that within the next two to five years you 
could have a majority in the hungarian parliament that will be 
noncommunist kamman said 
he said both hungary and poland have permitted more freedom of 
speech and the press than ever before in modern times 
president bush will visit hungary and poland during his trip to 
europe next month and kamman said by his presence we will 
encourage and signify our commitment to their struggle for freedom 
and democracy 
kamman said the administration is working on economic initiatives 
for hungary similar to those bush announced for poland during a 
speech last month 
he was asked whether or not that progress could or might be 
reversed 
the potential for reversal is very very low he replied i 
really dont foresee it in either poland or hungary if the present 
leaders remain in power 
but he noted that the climate for democratic change could be 
altered if dramatic changes occurred in the soviet union 
altering its apparent present tolerance toward independent political 
development in eastern europe 
kamman said eastern europe can no longer be seen as a 
moscowdominated communist monolith 
he said democratic reforms are most advanced in hungary and 
poland and that there have been modest changes in czechoslovakia 
east germany and bulgaria the exception is romania where he said 
the political and economic situation appears to be rapidly 
deteriorating 
what we see now is that if the promise of reform is kept 
eastern europe will be a very different place more true to its own 
historical traditions more independent and ultimately more 
prosperous and stable kamman said 
it is no longer a bloc but an increasingly interesting and 
important grouping of individual countries each moving forward or 
sideways or as in romanias case backwards

the soviet ambassador met with turkeys 
foreign minister tuesday and indicated moscow may try to help 
resolve problems that have led to the exodus of tens of thousands of 
ethnic turks from bulgaria 
we are at the beginning of a road ambassador albert 
chernishev told reporters tuesday after meeting foreign minister 
todor zhivkov this diplomatic process will continue 
in the past month more than 75000 ethnic turks have crossed 
into turkey to escape an assimilation campaign the anatolia news 
agency said tuesday 
the mass emigration followed protests by ethnic turks in may in 
which bulgarian police used clubs and dogs to quell bulgaria said 
seven people died in the protests but western sources say up to 30 
died 
bulgaria then relaxed its emigration policies last week it said 
250000 ethnic turks had applied for passports and 150000 of them 
had received travel documents 
chernishev returned to turkey on monday after meeting last week 
with bulgarian president todor zhivkov and gave turkish officials a 
message from zhikov which he did not disclose 
bulgaria is a soviet ally but we also want to improve our 
relations with the friendly country turkey anatolia quoted 
chernishev as saying upon his return 
the foreign ministry issued a statement after the meeting and 
said there was no reason to be optimistic yet but the efforts of 
the soviet union were appreciated 
the ministry said the soviet union was trying to figure out how 
it could be helpful in solving the problems of ethnic turks who 
make up about 1 million of bulgarias 9 million people 
chernishev flew to moscow on june 21 after yilmaz summoned him to 
the foreign ministry and reportedly urged the the soviet union play 
a more active role in the plight of ethnic turks in bulgaria 
premier turgut ozal has called on bulgaria to open negotiations 
on the status of the mainly moslem ethnic turks who were forced to 
take bulgarian names and cannot speak their own language or practice 
their religion in bulgaria under a 1984 law 
bulgarias ethnic turks and christian slavs have been deeply 
suspicious of each other since its 500year rule by the ottoman 
empire bulgarian officials blame turkish propaganda for the exodus 
ozal wants to hold talks with bulgaria and the un high 
commissioner for refugees for an orderly transfer of ethnic turks 
who want to leave bulgaria turkey wants the ethnic turks to be 
allowed to dispose of their property and take their liquid wealth 
with them 
ozal said monday the soviet union has been boasting about its 
social and democratic reforms under mikhail s gorbachev and that 
the kremlins attitude to the problems of ethnic turks in bulgaria 
would put that to the test 
let us see what kind of a democrat gorbachev is ozal said in 
a speech at gazi university here

a federal judge has ordered the us department of 
housing and urban development the state and the city to work harder 
to eliminate racial discrimination in housing in metropolitan boston 
the ruling by us district judge walter jay skinner stems from a 
lawsuit filed 11 years ago by the national association for the 
advancement of colored people against hud 
dianne wilkerson of the naacp in boston called the ruling a 
blockbuster a whole new world 
this really is a challenge ms wilkerson said tuesday in 
the end its a challenge to hud secretary jack kemp jack kemp has 
said fair housing is a challenge for his administration if thats 
true they wont appeal 
jacqueline roundtree a hud spokeswoman in boston said agency 
attorneys were reviewing the ruling and had not decided whether to 
appeal 
the boston fair housing commission has found that eight of 10 
blacks who look for a home to rent or buy encounter discrimination 
ms wilkerson said fridays ruling gives them more means to fight 
back she said 
from 1977 to 1982 skinner said in his ruling hud broke federal 
law by failing to use its grant programs to produce an adequate 
supply of affordable integrated housing and failing to require 
effective fair housing enforcement by the city 
the conditions exacerbated by huds pattern of inaction 
apparently continue to exist and are currently remediable the 
ruling said 
skinners ruling orders 
hud to require that all landlords who get federal aid 
participate in programs that market suburban housing to lowincome 
minorities 
boston to create a housing opportunity clearinghouse that lists 
available public housing 
the state to give the boston fair housing commission legal 
authority to issue subpoenas levy fines and initiate civil actions 
against discrimination 
in 1985 skinner said he agreed with the naacp suit finding that 
hud was aware that boston had a history of racial bias in housing 
and that its acute shortage of lowincome family housing affected 
blacks more than whites 
however he dismissed the lawsuit then saying he lacked 
authority to review and correct the agencys practices in 1987 an 
appeals court said skinner did have authority and ordered him to 
reopen the case 
mayor raymond flynn said tuesday he welcomed the decision and has 
supported many similar remedies since becoming mayor in 1984 
marcia hertz a spokeswoman for the executive office of 
communities and development the state housing agency praised the 
ruling 
it actually mirrors the state policies already in place our 
programs and policies all have strong affirmative action 
components 
ms roundtree said if you ask whether theres been some 
improvement in boston since 1978 from a public housing standpoint 
our survey and monitoring report in 1987 showed there are still some 
problems 
were not 100 percent where everybody has equal housing but 
were moving in that direction its probably not as much as the 
judge wanted 
metropolitan boston refers to an area of 28 million people in 
about 110 municipalities while 13 percent of bostons 573000 
people are black there are no current figures available on the 
percentage in the metropolitan area

the west german government has agreed to a us 
request to expel an iranian diplomat involved in a german companys 
sale of poisongas chemicals to iran the bush administration said 
tuesday 
secretary of state james a baker iii told visiting west german 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher about the sales during a 
luncheon last week said state department spokeswoman margaret 
tutwiler 
genscher said he knew nothing about the incident ms tutwiler 
said 
german authorities undertook an investigation into the activities 
of the company a small firm in dusseldorf said a west german 
embassy official 
the company to circumvent stricter west german export controls 
bought the chemicals from a business in india another 
administration official said 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity declined to 
name the west german company 
the diplomat in charge of the chemical acquisition was identified 
as said karim ali sobhani an official of irans trade mission 
ms tutwiler said it was understandable that west german 
officials dont know about every sale by every west german company 
she also said the united states was satisfied with the west german 
response but doesnt view the case as closed 
news of the incident comes as congress considers several 
proposals to enact sanctions against nations and companies that sell 
chemical and biological weapons 
the proposed legislation was prompted by revelations last year 
that west german companies sold libya equipment for production of 
chemical weapons west germany tightened its export control laws as 
a result of the ensuing furor 
iran and iraq used chemical weapons during their nineyear war 
that ended last year 
use of the chemical weapons prompted the united states to join 
with its allies in seeking to halt sales of any chemicals that can 
be used by third world countries as weapons

president ali khamenei of iran said 
tuesday his country is committed to peace talks with iraq but he 
insisted the persian gulf rival give up occupied iranian territory 
we will support the talks if they lead to peace but we cannot 
find the necessary faith as long as the enemy is on our soil 
khamenei said in comments carried by the official islamic republic 
news agency monitored in nicosia 
how can they have pretensions to peace when they have kept 
their forces on our soil he said iraq must withdraw its forces 
 
the eight years of fighting ended in august under a 
unsponsored ceasefire agreement but talks on a permanent peace 
remain deadlocked over several issues including possession the 
shatt alarab waterway prisoner exchanges and the withdrawal of 
troops to prewar borders 
iraqi troops still occupy about 380 square miles of iranian 
territory 
the iranian news agency said khameneis remarks came in a speech 
to volunteer forces from throughout the nation khamenei was chosen 
as irans senior leader after the june 3 death of revolutionary 
patriarch ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
the remarks follow a saturday speech by iraqi president saddam 
hussein who urged iran to work for peace in the gulf region instead 
of rebuilding its armed forces 
hussein also suggested the two sides exchange prisoners of war in 
a goodwill gesture but khamenei did not address that point an 
estimated 100000 soldiers remain to be repatriated

a thai security official said tuesday 
that a group of up to 600 cambodian refugees would be returned to 
the control of the communist khmer rouge but the us state 
department said that wouldnt happen 
the refugees fled the khmer rouge camp of kaiche after it was 
heavily shelled in midapril and traveled a few miles to sok sann 
camp run by the noncommunist khmer peoples national liberation 
front or kpnlf 
the khmer rouge the largest guerrilla group fighting vietnamese 
forces in cambodia wanted the refugees returned to kaiche but the 
un border relief operation and the international committee of the 
red cross which have reported widespread human rights violations in 
khmer rouge camps insisted the refugees be allowed to choose where 
to live 
the thai official speaking on condition of anonymity said that 
as a compromise the military decided the refugees should be 
moved to site 8 the only khmer rouge camp where the guerrillas have 
allowed aid officials to give refugees full medical and other 
services site 8 is north of kaiche which is along the cambodian 
border and in thailands eastern trat province 
he could not say when the transfer would take place 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said in washington 
that the thai government confirmed to us officials that the 
refugees will be allowed to remain in noncommunist resistance 
camps she said this followed strong appeals from us officials to 
thailand that the refugees not be returned to khmer rouge control 
because their safety could not be assured 
the united states goverment continues to be strongly opposed to 
the return of these cambodians to khmer rouge control she said 
a western relief official also speaking anonymously called the 
thai decision a facesaving move in which the military would 
avoid criticism for returning the refugees to kaiche yet still 
continue support for the khmer rouge 
the refugees should have individual choice he said some 
people have families in sok sann and they should stay in sok sann 
some have families in site 8 and they should go to site 8 some 
people have reasons to flee khmer rouge control and they should not 
be sent to khmer rouge control 
the khmer rouge ruled cambodia from 1975 until vietnamese forces 
invaded and ousted it from power in late 1978 washington says 2 
million people a fourth of the population were executed or died of 
famine in the khmer rouges attempt to impose radical agrarian 
communism 
the khmer rouge fled to the border established camps just inside 
thailand and allied itself with guerrillas of the kpnlf and of 
prince norodom sihanouk violations reported in khmer rouge refugee 
camps included forcing children to porter arms through mine fields 
and denying people emergency medical treatment 
western aid officials have been barred from kaiche the flight 
from kaiche was one of the largest escapes from a khmer rouge camp 
in years one relief official said 
the refugees fled after gunners inside cambodia rained heavy 
shells on kaiche and nearby ta luan camp relief officials believe 
hundreds of people were hurt but the khmer rouge refused to allow 
any to be evacuated to outside hospitals

climbing temperatures on tuesday melted 
blobs of heavy oil scattered over 21 miles of the delaware river and 
slowed down cleanup efforts already being challenged in court as too 
slow 
coast guard officials revised downward the number of gallons 
spilled from 800000 gallons to 306684 gallons based on new 
assessments 
a uruguayan tanker went aground early saturday spilling no 6 
industrial heating oil the oil coagulated in the cool water into 
chunks averaging about the size of a basketball but with some up to 
2 and 3 feet across 
cleanup workers had been using pitchforks and even their hands to 
snare the blobs of oil from the water while skimmers jammed up by 
the larger chucks were deployed in areas of the river where there 
were smaller lumps the crews also have tried out fishing nets 
when weve got it in chunks we can pick it up said coast 
guard capt larry murdoch 
but on tuesday the temperature headed into the 90s the melting 
range for the no 6 industrial heating oil 
during an inspection tour officials pointed to patches where the 
rainbow hue of petroleum on water showed up and said it was coming 
from oil blobs close enough to the surface to heat and melt 
the melting oil poses a much greater haal guard federal 
government and private contract employees walking along the 
shoreline and working out of 22 boats snaring the oil blobs 
coast guard officials said they hoped to have more than 500 
people involved in the cleanup tuesday but roger a lucio of the 
delaware department of natural resources and environmental control 
said 207 national guard and private contractor employees were 
working along with 100 federal government workers 
the heat was reaching the point where officials also began to 
worry about the cleanup workers 
we have to recognize if we work them unreasonably in this 
kind of weather we can also do bad things to their health

relationships with the men 
if you want to assign blame to the vice president for what 
happened over the past eight years ok thats fine i accept 
it said the president during a news conference at the white house 
bush said he wants to make sure there is no recurrence of 
cronyism and special favors in awarding government contracts 
that matter is being looked into by our very able dedicated 
secretary of hud and we are going to do everything we can to clean 
up any cronyism or see that matters of that nature not recur said 
bush 
the department of housing and urban development has been rocked 
in recent months by allegations that several republican insiders and 
former government officials were paid as consultants and developers 
in the agencys moderate rehabilitation program 
bush said he would not single out anyone when asked specifically 
about two men who were key aides in his presidential campaign last 
year 
paul manafort an adviser to bushs 1988 presidential campaign 
manager republican national committee chairman lee atwater told a 
congressional panel last week that the more than 300000 he earned 
as a consultant on one project could indeed be characterized as 
being for influencepeddling 
frederick bush who was deputy chief of staff for thenvice 
president bush no relation earlier testified before the same panel 
about his role in another project 
he has been asked to make a second appearance this week before 
the house subcommittee on employment and housing to further clarify 
his companys 260000 consultants fee on the los jazmines project 
in puerto rico 
the president was asked does this affect your relationship 
with these people to know that they were involved apparently in 
influence peddling 
well it doesnt improve things but on the other hand i want 
to be fair he answered i want to be sure that i dont jump at 
conclusions as to what guilt is and what it isnt whether law was 
broken or were people just out there you know doing what was 
permitted 
i want to have the standard higher though even if its 
permitted i want to have the highest possible standard but i 
havent put it on that kind of a personal basis yet bush said 
the president praised hud secretary jack kemp for his work but 
sidestepped placing blame on former secretary samuel pierce for 
problems at the agency 
i am not about to prejudge the secretary himself i assume that 
he would accept responsibility for what happened past tense in 
his department just as i would have to assume responsibility for 
something that goes on in my administration whether i know about it 
or not said bush 
the message has gone out loud and clear to every cabinet 
officer that we want the highest possible ethical standards bush 
added 
hud inspector general paul adams has said at least a dozen 
private escrow agents nationwide are under investigation for 
possible embezzlement of millions of dollars of hud funds 
bush said he has met with investigators and encouraged 
independence and thoroughness in their work 
his statement came as reports revealed the us attorney in 
atlanta is seeking 75 million in damages from two agents accused 
of keeping more than 1 million in proceeds from real estate 
closings there 
in maryland marilyn harrell an escrow agent dubbed robin 
hud by investigators has admitted she stole 55 million from hud 
closings she conducted 
harrell has turned over her temple hills md home to the agency 
to compensate for part of her theft 
mike norton the us attorney in denver also is investigating 
allegations that a suspended hud accountant embezzled 1 million in 
housing funds 
meanwhile hud announced 892 million in new grants tuesday to 
private nonprofit and government sponsors to develop 131 projects 
nationwide in a demonstration transitional housing program for the 
homeless

glenn michael souther may have been a soviet 
spy but its unlikely he was a russian mole who infiltrated this 
country his former associates said tuesday after southers death 
was reported in the soviet union 
rather he was a rambuctious young american who satisfied his 
craving for attention by defecting to the soviet union three years 
ago a decision that may have cost him his life they said 
they used him like a spider playing with a moth and when they 
were going to finish with him they finished with him said 
barbara fahey a professors wife who knew souther when he was an 
old dominion university student 
souther 32 was a former navy intelligence specialist who 
disappeared shortly after he graduated from odu in may 1986 with a 
degree in russian he appeared on soviet television last july and 
said he had defected the soviet military newspaper red star 
reported tuesday that souther was a kgb agent named mikhail orlov 
and that he died unexpectedly june 22 
theres some attempt to imply that he was really a sovietborn 
citizen and became a mole but that was never really stated and i 
dont believe its true said ronald kessler a maryland author 
who is writing a book on souther 
he was in fact a very successful spy kessler said in a 
telephone interview from his home in potomac he was an american 
mole its possible that he took this russian name after he 
defected 
odu professors who taught souther said he was an outgoing 
wellliked student who started out poorly in his russian major 
there was throughout the years not a single indication that 
he could have been not an american said leonid i mihalap a 
sovietborn professor who taught souther russian he did not look 
slavic and besides he didnt drink vodka 
but mihalap said he reread one of southers final papers in 
russian and was surprised that it was grammatically flawless except 
for one misspelling 
his russian was better than what i taught him he said 
fran hassencahl southers speech professor at odu said he 
talked often about his childhood in the midwest and she met several 
members of his family she said she understood that he had married a 
russian woman and his mother had visited him in the soviet union 
kessler who said he has obtained evidence of southers spying 
said he received a letter from souther this month in response to the 
writers request for an interview 
he said according to your letter you have already convicted 
me of espionage guilty until proven innocent and then he said that 
due to that he didnt want to be interviewed but would respond in 
writing to questions kessler said 
john fahey a retired navy commander who taught souther russian 
at odu said souther loved to clown and play pranks 
one of southers pranks may have led to his decision to defect 
fahey said because he was suspended from odu in 1984 for biting a 
female student on the neck souther was turned down for officer 
candidate school in the navy 
he was very bitter about what happened to him as far as the 
problem on campus fahey said he really wanted to become a 
naval officer

european leaders made a deal tuesday to take 
the first steps toward economic and monetary union but prime 
minister margaret thatcher of britain fended off moves for a single 
currency and one central bank 
leaders of the 12nation european economic community fell far 
short of embracing sweeping proposals that would lead to tight 
economic integration of the trading bloc 
weve made as much progress as we can at this stage while 
leaving longer term issues for further discussion mrs thatcher 
said at the end of a twoday summit 
mrs thatcher was pitted against french president francois 
mitterrand and west german chancellor helmut kohl who wanted a 
quick monetary marriage 
despite their differences the leaders praised the agreement to 
coordinate more closely their economic and monetary policies 
kohl described the summit outcome as superb 
the foundation has been laid for a development that brings the 
eec further together and brings political union one step nearer 
he said 
spanish prime minister felipe gonzalez said a week ago i 
would have said this would have been impossible 
jacques delors a top common market official who championed 
radical plans for monetary unity said i can say the community 
is moving forward 
the leaders expanded the common markets drive to fashion a 
single market by the end of 1992 by that date the nations hope to 
remove the many trade barriers that block the free movement of 
people goods services and money 
in their final statement the leaders said they decided the 
first stage of the realization of economic and monetary union would 
begin on july 1 1990 
they asked common market officials to complete measures required 
for the initial phase which generally stresses greater cooperation 
on economic and monetary issues 
in agreeing only on greater economic coordination the leaders 
failed to back wholeheartedly a report pushed by delors setting 
out three stages for a monetary union 
they did however agree to start work on a special conference to 
alter their founding treaty such changes would be necessary to set 
up a europeanwide central bank system and joint currency 
delors said the unity movement has been started and im 
tempted to say its irreversible and will lead to economic and 
monetary union 
mrs thatcher said however there is absolutely nothing 
automatic about going beyond stage one all that is for future 
decisions 
the leaders also sidestepped the touchy question of a proposed 
social charter to set out minimum rights for workers in the new 
europeanwide market 
mrs thatcher a conservative had criticized the proposal as a 
socialist move 
we have agreed at this summit that it cant be done now and 
we have said it is all for further discussion she said 
but gonzalez said the plan had not been shelved 
the agreement for further discussion he said constitutes a 
clearing of the way to continue working for social rights 
also tuesday the eec leaders called for an embargo on arms sales 
to china and urged the world bank to postpone new loans to that 
country to protest the governments crackdown on prodemocracy 
demonstrators 
they also froze visits by highlevel eec members to beijing 
extended visas of chinese students in europe and placed limits on 
cultural and scientific exchange programs 
the leaders also called for the participation of the palestine 
liberation organization in any unsponsored peace conference on 
the middle east 
the declaration spoke of the continuing deterioration of the 
situation in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip and 
called on israeli authorities to end repressive measures in the 
territories 
the 18month palestinian uprising against israeli occupation of 
the territories has claimed 539 palestinian and 23 israeli lives 
the israeli foreign ministry issued a statement expressing 
disappointment with the eecs middle east declaration 
eec members are britain belgium france germany denmark 
luxembourg spain greece italy portugal the netherlands and 
ireland

which replaced the old rubberstamp body this year

a 37ton hercules cargo plane salvaged from 
antarctic ice and snow more than 16 years after it crashed is set 
to arrive in california this week officials said tuesday 
the airplane is just in the final stages of rework at air new 
zealand in christchurch us navy cmdr keith armstrong said by 
telephone from point mugu naval air station about 50 miles 
northwest of downtown los angeles 
the huge onceicebound lc130 hercules is expected to arrive 
friday at the navys antarctic development squadron 6 the 
puckered penguins who fly support missions for the national 
science foundation in antarctica 
so far about 42 million has been spent to excavate the plane 
and overhaul it said guy guthridge a national science foundation 
spokesman in washington 
an additional 28 million still must be spent to install new 
electronic equipment at cherry point nc guthridge added but 
thats cheaper than the 35 million price tag for a replacement 
plane 
the aircraft is specifically designed and equipped to operate in 
polar climates including the use of oneton tefloncoated 
wheelskis needed to break the grip of ice on takeoff 
we left the plane there in 71 because we simply had no 
capability in place to go back to a remote location in extremely 
cold weather and retrieve it guthridge said 
the hercules was one of seven owned by the foundation and its 
loss affected our ability to install science projects in the 
field which really is the payoff of our program guthridge said 
over a 42day period the cargo plane was dug from the snow that 
had buried all but the top 3 feet of the planes 38foot high tail 
and it flew out on jan 10 1988 
much of the time since then was spent in christchurch new 
zealand where it was inspected and renovated before it is returned 
to the united states guthridge said 
a lot of people were worried that the stresses induced by the 
aircraft being covered in snow would damage the air frame 
guthridge said 
but the salvage crew was surprised to find that the belowzero 
climate with air too frigid to carry moisture had preserved the 
lockheed aircraft amazingly well said joe dabney a spokesman for 
the manufacturer in marietta ga 
it was in effect just frozen with no deterioration in the 
structure dabney said 
lockheed engineers found many of the hydraulic systems were still 
working the electronics still worked there still was air in the 
tires and fuel in the tanks dabney said 
the hercules was abandoned in december 1971 at a remote site 
about 700 miles from mcmurdo sound after supplying fuel and other 
supplies to a scientific team measuring snow accumulation on the 
east antarctic plateau 
the field team part of a joint american french and soviet 
effort was in a rugged area of high winds and snow accumulation 
said winifred reuning national science foundation spokeswoman 
the pilot was forced to abort on takeoff after a jet 
malfunctioned ms reuning said 
the pilot managed a crash landing damaging the front landing ski 
and nose of the aircraft but the crew and several french scientists 
who were aboard walked away without injury

floridas privacy laws should be 
extended to minors a lawyer told the state supreme court tuesday in 
the case of a teenager forced to ask a judge to allow an abortion 
without parental consent 
the statute clearly fails to protect a minors privacy right 
attorney jerri blair told the justices a minor who is pregnant 
has a right to submit to any medical procedure except abortion under 
florida law 
there is no question it should be applied to the minors 
abortion decision ms blair told reporters later 
the florida law requires unmarried minors to get permission from 
their parents or a judge before having an abortion 
the case argued tuesday began when ms blairs client a 
15yearold known only as tw did not want to tell her parents 
about her pregnancy then in its 11th week and sought judicial 
permission for an abortion 
a lake county judge denied her request last month saying the 
state law was vague and unworkable an appeals court then ruled the 
law unconstitutional and a series of legal maneuvers landed the 
case in the us supreme court which returned the case to state 
justices without comment 
the us supreme court has left the law unenforceable until the 
florida high court reviews it 
suporters of the law contend it protects the unborn and the right 
of parents to supervise their children 
when you elevate the right of privacy over the right to life 
you have elevated an inferior right over a superior right said 
ken connor a tallahassee attorney for florida right to life 
without the right to life there is no right to privacy 
attorney james bopp jr of terre haute ind who served as 
guardian for the fetus argued that minors are not mature enough to 
make decisions about abortion 
i dont believe the people of florida intended to subvert 
parental rights or to subvert the states traditional interest in 
protecting innocent human life and withdraw the ability of the 
state to protect vulnerable minors when they adopted the 1980 
florida right of privacy bopp said 
a ruling by the seven justices could be weeks away as the court 
begins its annual vacation period next month the courts decision 
could affect thousands of unmarried pregnant teens and possibly set 
a broad precedent attorneys said 
similar privacy issues dominate a case pending before the us 
supreme court and the original 1973 roe vs wade decision giving 
women the right to have abortions 
before floridas parental consent law was declared 
unconstitutional 60 teenagers received judicial permission for an 
abortion

amnesty international said tuesday that rulings by 
the us supreme court upholding the death penalty for youthful or 
retarded offenders are a step backward for human rights 
in two 54 votes the supreme court said monday the 
constitutions ban on cruel and unusual punishment does not prohibit 
execution of people who committed crimes as young as 16 or adults 
with the reasoning capacity of children 
the imposition of death sentences on juvenile offenders was in 
clear contravention of international human rights treaties and 
standards including the international covenant on civil and 
political rights and the american convention on human rights both 
of which the us government signed in 1977 but has not ratified 
amnesty international said 
the londonbased group which won the nobel peace prize in 1977 
said the death penalty was particularly inappropriate for 
individuals who had not attained full physical or emotional maturity 
at the time of their crimes 
to impose the death penalty in such cases whether as 
retribution or as an intended deterrent violates basic principles 
of humanity the groups statement said 
amnesty international noted that 72 countries that retain the 
death penalty have abolished it for criminals under the age of 18 
including the soviet union south africa syria paraguay and libya 
bangladesh pakistan iraq and iran are among the countries that 
have executed people who were under 18 at the time of their crimes 
amnesty international said

karoly grosz his power curbed in a new 
fourman leadership dominated by reformers was quoted tuesday as 
saying he plans to resign as communist party chief next year 
mai nap an independent afternoon daily quoted grosz as saying 
in an interview he will no longer be general secretary after 
parliamentary elections scheduled for 1990 he has held the post 13 
months 
we have to make room for the younger generation the paper 
quoted him as saying obviously ill continue to be engaged in 
politics at some level but i never again want to be a general 
secretary 
rezsoe nyers father of pioneering economic reforms in the late 
1960s was chosen as party chairman saturday and a fourman 
presidium was formed to run the party until the communist party 
congress scheduled for oct 7 
the paper quoted grosz as saying the central committee had 
agreed that we will need to hold another congress after the 
elections as well its obvious that there will be a new balance of 
forces and a new leadership 
grosz considered a centrist has lost standing recently with 
contradictory statements 
he angered other leading communists and many other hungarians 
when he said on television may 30 there was no need to rehabilitate 
imre nagy who led the 1956 uprising crushed by soviet tanks 
because nagys execution was not a party decision 
a day later party issued a statement that described nagy as a 
forerunner of reform and amounted to de facto rehabilitation nagy 
since has been reburied with honors 
grosz replaced janos kadar as party chief in may 1988 heading a 
new leadership that seemed to strike a balance between reformers and 
more orthodox communists 
as reformers gained the upper hand over conservatives wary of 
relinquishing power grosz jockeyed unsuccessfully for a middle 
ground 
communists and democratic opposition groups agreed to cooperate 
in drafting legislation to govern the first multiparty elections in 
more than 40 years and work began june 13 
the government has said elections will be held by june of next 
year but there have been increasing calls for the date to be 
advanced

the house on tuesday endorsed and sent to the 
senate legislation that would give final approval to a 
selfgovernment plan for the western pacific islands of palau 
the measure passed on a voice vote also provides final 
authorization for spending of 238 million over the next five years 
including an immediate 36 million payment to cover palaus debt for 
a power plant 
this is a highly responsible act for the united states said 
rep morris udall dariz chairman of the house interior committee 
the measure brings an honorable end to a very difficult chapter 
in the history of the united states in the western pacific said 
ron de lugo the nonvoting house delegate from the virgin islands 
palau is the last of four parts of the trust territory of the 
pacific islands created following world war ii to define its 
political status the plan called the compact of free association 
provides selfgovernment in all areas except defense which is 
reserved for the united states 
the united states also retains a 50year right to establish a 
military base on palau should it need an alternative to its current 
bases in the philippines 
palau itself has failed in six referendums to approve the 
compact and the bill provides another 200000 to hold a seventh 
referendum 
the island nation has been troubled by political corruption 
crippling debts and fiscal mismanagement drug abuse and crumbling 
public facilities the legislation would create a antidrug program 
for palau and establishes controls for the spending of us aid 
money 
the house acted despite warnings from rep bill frenzel rminn 
who argued that the united states doesnt have the money to spend 
we are playing fast and loose with our budget agreement we are 
squeezing things in and declaring them emergencies he said 
in a separate action the house also approved and sent to the 
senate a bill establishing regular diplomatic relations with two 
other former pacific trusteeships the marshall islands and 
micronesia the measure would elevate the status of the us envoys 
in those two island groups to ambassador

the house armed services committee on tuesday 
slashed 11 billion from president bushs proposed star wars budget 
and cut funds for the b2 stealth bomber to save a marine aircraft 
the administration wants to cancel 
beginning full committee action on the 2956 billion pentagon 
budget for fiscal 1990 the democraticcontrolled panel did side 
with bush on some issues 
it rejected an amendment introduced by rep ron dellums 
dcalif to terminate the midgetman missile program and it voted 
to restore 71 million for the lance missile and other shortrange 
attack weapons money that had been cut by a subcommittee 
by voice vote the full committee approved a 35 billion budget 
for the strategic defense initiative considerably less than the 
46 billion bush had proposed for the star wars program to develop 
lasers and other weapons to stop enemy nuclear missiles 
the committee decision came just two months after defense 
secretary dick cheney in slashing 10 billion from the budget had 
already cut 1 billion in proposed star wars spending the committee 
action if supported in later votes in the house and senate would 
take 11 billion more 
by a 3912 vote largely along party lines the committee rejected 
an amendment by rep jon l kyl rariz to accept cheneys 
spending level for star wars 
i believe the american people will support a strong robust sdi 
program kyl told his committee colleagues before the amendment 
was defeated 
one of cheneys most controversial budget decisions was scuttling 
the marine corps v22 osprey a revolutionary aircraft designed to 
take off like a helicopter and fly like a plane 
his move met with stiff opposition in congress where last week 
reps curt weldon rpa and thomas foglietta dpa succeeded in 
persuading the research and development subcommittee to approve an 
amendment to pump 351 million into the program by taking money that 
had been earmarked for the radarevading b2 stealth bomber 
rep william l dickinson rala introduced an amendment to 
restore some of the funds for the bomber but weldon argued that the 
amendment in effect kills the v22 his argument succeeded as 
the committee voted 3119 to reject dickinsons amendment 
the vote leaves 27 billion in procurement funds for the b2 
bomber and cuts the proposed 18 billion for research and 
development to about 15 billion 
three committee members reps john kasich rohio john 
rowland rconn and dellums plan to introduce an amendment 
wednesday to eliminate all money for the aircraft which is 
considered one of the most expensive in history at a cost of between 
500 million and 650 million a copy 
after the committee rejected the administrations requested 
figure for star wars tuesday kasich proposed spending 38 billion 
plus inflation on sdi reaching that level by cutting added items 
including a proposed 200 million for the national aerospace plane 
the highspeed transport could fly around the world in two hours 
kasichs amendment lost 3215 largely along party lines 
the panel didnt take up other star wars amendments reasoning 
that there was no need to engage in rancorous debate at this point 
over an issue that is expected to reach the house floor for full 
discussion next month 
at that time rep charles bennett dfla plans to introduce an 
amendment cutting star wars to 31 billion and dellums chairman 
of the subcommittee plans a measure limiting fiscal 1990 funds to 
13 billion for sdi 
dellums said that based on the reality over the past few 
years the research and development total for star wars will 
likely be cut on the house floor to 28 billion 
the committee on tuesday also rejected a surprise amendment by 
rep larry hopkins rky to eliminate money for the armys light 
attack helicopter commonly known as the lhx 
santa claus should not come to town every day hopkins said 
in response to arguments that funds for army research and 
development projects were drastically low and the service deserved a 
modernized force 
his amendment failed 418 
in approving the research and development budget the panel also 
approved 50 million for the defense advance research projects 
agency to spend on high definition television the agency has 10 
million available annually for the program during the next three 
years 
earlier the full house committee approved the seapower and 
strategic and critical materials subcommittees budget of about 14 
billion for shipbuilding two additional minesweepers and other 
items

the kidnapping of foreigners 14 of whom 
are believed still held in lebanon may have been a very big 
mistake said a spokesman for shiite moslems thought to be the 
captors umbrella group 
ibrahim amin the spokesman for hezbollah or party of god said 
it is possible that we might feel that some acts might have 
involved a very big mistake 
but we have to face our mistakes in the way that preserves and 
respects our society amin said 
hezbollah has repeatedly denied involvement in the kidnappings 
and the blackturbaned amin reiterated those denials at a news 
conference but western and local intelligence sources have linked 
the organization to extremist groups who claim responsibility in 
most of the abductions 
hezbollah supported the antiwest policies of irans late 
spiritual leader and founder of the islamic republic ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini who died of a heart attack on june 3 it was 
unclear whether hezbollahs attitudes would change with his death 
hezbollah has declared support for iranian president ali 
khamenei who was appointed khomeinis successor as supreme leader 
among those held are nine americans the longest held is terry 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated press

thousands of mormons gathered tuesday to 
dedicate a 1 million shrine on the hallowed spot where church 
founder joseph smith and his brother hyrum were killed by a mob 
145 years ago 
mormon church president ezra taft benson jayne thompson wife of 
illinois gov james r thompson and about 3000 others attended a 
ceremony marking the completed restoration of the old carthage jail 
where smith died a site considered sacred by the worlds 65 
million mormons 
few could foresee the future stature of the man whose blood 
stained the floor of this jail said gordon hinckley first 
counselor to benson as he recounted the shooting of the smiths on 
june 27 1844 
we are grateful for the reconciliation that has come with the 
passage of time said hinckley who described the founders death 
as an epic story of martyrdom 
this is a hallowed spot hinckley said 
the fiveroom bulletriddled jail stands as a reminder of the 
religious persecution of the mormons and the hatred that drove them 
from the mississippi river town of nauvoo 30 miles west he said 
the twostory stone jail with its two cells and the bedroom 
where the smiths died has been restored to its 1844 appearance 
bullet holes are still visible in the bedroom door and hyrum 
smiths bloodstained cloths are on display along with a statue of 
the smiths and six slate monuments inscribed with quotes from joseph 
smith 
renovation of the jail built in 1840 was completed to coincide 
with the 150th anniversary of the mormons settlement in nauvoo a 
town of about 1100 located 200 miles north of st louis that 
briefly was home to smiths followers the core of the church of 
jesus christ of latterday sains 
smith and his congregation arrived in nauvoo in 1839 when the 
town was named commerce 
they settled on 1000 acres in the swamp flats below the 
towns main business district the land was drained and divided into 
fouracre farm plots each member was given an acre for a house 
barn and a few animals 
within a few years a city of 15000 sprang from the swamp 
named nauvoo by the mormons from the hebrew for beautiful 
location it rivaled chicago as the largest city in ilinois a 
huge limestone temple was built on a bluff overlooking the town 
but the friction with outsiders that had forced smith to leave 
other towns followed the settlers into illinois 
mormons clashed with local residents who rejected smiths claims 
that he had spoken with god been visited by angels and was a 
prophet 
the conflict eventually led to the arrest of the smiths and two 
associates 
they were awaiting trial in carthage when the jail was stormed by 
a mob estimated by some accounts at 125 
the historic preservation of this site will foster an ongoing 
growth of tolerance which is illinois and america mrs thompson 
said 
after the deaths of the smiths brigham young assumed leadership 
of the church and two years later led a mass exodus west from 
nauvoo eventually settling in salt lake city

the air line pilots association asked federal 
mediators tuesday to intervene in talks with strikebound eastern 
airlines a request that could complicate the troubled carriers 
plans to reorganize 
the union made the request of the national mediation board even 
as it continued negotiations with eastern in talks ordered by the 
bankruptcy judge overseeing the airline which filed for court 
protection from its creditors after its machinists union struck in 
march 
a mediation board spokesman said the request had not been logged 
in as of the close of business tuesday but the union provided a 
copy of the filing which the union said was delivered to the board 
tuesday afternoon 
most pilots have honored machinists pickets lines and under 
labor law are considered legal sympathy strikers 
but the request for mediation could trigger a pilots strike as 
well nearly 300 alpa pilots have crossed machinists picket lines 
but alpa officials contend most of them would refuse to work if 
their union struck eastern 
mediation also would add a number of legal and jurisdictional 
questions that are likely to further complicate easterns legal 
odyssey 
airline disputes are regulated by the railway labor act which 
gives the mediation board broad powers to try to resolve contract 
disputes unions cannot strike airlines or railways unless released 
from mediation a situation which occurred prior to the machinists 
strike mediation requests generally are granted as a matter of 
routine 
eastern last week sough bankruptcy court permission to cancel its 
contract with the pilots and impose changes in wages and work rules 
it said it needed to reorganize as a smaller carrier 
parties engaged in federal mediation however are prohibited 
from altering terms of their contracts mediation board spokesman 
david bushnell said he believed a mediation request involving a 
company in bankruptcy proceedings was unprecedented and could not 
say what it would mean for easterns bid to abrogate the pilots 
contract 
if in fact mediation is granted that issue would probably end 
up in court said bushnell 
board procedures call for the appointment of a mediator and a 
factfinding process that takes several weeks the mediator then 
would arrange sessions between the parties which already are 
involved in bankruptcy court proceedings and the contract talks 
ordered by that court 
if the mediator declared an impasse a 30day cooling off period 
would begin after which the union would be free to strike and the 
airline free to change provisions of existing contracts 
union spokesman ron cole said the union decided to seek mediation 
after eastern officials refused to schedule future negotiating 
sessions under terms of the railway labor act those sessions would 
be separate from the bargaining ordered by the bankruptcy judge a 
second meeting under that process was held tuesday but resulted in 
no progress cole said 
eastern spokesman robin matell said company officials believed 
the bankruptcy court proceedings would supersede the authority of 
the mediation board 
he disputed the unions assertion that eastern had refused to 
bargain under the railway labor act saying eastern declined to meet 
with the union because it has not made a counteroffer to a proposal 
eastern made three weeks ago 
we dont know what they are trying to accomplish with the 
mediation he said we believe that the bankruptcy court and the 
examiner are better able to handle bankruptcyrelated labor 
agreements 
also tuesday alpa and eastern exchanged a new round of charges 
and contract charges about whether the carrier will be able to 
recruit and train enough new pilots to meet its planned summer 
schedule 
the union said its analysis of new pilot hiring and training 
indicated that eastern would fall at least 236 pilots short perhaps 
as many as 358 of the 837 it would need to fly the august schedule 
it has presented to its creditors 
eastern dismissed the unions conclusions as the product of 
voodoo arithmetic and the overall report as part of attempts by 
the pilots and easterns other unions to force texas air corp to 
sell the airline 
we have no shortage of employees or other staff to fly the 
schedule said eastern spokeswoman karen cermesak the criticism 
of insufficient resources will continue as long as they are on the 
outside looking in 
she said eastern had told the creditors committee it would fly 
221 flights a day in july but had revised the schedule to 226 
flights because of progress in training replacements 
eastern figures indicate that 276 of its prestrike pilots have 
been crossing picket lines and about 100 replacements have completed 
training and begun carrying passengers more than 500 pilots are in 
training 
industry analysts have said the airline will be hardpressed to 
recruit and train enough pilots to reach 1700 by the end of the 
year the number it would need to meet its reorganization goal

a 7yearold girl who was swept away by 
fastflowing water was rescued tuesday from a storm drain after 
clinging to the cracks of the sewers brick lining for more than 12 
hours authorities said 
she spent the entire night in the citys major sewer system 
with all that flood water coming in on her and hardly had a 
scratch said fire department spokesman mike warnke its just a 
miracle that she could still be alive 
latricia reese was playing outside her home monday afternoon when 
her young cousin saw her lose her footing in the fastmoving storm 
water and slip into a 18inch culvert 
she was retrieved around 8 am tuesday by two construction 
workers who removed manhole covers near the spot where she 
disappeared and found her clinging onto some cracks in the brick 
lining of the sewer warnke said 
i just held onto the crack in the cement latricia said 
several hours later from her hospital bed while watching cartoons 
and smiling occasionally at friends and relatives gathered around 
her 
her mother karen reese said that after latricia slipped into 
the sewer opening she dropped several levels under the street twice 
plunging more than 6 feet before reaching out and clutching a crack 
in the channel wall 
she said latricia told her she was bothered throughout her ordeal 
by mosquitos and ants and bugs 
latricia suffered only abrasions to her knees and elbows and mild 
shock she was in very good condition at humana hospitalsouthmore 
said spokeswoman ramona branch 
thunderstorms spawned by tropical storm allison dumped about 10 
inches of rain in the houston area 
the water was pouring so quickly into the drain where she 
disappeared that fire department personnel were unable to reach her 
or even conduct a proper search monday warnke said 
the fire department diving team was called out and they refused 
to go in the hole because the water was just so swift that it was 
too dangerous he said they thought that at that point because 
the water was moving so fast that she would have been swept down to 
the place where the sewer system empties into the bayou 
we used a flashlight and saw a little figure about 30 feet 
under the street said timothy gabrysch a construction worker who 
went into the drain it was pitch dark and she couldnt see 
anything 
i have no idea how she stayed there gabrysch said its 
pretty nasty down there theres all kinds of debris down there 
they began yelling her name and she answered back who are 
you warnke said they told her and she was reluctant to come 
outof the hole after being in there all night hanging on through 
that swift water 
latricias reactions were initially confused in the hours right 
after her rescue 
when they keep asking her what happened she gets a little 
foggy about that and you dont get really clear answers ms 
branch said she also thought she didnt spend the night there 
she thought she went home

a multimillionaire investor linked to a 
financial scandal that shook brazils stock markets has been charged 
on two counts of financial wrongdoing police said tuesday 
police questioned nahas monday night about his role in the 
scandal but the charges filed were unrelated to the crisis which 
led to the closing of six brokerage houses police spokesman mauro 
ament said from brasilia the capital 
nahas is accused of trying to illegally take dollars out of the 
country in 1987 and of violating the financial system law in 1983 
ament said 
ament said that in december 1987 police at sao paulos 
international airport found 20000 in nahas suitcase as he was 
about to board a plane for london by law brazilians then were only 
allowed to take 1000 
in 1983 a construction firm owned by nahas borrowed the 
equivalent of 12 million from the sogeral bank of which he was a 
major shareholder this was a violation of the financial system 
law which prohibits this kind of transaction ament said 
the spokesman said that if convicted on the charges nahas faces 
an 11year jail term 
federal police also questioned nahas on his alleged role in the 
stock market scandal that broke june 9 but ament said there was 
still insufficeint evidence to bring charges against the investor 
nahas bounced 31 million in checks to pay for highly speculative 
deals on the rio de janeiro stock exchange according to the 
brazilian securities commission 
on june 12 the government closed all of brazils nine stock 
markets to avoid panic among investors nahas was prohibited from 
leaving the country the market reopened the next day 
the government has closed six brokerage houses involved in the 
scandal including one owned by elmo camoes former president of the 
central bank camoes resigned shortly before his brokerage was 
closed 
nahas a lebanese immigrant whose business interests range from 
mining and farming to real estate and insurance is a common sight 
in brazilian society pages in 1984 he hosted saudi arabian arms 
merchant adnan khashoggi on a visit to brazil 
the commodity futures trading commission of the united states 
also has linked nahas with texas billionaires nelson bunker hunt and 
william herbert hunt in their illfated try to corner the worlds

the district of columbia council approved 
legislation tuesday to sharply limit outside income for city 
officeholders a move some say is designed to prevent the rev jesse 
jackson from running for mayor 
the bill sponsored by council member john ray and approved on an 
112 vote sets a 10000 limit on income from speeches for the 
mayor and council chairman and includes an amendment by council 
chairman david clarke that limits the mayor or council chairman to 
10000 income from book royalties 
both ray and clarke are running for mayor in the 1990 race 
incumbent marion barry has not said whether he will seek reelection 
jackson who earns most of his income from speeches has not 
ruled out running for the 82500peryear post 
i am awfully suspicious when two announced candidates put 
together legislation to keep someone from running said council 
member frank smith 
we can say that this is a jesse jackson bill for sure 
said council member nadine winter we have railroaded a piece of 
legislation in 19 days only because the political campaign is 
heating up and it seems to me we have a problem here 
smith and council member betty ann kane voted against the measure 
ray denied the bill was meant to keep jackson off the ballot and 
said he began working on it after constituents complained last year 
when the council voted itself a pay raise 
council member hr crawford said the honoraria limit would be an 
unfamiliar concept for most city officials 
from what i hear in the community most people would pay us 
10000 only to be quiet crawford said

1987 settled their cases out of court on tuesday 
the settlements came just before final arguments were to be heard 
in the liability trial against usair and others damage cases 
brought by the families of two passengers a flight attendant and 
the pilot remain 
families who did not request confidentiality said settlements 
ranged from 200000 to 37 million attorneys said the total 
payment was less than 37 million but more than 20 million 
evidence presented during the trial included allegations of lax 
security at both los angeles and san francisco international 
airports that allowed fired usair employee david burke to board 
pacific southwest airlines flight 1771 with a 44caliber magnum 
pistol 
i think we brought out how bad it was said plaintiff 
attorney ronald wecht referring to airport security among other 
things this was the first public hearing of this airplane crash 
i think the public had a right and a need to know about this 
kind of disaster 
a telephone call seeking comment from lead defense counsel george 
manfredi was not immediately returned 
fortythree people including burke died in the dec 7 1987 
crash federal investigators concluded that midway through the 
flight burke shot his supervisor then entered the cockpit and shot 
the crew 
minutes later the bae146 fourengine plane slammed into a 
hillside north of san luis obispo in an explosive crash there were 
no survivors 
marshall foreman who represented the families of crew members 
killed in the crash said the most damaging testimony in the trial 
came from former usair employee joe drabik who loaned burke the gun 
used in the shootings and was a usair supervisor in san francisco at 
the time 
drabik testified that in november he loaned the gun and 12 rounds 
of ammunition to burke a longtime friend at burkes request burke 
had already been fired by usair for allegedly stealing 69 from a 
petty cash box 
drabik said that on the day he loaned burke the gun at the 
airport he helped him get it through security by walking through an 
employee bypass at the metal detector station while burke walked 
through the detectors 
although drabik insisted that he did not carry the gun through 
for burke he could not explain how burke could pass through the 
detectors and not set them off 
not one juror we talked to later said they believed that 
said foreman it was the most damaging testimony for usair an 
employee had knowingly violated security 
other testimony came from experts on how burke managed to sneak a 
gun aboard flight 1771 at los angeles international both sides 
agreed that burke used an unreturned employee identification badge 
to move unchallenged through the airport but his route to the plane 
with the gun was disputed 
plaintiffs contended burke could have simply flashed his 
identification badge at security guards and used a bypass to avoid 
metal detectors 
since the crash the federal aviation administration has 
tightened requirements for airline employees passing through 
security areas and regulation of identification badge issues 
the settlements came before closing arguments or jury 
deliberations began in the los angeles superior court case overseen 
by judge jack t ryburn 
defendants included pacific southwest airlines its parent 
company usair the city department of airports and ogden allied 
security the private firm that handles metal detection and 
passenger screening stations at los angeles international airport 
by agreement the airports department was dismissed as a 
defendant by all plaintiffs 
wecht one of the plaintiffs attorneys suggested that the 
remaining cases might eventually be settled out of court as well 
it wasnt feasible for them to settle at this time said 
foreman who refused to elaborate

the head of the national council of churches said 
tuesday hes quitting because ecumenical dreams for the council 
as a more unifying movement have been blocked 
the rev arie r brouwer said that in recent struggles over 
council objectives differences in dreams led to the sharpness of 
the conflict with him favoring fuller integration of the 
councils operational units 
i can do no more in this position to fulfill that goal he 
told a conference 
brouwer 53 said he would step down friday as the councils 
general secretary a post he has held for four and a half years the 
last two embroiled in turmoil over future council directions 
the council the countrys largest ecumenical organization 
includes most major protestant and eastern orthodox denominations 
totaling more than 40 million members 
brouwer a tall quietspoken midwesterner from iowa and a 
clergyman in the reformed church in america emphasized he was not 
leaving the council office in a spirit of anger or bitterness 
the conflict over goals boiled to a near breaking point at a may 
meeting in lexington ky of the councils governing board which 
split evenly 57 votes to 57 over a move to oust brouwer 
he said his resignation is a direct result of events 
precipitated at that meeting which initiated steps to consolidate 
11 council units into four each run by church representatives 
largely independent of other units 
brouwer said this essentially perpetuated the past loosely linked 
units mostly setting their own policies 
he had clashed sharply with church world service the councils 
relief arm and largest operational unit in trying to bring it into 
joint administration efforts that cws strongly resisted 
at the lexington meeting brouwer sharply delineated the 
conflict denouncing a tide of rumors innuendo and false 
charges against him critics had called brouwer harsh and 
autocratic 
he said the problem was that he dared speak the truth the 
powerful are not accustomed to such behavior and they are outraged 
they will not have it 
brouwer said he spoke out strongly about the matter then because 
i wanted to set it openly before the entire community knowing 
that doing so involved personal vulnerability and professional 
risk 
the tie vote over his continuing in his post showed that the 
governing board could not resolve the issues he said and in 
reflecting about the impasse he concluded he should resign 
under those circumstances i could not carry further the work 
which is essential to my vocational fulfillment he said in a 
written statement 
to outside observers this must surely seem to be a time of 
great brokenness for the council it is but it is also a time of 
healing and binding the experiences of the past few weeks have in 
some ways brought us closer together 
brouwer was chief executive of the reformed church in america 
before he took the council post in 1985 at a time when a special 
panel had presented plans for making the council a closerknit 
communion of communions 
acknowleging that he had been rebuffed in trying to implement 
that larger dream he added that does not however mean that i 
am giving up on those dreams or on the council 
a statement by other council officers said we profoundly 
regret the developments in our life together that now deprive our 
community of aries leadership 
the rev patricia mcclurg a presbyterian and the councils 
titular president said there has been a great deal of hurt in 
the conflict and the council wanted to move forward toward greater 
unity but she added 
this was not the right time we didnt learn to do it quickly 
enough weve had some rough sledding but we havent given up 
the rev james hamilton a united methodist and the councils 
washinton dc publicpolicy representative was named as the 
councils acting general secretary until brouwers successor is 
chosen

environmentalists on tuesday rejected a 
compromise plan that would have preserved the best northwest forest 
land for the rare northern spotted owl while freeing enough timber 
to keep mills operating 
the environmental groups however said they were willing to 
continue negotiating toward a solution that would overcome a bitter 
court battle which has tied up billions of board feet of timber on 
federal lands 
we are talking about the extinction of a species and shouldnt 
act precipitously said andy kerr conservation director for the 
oregon natural resources council conservationists like misers 
may be hell to live with but we make great ancestors 
timber industry officials had said they were willing to accept 
the compromise offered saturday by members of the oregon 
congressional delegation and gov neil goldschmidt 
the proposal called for a shortterm increase in the number of 
trees that could be cut on federal land in oregon and washington 
while protecting some of the older forests where the rare northern 
spotted owl nests 
a statement issued by the environmental groups said they could 
not accept the timber harvest figures in the compromise without more 
information 
the proposal was a bittersweet pill robert l spence 
chairman of the northwest forest resources council said at a news 
conference in seattle the simple truth is that less timber means 
fewer jobs 
in washington dc rep bob smith rore reacted angrily to 
the rejection while rep les aucoin dore expressed hopes for an 
eventual resolution 
all bets are off said smith who has proposed legislation to 
allow unrestricted logging for five years while the status of the 
owl is studied more 
no doors are closed said aucoin spokeswoman rachael gorlin 
were in touch with everyone 
the compromise was offered at the socalled spotted owl summit 
meeting in salem among representatives of the timber industry 
environmentalists all seven members of oregons congressional 
delegation and gov neil goldschmidt

tehran radio said tuesday that 205 of the 
270 deputies in irans parliament have asked ahmad khomeini son of 
the late revolutionary patriarch ayatollah ruhollah khomeini to run 
for parliament 
political foes said it was intended to avert an open power 
struggle between radicals led by ahmad khomeini and pragmatists led 
by parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani the only announced 
candidate in the july 28 presidential election 
irans official islamic republic news agency quoted the tehran 
times daily as saying the deputies suggested that ahmad khomeini 
become speaker if he wins an election in rafsanjanis tehran 
constituency 
rafsanjani who polled 13 million votes in last years 
parliamentary election will have to give up his seat in the majlis 
or parliament to run for president no date has been set for the 
byelection 
we call upon your excellency to be in the majlis to become 
a cause of strength encouragement and guidance for this important 
pillar of legislation in the arena of the countrys decisions the 
radio quoted the deputies as saying in a letter to ahmad khomeini 
the iranian news media were monitored in nicosia 
the iraqbased mujahedeen khalq or peoples holy warriors 
opposition group said the deputies offer was aimed at leaving 
rafsajani a clear run 
speculation has grown that the politically ambitious ahmad 
khomeini 43 would declare himself a candidate for president to run 
against rafsanjani 
many analysts said that would lead to an open fight for power 
between the pragmatists and their radical rivals 
the mujahedeen said in a statement telexed from their baghdad 
headquarters to the associated press in nicosia ahmad has told 
his aides that if rafsanjani becomes president that would lead to 
splits within the regime and its disintegration 
it said the deputies sent the letter to ahmad on sunday and that 
rafsanjani was a signatory 
the letter reflects the deputies profound fears that any 
factional alignment in the presidential elections would lead to the 
disintegration of the whole regime following ayatollah khomeinis 
death june 3 the mujahedeen said 
analysts believe that if rafsanjani is elected president he will 
take over the daytoday running of iran once entrenched his 
pragmatic faction is expected to maneuver to loosen the governments 
grip on the economy and to mend relations with the west 
such policies are anathema to the radicals the mujahedeen say 
the radicals are engineering to promote ahmad khomeini in the 
hierarchy to curb the power of their rival camp 
the younger khomeini a lowranking clergyman has held no 
official position but he was a close aide to his father and 
controlled access to him

a nuclear weapons test that had been 
delayed by fickle wind conditions shook the nevada desert tuesday 
with an explosion several times the force of the hiroshima atomic 
bomb 
the blast registered 46 on the richter scale of ground motion at 
the national earthquake information center in golden colo 
according to spokesman john minsch 
monitors atop highrise hotels in las vegas 100 miles from ground 
zero registered the blast but the readings were not as distinct as 
with some previous tests 
the test codenamed amarillo was the second major us nuclear 
weapons test in six days energy department officials deemed the 
latest shot a success 
the device was detonated 2100 feet beneath the surface of pahute 
mesa on the sprawling desert test range and had an explosive force 
of up to 150000 tons of tnt the blast that destroyed hiroshima had 
an explosive force of 13000 tons of tnt 
the seismograph needle is swinging wildly from side to side 
energy department spokesman jim boyer said as he monitored the blast 
in a control center 30 miles from ground zero 
the test was originally scheduled for saturday then delayed 
several times because of unfavorable wind conditions it was 
rescheduled for sunday then delayed again for the same reason 
tests are not conducted if winds are blowing toward a populated 
area such as las vegas in the event that nuclear radiation escapes 
the underground cavity where the nuclear device is detonated 
boyer said monitoring equipment surrounding ground zero indicated 
there was no leak of radiation

kraft has begun sending out 250 checks as 
consolation prizes for wouldbe winners of a 17000 van offered in 
the companys botched ready to roll contest officials said 
tuesday 
the food company based in this northwest chicago suburb had 
planned to give away only one van in the game but a printing error 
in newspaper inserts distributed june 11 created hundreds perhaps 
thousands of winning combinations with matching pieces in packages 
of kraft singles cheese 
the firm nullified the contest june 12 but offered the 250 to 
those holding game pieces that indicated they had won the van 
we hope that the actions were taking will show consumers how 
much we appreciate their understanding and patience during this 
situation said kathy knuth a spokeswoman for kraft usa 
the checks from the food company are accompanied by letters 
saying that the company is sorry for any confusion or 
disappointment the flawed game may have caused 
the grand prize in the game offered only in chicago and houston 
areas was a 1990 dodge caravan le worth 17000 
officials of kraft usa a division of kraft general foods which 
is part of philip morris cos inc of new york city have so far 
not specified how many people mailed in matching game pieces for the 
van and other prizes offered 
that information isnt available right now ms knuth said 
tuesday 
after the error was discovered and the game canceled kraft 
officials announced a modified contest 
claimants were required to have mailed their pieces by midnight 
june 16 to qualify for cash and a july 14 drawing for four vans and 
other prizes the company also announced plans to send 250 checks 
to van claimants 
jerry ohearn 48 of suburban brookfield got his check in the 
mail monday just 10 days after he sent in his game pieces 
those kraft people just made a big flub out of the whole 
deal said ohearn 
but he said he does not intend to participate in classaction 
lawsuits against the company at least two such lawsuits were filed 
earlier this month with plaintiffs seeking more than the 250 the 
company offered 
i can see how a mistake could happen said ohearn its 
pretty fair what theyve done 
in addition to the van kraft had originally planned to award 100 
bicycles 500 skateboards and 8000 packages of cheese 
ms knuth said that payments have also started going to wouldbe 
winners of those prizes 50 to bicycle winners 25 to skateboard 
winners and 5 to cheese winners she said she was unsure whether 
all checks had been mailed 
only one winner is allowed per household under company rules

a us navy intelligence analyst who defected to 
the soviet union in 1986 complaining of fbi harassment actually was 
a longtime soviet spy a newspaper said tuesday in disclosing his 
death at the age of 32 
the disclosure that glenn michael souther had been a staff 
member of the kgb was a rare admission of soviet spying 
the military newspaper red star published an obituary signed by 
the kgb collegium and his work comrades of the man it called 
mikhail yevgenievich orlov it said he died suddenly june 22 but 
did not give a cause of death 
a picture accompanying the obituary showed a cleancut souther 
wearing a suit and tie 
it was not clear whether he was a soviet mole working under cover 
for years in the united states or whether he began working for the 
kgb the soviet secret police and intelligence unit only after 
his defection 
i think its probably too early to tell fbi spokesman mike 
kortan said in washington 
he said souther was born in hammond ind went to high school in 
cumberland maine the fbi believes he took the name orlov when he 
defected kortan said 
theres some attempt to imply that he was really a sovietborn 
citizen and became a mole but that was never really stated and i 
dont believe its true said ronald kessler a maryland author 
who is writing a book on souther he was an american mole 
kessler spoke in a telephone interview from his home in potomac 
md 
the fbi says souther was a navy veteran who disappeared in may 
1986 after graduating from old dominion university in norfolk va 
with a major in russian he served in the navy in the 1970s and 
worked as a civilian intelligence specialist in the navys 2nd fleet 
headquarters in norfolk he apparently was being investigated for 
espionage at the time 
old dominion professors said in virginia that souther was an 
outgoing wellliked student who started out poorly in his russian 
major 
leonid i mihalap a sovietborn professor who taught souther 
russian said he may have become disillusioned with the soviet union 
and committed suicide 
barbara fahey a professors wife who knew souther when he was a 
student said i think they decided that this was a bad apple 
probably somebody just said hey lets get rid of him 
kortan said southers wife did not defect with him 
all thats come out is the fact that his wife has said she 
suspected him several years before he left kortan said adding he 
did not know the status of their marriage 
soviet media reported in july 1988 that souther had been granted 
asylum in the soviet union after he claimed fbi agents persecuted 
him 
the obitary said he was a soviet intelligence agent who had 
worked a long time to remove the threat of nuclear war hanging 
over humanity and had performed special assignments and made a 
large contribution to ensuring soviet state security 
the newspaper did not say exactly what he did for the kgb or how 
long he had spied for the soviets 
shortly after his defection was disclosed souther appeared on 
soviet tv to describe his american work with secret reconnaissance 
photographs taken by satellites to help plan the us bombing raid 
on libya in april 1986 
the attack was to retaliate for what washington claimed was 
libyan involvement in the bombing of a west german disco in which a 
us serviceman was killed and 50 others wounded 
in his tv appearance souther said nothing about spying for the 
soviets 
during the broadcast souther indicated he had not settled in to 
soviet life and wasnt satisfied with what he was doing 
although he said he had a comfortable moscow apartment souther 
added theres a lot of work here but i havent found my niche 
exactly i dont feel that im being the most productive for what i 
have to offer 
red star said he made a great contribution to maintaining the 
soviet unions security

a senate committee staff analysis concluded 
tuesday that running the controversial shoreham nuclear power plant 
on long island would be cheaper that shutting it down contrary to 
an analysis by state regulators 
after hearing some of the reports conclusions chairman peter 
bradford of the new york public service commission characterized the 
study which he had not seen as baloney 
the analysis was released as the nuclear regulatory commissions 
atomic safety and licensing board decided that it was acceptable to 
use polemounted sirens on trucks to notify nearby massachusetts 
residents of an emergency at the seabrook nh nuclear power 
plant the other completed but not operating reactor in the 
northeast 
though some of the truck sites would slightly exceed federal 
guidelines of that it should not take more than 15 minutes to set 
off warnings the board said the plan by the seabrook operators was 
adequate considering the fact that concerned political 
jurisdictions can reduce alerting and notification times by making 
sites available for sirens permanently mounted on poles 
the state of massachusetts and its towns in the evacuation zones 
have refused to cooperate in emergency planning and massachusetts 
deputy attorney general stephen jonas said the state would appeal 
the decision to an appeal board 
the senate report an analysis of a new york commission study 
performed last year of the plant owned by long island lighting co 
or lilco was prepared by an economist with the senate committee on 
energy and natural resources which is chaired by sen j bennett 
johnston dla 
his study concludes that the psc report is a biased and unfair 
comparison of shoreham inservice and the settlement johnston 
said in a letter to bradford the study shows that shoreham 
operation would save threequarters of a billion dollars in real 
economic costs over the first 15 years of its life 
the settlement refers to the pending deal to be voted on by 
lilco shareholders wednesday to turn the 55 billion plant over to 
the state for 1 and assurance of a decades worth of rate increases 
of about 5 percent a year though fully licensed the plant has 
never entered commercial operation local and state authorities 
contend nearby residents could not be evacuated in an emergency 
bradford said johnston assigned staff to go and find every 
fault that they could with the psclilco study 
the senate staff analysis concludes that lilcos electric rates 
with shoreham in service would average about 1522 cents per 
kilowatthour 029 cents cheaper than under the shutdown 
the state study estimated the average rate if shoreham operates 
sat 1496 cents or 052 cents more expensive than closing it down 
the report criticized the psc analysis for placing too much 
emphasis on electric rates in the first 11 years of shoreham 
operation while utility investments are typically analyzed over 
planning horizons of 2030 years 
thats flat wrong bradford countered the pscs study runs 
out to the year 2003 i believe but a lot of the further 
calculations run out over the life of shoreham 
the committee staff study also said among other things that the 
state had overestimated the savings to the company of being able to 
carry more debt with shoreham retired had failed to assign enough 
cost to shrunken generating reserves without shoreham and had 
assumed the implausibly low price for oil lilcos major fuel in 
the year 2000 of 15 per barrel vs 20 to 25 a barrel forecasts by 
private consulting firms

former pro football star john matuszak died of 
an accidental overdose of a mild narcotic painkiller the coroner 
said tuesday in a report that also found nonlethal traces of 
cocaine in his system 
also contributing to the death of the former oakland raider 
defensive lineman were an enlarged heart and pneumonia los angeles 
county coroners spokesman bob dambacher said 
the manner of death is listed as an accident dambacher said 
matuszaks parents immediately acknowledged his use of prescribed 
and illegal drugs for his chronic pain 
at the proper time we will have things to say about substance 
abuse and the scoundrels in the medical profession who recklessly 
dispense prescription drugs and the parasites of society who 
distribute illicit drugs from back alleys to fashionable 
condominiums his parents marv and audrey matuszak said in a 
statement released within minutes of the coroners report 
matuszak who was 38 when he died june 17 in a burbank hospital 
had been given a prescription for darvocet early that morning 
dambacher said 
darvocet is a combination of two drugs propoxyphene a mild 
narcotic painkiller found in darvon and acetaminophen the 
painkiller found in tylenol anacin3 panadol and tempra 
high doses of propoxyphene taken for prolonged periods may lead 
to physical dependence on the drug however it is less addictive 
than other similar drugs and most people are able to stop treatment 
without difficulty according to the american medical 
associations guide to prescription and overthecounter drugs 
the propoxyphene level found in matuszaks blood was 34 
micrograms per milliliter dambacher said 
anything could be fatal over 10 micrograms but that depends 
if youve perhaps been using it you can build up a tolerance 
dambacher said with his size 6foot8 280 pounds and his prior 
use of it we dont know how much it takes 
dambacher said he did not know how much of the painkiller 
matuszak took before his death 
tests also showed traces of a byproduct of cocaine but that was 
not considered to have contributed to matuszaks death dambacher 
said 
side effects of darvocet including dizziness drowsiness and 
nausea are more common in active people and often can be relieved 
by lying down and resting serious adverse effects are rare except 
in overdose the ama said 
matuszaks parents alluded to their sons battle against chronic 
pain and his resulting use of drugs both prescription and 
otherwise 
for now however we do not wish the dark side of these 
realities to detract from the celebration of the good and great 
deeds of this kind and wonderful man our son 
the matuszaks statement was released by a publicist they were 
in california for a memorial service and could not immediately be 
reached for additional comment 
matuszak played for the raiders from 197681 and was on two super 
bowl championship teams he was on the injured reserve list when the 
club moved to los angeles in 1982 
matuszak retired that year to pursue an acting career fulltime

the food and drug administration announced 
tuesday it is investigating doctors in several us cities who are 
testing an aids drug from china without federal approval 
nine doctors in los angeles san francisco and new york city have 
treated 42 patients with compound q imported from china with the 
help of couriers who in some cases bribed chinese government 
officials doctors said monday three patients showed adverse 
reactions and one died saturday 
compound q is the name aids researchers have given to 
trichosanthin a protein from the root of a cucumberlike plant that 
chinese doctors have used to induce abortions and to treat cancer 
since the third century 
dr paul rothman one of the doctors in the underground testing 
said that observations of 15 patients in los angeles indicated the 
drug appears to be the most effective aids medication available or 
on the horizon 
we would have liked to have done this study formally and with 
the approval of the fda he said but one person dies from aids 
every 30 minutes we felt that as long as we proceeded on a rigorous 
scientific basis we would be on very strong ground 
the fda under its socalled compassionate use decision allows 
individuals to import personal use quantities of experimental 
drugs the supplies must be no more than enough for one individual 
use for three months largescale importation of unapproved products 
for commercial use is prohibited violating fda policy on 
distributing unapproved drugs could result in seizure of the 
material cease and desist orders or in rare cases mostly 
involving forprofit schemes criminal penalties 
the agency said drug testing must be done under its scrutiny 
we will be investigating this matter to see just what has 
occurred said fda spokesman brad stone in washington 
the fda has approved only one drug azt to treat aids and side 
effects keep many patients from taking it 
the fda in april approved testing on aids patients of glq223 a 
highly purified form of trichosanthin developed at the university of 
california at san francisco and genelabs of redwood city calif 
at the time genelabs warned that aids patients should not turn 
to china to get the active ingredient because it might have toxic 
side effects 
some aids activists charged that the university and genelabs were 
taking that position to protect an agreement giving their financial 
backer the swiss pharmaceutical company sandoz ltd exclusive 
rights to market glq223 
at least one doctor not involved in the underground testing said 
the extreme side effects of compound q could have contributed to the 
death saturday of an aids patient at san franciscos mount zion 
hospital 
that was denied by martin delaney codirector of project inform 
a san francisco aids education group that organized the network of 
doctors in the underground testing 
but i want to stress that this is not herbal tea said 
delaney this is radical chemotherapy some of the patients have 
had a very rough ride 
san francisco immunologist dr alan levin who helped set up the 
study of compound q said the program is at least six months ahead 
of mainline research on the drugs efficacy and contended he could 
have dosage recommendations within three months 
from our tests well have better scientific data in 10 percent 
of time and 1 percent of the cost it is taking regular science to do 
the job said levin he and his wife dr vera byers designed the 
trial 
our scientific procedures are very good and rigorous said 
levin i resent people calling us underground illegal or guerilla 
groups were not amateurs were firstclass doctors 
levin said lawyers for doctors involved in the program had 
informed fda officials earlier this spring of the treatment trial

the house on tuesday rejected a fiveyear 
extension of mostfavorednation trading status for hungary with 
some members arguing the issue should be left to the presidents 
discretion 
president bush already has announced he intends to extend the 
trade preference for another year 
the house vote was 242172 for the legislation less than the 
twothirds necessary to pass a bill under suspension of the rules a 
procedure generally reserved for noncontroversial bills 
during debate rep sam gibbons dfla chairman of the house 
ways and means trade subcommittee said the people of hungary 
have demonstrated since world war ii that they seek and yearn for 
freedom theyre close now it is time for us to take them off of 
probation and extend a helping hand 
earlier at a house foreign affairs committee hearing curtis w 
kamman deputy assistant secretary of state for european affairs 
said hungary had made progress in human rights including free 
travel and emigration 
hungary a communist nation in the warsaw pact will clearly meet 
the criteria for a new extension of its mostfavorednation status 
which presidents have renewed annually over the past decade he said 
in light of that there is no need for congress to direct a 
fiveyear extension he said 
countries in mostfavorednation status are guaranteed the lowest 
tariffs applicable to their products in other words they will be 
treated like the most favored nation 
speaking against the measure on the house floor rep ben gilman 
rny said the trade benefits should be left to the president to 
determine and pointed to the recent chinese crackdown on the 
prodemocracy movement as an example of how quickly situations can 
change 
gilman also hinted that president bush might want to make the 
announcement himself during a trip to budapest in about two weeks 
he asked colleagues not to preempt the president from taking the 
kinds of steps he would be inclined to do later on this year 
bush on may 31 announced his intention to extend hungarys trade 
benefit for another year 
the president also has generally held out the hope of increased 
economic aid to east bloc countries that expand freedoms and has 
promised a longerterm extension of mostfavorednation trading 
status to hungary if it passes a liberalized emigration law 
current law bars mostfavorednation status with its 
preferential customs duty rates to communist countries with 
restrictive emigration policies since the ban was imposed in 1974 
three nations have been granted waivers hungary romania and china

the house ways and means committee approved 
legislation tuesday that would bar doctors from referring patients 
to testing labs they own but do not supervise 
the antireferral package pushed by rep pete stark dcalif 
is part of an overall medicare bill the committee is expected to 
approve on wednesday 
even though the section on referrals technically could be changed 
before the overall bill wins final committee approval committee 
staffers said it and several less controversial matters are 
considered final for all practical purposes 
the panel left the most controversial part of the medicare bill 
until wednesday the second of two days of closed hearings whether 
to clamp a limit on the overall amount medicare will pay for doctor 
bills and whether to adopt a new fee schedule for medicarecovered 
services 
the health subcommittee headed by stark proposed setting targets 
under which medicare doctor bill spending could not grow more than 
somewhere between 10 percent and 12 percent next year 
if actual 1990 billings exceeded that amount fees would be held 
down to compensate 
the antireferral provisions are aimed at removing the financial 
incentive for doctors to enhance their income by referring patients 
to labs in which their sole interest is financial rather than 
professional

washington energy secretary james d watkins on tuesday 
launched a broad shakeup of nuclear weapons production pledging to 
chart a new course of environmental safeguards and conceding 
that a key waste storage facility has to be delayed 
the chickens have finally come home to roost watkins said 
after years of inattention to changing standards and demands 
regarding the environment safety and health 
watkins announced new steps for improving management of the 
weapons production complex including 17 major plants or 
laboratories in 12 states and for determining the extent to which 
the facilities are violating state and federal environmental laws 
he also said a new mexico site that was scheduled to open in 
september as the nations first permanent dump for waste from the 
military facilities would not begin receiving waste until sometime 
in 1990 he said he had no more specific target date 
we have had a flawed plan for opening the waste isolation 
pilot plant he said 
waste production has been reduced which should allow the 
production plants to continue operating normally until the new 
mexico site opens he said 
watkins announcement came as a group of 21 environmental 
scientific and church groups sued the energy department to try to 
force a broad public review of plans for modernizing the weapons 
plants 
the suit filed in us district court in washington said the 
department should be compelled to prepare a programmatic 
environmental impact statement a comprehensive analysis of the 
environmental and health effects of its weapons plant initiatives 
watkins declined to comment directly on the suit except to say he 
was committed to ensuring full compliance with all environmental 
requirements 
at his first formal news conference since taking office last 
march watkins said he was surprised and disappointed to learn of 
the depth of problems in the weapons program which has been 
crippled by mechanical failures and safety problems 
it has been a nightmare for me to unravel the background 
sufficient to make a decision he said adding that he was being 
forced to act on a crisis basis because of the urgent need to 
get key weapons plants running again 
three nuclear reactors at the savannah river site in south 
carolina which are the nations only source of tritium needed for 
nuclear warheads have been shut down for more than a year because 
of uncertainties about their safety watkins said he hoped to 
announce a reactor restart scheduled in july 
in what he called an illustration of the breadth of change he 
seeks in the weapons program watkins said the savannah river 
restart plan would require westinghouse electric corp which runs 
the plant under a federal contract to devote far more resources 
than our own program coordinator ever demanded in the past 
he said he was creating environmental tiger teams to closely 
examine each weapons plant to assess its compliance with state and 
federal environmental laws 
this is a complete review with my tiger teams moving out to 
see to what degree we have actually been complying with the intent 
as well as the letter of the law watkins said 
the departments increased attention to health and safety issues 
comes just days after the justice department raided the rocky flats 
weapons plant in colorado in search of evidence of illegal dumping 
and incineration of hazardous wastes 
watkins was mildly critical of justice for refusing to give him 
any information about its findings at rocky flats which makes 
plutonium triggers for thermonuclear weapons 
he said he wanted to find a new way of doing business in these 
events in the future if we get into this situation because i think 
its important that we know at once whether there has been any 
violation of the environment particularly when radioactivity is 
involved 
watkins said rocky flats illustrated the extent of turmoil in the 
weapons program 
i cannot certify to you today or to the public that we know 
exactly what is contained in radioactive waste stored at rocky 
flats he said it will take another four months to revalidate 
the contents of the waste he added 
watkins also defended president bushs decision to nominate 
victor stello as assistant secretary for defense programs the top 
job in the weapons program despite what watkins called the 
potential controversiality of the choice 
in 1987 a senate panel conducted a hearing on whether stello as 
executive director for operations of the nuclear regulatory 
commission was guilty of improprieties in connection with a 
commission investigation of the tennessee valley authority 
the probe included the question of whether stello improperly 
advised the manager of nuclear power at tva on how to respond to a 
commission inquiry about the readiness of a plant under 
construction stello denied any improprieties 
if he has some chinks in his armour so be it watkins said 
i have to have somebody in here who wants to serve and let me 
tell you not many want in on this one and has the skills and 
background to understand from day one what it means to run a 
reactor

a university of south carolina foundation 
filed an appeal with the state supreme court on tuesday in an effort 
to keep its records from being opened to the public 
circuit judge carol connor on monday ordered the carolina 
research and development foundation to open its records as a result 
of a 1987 lawsuit filed by the associated press and the greenville 
news 
the news organizations requested access to the records under the 
states freedom of information act which requires with some 
exceptions that public bodies open their records and meetings to 
the public 
the foundation was established as a nonprofit corporation to 
engage in land acquisition and development for the university 
in their lawsuit the news organizations said the foundation had 
received and spent more than 28 million in public funds 
foundation attorneys argued that the foundation is a private 
entity separate from the university and thus is unaffected by the 
laws disclosure provisions 
but ms connor agreed with the ap and the news ruling june 13 
that the foundation was subject to the freedom of information act 
on monday ms connor acted on the written order that she had 
instructed the news organizations attorneys to prepare in the 
earlier ruling 
attorneys for the foundation filed a motion in circuit court 
tuesday requesting a stay of the order so that the foundations 
records could not be opened while the appeal was being considered 
the judge said the ruling did not necessarily apply to all 
foundations related to state schools or to businesses that receive 
public money

pete rose tried to get involved in cocaine 
deals arranged by his associates so he could pocket taxfree cash 
and once offered to store cocaine in his house a former associate 
told baseball investigators 
the allegation was dismissed as ridiculous by one of roses 
lawyers 
paul g janszen who claims he ran bets for the cincinnati reds 
manager told baseball investigators in february that rose once 
asked him to set up a cocaine ring and include him 
janszen also said rose once said he might consider throwing a 
game if he had a large bet on it he also told investigators that 
rose checked by telephone with other majorleague managers about 
their players physical status before placing bets on their teams 
janszens claims were made in an interview included in thousands 
of pages of exhibits to investigator john m dowds report which 
was released monday 
it was the first time rose has been linked to the cocaine ring 
operated by former associates who ran a gymnasium in cincinnati 
where the manager worked out 
this idea of rose being involved with drugs is so far off the 
wall that its ridiculous rose lawyer robert a pitcairn jr 
said to anyone who knows pete rose and has known pete rose over 
the years theres just no question he wouldnt get involved with 
drugs 
for janszen to say this is slander of the worst kind its 
further evidence to us that this guy will do anything to follow 
through with his blackmail attempts of pete rose why dowds 
investigators even went into areas like this is beyond me 
according to a spokeswoman for dowd the investigator said he 
left the drug references out of his 225page summary report to 
baseball commissioner a bartlett giamatti because it was not 
relevant to the gambling inquiry 
in other developments the former girlfriend of a rose associate 
said she had corroborated the dowd reports charge that rose 
conspired to hide racetrack winnings from a 47646 piksix ticket 
in 1987 at turfway park in florence ky 
if the charges are true rose faces possible indictment on 
charges of conspiracy to defraud the us government a federal 
grand jury is investigating roses income taxes 
rose fernbach billiter the former girlfriend of thomas p 
gioiosa told the associated press that she had provided first and 
secondhand information supporting the charges to the fbi and the 
internal revenue service 
also a jan 20 letter from janszen to another attorney for rose 
reuven j katz reveals janszens feelings on why his relationship 
with rose deteriorated 
because i covered for him with his wife while he was sleeping 
his way around town she no longer wanted me in their house 
janszen said of roses wife carol doesnt have the guts to leave 
him so she has to blame his friends for his disgusting behavior 
attempts to reach mrs rose by telephone tuesday were 
unsuccessful 
rose who faces a possible lifetime ban by baseball if it is 
determined he bet on his own team won a temporary restraining order 
preventing giamatti from holding a hearing on the charges 
baseballs lawyers have asked a threejudge panel of an ohio appeals 
court to suspend the restraining order and roses response is due 
wednesday 
janszen who recently completed a fourmonth sentence for failure 
to report income didnt say that rose used drugs but he said the 
manager thought he could get cash from drug deals conducted by a 
circle of associates several of the associates were sentenced after 
federal authorities cracked a ring that smuggled cocaine from 
florida to ohio 
gioiosa faces trial in cincinnati next month on charges of tax 
evasion and conspiring to arrange cocaine deliveries from florida to 
cincinnati between 1985 and 1987 
golds gym where rose worked out was operated by donald j 
stenger who admitted smuggling 40 to 50 kilograms of cocaine from 
florida to cincinnati stenger was given an 10year prison sentence 
last march following a guilty plea 
michael e fry who owned the gym is serving an eightyear term 
for cocaine trafficking and tax evasion 
during his interview last february with baseball investigators 
janszen said that rose showed him a copy of his income tax return in 
1987 
he showed me that and he told me at the same time paul if 
you get me involved and if you can if you will set up a cocaine 
organization and include me in it you can spend as much money as 
you ever want to because if they ever come to you and say where do 
you get your money i will tell them from pete rose janszen said 
janszen also said rose told him that gioiosa a former housemate 
of the manager brought a suitcase with 200000 into the reds 
clubhouse sometime during 1987 and showed rose the money which 
supposedly was going to be used to buy cocaine in florida 
janszen said that when he asked rose why he wanted to get 
involved in cocaine rose responded that he had a certificate of 
deposit for 65000 or 75000 that was maturing in a few weeks he 
quoted rose as saying 
ill use that money and buy the kilos and ill keep them in my 
house because nobody would have the to come to my house

sir alfred j ayer the british philosopher who 
helped popularize the notion that all philosophy can be reduced to 
linguistic analysis died tuesday night he was 78 
ayer died after a lengthy respiratory illness in university 
college hospital said journalist nigella lawson whose late mother 
vanessa was ayers third wife 
ayer was known to generations as a j ayer and to friends as 
freddie 
his first book language truth and logic in 1936 was the 
first exposition of logical positivism in the english language 
the movement which ayer helped to develop in britain expounds 
the view that philosophical problems of the past can be reduced to 
linguistic analysis and that any idea that cannot in principle be 
verified by sensory observation is nonsensical 
ranging widely between the ideas of linguistic philosophers 
bertrand russell and ludwig wittgenstein it accepts that language 
must be strictly analyzed and redefined if there is any possibility 
of using it as an intelligible means of logical argument 
the philosophical school of linguistic analysts now dominates 
many british and american universities 
language truth and logic which jolted the metaphysicians by 
its assault on much of what has passed for philosophy owed a 
debt to empiricists such as russell and rudolph carnap it brought 
the term logical positivist to the attention of british 
academics 
i maintain that there is nothing in the nature of philosophy to 
warrant the existence of conflicting philosophical schools he 
wrote and i attempt to substantiate this by providing a 
definitive solution of the problems which have been the chief 
sources of controversy between philosophers in the past 
the principles of logic and metaphysics are true simply because 
we never allow them to be anything else he added 
ayer wrote the foundations of empirical knowledge in 1940 and 
the problem of knowledge in 1956 as well as volumes of 
philosophical essays and histories of modern philosophy in which he 
extended the traditions of british empiricism 
born oct 29 1910 ayer was the only child of a frenchswiss 
father and a dutchjewish mother his father jules a timber 
merchant became a naturalized british subject before the birth of 
his son 
educated at eton and at oxford university he was a philosophy 
lecturer and research student at christ church oxford from 1932 to 
1944 and dean of wadham college oxford in 19451946 he served as 
an intelligence officer in france during world war ii 
ayer was professor of mind and logic at university college london 
from 1946 to 1959 then professor of logic at the university of 
oxford and fellow of new college oxford until 1978 
he was a visiting professor at new york university in 19481949 
at city college new york in 19611962 and at bard college in new 
york state from 1987 
ayer earned a firstclass literary humanities degree at oxford 
university in 1932 then spent several months in vienna where he 
came under the lasting influence of the werner kreis a school of 
austrian philosophers dominated by wittgenstein and carnap 
in the 1930s he introduced and popularized at oxford university 
severe viennese philosophical attitudes when oxford philosophy was 
considered vague and explanatory rather than opinionated 
ayer married grace lees in 1932 and they had two children his 
second marriage to american journalist dee wells ended in divorce 
23 years later in 1983 he then married vanessa lawson former wife 
of britains chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson she died two 
years later

israels national airline made its first 
direct flight to the soviet union on tuesday and brought 61 
survivors of the armenian earthquake to israel for six weeks of 
treatment 
the 49 amputees and 12 victims suffering from multiple fractures 
known as the crush syndrome came slowly down the ramp those 
able to walk supported themselves with crutches as they limped off 
taking their first look at the jewish state that gathered them in 
for six weeks of medical treatment 
the el al boeing 757 took off for yerevan the capital of the 
soviet armenian republic at 130 pm and returned to ben gurion 
airport from its historic flight nine hours later 
israeli officials and archbishop kerkin kazanjian head of the 
armenian church in jerusalem greeted the survivors israeli 
immigrants from armenia brought flowers 
health minister yaakov tzur told reporters at the airport this 
definitely shows we are experiencing a new relationship with the 
soviet union 
moscow cut diplomatic relations with israel after the 1967 middle 
east war in a show of solidarity with arab nations the soviet union 
and israel exchanged lowlevel consular delegations in 1987 
the armenian patients looked confused and smiled uneasily upon 
their arrival during the 2hour flight from soviet armenia many 
burst into tears recalling the ordeal of the dec 7 earthquake that 
left an estimated 25000 dead many thousands injured and 500000 
homeless 
i lost 18 classmates in the earthquake said 17yearold egor 
khatchaturian of hardhit spitak 
they told me a week ago that i was going to israel i feel very 
well i hope they will make a prosthesis for me he said 
khatchaturian who lost his left leg could not recall what he 
did after the quake and wept the moment the disaster was mentioned

the house on tuesday approved plans to require 
the government to collect and publish for five years statistics on 
crimes based on the race ethic group sexual preference or religion 
of the victims 
this legislation is an opportunity to begin the counterattack 
against crimes based on hate said rep charles e schumer 
dny as the house approved the measure 36847 and sent it to the 
senate 
supporters said the nation is being hit by a growing wave of 
socalled hate crimes ranging from gang attacks on members of 
minority groups to cross burnings and the spray painting of 
swastikas and bigoted slogans 
under the bill statistics would be collected on homicide 
assault robbery burglary theft arson vandalism trespassing 
threats and others deemed appropriate by the justice department if 
they involved bias involving race ethnicity sexual preference or 
religion 
the house has passed similar measures in the past but the senate 
has not acted a hate crimes bill was approved by the senate 
judiciary committee on march 9 and supporters are hoping for a floor 
vote 
the fbi publishes annual crime statistics but does not include 
hate crimes supporters have relied on unofficial reports and 
anecdotal information from news accounts in estimating that the 
problem is growing worse 
rep bill green rny said 1281 antisemitic incidents were 
reported by the antidefamation league of bnai brith in 1988 he 
said the national gay and lesbian task force reported 7008 
incidents of antigay violence in 1987 there is also evidence of 
growing klan neonazi skinhead and other hate group activity 
throughout the nation green said 
the tremendous rise in crimes against minorities is widespread 
and extremely serious rep nancy pelosi dcalif said 
compiling data on such acts would help in fighting them 
supporters said the more we know about crimes of hate the more 
chance we have of preventing them said rep barbara b kennelly 
dconn 
congress should send a clear signal to all people that crimes 
based on race religion or sexuality will not be tolerated said 
rep ben gilman rny

president bush declaring the american flag a 
unique national symbol tuesday called for a constitutional 
amendment to set aside last weeks supreme court decision and forbid 
flag desecration 
as president i will uphold our precious right to dissent but 
burning the flag goes too far and i want to see that matter 
remedied he said at a news conference 
his announcement came as efforts already were advancing in 
congress to condemn last weeks decision extending first amendment 
free speech rights to protesters who burn the flag 
the house voted 4115 tuesday night for a resolution that 
expressed profound concern over the court decision and called 
for continued commitment to preserving the honor and integrity of 
the flag as a living symbol of our nation 
the resolution whose chief sponsor was house judiciary committee 
chairman jack brooks dtexas also condemns all actions intended 
to desecrate the american flag and urged americans to display the 
flag 
brooks said the committee would begin hearings soon to examine 
the matter from the standpoint of the need for constitutional 
amendment or statutory remedies 
house members used the resolution to vent their feelings rep 
carroll hubbard jr dky said those who burn the flag should 
consider moving to iran china or cuba where burning the flag 
is encouraged 
but rep ted weiss dny deploring desecration of the flag 
said the court acted correctly i exult in the decision 
because the supreme court has has validated once again the 
constitution and the bill of rights 
we should be careful of a reckless tampering with the 
constitution he said 
voting against the resolution were reps weiss gus savage 
dill ronald dellums dcalif william clay dmo and george w 
crockett jr dmich 
bush who made patriotism the flag and the pledge of allegiance 
a central theme in his 1988 presidential campaign asserted i 
think respect for the flag transcends political party and i think 
what ive said here is american it isnt republican or democrat it 
isnt liberal or conservative 
he said adding an amendment to the constitution would be the only 
foolproof way to set aside the supreme court ruling which nullified 
flagdesecration laws in 48 states 
however the process is a lengthy one requiring twothirds 
votes in both house and senate and then ratification by no less than 
38 state legislatures in the constitutions 200year history 
thousands of amendments have been proposed but only 26 have been 
ratified 
still bush said the importance of this issue compels me to 
call for a constitutional amendment 
support for the first amendment need not extend to desecration 
of the american flag he added protection of the flag a 
unique national symbol will in no way limit the opportunity nor 
the breadth of protest available in the exercise of free speech 
rights 
bushs comments were praised by conservatives but denounced by 
civilliberties groups 
we think it violates the fundamental principle of this nation 
that every person has a right to express their views and express 
them in a way they choose no matter how obnoxious the majority find 
those views said morton halperin washington director of the 
american civil liberties union 
david cole staff attorney for the center for constitutional 
rights said the first amendment has survived for 200 years 
without exceptions it is outrageous for the president to urge that 
we deviate from the fundamental principles of toleration and freedom 
of expression 
last week the senate by voice vote added language to childcare 
legislation that would make desecration of the flag punishable by a 
maximum 1000 fine and a year in prison 
however this language would not be added to the constitution and 
therefore could be overturned by the supreme court 
senators also voted 973 for a resolution expressing profound 
disappointment in the court ruling and pledging to seek ways to 
restore sanctions against such reprehensible conduct 
a number of proposed constitutional amendments on the subject 
have been introduced in both houses no hearings have yet been 
scheduled 
house republican leader bob michel said he supported bushs call 
even though he harbored an instinctive conservatives dislike of 
ameding the constitution 
the court decision leaves me with no alternative michel said 
unfurl the flag fly it flaunt it argue about it if you want 
to but dont desecrate it thats all were asking surely that 
view reflects the common sense of the american people michel said 
sen strom thurmond rsc one of numerous lawmakers to propose 
constitutional amendments to overturn the decision said with the 
presidents backing i intend to move forward expeditiously this 
egregious decision by the court must be corrected 
house speaker thomas foley dwash who has criticized the court 
decision while voicing objections to amending the constitution to 
overturn it reacted angrily to suggestions that republicans could 
make flag burning a partisan issue if democrats fail to support a 
constitutional amendment 
im sure people will play politics with any emotional issue 
foley said but he added that anyone who does so with the flag issue 
would be playing the most cynical politics for the most base 
and crass political purposes 
in his 1988 campaign bush frequently blasted democratic opponent 
gov michael dukakis for vetoing a massachusetts law requiring 
public school teachers to lead their classes in the pledge of 
allegiance 
bush said during the campaign that if he had been governor he 
would have found ways to make the law stick he reinforced his theme 
by visiting a flag factory 
on tuesday asked if he hadnt used the flag for partisan 
purposes during that campaign bush responded everything i did 
last year was for the purpose of advancing my everything i did 
politically advancing my election but i didnt put it on the 
basis that republicans are for the flag and democrats are not 
on another courtrelated topic bush was asked about recent 
supreme court rulings on affirmative action that have drawn 
criticism from civil rights groups rulings making it harder for 
employees to bring discrimination cases against employers 
bush said he had been assured by attorney general dick thornburgh 
that followup legislation was unnecessary

mayor manuel camacho solis of mexico citry 
ordered the police intelligence unit disbanded tuesday after three 
commanders were charged in a murder plot that led to the death of an 
investigative journalist 
in a statement he branded as intolerable their purported 
involvement in the may 30 1984 death of columnist manuel buendia 
he said the order to disband the intelligence division of mexico 
city police because of the buendia case and other crimes was 
effective at once 
the brief statement gave no details 
commanders juventino prado hurtado sofia naya suarez and raul 
perez carmona were charged over the weekend with buendias murder 
all three said they were tortured into confessing 
authorities say the men acted on orders of jose antonio zorrilla 
perez then head of the federal security administration all three 
served as officers under zorrilla in the agency which was the 
mexican equivalent of the fbi but was disbanded for corruption in 
1985 
zorrilla 47 is under indictment as having masterminded 
buendias murder he faces other charges including obstructing 
justice and abuse of authority 
authorities say zorrilla feared that buendia would expose his 
lucrative links with mexican narcotics kingpins 
zorrilla denies ordering buendias death 
the intelligence police have been under fire by human rights 
activists public officials and the press since the unit was created 
late last year as part of president carlos salinas de gortaris 
crimefighting program 
the first commander miguel nazar haro is wanted in san diego on 
a 1982 us indictment alleging he was part of an auto theft and 
auto smuggling ring 
the unit also was assailed for its role in quelling a prison riot 
in tepic 500 miles from mexico city a videotape viewed by the 
associated press indicated that six prisoners who surrendered were 
later shot 
repeated demands were made in the federal district assembly the 
capitals equivalent of a city council for disbanding the unit 
which was accused of illegal detentions torture and extortion 
in march intelligence agents were accused of detaining nine 
women coming home from an illegal abortion clinic the women said 
they were beaten and their elderly doctor was tortured before they 
were released without charge 14 hours later 
police and city officials refused to discuss the incident but 
they closed down the intelligence polices notorious detention 
center tlaxcoaque in april 
reps victor orduna chairman of the justice administration 
committee of the federal district assembly and ramon sosamontes 
chairman of the public safety committee and human rights groups 
told the ap the intelligence police have been using four other 
locations as clandestine jails since then

death penalty opponents are calling for new 
state laws to protect juveniles and the mentally retarded in the 
wake of supreme court rulings they say are medieval and barbaric 
to give up with ultimate finality upon a person even before 
they emerge from childhood is squarely in opposition to the 
fundamental premises of an enlightened juvenile justice system 
said american bar association president robert raven 
of the 37 states permitting capital punishment 15 now bar its 
use for anyone who committed the crime before age 18 
the court voting 54 said monday the constitution does not bar 
states from executing murderers who committed their crimes as young 
as 16 or mentally retarded adult killers 
in the case of the mentally retarded the justices said convicted 
murderers may demand that sentencing juries and judges consider 
their limited reasoning capacity as a factor weighing against the 
death penalty

a survey of more than 3000 adults suggests that 
if there was a sexual revolution in the 1960s most americans missed 
it 
the survey conducted in 1970 but published this week for the 
first time found that americans overwhelmingly disapproved of 
prostitution extramarital sex and premarital sex and were fiercely 
opposed to homosexuality 
the number of women jumping in and out of bed at random is 
exaggerated i think just as the number of homosexuals in the 
population has been exaggerated one of the studys authors 
eugene f levitt a psychologist at the indiana university school of 
medicine said in a telephone interview monday 
the survey which could help researchers understand how aids 
spreads was not released for so long because two of its authors 
fought over whose name should appear first on the title page said 
hubert j ogorman who edited the survey report to be published

felicita rodriguez is ready to start her life 
over 
i have a future in front of me said the 24yearold resident 
of new york citys lower east side a better future 
that future includes a high school equivalency degree a job and 
the chance to raise her two young children properly rodriguez said 
it wont include using or selling drugs which is what got her into 
trouble in the first place 
it also got her into state prison 
this inmate thinks she can do it she said i know im 
special now 
rodriguez and 14 other women this month became the first female 
platoon to complete new york states shock incarceration program 
about 1400 of the states 40000 prison inmates are women 
while doing their six months at the shock camp the women 
followed an intense regime of military drills manual labor 
exercise remedial education and drug and alcohol counseling they 
lost weight gained some selfrespect and won their freedom 
earlier than they would have in a traditional prison 
they opted into the program trading a tough six months in an 
environment very much like a marine boot camp for a shorter prison 
term 
firsttime nonviolent offenders sentenced to three years or 
less in prison who complete the shock program are immediately 
eligible for parole that means they can cut up to 2 years off 
their minimum prison time 
thats good news for the state whose prisons are so overcrowded 
that officials recently decided to start housing inmates in prison 
gymnasiums and its very good news for inmates who want to go home 
early 
im going home and growing my hair said christine conti a 
cocaine dealer as she stuffed her possessions in a paper bag and 
prepared for a ride home to new jersey the women in shock camp 
dont have to shave their heads as closely as the male inmates but 
their hair is cut to about collar length 
conti 25 said most of the other shock inmates thought i was 
crazy because she liked the running and the strenuous exercise 
that begins every day at 530 am but other aspects of the military 
life didnt sit as well 
the worst part is the mess hall she said i like to talk 
when i eat you cant talk you cant even look 
sherrell radcliffe 26 of rochester couldnt wait to get out of 
the fatigues shed been wearing for six months i keep looking at 
what everyone else is wearing she said of inmates friends and 
relatives at graduation 
superintendent rosetta burke said the military basis of the shock 
program teaches the inmates responsibility discipline and respect 
traits most had very little grounding in before 
conti said drug counseling helped her get over a cocaine 
addiction before shock camp she said i wouldnt have told you i 
was a drug addict they taught me how to open up and deal with my 
problem 
other programs taught her she didnt always have to say 
something about everything 
when i first came in here i was trying to tell the lady how to 
run the community meeting thats how i was i wouldnt listen to 
anybody 
the women who completed shock camp this month were effusive in 
praising the program and thanking the staff that may be because the 
program is voluntary 
inmates who dont like it can transfer back to a regular prison 
and their longer sentences troublemakers are sent back 
the platoon of 15 started out with 25 women six months ago most 
of them convicted of drug charges one woman owes a month because 
she was hospitalized during her shock term another left for medical 
reasons five were kicked out because of disciplinary problems 
inmates like the three who chose to go back to prison cant 
take it any more said burke they dont like getting yelled at 
they dont like getting up in the morning they dont like the 
responsibility 
we dont let them off the hook 
while all of the graduating platoon spoke sincerely of new 
brighter futures the odds are that a few of them will get in 
trouble again shock inmates have a 17 percent to 19 percent 
recidivism rate burke said however the average prison inmate 
return rate is 25 percent 
that improvement and the millions the state can save through 
shorter prison terms has prompted gov mario cuomo to propose 
raising the current 26year age cap for shock camp to 29 the shock 
programs operated by a growing number of states louisiana and 
mississippi also have graduated classes of women have attracted 
the attention of national drug policy chief william bennett who is 
interested in it for federal prisons 
several of the women leaving the camp about 50 miles west of 
albany cried as they said their goodbyes to each other and to their 
guards who kept up their drill sergeants roles to the end 
as the platoon fell into formation to march their last drill 
chanting loudly to the graduation ceremony one officer barked 
dont march like girls march like shock graduates

through marketing ingenuity incentives good 
design improved quality and sheer persistence automakers have 
managed to stretch their selling cycle long beyond its usual 
lifespan 
now they are faced with another situation with the delayed but 
inevitable end of their growth cycle appearing on the horizon can 
they manage to maintain their stock prices until the next upturn 
automaking is a cyclical industry meaning it has at least as 
many ups and downs as the economy itself the pattern is as distinct 
as in real estate a rising demand overproduction big inventories 
a downturn and a recovery 
its been a bit different this time amid intense competition 
the carmakers developed techniques to shift the production mix 
cars vs trucks for example offer discounts and belowmarket 
interest rates and finetune production 
in so doing they demonstrated that the cycle can indeed be 
stretched if only to a point now with indications it could snap 
july output may be at an annual rate of only 5 million cars lowest 
for any month since 1982 you might think the appeal of automaker 
stocks would fall but it might not 
with industry earnings heading for a secondhalf decline 
automotive stocks still remain in many portfolios one reason being 
that analysts believe the automakers might be able to do for their 
stocks what they did for their sales 
how do you keep stock prices up 
by using the money you earned in the good times to buy back your 
stocks as general motors and ford are doing thus tending to 
maintain the supplydemand ratio 
by maintaining dividends at a rate higher than most blue chips 
general motors current dividend yield is 66 percent fords 62 
percent and chryslers 48 percent 
by making operations more efficient thus buffering earnings to 
some degree against a sales downturn 
ford often is cited as the best example of improved operating 
efficiency moreover it chose to meet demand in the good days by 
expanding overtime rather than expanding plants it costs less to 
reduce overtime than to close a plant 
still another factor low priceearnings ratios conceivably 
could protect share prices gm sells for six times earnings ford 
four and chrysler five for the market as a whole the pe is in the 
double digits 
reflecting some of these considerations the value line 
investment survey offers these views of the big three automakers on 
the eve of a sales downturn 
general motors we look for negative quarterly matchups for the 
remainder of 89 and expect the fullyears earnings to decline by 
about 12 percent 
these shares have impressive total return potential for the 
three to fiveyear term in the meantime they provide an 
aboveaverage yield based on a secure payout 
ford we expect ford shares to keep pace with the market in the 
year ahead protected from most downside risk by a secure dividend 
that provides an attractive yield 
chrysler patient investors should keep this stock in mind 
although recent earnings comparisons suggest the stock is only 
likely to be an average performer in the year ahead we project 
sharply improved earnings for the company by 19921994 
if it turns out that way the major automakers may have succeeded 
not just in muting the ups and downs of the car market but of the 
stock market too

goin on and great balls of fire 
as for the movie itself lewis said he enjoyed quaids acting but 
didnt give too many points to accuracy this is a movie and it 
needs to be accepted as just a movie 
initially there was talk that quaid who has his own band would 
perform at least some of the songs in the movie lewis had to 
audition to get the job 
all the way on the plane he was saying this is ridiculous 
jerry lee auditioning for himself but he pulled it off great 
said his former manager jerry schilling 
schilling is also creative projects manager for the graceland 
division of elvis presley enterprises he and lewis parted this year 
after lewis was quoted in print as calling presley a dummy who 
wasted his talent 
jerry lee says some things that can be very damaging a lot of 
times hes striking out at himself schilling said 
lewis wants to record again if he can do it his way 
with his pumpin piano and wild stage antics lewis was at the 
top of the rock world in the late 1950s 
presley then the undisputed king of rock n roll had been 
drafted into the army and lewis was regarded as a possible 
contender for presleys crown but his rocket to fame launched by 
records cut at the old sun studio in memphis was deflected by a 
scandal over his marriage to 13yearold cousin myra brown 
it totally destroyed his career said the former mrs lewis 
now myra williams he went from making 10000 a night to 200 a 
night thats starvation wages when youre trying to travel on the 
road and pay a band 
lewis then 22 was advised to keep the marriage quiet but he 
insisted on showing off his young bride on a concert tour to 
england lewis knew the marriage would upset people but he didnt 
care the reaction however was stronger than expected it didnt 
quite go like i thought it was going to go he said 
jerry has been headstrong all his life williams said you 
just couldnt tell him anything you couldnt stop him from doing 
anything 
now married to a real estate broker in atlanta williams wrote 
the book on which the movie is based 
at 53 lewis has been on the road all of his life sometimes 
playing 200 or more dates a year and though hes had long dry 
spells between records and often found himself snarled by tangled 
finances and business squabbles his stage show has kept its fire 
his recording career which peaked in the 1950s blossomed again 
in the late 70s with such country hits as middleage crazy and 
im gonna find it where i can he did well in the early 80s 
with 39 and holding and over the rainbow then took a break 
from recording to concentrate on live shows 
i just got so tired and bogged down with that country style 
slowsinging beerdrinking type music i just had to kind of get 
out of it he said its great music dont get me wrong but i 
like to rock n roll 
lewis has made hundreds of thousands of dollars over his career 
but he likes his money in cash and has tastes that run to flashy 
jewelry and fancy cars rather than ledger books he filed for 
bankruptcy last year and hasnt had a hit record in quite a while 
he told the bankruptcy court he will make about 200000 from 
great balls of fire 
dogged by the internal revenue service hes had trouble getting 
concert dates the worst may be over thanks to the movie and to 
efforts begun in 1987 to clean up his image with promoters 
lewis recently completed a threeweek stint in las vegas and 
headlined two large concerts in california and colorado but those 
jobs would have been closed to him two years ago 
i tried to get him in las vegas for six months and they 
literally laughed at me schilling said evidently there was 
some bad past history with jerry lee in vegas

a plan to keep palestinian day 
laborers in a fencedin compound while they wait to be hired in 
petah tikva has fueled debate over the wisdom and morality of using 
arabs to work in israel 
critics of restrictions on arab laborers say the practice is 
similar to what nazis did to jews in germany but proponents 
maintain that after 18 months of a violent palestinian uprising in 
the west bank and gaza strip restrictions are necessary for safety 
and security 
caught in the middle are the arabs who usually work as 
construction laborers street cleaners garbage collectors and at 
other menial jobs and their employers who pay them about half what 
israeli workers would have to be paid 
in the west bank settlement of ariel officials backed down from 
a plan to make the arabs wear tags labeling them alien workers 
after critics compared them to the yellow stars of david that jews 
were forced to wear in nazi germany 
when the town council in petah tikva a city of 150000 six miles 
east of tel aviv approved the holding area for arab workers in may 
some israeli newspapers said it amounted to a temporary prison 
the original plan called for a fencedin holding pen where arab 
workers would be required to show their identity cards and wait to 
be hired 
but after the public outcry the town decided to do away with 
plans for the fence and a legal requirement that workers wait inside 
instead a metalframe shelter with a green plastic roof was 
erected over three park benches a portable toilet was put up 
nearby on one recent day the shelter was empty and several arab 
workers waited at a corner about 100 yards away 
people are afraid to go to the shelter said one of the 
workers identifying himself as only as faisal they are afraid of 
the police or of citizens here who might plant bombs or shoot guns 
at us 
avraham oren a petah tikva town council member who opposes the 
shelter said it would probably never be used because of the 
controversy it has caused 
this idea that it is possible to put people in pens is like 
segregation of the races he said 
but council spokesman shuki yelin defended the shelter saying it 
was meant to ease fears by jewish parents that their children might 
be attacked by arabs on the streets 
we built it because many jewish citizens protested and sent 
petitions saying they are suffering because of the presence of the 
arabs near their houses yelin said 
its not racist we know we are criticized but its not a 
jail we dont force them to go its an open place 
similarly expressed fears have been behind other moves to 
restrict arab workers 
mayor zvi zilker of the southern israeli town of ashdod 
temporarily barred all palestinian laborers recently after a soldier 
was killed nearby and another disappeared and was believed 
kidnapped police said they suspected palestinians from the gaza 
strip in both cases 
after the attacks on soldiers the israeli government also began 
requiring gaza arabs to obtain new work permits and restricting 
those with records of crime or security offenses 
but rightwing calls for barring all arab workers from israel 
have brought an outcry from employers who depend on them 
the issue has opened up a debate that touches not only israels 
economy but also many israelis vision of their country as a bulwark 
of jewish morality that does not condone exploiting the arabs 
professor ehpraim yuchtmanyaar a social psychologist at tel 
aviv university says israelis are torn between dependence on arab 
workers and guilt over their treatment 
people recognize the labor is vital for the israeli economy 
he said they are doing lowstatus jobs that israelis prefer not 
to do but morally many israelis feel the arabs should be treated 
equally to jewish workers because they are not it is 
exploitation and should be denounced 
moshe semyonov a tel aviv university sociologist says the 
segregation of arabs is being fostered by a curious alliance between 
rightwing israelis and traditionalists who see the use of arab 
labor crushing their dream of an israel built by jews 
people on both ends of the political spectrum are against 
depending on arabs one out of antagonism the other for humanistic 
or moral reasons semyonov said

early in 1988 a letter composed by four israeli 
writers appeared in the new york times urging american jews to speak 
out against israels violent crackdown of palestinian protesters in 
the west bank and gaza strip 
one of the writers was ab yehoshua whose novels include a 
late divorce and the recently released five seasons 
doubleday 1995 yehoshua amos oz yehuda amichai and other 
israeli writers uphold a tradition of active participation in their 
countrys politics zionism or jewish statehood they note was 
created by a writer theodor herzl 
the main figures of the first zionist congress were writers 
said yehoshua professor of literature at haifa university by 
their imagination they understood what was going to happen to the 
jewish people 
avraham bulli yehoshua was born in jerusalem in 1936 at a time 
when the city was part of britishcontrolled palestine when he was 
12 years old israel was granted independence and won a fierce war 
with arabs for possession of the land 
i remember always sitting under the shelters and being without 
food i remember the fighting the shelling the bullets i was 
worried about my father who was working in the secret service 
listening to the arabs telephone calls he said 
he didnt originally want to be a writer dreaming instead about 
a legal career but as a teenager yehoshua joined a youth group 
and impressed his peers with humorous pieces about local events he 
continued to write while serving in the army 
i was writing about things in the unit creating absurd 
situations in a very fantastic kind of style describing what was 
inside the camp this was the idea absurd stories fantastic 
stories 
his first published work a short story about a dying man was 
also an absurdist piece 
hes still alive but the old woman decides to bury him alive 
to get rid of him yehoshua said about the work the neighbors 
are participating in this live burial and im writing about how 
this can be achieved 
yehoshua soon became influenced by the works of william faulkner 
admiring the great southern writers streamofconsciousness prose 
and blending of myth and reality 
the use of myth is important for an israeli writer we dont 
have a long history as an independent country so you have to relate 
yourself to some myth yehoshua said israel has changed so 
radically its unbelieveable 
a selfdescribed dove who favors talks between israel and the 
palestine liberation organization and eventual palestinian 
selfdetermination recalled a short story he had written in 1962 
a student is sent to a forest because he didnt finish his 
studies and his friends are advising him to finish his thesis so 
hes sent to a forest theres an arab in the distance planning to 
set fire to the forest because it was built on his village finally 
the forest is set on fire 
in 1962 it was an indication that the palestinian problem was 
being repressed the palestinian problem has been coming expecially 
in the last year its a sign that the israelis have to realize the 
limits of zionism 
politics are not mentioned directly in five seasons which 
chronicles the difficulties of a middleaged government bureaucrat 
molkho in adjusting to the death of his wife who succumbs to 
cancer at the start of the novel 
molkho anxiously seeks companionship flying to berlin for a 
weekend with the legal adviser from work and spending time with the 
wife of his old youth group counselor who has encouraged the 
meeting but molkho is unable to connect with either woman as the 
grief over his late wife makes him alternately abrupt and distant 
incapable of understanding their feelings 
my point in this book is that this was the year molkho thinks 
hell be free yehoshua said without believing in ghosts he 
interiorizes his wife in such a way that shes still alive after her 
death and this is the way he has to struggle until then hes 
liberated 
where a late divorce showed faulkners unmistakable 
influence yehoshuas writing in five seasons is in keeping with 
his main character restrained introverted and obsessed with minor 
details 
it had to be much more subtle the author said when you 
are writing streamofconsciousness everything has to get out with 
this theres what you say and what you dont say theres a gap 
between the two in a way i was returning to the style of my short 
stories 
in one passage yehoshua describes molkhos thoughts while 
attending a dinner party given by the legal adviser 
the conversation rambled intimately though he had prepared a 
few subjects to talk about especially several of a legal nature he 
saw at once that he neednt make the effort for everyone appeared 
harmoniously acquainted and he it seemed was passed back and forth 
among them in a discreet and unaffected fashion 
afraid of being suspected of some organic problem if he went to 
the toilet too soon he sat with his legs together to ease the 
pressure on his bladder while one by one the men came up to him 
introducing themselves once again 
yehoshua is a strong critic of the diaspora the dispersion of 
jews around the world stating that the failure of jewish people to 
return to their homeland presents a greater threat than the arabs to 
israels national security yet in the final chapter of five 
seasons molkho helps an unhappy russianborn girl return to her 
home country 
it was a healthy thing for her to do yehoshua explained i 
dont tell you to stay you have to feel natural by understanding 
the russians feelings molkho can better understand himself and 
demonstrate his belonging to the country

homeowners increasingly have been refinancing 
their mortgages as interest rates drop and adjustablerate home 
loans lose some of their luster according to those in the industry 
were seeing a rash of these variable rate loans coming for 
refinancing to a fixed rate even some where their current arm 
rate is lower said angelo mozilo president of countrywide 
funding corp in pasadena calif one of the nations largest 
mortgage lending companies 
and were getting inquiries by the thousands he said 
monday 
mortgage rates particularly on conventional fixedrate loans 
have declined steadily in recent weeks as market interest rates 
dropped amid continued signs the economy and inflation are cooling 
in the past month more and more lenders have dropped their 
30year conventional mortgage rates to below 10 percent for the 
first time in about 16 months 
hsh associates a butler njbased mortgage reserach firm said 
105 percent of the 2000 mortgage lenders surveyed last week 
dropped their fixed rates to 9 percent to 99 percent compared with 
about two dozen at the end of may 
the national average for 30year loans was 103 percent while 
the average for oneyear arms was 9 percent the survey said 
some lenders say the drop in interest rates has helped spur 
interest in new and existing homes lately 
the national association of realtors reported monday that 
existing home sales fell 56 percent to their lowest level in 16 
months however some experts predicted the pace would pick up this 
summer as the full impact of the rate drop was felt 
right now arm holders with rates in the 11 percent to 14 percent 
range have become the first to cash in on the rate decline by 
rushing to lock in lower fixed rates industry experts said 
arms are adjusted up or down at specified intervals to reflect 
prevailing interest rates usually oneyear treasury bills in many 
cases arm rates may be raised by up to 2 percentage points a year 
or 6 percentage points over the life of the loan 
for someone who received a 100000 arm three years ago with a 
75 percent rate the first year of the loan monthly payments would 
total 90278 but payments could rise to 136111 a month this 
year if the rate rose to the maximum 135 percent 
experts say homeowners should consider refinancing if prevailing 
market rates fall at least two percentage points below their 
mortgage rate otherwise with closing costs running anywhere from 3 
to 5 percentage points of the refinanced loan it may not be worth 
it they said 
the rush to refinance appears to be spotty according to experts 
fred koons chairman of chase manhattan corps home mortgage 
division said hes seen a sharp increase in refinancings in 
california where arms are particularly popular he said half of the 
current mortgage applications there were for refinancings 
but ronnie j wynn president of colonial mortgage co of 
montgomery ala said refinancings made up only 15 percent of 
outstanding mortgages compared with 40 percent in 1986 and 1987 
when interest rates were significantly lower 
refinancings are up a little bit but most of the people who had 
interest rates of 12 percent or above where it would be worthwhile 
to refinance refinanced in 86 or 87 wynn said i do think 
well see them refinancings pick up as interest rates fall 
for homeowners with arms that started out with low interest rates 
the first year but headed higher each year as overall interest rates 
rose refinanicng means more than securing a steady rate 
its brought peace of mind for some people said mozilo of 
countrywide where 10 percent of the 800 million are loan 
applications are for refinancings many people were very naive to 
the consequences of these adjustable rate mortgages of course many 
people also couldnt qualify to buy a home without arms

a new generation of supersonic jetliners 
might be built but only if manufacturers can conquer the immense 
environmental technical and economic problems of a plane that would 
fly at twice the speed of sound while costing twice as much as a 
747 a boeing co official says 
this is boeing dreaming said michael henderson manager of 
highspeed commercial transport studies for boeing but its our 
job in new airplane development to protect the future of the company 
about 70 boeing employees has been looking at whether a new 
supersonic transport could be flying within the next 20 years the 
early outlook henderson said monday is that it could be done but 
not easily 
henderson said that mcdonnell douglas corp the only other us 
maker of commercial jets the europeans and the japanese also have 
looked at newgeneration ssts and appear to have reached similar 
conclusions 
we and boeing have been working on parallel paths said 
mcdonnell douglas spokesman keith takahashi in long beach calif 
boeing and mcdonnell douglas each received 45 million from the 
national aeronautics and space administration for a twoyear study 
on the feasibility of a new sst both companies decided to continue 
the research after the study ended last fall 
boeing declined to say how much it has spent so far 
boeing pinned a lot of hopes and a lot of money in the late 1960s 
on building an sst when the government cancelled the program over 
environmental concerns it contributed to the boeing slump that 
plunged seattle its headquarters city into hard times in the early 
1970s 
because of this boeing executives have said they are wary of 
committing the hundreds of millions of dollars it would take to 
build a new sst 
richard albrecht executive vice president of boeings commercial 
airplanes division has said that while the concorde sst has been 
successful as a premium transatlantic service he doubts anyone 
would build nor would airlines buy a plane that must command a 
much higher ticket price to serve a niche market 
the anglofrench concorde began flying passengers in 1976 only 
about a dozen of the sleek jets now fly operated by air france and 
british airways and are severely limited in routes because of noisy 
engines and earrattling sonic boom resulting from it flying about 
twice the speed of sound 
boeing is studying a plane capable of flying 18 to 25 times the 
speed of sound or roughly 1330 to 1850 mph that would permit it 
to fly from los angeles to tokyo in 4 hours 20 minutes compared 
with the 10 hours 20 minutes a nonstop subsonic flight takes today 
boeing doubts a faster plane would be practical because it would 
require new fuels such as liquid natural gas or liquid hydrogen and 
special airport facilities henderson said further a plane that 
could fly 2500 mph or better would have scant time at cruising 
speed on a 5000mile transpacific flight 
boeings fourengine hsct a long languid curve in profile is 
envisioned to be about 293 feet long 60 feet longer than a 747400 
jumbo jet with a wingspan of just 142 feet or 70 feet less than 
the 747400 it would haul 200 to 300 passengers about 5000 
nautical miles nonstop 
the concorde is about 204 feet long with an 84foot wingspan and 
carries 100 to 128 passengers 3360 nautical miles nonstop 
by using engine noise suppressors boeing planners think their 
hsct could meet the governments strict new standards for airport 
noise sonic boom is another matter 
we saw no way and still see no way we could reduce sonic boom 
to acceptable levels over land henderson said 
another environmental worry is possible damage to the ozone 
layer by limiting the plane to under mach 3 or three times the 
speed of sound it could still fly below the ozone layer in the 
troposphere where engine emissions should be dispersed henderson 
said 
the hsct would require some yettobe developed technology 
especially in lightweight composite materials just as critical is 
making the plane economical to fly he said 
boeing estimates air traffic in 2015 will be about 19 million 
passenger miles per day roughly twice what it is now about a third 
of all passengers would be on routes that could be served by an 
hsct henderson said 
the problem he said is that to compete an hsct has to offer a 
ticket price roughly the same as the newer and cheapertooperate 
longrange widebody jets that could be tough he said for a plane 
that probably would cost twice as much as a 747400 which sells for 
about 125 million 
in boeings market research even an optimistic look says that 
if you were to increase the ticket prices by as much as 20 percent 
wed lose over half the market he said

time inc has rejected paramount communications 
incs 122 billion takeover bid noting that the sweetened offer 
is subject to the same unresolved conditions as paramounts earlier 
107 billion proposal 
times board which turned down the revised 200ashare bid 
monday also called the offer financially inadequate and the media 
giant restated its intention to pursue a 14 billion tender offer of 
its own for warner communications inc 
the paramount offer remains as highly conditional and 
conjectural as it was when paramount started it nearly three weeks 
ago time said in a statement monday 
paramount has conditioned its buyout on being able to obtain 
financing for the deal which it did not accomplish while its 
earlier 175ashare bid was on the table and on obtaining the 
rights to operate about 800 cable television systems time owns the 
bid is also contingent upon the termination of times merger 
agreement with warner 
time which has focused on these conditions in its campaign 
against paramount claims they will prevent the paramount bid from 
being completed and has urged its shareholders not to be tempted by 
the size of the offer 
its not just the question of price time vice chairman jerry 
levin said in a telephone interview monday 
paramount was undaunted by the latest rejection we will 
continue to pursue our acquisition of time in a calm studied and 
deliberate manner it said in a statement 
time announced its rejection of the paramount bid after the close 
of trading on the new york stock exchange 
time stock seesawed in nervous trading as investors awaited the 
boards response rising as high as 17225 a share before closing 
at 164 a share down 187 from fridays close 
securities analysts had expected time to reject any sweetened bid 
however observers said they did not expect paramount to raise 
its offer again and levin indicated the company expected the 
takeover struggle to be resolved in delaware chancery court where 
paramount has sued to block times planned 70ashare buyout of 
warner 
a key issue before the court in delaware where all three 
companies are incorporated is whether time put itself up for sale 
thereby opening itself up to the bid from paramount when it 
announced its merger agreement with warner in march 
time and warner originally agreed to merge in a stockforstock 
transaction but revised their merger agreement to provide for times 
tender offer after paramount announced its first bid on june 6 
paramount contends that times tender offer for warner was begun 
solely as a defense against the paramount bid 
i just believe that when the court looks at these issues that 
theres a fairly persuasive case that we have a transaction that has 
not been done defensively levin said its something weve 
studied for so long 
when they announced their plans to merge time and warner said 
they had been negotiating over two years 
time stated that its board based its unanimous rejection of the 
paramount bid partly on the opinions of its financial advisers 
wasserstein perella amp co and shearson lehman hutton inc that the 
offer was inadequate 
paramounts original offer of 175 was absurdly low time 
chairman j richard munro stated paramounts revised offer has 
not changed the conclusion of our management and board that the 
acquisition of warner by time is in the best interests of time and 
its stockholders 
meanwhile speculation continued on wall street that paramount 
itself might be the target of a hostile bid investors bid paramount 
stock up 237 a share to 6037 monday 
warner stock was up 25 cents a share to 5887 
also monday two large time shareholders robert m bass limited 
partners and a partnership of the cablevision systems corp and 
jerry perenchio filed suit in delaware chancery court seeking to 
block times annual meeting scheduled for friday 
bass and the cablevisionperenchio group have been mentioned as 
possible bidders for some of times assets the new york times 
reported in tuesdays editions

eastern airlines and its pilots union are 
negotiating under court supervision over the strikebound companys 
attempt to cancel the pilots contract and impose wage concessions 
the air line pilots association and eastern were to meet for a 
second day today after mondays first session ordered by us 
bankruptcy judge burton r lifland produced nothing fruitful 
said a union spokesman 
the meeting was the first between eastern and alpa since the 
airline last week sought court permission to cancel its contract 
with the pilots the two sides met at the offices of david i 
shapiro the courtappointed examiner overseeing the airline on 
behalf of the bankruptcy court 
alpa spokesman dan ashby said mondays meeting was mainly a 
feelingout process a discussion of basic issues eastern 
declined comment 
other alpa officials said they did not expect eastern to offer 
the jobsecurity provisions the union says would be necessary for an 
agreement 
most of easterns pilots and flight attendants have been honoring 
the pickets of the international association of machinists since the 
machinists began their strike march 4 forcing the carrier to 
sharply cut back the number of its flights 
a house subcommittee plans this week to examine the impact of the 
nearly fourmonthold strike and a senate panel has asked the 
general accounting office to assess the impact of easterns proposed 
reorganization on the airline industry 
six senators also are asking transportation secretary samuel 
skinner to block eastern at least temporarily from selling more 
assets as part of the airlines reorganization plan 
eastern last week asked the bankruptcy judge for permission to 
impose about 50 million in wage and benefit concessions as well as 
changes in work policies that would allow eastern to increase 
pilots hours 
eastern said it needed contract concessions from the pilots as 
part of its plan to reorganize and emerge from chapter 11 bankruptcy 
protections as a smaller carrier 
a consultant to the pilots union said over the weekend that 
shapiro would oppose easterns bid to terminate the contract 
shapiro did not return calls seeking comment monday and eastern said 
it wasnt aware of shapiros position 
the unions contend eastern and its parent company texas air 
corp are trying to use the bankruptcy court to destroy easterns 
unions 
lifland would have to approve easterns reorganization plan 
which includes major asset sales the unions have unsuccessfully 
sought the sale of eastern 
lifland said three weeks ago the court would no longer consider 
the buyout offer of chicago commodities trader joseph ritchie 
although he said ritchie was free to pursue his offer with eastern 
on capitol hill the senate committee on commerce science and 
transportation has requested the gao investigation saying in a 
letter that its review should examine whether the proposed 
business plan of eastern has any realistic prospect of revitalizing 
the carrier 
in a separate letter to skinner six senators called on the 
transportation secretary to seek a delay in additional sales that 
could further erode the competitive base in the airline industry 
the senators specifically cited easterns reported plan to sell 
its south american routes 
the senators who wrote to skinner were democrats frank r 
lautenberg of new jersey wendell h ford of kentucky bob graham of 
florida daniel patrick moynihan of new york john f kerry of 
massachusetts and republican alfonse m damato of new york

european economic community leaders today 
agreed on a compromise plan for gradually unifying their economies 
after britain succeeded in blocking attempts to create a single 
currency and a central bank 
we have conceded nothing at all british prime minister 
margaret thatcher said at the end of a twoday summit 
however france and west germany which were aligned against 
britain in the dispute over broad plans to unify the economies also 
declared themselves pleased with the compromise pact 
closer monetary union is part of the eecs drive toward december 
1992 when the member nations will drop trade barriers to form a 
single market 
west german chancellor helmut kohl said the agreement at the end 
of a twoday eec summit was a superb result 
the foundation has been laid for a development that brings the 
eec further together and brings political union one step nearer 
kohl told reporters 
the 12 eec leaders have been divided over how far and how fast to 
go toward closer economic and monetary union as part of the 
establishment of a single europewide market in 1992 
in a final communique the leaders endorsed only part of a 
sweeping plan for monetary union drawn up by jacques delors head of 
the eecs executive body the european commission 
the communique avoided setting any deadline on the more 
controversial aspects of the plan creating a single currency and a 
central bank but it did provide for the calling of the 
intergovernmental conference on those proposals something mrs 
thatcher had sought to avoid 
french president francois mitterrand said he would call an 
intergovernmental conference after next year the conference can be 
called by a simple majority but once there any member nation could 
then veto the changes 
britain also agreed in principle to link the pound to the 
exchange rate mechanism that aligns the value of the eecs major 
currencies 
but mrs thatcher hedged the move which she has long resisted 
with strict conditions these included that britains 83 percent 
inflation must drop to near the 45 percent average in the eec and 
that arrangements for the single market must be complete 
besides britain some smaller eec nations including the 
netherlands luxembourg and portugal have also expressed 
reservations about the delors plan 
mitterrand and mrs thatcher clashed repeatedly during the summit 
behind closed doors officials reported and jibed publicly at each 
other afterward 
each claimed that it was the other who was the other who had been 
most isolated at the conference 
it was not me who was isolated said mrs thatcher it was 
president mitterrand 
mitterrand agreed with a french radio interviewer that mrs 
thatcher was the brake on europe 
she retorted at a news conference its a bit rich isnt it 
someone who has not got freedom of capital movement calling me a 
brake on europe he has scarcely got into the car 
mrs thatcher adopting a more conciliatory manner than usual at 
this summit agreed monday to support in principle the linking of 
the british pound to a system that aligns the major eec currencies 
mrs thatcher rejects full monetary integration as surrendering 
to the eec national policymaking powers on budgetary and other 
financial matters 
mitterrand conference said he was very satisfied with the 
summit 
asked if he was angry about mrs thatchers resistance to the 
delors plan which he strongly favored he said one should not 
confuse a certain firmness with anger he added smiling i am 
used to her shes very nice

ual corps stock soared more than 7 a share this

a federal judge today ordered nearly 
43000 coal miners in nine states to end a wildcat strike and go 
back to work 
us district judge dennis knapp issued the indefinite 
restraining order against the united mine workers at the request of 
the national labor relations board 
the nearly 43000 miners walked out in support of 1900 umw 
members who have been on strike against pittston coal group since 
april 5 
umw vice president joe corcoran in washington did not immediately 
return a telephone call 
miners have ignored previous restraining orders and remained off 
the job 
knapp said union officials must report to the nlrb within 10 days 
on what steps they have taken to meet the court order 
the judge could have restricted the backtowork order to west 
virginia and parts of virginia kentucky and ohio but instead made 
it nationwide ordering that it apply to all coal companies with 
whom the umw has contracts 
about 1600 umw miners in virginia and west virginia went on 
strike against pittston on april 5 after working 14 months without a 
contract they were joined by 300 pittston miners in kentucky 
earlier this month 
that strike spurred wildcat sympathy walkouts beginning june 12 
in appalachia and the midwest at one point 46000 miners in 
missouri west virginia alabama illinois indiana kentucky ohio 
pennsylvania tennessee and virginia were off the job missouris 
miners went back to work on monday 
most of the nations union miners began their twoweek vacations 
this week and the coal fields have been relatively quiet since the 
weekend 
on monday a second attempt by gov gaston caperton to mediate in 
the 11weekold pittston walkout fell short when pittston chairman 
paul douglas declined to say whether he would meet with umw 
president richard trumka 
caperton had invited douglas and trumka last week to meet at the 
governors mansion 
but caperton attached several conditions unacceptable to douglas 
including asking that pittston not use other coal companies to fill 
its orders and that other companies suspend any lawsuits against the 
umw over the strikes 
the governors latest offer contained no conditions

there are more than balmy breezes 
blowing from the south 
hundreds of sweettalking scam operators are working the 
telephones to con victims out of a few hundred dollars or in some 
cases their life savings 
investigators estimate 90 percent of all the major boiler 
room telemarketing schemes in the nation are based in either south 
florida or southern california with affluent orange county calif 
dethroning fort lauderdale several years ago as the countrys scam 
capital 
the pitches are limited only by the imagination from oil wells 
to medical breakthroughs worm ranches to lowcost precious metals 
and rope in nearly 1 billion annually according to the federal 
trade commission 
officials say the best salesmen can mold a lump of truth into a 
monument of credibility and disguise a sham as a onceinalifetime 
deal 
these boiler room guys like life in the fast lane the yachts 
the fancy cars the sunshine said kent neal head of the broward 
county economic crime unit based in fort lauderdale south florida 
and southern california offer the kind of lifestyle they want 
scam artists also like southern climes for their transient 
populations and ready pools of pitchmen 
some of the ads they run specifically target struggling actors 
or musicians said david katz coordinator of the southern 
california fraud task force based in los angeles in an way its 
like an acting job they try to give the pitch as sincerely and 
convincingly as possible too many times it works 
tougher state laws and more aggressive enforcement have driven 
many boiler room operators from the fort lauderdale area but neal 
estimates about 80 large telemarketing fraud operations still carry 
on from miami to palm beach katz said at least 150 boiler rooms 
have staked out southern california with most centered around 
newport beach 
the boiler rooms ability to survive is partially due to lack of 
coordination betwen federal and state law enforcement agencies and 
the con artists nomadic instincts say investigators 
when the law gets too close they pack up shop and begin 
again said deputy state attorney albert sheldon a boiler room 
specialist based in san diego 
the first telephone scams began in south florida in the 1920s 
when salesmen would pitch mosquitoinfested swampland as prime 
property the boiler rooms so called for their typically spartan 
surroundings did not flourish again until the 1970s this time 
surebet oil and gas fields and inexpensive gems and gold dominated 
the pitches said neal 
one of neals favorite souvenirs from the early 80s heyday of 
south florida boiler rooms is a piece of wood carved and painted to 
resemble a gold bar it was found with others in the vaults of 
international gold bullion exchange one of the boldest and most 
notorious fraud scams on record 
from unusually swank offices in a fort lauderdale skyscraper 
topped with the igbe logo principals william and james alderdice 
reportedly made 75 million on fraudulent sales of gold silver and 
platinum to 13000 investors many reassured by igbe ads in the wall 
street journal some igbe salesmen earned 8000 a week and the 
alderdices were known to toss 100 bills from their stretch 
limousine and watch folks scramble for the cash 
neals successful prosecution of igbe in 1985 was the first major 
boiler room case in south florida and is credited with beginning the 
crackdown that drove many to california william alderdice was 
hacked to death by his chauffeur before the trial began and his 
brother received a 10year federal and a sixyear state sentence 
we are an equal opportunity agency we prosecute anyone we 
have doctors lawyers and indian chiefs neal said pointing to a 
photo of bernard kabrahrah a former comanche tribal leader who 
became involved in a 40 million scam to sell rights to 
nonproducing natural gas wells in oklahoma 
and the victims known as mooches or mullets in boilerroom 
parlance are just as varied 
its no longer just the retirees getting burned yuppies with 
money to spend are becoming the new targets said neal 
some emerging scams include bogus job search agencies travel 
club ripoffs and touting lowpriced penny stocks according to 
the alliance against fraud in telemarketing a watchdog group neal 
has also noticed organized crime taking an interest in boiler rooms 
in april the securities and exchange commission charged the 
nations largest penny stock dealer stuartjames co inc of 
denver with defrauding clients at its boca raton office by making 
exaggerated claims about companies a good boiler room salesman is 
like a chameleon said neal if you are religious suddenly they 
are bornagain if you have kids they are suddenly the concerned 
parent they tell you what you want to hear 
in southern california scams involving vitamins and prize 
contests are hot say investigators 
the boiler rooms hook customers with a postcard saying they have 
won a valuable prize sometimes cash a car or jewelry the catch 
is that the customers must also purchase a supply of vitamins or 
some other item often the vitamins or prize are never delivered or 
they are grossly inferior to the product described by the yaks 
or boiler room salesmen 
yet local agencies are often slow to crack down said katz 
the cops here are dealing with drug traffic gang violence and 
all sorts of other things said katz whose office has prosecuted 
300 people since 1986 
some areas such as clark county nev have discouraged boiler 
rooms by requiring costly bonds for each company and every employee 
of a telemarking firm 
california began registration of telemarketing firms in january 
1987 and operators face a maximum penalty of one year in prison and 
a 10000 fine for failing to comply 
florida adopted tough boilerroom laws in october 1986 including 
making schemes involving more than 50000 in losses a firstdegree 
felony punishable by up to 30 years in prison in 1987 gary fox was 
convicted of swindling 11 million from 4000 investors in his 
united precious metals firm and was sentenced to 585 years in 
prison believed to be the longest whitecollar crime sentence 
neal has one letter he cant forget it came in early 1987 from 
samuel kaminsky of hazleton pa who lost 70000 in mostly 
borrowed money in the united precious metals scam 
i feel foolish and unable to make decisions i always feel as 
though i will make another devastating mistake wrote kaminsky 
these letters tear me up said neal when a guy robs you on 
the street at least he is up front and only takes what is in your 
pocket with telemarketing scams they dont just take whats in 
your pocket but everything else you own you can make more money 
but its the emotional impact you may never recover from

mobil corp and the chemical 
workers industrial union reached an agreement tuesday on most 
elements of the oil concerns withdrawal from south africa the 
union announced 
two issues remain to be worked out in meetings next month but 
otherwise the union won most of its demands the group said in a 
statement 
mobil spokesman mike morgan in new york said the company would 
not comment on any possible accord 
mobil announced on april 28 that it was withdrawing from the 
racially divided nation and selling holdings once valued at 400 
million to general mining union corp ltd a south african 
conglomerate for more than 155 million in cash and 10 million 
that was expected to be the operations 1989 profit 
the company which blamed us foreign policy for forcing the 
pullout said it would record a net book loss of 140 million on the 
sale after adjustments for taxes and accounting 
the chemical workers union threatened to strike accusing mobil 
of lying about its intentions to leave and demanding a series of 
concessions the union represents 1200 of mobils 1500 black 
workers 
tuesdays agreement honors labor contracts and provides job 
security with the new owner as well as details of the disinvestment 
the union said 
the one vital piece of information still to be provided the 
union said was whether mobil would continue to supply crude oil to 
south africa after gencors subsidiary trek takes over mobils 
assets june 30 
mobil chairman allen e murray said in april that mobil would not 
export crude or products to south africa 
the union said this and details of a trust fund would be 
negotiated with a senior us representative from mobil next month 
the union regards the progress made so far as a major advance 
in its campaign for a fair disinvestment procedure there is still a 
considerable way to go but within the constraints of mobils failure 
to give notice progress has been made the union statement 
said 
mobil had operated in south africa for 90 years and was the 
largest us company doing business there with almost 2800 
employees 
its decision to withdraw followed months of denials that it would 
follow exxon corp who left in 1986 and about 170 other american 
companies in bowing to pressure to disinvest in south africa because 
of the countrys apartheid racial policy 
some major oil exporters claim to observe an embargo on doing 
business in south africa but the absence of any petroleum shortages 
has raised questions about whether and how their products are 
funneled into the country 
militant black unions joined other antiapartheid groups in 
demanding sanctions and disinvestment by foreign companies during 
widespread political unrest in 1985 and 1986 but since then have 
cooled their public rhetoric on the subject critics of the union 
position say the pullouts by major firms hurt black workers as well 
as hardening the attitudes of whites 
mobil said earlier that all contract and equal employment 
policies would remain in effect under the new owners and the company 
would continue until at least 1994 to fund a foundation that 
supports various social programs in south africa

mongolian cashmere sweaters hang from 
bloomingdales racks and general electric still hopes to sell china 
its locomotives but the 14 billion trade relationship between the 
united states and the peoples republic has been damaged after years 
of patient nurturing 
in the wake of the tiananmen square massacre and subsequent 
string of executions experts point to pockets of vulnerability 
among us companies working with china as well as a decline in 
chinese imports 
it wont be because americans dont want to buy but delivery 
and reliability will be perceived widely as going down and that 
will affect orders irrespective of whether its true said david 
m lampton president of the national committee on united 
stateschina relations 
china had replaced other pacific rim nations as a lowcost 
producer of everything from clothing to luggage to tents while 
steadily improving productivity and quality as workers became more 
motivated 
the problem is going to be whether the work force will continue 
to be as productive lampton said as chinese workers and managers 
become more fearful of associating with foreigners 
communications are snarled we dont know if longshoremen will 
load ships on time and american importers just may not want to 
deal with those uncertainties he noted 
without chinese imports americans would pay more for nike 
running shoes silk blouses and painted porcelain bowls 
experts say toy and game importers who already are stocking up 
ahead of the christmas shopping season are scrambling to line up 
suppliers in other lowcost nations like thailand and mexico last 
year china exported 117 billion worth of toys and games to the 
united states 
on the flip side midwest farmers would take a beating if their 
exports were curtailed last year they shipped to china about 700 
million in wheat the largest us export to the peoples republic 
according to the commerce department 
computer makers could lose a 150 millionplus outlet for their 
goods 
military suppliers already are bearing the brunt of a 
presidential decree prohibiting further sales to china grumman 
corp said earlier this month it would eliminate 250 jobs associated 
with a 500 million us air force contract to develop and modernize 
a weapons control system for chinese fighters 
us companies that sell products like powergenerating equipment 
to the chinese goverment could face trouble because china is going 
to have a foreign exchange shortage said roger sullivan 
president of the uschina business council 
theyve taken a big hit on their balance of payments they 
cant buy what they thought they would buy and theyre going to 
have to cut imports he said 
roughly 80 percent of us companies investment in china lies in 
industries that manufacture goods for the domestic market sullivan 
said plans for expanding those operations are evaporating rapidly 
but most us businesses are not likely to suffer substantially 
while they have committed 34 billion to joint ventures in china 
each firms individual exposure is limited 
general electric co for example sold 500 million of 
locomotives aircraft engines and medical systems to china over the 
last five years but the number pales in comparison with ges annual 
revenue of 50 billion 
and ball corp a 11 billion muncie ind container maker has 
spent just 2 million since 1987 on its joint containermaking 
venture in china 
from our perspective its a very small percentage of sales 
said ball spokesman brad wilks 
still companies do not want to mothball their china operations 
its clearly not because of the money sullian said its the 
effort theyve spent five or six years building a relationship 
for businesses the attraction is formidable china looms as the 
fastest growing economy in the world with a gross national product 
that has mushroomed at more than 10 percent a year 
as a market for consumer goods china is virtually untapped the 
nations 11 billion population is a solid reason companies are 
reluctant to just bag it you cant just write off 25 perent of the 
globe one china watcher said 
while most us companies are taking a waitandsee approach a 
few have found opportunity in the crisis jack shamash president of 
the new yorkbased trading company shamash amp sons inc said he has 
been snapping up chinesemade products ranging from silks to nails 
now that shamashs competitors are skittish about buying prices 
of chinesemade goods are lower and the goods are more abundant 
the us embassy in beijing said some american staff of the 175 
us companies operating out of the chinese capital are returning 
despite a travel advisory and the embassys counsel against it 
the chinese government is pulling out all the stops to lure 
businessmen back even as it simultaneously wages a media campaign 
against the us government for alleged interference 
american companies are being bombarded with longsought 
concessions from the chinese government and atypical promises of 
prompt payment 
governmentowned noble tower a modern beijing building that 
houses foreign companies sent faxes to every tenant asking them 
to come back and that everything is peaceful said one american 
tenant 
but businesses are wary that they may become pawns in chinas 
powerful propaganda game 
we dont want to be in a position where were manipulated and 
paraded in front of cameramen said ball corps wilks

the wheat market led grain and soybean futures 
prices to a sharply higher close tuesday on the chicago board of 
trade reflecting ideas that the soviet union is seeking to buy more 
us wheat 
the rally drove wheat futures to their highest level since 
midmay and erased most of mondays steep losses in the corn 
soybean and oat markets 
unlike the other grains wheat futures had risen monday on signs 
that the soviets had bought up to 500000 metric tons of us wheat 
at market prices an indication that they had an immediate need for 
the grain 
tuesdays rally was fueled by speculation that the soviets would 
be back for more wheat and by reports of raininduced harvest delays 
in the central and southern states where soft red winter wheat the 
variety reportedly sought by the soviets is grown 
there are also a lot of quality concerns in the soft red wheat 
which makes largescale buying particularly bullish said 
katharina zimmer a grainmarket analyst with merrill lynch capital 
markets inc in new york 
at the close of trading wheat was cent to 10 cents higher 
with the contract for delivery in july at 412 a bushel corn was 
3 cents to 4 cents higher with july at 262 a bushel oats were 
4 cents to 5 cents higher with july at 153 a bushel soybeans 
were 4 cents to 13 cents higher with july at 740 a bushel

thirty years ago ed beauvais left an 
accounting job at a steel company for one in the airline industry 
that offered 15 more a month today he operates the nations 
10thlargest airline 
america west is a prototype of successful companies in the 1980s 
slick opportunistic oriented to employees needs a child of 
deregulation the 6yearold airline made 10 million last quarter 
while some other carriers waded in red ink it projects a 30 
million profit this year 
while metal fatigue made headlines last year in the wake of fatal 
accidents america west fielded a fleet of 74 aircraft mostly 
boeing 737s and 757s averaging only 56 years old 
we have a very good market niche and weve always been 
adequately financed and our people are extremely productive 
beauvais says you have to have all these elements in place or you 
cannot deal with the significantly competitive atmosphere that we 
have 
america west recently failed in its most ambitious undertaking 
an attempt to buy eastern airlines northeast shuttle out from under 
developer donald trump despite offering 50 million more than 
trump 
but beauvais the 52yearold chairman and chief executive whose 
swashbuckling image is stamped on his airline didnt get where he 
is by putting his eggs in one basket 
america west has applied for federal approval to start flights to 
sydney australia and tokyo and is constantly on the lookout for 
opportunities to expand into other markets 
america west succeeds primarily because of strong leadership 
said james carey a senior vice president with airline economics 
inc which publishes airline quarterly in washington 
they have proven to be able to make adjustments to their 
operating strategies as the marketplace requires carey said 
i do like the fundamentals of the company said paul karos a 
financial airline analyst for first boston corp in new york they 
clearly are well into a turnaround 
for its first five years america west averaged about 65 percent 
annual growth in carrying capacity but lost money in all but one 
year karos said in 1988 he said the company began to slow its 
growth in seatmiles to focus on profitability 
it posted a profit in the second quarter of 1988 and has been 
profitable each quarter since then 
they changed their operating strategy carey said they 
actually changed from their emphasis on longhaul operations and 
reemphasized the feeder services through phoenix and have improved 
their profitability because of that revenue growth 
carey said transpacific air service is growing at a higher rate 
than travel to europe and is almost triple domestic growth 
beauvais said america west was serious about buying the shuttle 
but ran out of time to come up with the financing the airline is 
going ahead with expansion of service to the east coast through 
washingtons national airport and new yorks laguardia via landing 
slots acquired in may 
america west needs approval from the us department of 
transportation and the japanese government before it can start 
service to japan and australia 
deregulation provided opportunity but also unprecedented 
competition and most of the new entrants failed 
theres not many survivors beauvais said he is one of them 
the colorado native entered the industry in 1960 as an accountant 
for frontier airlines and moved through jobs in las vegas phoenix 
san francisco and washington 
in 1981 while in phoenix for a second time he linked up with 
current company president mike conway who had quit as a vice 
president of continental airlines 
by 1983 beauvais conway and five others had raised 20 million 
through public stock offerings and bank financing and were ready to 
fly 
the company started service aug 1 of that year with 280 
employees and three boeing 737s serving four points between los 
angeles and kansas city mo today america west has 8800 
employees and serves 47 cities 
beauvais said he chose the phoenix area because no carrier 
dominated the region 
other airlines failed to see the opportunity he said the 
timing was right to build a hubandspoke system 
two constants of the airlines history have been its original 
marketing slogan less fare more care and managements 
willingness to bend over backward to keep its employees from union 
afflilation 
america west offered more care through assigned seating 
complimentary beverages and free copies of the wall street journal 
and usa today after some complaints about late flights the carrier 
recovered and ranks first in ontime operations for the period since 
the department of transportation began keeping figures in 1987 
america west employees are stockholders who participate in a 
profitsharing program employees move around working as a flight 
attendant one day and taking reservations or doing ramp duties the 
next 
its helped america west be extremely productive and given 
individuals very good professional atmosphere beauvais said 
the practices apparently convinced employees to reject two unions 
in elections this year and keep their airline the nations largest 
without any unionized employees continental airlines is largely 
nonunionized but has a weak flight attendants union 
beauvais secondfloor office is directly beneath the flight 
paths into and out of phoenix sky harbor international airport 
allowing the chief executive officer the opportunity to watch his 
planes land and take off 
i dont regret a moment of it he said id never work in 
any other industry

the retailer to more easily pursue its intention to concentrate on 
its department store and shoe businesses 
the divestiture of caldor and venture will allow may to focus 
on the operations and expansion of our higherreturn and 
fastergrowing businesses said david c farrell may chairman 
and chief executive officer 
may one of the largest retailers in the country and owner of 
lord amp taylor hechts sibleys plus other department stores and 
specialty shoe chains said it anticipates using a significant 
portion of the proceeds from a possible sale to buy back its stock 
the remainder of any proceeds would be spent on general corporate 
purposes including investment in the department store operations 
and shoe businesses the company said in a news release 
may management have been working to restore caldor to higher 
levels of profitability and recently have expressed optimism about 
caldors prospects 
caldor which operates in the northeast was taken over by may in 
1986 as part of the acquisition of associated dry goods caldors 
operating earnings came to 50 million in 1988 on sales of 16 
billion 
may launched venture in 1970 it operates in the midwest and last 
year had operating income of 81 million on sales of 13 billion 
both venture and may sell a range of items including hard line 
goods such as appliances and soft line goods such as clothing 
thomas a hays mays president described caldor and venture as 
two wellpositioned businesses with excellent management and 
committed associates 
as a condition of any sale may will insist on provisions 
regarding jobs compensation and benefits for caldors and ventures 
employees 
retail industry analysts had been expecting that may eventually 
would shed caldor and venture 
i think it was something we were all expecting them to do 
said jeffrey edelman of drexel burnham lambert inc but it is a 
little earlier than expected 
edelman said he thought may would have waited to look for buyers 
until caldor and venture had shown steady financial progress over a 
longer period of time 
given mays plan to use much of the money it would get from 
selling the two units to buy its shares the move seems aimed 
chiefly at enhancing the value of the retailers stock 
some shareholders had become disgruntled when may diluted its 
earnings through the acquisitions of the associated dry goods 
properties in 1986 and then the foleys and filenes department 
store chains in 1988 
i think its an attractive move for them to make as far as 
shareholders are concerned said edelman 
farrell said may has asked the investment banking firm morgan 
stanley amp co inc to look into the move 
with the addition of foleys and filenes last year mays 14 
department store divisions produced sales of 75 billion and 
operating earnings of 802 million volume shoes sales were 11 
billion with operating earnings of 138 million 
may which is based in st louis currently operates 283 
department stores in 29 states and the district of columbia 120 
caldor stores in eight states in the northeast 73 venture stores in 
the midwest and 2628 volume shoe stores in 43 states and the 
district of columbia

sustaining success has been difficult for 
eastman kodak co this decade and thats one reason the companys 
name keeps coming up on wall street as a possible takeover target 
the company has managed to turn around a sagging bottom line 
twice since 1980 only to see the same problems increased 
competition a rising us dollar and higher costs return to chew 
up profits 
it seems like they wipe their brow and say whew were glad 
thats over and they turn around and have to do it all over 
again said mark obenzinger a stock analyst for wood gundy amp co 
in new york 
call it the threeyear twitch 
kodak laid off thousands of workers in 1983 saying unfavorable 
exchange rates and soft markets overseas had hurt its business the 
companys profits went up 63 percent the next year 
in 1986 the company had to lay off more than 10000 workers 
radically restructure the company and start a costcutting program 
in an effort to remain competitive 
profits more than tripled the next year and set a record in 1988 
now in 1989 after profits declined 23 percent in the first 
quarter of the year the company has announced plans to cut costs by 
consolidating its photofinishing and consumer photography units 
which could mean hundreds of layoffs 
it does seem to go in cycles and were at the point where the 
company is under pressure again said eugene glazer a stock 
analyst with dean witter reynolds inc 
meanwhile kodak is having trouble controlling expenses at 
sterling drug co which it bought for 51 billion last year and 
the company is battling in court to prevent a large damage award to 
polaroid corp in the two companies patent infringement lawsuit 
over instant photography 
as if all these problemsthatwontgoaway arent enough kodak 
was named last month as the no 1 emitter of the industrial 
pollutant methylene chloride by a washingtonbased environmental 
group 
analysts point to several reasons for kodaks rollercoaster ride 
through the 80s 
first and foremost is the value of the us dollar 
when the dollar is strong compared to other countries 
currencies kodak gets hurt in two ways its profits overseas are 
smaller when translated back into dollars and foreign rivals gain a 
price advantage in sales to the us market 
this double whammy hurt kodak throughout the first half of the 
decade and helped competitors like fuji photo film co and 
agfagevaert inc loosen kodaks strangle hold on photographic film 
sales around the world 
in the 1970s kodak sold between 90 and 95 percent of all 
photographic film in the world today that has fallen to between 80 
and 85 percent according to industry estimates 
the dollar has been gaining strength for the past year and 
unless it weakens soon kodak is going to have to continue cutting 
costs to offset the losses it will bring 
im not sounding alarm right now on the dollar but im getting 
ready to kodaks chairman colby chandler said if it hasnt 
started down by yearend im going to be concerned 
chandler said its difficult to determine how much of kodaks 
woes can be traced to outside factors like the dollar or to 
management decisions made by kodak executives 
america basically has sort of a chip on its shoulder these 
days were always trying to find whos to blame for something 
chandler said instead of taking responsibility we have learned 
to blame everyone else but ourselves for what goes wrong 
he said he doesnt want kodak to join that chorus 
in an effort to become more in control chandler said the company 
is planning to sell a number of its businesses that have either been 
developed within the company or been acquired 
each one will not make a significant impact on the company or 
the public eye theyre not that big but the idea is very powerful 
inside the company chandler said 
kodak remains a benevolent corporate father figure to the 
rochester area where it remains the largest employer said peter 
enderlin an analyst for smith barney harris upham amp co 
their idea of dramatic costcutting and dramatic restructuring 
really isnt that dramatic enderlin said they still have a 
mentality that is somewhat paternalistic 
questions about kodak being too nice only pump up the takeover 
talk on wall street 
rumors have swirled in the past few weeks speculating that 
corporate raider carl icahn has begun looking at the company and 
that kodak might be considering a merger with general electric co 
with takeovers sweeping corporate america stock analysts arent 
surprised that kodaks name has popped up on the merger and 
acquisitions menu but most agree a takeover of the company is 
unlikely 
these rumors get started because the company has 
characteristics that attract corporate raiders but the odds are 
against a takeover attempt said glazer 
kodak is a wellknown name its in a good industry and its 
being managed for longterm growth three things that appeal to 
corporate raiders who want companies that can be changed around to 
yield more money right away 
i guess there are some people who believe that some outside 
group can wave a magic wand and change kodak from an ugly duckling 
into a beautiful swan said enderlin of smith barney its not 
that easy 
kodaks businesses are complex the company also has a number of 
hurdles that give it some protection from potential hostile 
takeovers 
the company is incorporated in new jersey which has tough 
antitakeover laws if a raider acquired a majority of kodak stock 
management could issue enough new stock to friendly buyers to 
outvote the raider 
the company also has about 13 billion in long and shortterm 
debt which would increase the cost of a leveraged buyout 
nothings impossible but a takeover attempt would be hard to 
believe said obenzinger

ual corps stock jumped higher tuesday fueled by 
a report that a group led by texas billionaire robert m bass had 
acquired up to 3 percent of the company which owns united airlines 
bass spokeswoman susan hawkins declined comment on the report in 
usa today and ual spokesman joe hopkins said the company would not 
comment on the stock activity 
in new york stock exchange trading ual rose 675 to 146 a 
share the jump followed gains of 175 on monday and 1550 for all 
of last week 
analysts said speculators have taken an intense interest in 
airline companies following an international investor groups deal 
last week to buy nwa inc the parent of northwest airlines in a 
deal valued at 364 billion 
the airline industrys strongest performers including american 
delta united and usair may have much higher value than their 
stock prices indicate said analyst louis marckesano of janney 
montgomery scott inc in philadelphia 
i think the northwest bidding and the subsequent publicity has 
kind of highlighted the potential value of the four or five strong 
majors the ones who are strong and prosperous and have been that 
way for years marckesano said 
the mentality seems to be that if nwa can be taken over why 
cant anybody else said robert decker an analyst with duff amp 
phelps inc in chicago 
united is the nations secondlargest airline after american in 
terms of paid passenger miles 
united owns 80 percent of its 408jet fleet the highest 
percentage among the major carriers and one of the factors that 
could enhance its appeal to suitors analysts said 
a buyer could conceivably sell the owned aircraft and use the 
money to pay off debt from the acquisition and lease other aircraft 
united also has a large route network in the pacific the worlds 
fastestgrowing airtravel region 
ual is the successor to allegis corp which formerly owned the 
airline the hertz car rental company and the westin international 
and hilton international hotel chains 
allegis embarked on a major restructuring in 1987 after the 
investor group coniston partners acquired a 13 percent stake and 
threatened to mount a takeover of the board of directors to force a 
breakup of the company 
coniston contended that the stock market would value allegis more 
highly if it dumped its nonairline businesses 
allegis sold its nonairline companies and renamed itself ual 
which was its title before it acquired those businesses and renamed 
itself allegis

the bush administration will be forced to 
double its initial spending on savings and loan rescues if congress 
restricts the financial power of the new sampl bailout agency thrift 
regulator m danny wall said tuesday 
if a congressional conference committee next month adopts the 
house version of the sampl bill wall said the new agency called the 
resolution trust corp would need to spend at least twice the 50 
billion it is due to receive over the next three years 
the house bill unlike the senate version forbids the bailout 
agency from issuing promissory notes or loss guarantees extending 
its liability beyond the 50 billion 
wall speaking at a conference of the us league of saving 
institutions the industrys largest trade group said 50 billion 
represents the net cost of closing and merging insolvent thrifts it 
reflects the cost after the government recovers some of its expenses 
by selling real estate inherited from failed sampls he said 
unless the agency can rescue institutions by issuing promissory 
notes and paying them off years later after the government sells the 
real estate the initial cash outlay needed will be at least 100 
billion he said 
in that case president bush would be forced to ask congress in 
several years for more money 
rep henry b gonzalez dtexas chairman of the house banking 
committee insisted on the restriction arguing that walls agency 
the federal home loan bank board abused its notewriting powers 
last year and in effect spent money without congressional approval 
he has said he wants to ensure the resolution trust corp which 
will take over some of the bank boards duties will not have 
similar leeway 
wall also complained about another provision in the house bill 
that makes the federal deposit insurance corp the primary regulator 
of statechartered sampls taking away that power from the agency that 
will succeed the bank board walls agency under the senate 
version retains its power over both state and federal sampls 
wall said that would create conflicts of interest in the future 
because the fdic as the insuror of sampl deposits likely will become 
partowner of rescued institutions the fdic should not regulate 
institutions it owns while at the same time regulating privately 
owned competing institutions he said 
on another topic wall said both the house and senate sampl bills 
do not give his agency and the fdic enough power to allow 
capitaldeficient savings and loans to continue operating 
wall said that even advocates of very tough capital rules believe 
regulators ought to have the leeway to allow undercapitalized sampls 
to continue operating provided they are profitable have competent 
managers and stick to a plan to increase their capital 
however a recent review by bank board lawyers indicates that 
regulators do not have enough authority to grant that leeway 
theres too much pressure to say no and not enough ability to 
say yes he said

said j thomas stanley a vice president at chemical new york

wheat futures prices bounded to a sixweek high tuesday on the 
chicago board of trade in anticipation of further buying of us 
wheat by the soviet union which apparently is strapped for supplies 
on other markets livestock and meat futures were mostly lower 
while oil and preciousmetals futures were mixed 
wheat settled cent to 10 cents higher with the contract for 
delivery in july at 412 a bushel corn was 3 cents to 5 cents 
higher with july at 262 a bushel oats were 4 cents to 5 cents 
higher with july at 153 a bushel soybeans were 8 cents to 13 
cents higher with july at 738 a bushel 
the rally pushed wheat futures to their highest level since may 
15 and erased most of mondays steep losses in the corn soybean and 
oat markets 
unlike the other grain markets wheat futures had risen monday on 
rumors the soviets had bought up to 500000 metric tons of us 
wheat at market prices an indication they had an immediate need for 
the grain 
most of the soviet unions recent purchases of us grain have 
been through the agriculture departments export enhancement 
program which effectively subsidizes grain sales and requires 
buyers to submit bids in a process that is not always speedy 
after the close of trading tuesday the usda said private 
exporters had reported sales of 400000 metric tons of soft red 
winter wheat to the soviet union for delivery during the current 
marketing year which began oct 1 
tuesdays rally was fueled by speculation that the soviets would 
be back for more wheat and by reports of raininduced harvest delays 
in the central and southern states where soft red winter wheat is 
grown 
there are also a lot of quality concerns about the soft red 
wheat which makes largescale buying particularly bullish said 
katharina zimmer a grainmarket analyst with merrill lynch capital 
markets inc in new york 
livestock and meat futures settled mostly lower on the chicago 
mercantile exchange reversing mondays trend 
the hog market led the way down reflecting lower spot hog prices 
and perceptions that the market was nearing a top 
cattle futures were pressured by slack demand and ample supplies 
live cattle settled 35 cent lower to 07 cent higher with august 
at 7057 cents a pound feeder cattle were unchanged to 27 cent 
lower with august at 8125 cents a pound hogs were 20 cent to 87 
cent lower with july at 4910 cents a pound frozen pork bellies 
were 80 cent lower to 50 cent higher with july at 3475 cents a 
pound 
heatingoil and crudeoil futures rose for the fifth straight day 
on the new york mercantile exchange but the gasoline markets rally 
ended with a modest decline 
analysts said the markets uncertain performance indicated that a 
downturn a socalled technical correction was likely 
west texas intermediate crude settled 6 cents to 23 cents higher 
with august at 2048 a barrel heating oil was 35 cent to 88 cent 
higher with july at 5053 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was 01 
cent to 25 cent lower with july at 6368 cents a gallon 
gold futures rose slightly while silver futures were nearly 
unchanged on new yorks commodity exchange in quiet trading that 
reflected the dollars mixed performance against other major 
currencies 
gold settled 150 higher across the board with august at 37980 
a troy ounce silver was unchanged to 1 cent lower with july at

the chairman of the new york stock exchange is 
indicating the big board will take disciplinary measures against 
drexel burnham lambert inc for the firms involvement in wall 
street corruption 
however an nyse spokesman said tuesday the exchange would wait 
for drexel to settle the sweeping criminal securities fraud case 
brought against it by the federal government before deciding what 
sanctions if any to impose on the investment firm 
drexel agreed to plead guilty to six felonies and pay 650 
million in penalties to settle its criminal case which involved 
alleged securities law violations stemming from the insider trading 
scandals linked to nowjailed speculator ivan boesky 
nyse chairman john j phelan jr said in an interview with the 
wall street journal that the settlement represents the biggest 
failure of the supervisory system in the history of the financial 
markets 
phelan did not specify what sanctions were being considered but 
the exchange could fine censure or suspend the firm and employees 
issues before the exchange include whether top drexel officials 
failed to supervise employees properly 
the last thing we want to do is come out looking like a wimp 
phelan said 
phelan made comments last week that raised doubts about whether 
the nyse would follow up on the federal sanctions being levied 
against drexel by the securities and exchange commission and the 
justice department 
im not sure what purpose we would serve by adding any more to 
that since the commission could have done everything including bar 
drexel as a brokerdealer he told a group of reporters 
exchange officials maintain phelan was not indicating the 
exchange would not take action against drexel 
we have not yet determined what action if any the new york 
stock exchange will take in the drexel case spokesman rich 
torrenzano said that determination will be made in the coming 
weeks and months once federal regulators have completed all of their 
deliberations and settlements 
a federal judge last week approved a civil settlement between the 
sec and the firm that places drexel under strict supervision for 
three years approval of the separate criminal settlement is pending 
before another judge 
once that happens phelan said we will go full blast 
the exchange has been talking to the sec and has been examining 
the secs proposed settlement torrenzano said 
in 1985 the nyse fined ef hutton amp co 400000 and censured 
its president and chief financial officer for failing to supervise 
the firm properly after hutton pleaded guilty to federal mail and 
wire fraud charges in a wideranging checkkiting scheme

crude oil and wholesale heating oil futures 
continued to climb tuesday carried aloft largely by technical 
buying 
gasoline futures prices pulled back 
on the new york mercantile exchange the august contract for west 
texas intermediate rose 23 cents to 2048 per 42gallon barrel the 
contract closed with a gain of 54 cents on monday 
contracts for later delivery of wti the benchmark grade of us 
crude posted similar increases 
among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange the july 
contract for no2 heating oil gained 088 cent to settle at 5053 
cents a gallon adding to mondays gain of 016 cent other contract 
months of heating oil also finished higher 
the contact for july delivery of unleaded gasoline edged down by 
001 cent to 6368 a gallon after mondays surge of 077 cent 
contracts for august september and october gasoline delivery also 
declined 
mary l haskins a vice president at drexel burnham lambert inc 
said the rally in the crude futures pits was sustained with the help 
of technical buying 
buying bred more buying as traders pushed the price of crude 
futures past thresholds considered significant 
the technicals have pointed upward now for a week and a half 
and until we get some dramatic bearish news the market will keep 
moving higher said haskins the market looks like it wants to 
head to 21 or 2120 a barrel in the near term 
the market also has been getting a lift this week from news that 
some opec members intend to curb crude production 
published reports have said kuwait and the united arab emirates 
two chronic overproducers will reduce their output levels closer to 
the amount desired by the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries 
kuwait previously had rejected its opecimposed production 
ceiling and set its own quota 
both kuwait and the uae reportedly now plan to scale back 
production levels but keep them above the amount mandated by the oil 
cartel at a meeting in vienna austria earlier this month

now that time inc has rejected a sweetened 122 
billion takeover bid from paramount communications inc the focus 
of their struggle is shifting to delaware not only the fate of time 
but also the future of friendly mergers may be decided in court 
time is fighting to preserve a planned merger with warner 
communications inc and it is that merger on which the takeover 
fight may turn 
paramount after announcing its original 175ashare or 107 
billion bid on june 6 filed suit in chancery court in delaware to 
stop the transaction that would create timewarner inc the worlds 
largest communications concern all three companies are incorporated 
in delaware 
time and warner first proposed their friendly stockforstock 
merger transaction in march after paramount began its pursuit of 
time the merger agreement was amended and time began a 14 billion 
tender offer for its wouldbe partner 
paramount contends time opened up a pandoras box effectively 
putting itself up for sale by announcing it would merge with 
warner 
under delaware law if a company has put itself up for sale its 
board is required to seek the maximum value for shareholders if the 
court rules that time in fact put itself up for sale the companys 
board could be hardpressed to reject paramounts 200ashare bid 
which is 74 higher than the price at which time stock traded before 
paramount announced its bid 
time rejected paramounts latest offer monday calling it 
financially inadequate and subject to too many conditions time 
contends that its merger plans with warner did not put the company 
up for sale meaning its board does not have to consider higher bids 
a court hearing on the issue is scheduled for july 11 
the case has generating much interest among companies and 
corporate lawyers because of the possibility it could set a 
precedent affecting mergers between other companies 
many us companies including about half of the fortune 500 
are incorporated in delaware to take advantage of state tax laws 
aimed at attracting business as a result business law decisions by 
the delaware courts which have established a strong reputation in 
dealing with corporate issues widely are seen as important 
precedents 
harry deangelo a professor at the university of michigan said a 
ruling in paramounts favor could place a chill on friendly mergers 
such as the original timewarner deal in favor of cash buyouts 
you would want to make sure if you didnt want to be acquired 
you were clearly the buyer in a deal he said 
but deangelo said a ruling favoring paramount would not 
necessarily mean an end to mergers such as the timewarner deal and 
predicted that corporate lawyers would find a way to structure 
mergers in accordance with such a ruling 
youll see a period of uncertainty and people will tread 
carefully as they get used to the new rules he said 
donald margotta a professor at northeastern university in 
boston said that even if the court rules in paramounts favor a 
merger transaction structured differently from the timewarner 
proposal might not be affected 
however margotta said a ruling against time is going to make 
it much more difficult to accomplish a friendly stockswap merger 
many observers decline to predict how the court might rule but 
some believe the fight will come down to a question of money and 
paramounts 200ashare bid 
the legal issue is nothing more than a subterfuge for some 
basic economic conflicts said alfred rappaport a professor at 
northwestern universitys kellogg graduate school of management 
time stock has fluctuated since paramount announced its bid as 
traders try to forecast how the court might rule and how the 
struggle will end on tuesday time stock slipped 75 cents to 
16325 a share in new york stock exchange composite trading 
warner was up 25 cents to 5912 a share and paramount was down 
87 cents to 6037 a share

merrill lynch amp co has decided to move about 
2600 jobs to jersey city nj and new york city officials said 
they have decided to remove the firm as senior underwriter for 
future municipal bond offerings 
they are now a new jersey company said george arzt 
spokesman for mayor edward i koch 
however the giant financial services firm which currently 
employs about 13000 people in new york city said its headquarters 
would remain in manhattan 
even after this move the firm will continue to be the largest 
employer among securities firms in new york said fred yager a 
merrill lynch spokesman 
merrill lynchs planned 43story office tower is to be built on 
the site of a former colgatepalmolive factory in jersey city the 
site still owned by colgate is being developed by the linpro co 
of berwyn pa 
we were very disappointed to learn today of merrill lynchs 
decision to relocate 2600 of their employees from manhattan to new 
jersey koch and city comptroller harrison j goldin said at a 
late afternoon news conference at city hall accordingly we have 
agreed to remove merrill lynch as the senior managing underwriter 
for any future new york city bond offerings 
new jersey gov thomas h kean issued a statement in trenton 
nj applauding the firms decision to move to the hudson county 
waterfront 
by combining all the standard incentives available at the 
state county and local levels we are able to construct a winning 
financial package he said 
new jersey is hoping merrill lynchs relocation will energize its 
efforts to redevelop the waterfront area 
rick cohen director of the department of housing and economic 
development in jersey city called merrill lynchs announcement a 
major shot in the arm to the waterfront development 
its been a little slow and this is really going to perk up the 
waterfront and stimulate other tenant leases he said 
details of the financial package offered to merrill lynch by new 
jersey were not available 
terms of the linpromerrill lynch agreement were not disclosed 
but the move is expected to reduce merrill lynchs annual occupancy 
costs for the operations by 50 percent 
we dont disclose those costs but i can tell you the reduction 
is 50 percent said yager 
the jobs being relocated to jersey city involve backoffice 
administrative functions in support of merrill lynchs consumer 
investment and capital markets businesses 
separately merrill lynch said it will relocate approximately 500 
data center employees to manhattan and staten island from boston and 
from somerset and new brunswick nj

the federal communications commission denied a 
request to delay a new pricing scheme scheduled to go into effect 
july 1 for the nations largest longdistance company atampt the 
agency said tuesday 
the requests for a stay had been filed in june by the puerto rico 
telephone co and la telefonica larga distancia which had said the 
new plan to place a cap on the prices american telephone amp 
telegraph co can charge would put the two companies at a 
competitive disadvantage they also said the plan would harm the 
public interest 
but the fcc in a decision reached friday and made public 
tuesday said the companies failed to provide adequate reasons for a 
stay and that the public would benefit from the new pricing 
the socalled price cap plan which the fcc adopted in march 
after a twoyear study replaces a 20yearold rate of return 
regulatory scheme that had placed limits on what atampt could earn 
above its costs most recently that limit was 122 percent 
fcc spokeswoman patricia chew said the commission also was 
reviewing other petitions to suspend the price cap plan so it was 
not immediately known if the plan would go into effect july 1 
atampt spokesman herb linnen said the company was confident it 
would prevail 
we expect price caps will go into effect july 1 linnen said 
atampt last month told the commission it would lower its prices by 
140 million on july 1 through reductions is basic longdistance 
rates and its special reach out america calling plan 
in its decision the fcc said price cap regulation offers 
significant consumer benefits that do not exist under rate of return 
regulation in light of the proposed decreases we believe that 
the public interest weighs strongly in favor of proceeding with the 
implementation of our price cap rules 
the price cap plan allows atampt which in 1988 controlled 68 
percent of the us longdistance market to raise rates 3 
percentage points less than the rate of inflation in three 
categories of service residential and small business 800 calls 
and other business services mainly for large customers 
the fcc has said the plan is intended to give atampt an incentive 
to cut costs and that consumers could save 900 million in charges 
over four years 
under rateofreturn regulation atampts longdistance rates have 
dropped 38 percent since 1984 much of that decrease however has 
resulted from higher prices consumers have been paying to connect to 
local telephone networks 
with consumers paying more longdistance companies have paid 
less to the local telephone networks and the fcc has forced atampt to 
pass those savings along to its longdistance customers 
puerto rican telephone argued that atampt will be able to apply the 
flow through savings to individual services in a way that would 
disadvantage competitors the company also argued that the fcc 
should consider price cap regulations for the local bell operating 
companies at the same time it does for atampt 
the fcc has proposed to impose price caps on the seven bell 
companies beginning in july 1990 
la telefonica larga distancia a puerto rican longdistance 
company argued it would be harmed by the access charge provisions 
and that the fcc should have imposed tighter limits on atampt price 
changes
