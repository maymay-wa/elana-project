former president carter an official observer of 
next months elections in nicaragua said monday hes confident the 
voting will be fair and honest 
i think its going to be relatively speaking a superb 
election carter just back from that central american country 
told a national security symposium at the carter presidential 
center 
what is protecting the integrity of the election is that both 
sides believe they are going to win he said referring to the 
sandinista government and the opposition 
carter has been invited to observe the general elections along 
with representatives of the council of freely elected heads of 
government a group of former chief executives which carter heads 
carter returned from a trip to nicaragua sunday night 
were doing everything we can to ensure that technically the 
election is almost perfect he said monday 
the sandinistas have been cooperative realizing they will not 
look good if carter and other international observers brand the 
elections as fixed 
the former president expressed the hope that the trend toward 
free elections might spread to cambodia afghanistan and other 
troubled nations 
this is the kind of approach that can be a new evolution in 
addressing longstanding armed conflict in troubled parts of the 
world carter said 
carter also said that with prodemocracy movements around the 
world the united states has an important opportunity to use 
these tremendous resources we have been wasting on weapons and 
sometimes spending wisely on weapons for other purposes 
he said the defense budget could be halved within a decade 
leaving an adequate military coupled with national security based 
on friendship and cooperation between nations 
will we do it he asked i dont know it might take 
us a year or two to realize we have this opportunity but such 
wonderful things can be done

striking hotel workers briefly closed the main 
streeet downtown monday night in a noisy sitin that ended with 
police arresting 74 of the demonstrators 
the strikers linked arms and sat in a circle in the middle of 
glittering fremont street between the golden nugget and binions 
horseshoe club where union workers walked off the job saturday 
after working without a contract for eight months 
about 30 police officers confronted the strikers and after they 
refused to disband began arresting them one by one there was no 
violence and the demonstration was over in 30 minutes 
culinary union local 226 leader jim arnold was among those put 
in plastic handcuffs and taken to a waiting police bus for 
transportation to the clark county detention center 
metropolitan police lt randy oaks said the strikers arrested 
would be booked on misdemeanor public nuisance charges 
union officials said they had made arrangements to bail strikers 
out 
pickets marching in front of the horseshoe club chanted slogans 
in support of the strikers in the street as curious tourists 
sipped drinks and watched the action from the other side of the 
street 
the strike was the first by the culinary and bartenders unions 
since 1984 when a walkout against most of the citys resorts cost 
millions of dollars in lost revenue and resulted in nearly 1000 
arrests 
arnold secretarytreasurer of local 226 said he had heard 
nothing from binions president jack binion since the strike began 
arnold accused binion of trying to break the union at the resort 
we knew it could be a long one and were prepared for it 
arnold said of the walkout 
union officials said 90 percent of the 1100 kitchen workers 
bartenders porters and other union members walked off their jobs 
but an attorney for the horseshoe said half the workers were 
crossing picket lines 
the casino is the first to be struck since union contracts 
expired june 1 
the horseshoe is one of 14 resorts that have not reached new 
pacts with the union but 20 resorts including most major casinos 
along the strip a couple of miles from downtown agreed several 
months ago to fiveyear pacts

phil donahues audience took turns blasting 
general motors corp and filmmaker michael moore on monday as they 
discussed the quirky documentary roger and me 
about 2000 people jammed whiting auditorium for a segment of 
donahues nationally syndicated television show devoted to moores 
film 
the crowd included auto workers who accused gm of sending 
american jobs overseas and flint boosters who said moores movie 
made conditions in flint look worse than they are 
you showed the slummiest areas one woman told moore 
roger and me purports to depict what happened to flint when 
gm shut down factories in the community idling 30000 workers over 
several years 
in the film moore unsuccessfully pursues gm chairman roger 
smith to ask him to come to flint to see what gms layoffs have 
done to the city 
the documentary made for 260000 and released nationwide by 
warner brothers this month has won several awards and is being 
touted as a possible academy award winner for best documentary but 
moore has come under fire by some film critics for misrepresenting 
some time sequences such as the span during which layoffs occurred 
moore a flint native said his movies message was that after 
10 years of reagan and bush its not morning in america for us 
were all working harder for less 
moore said gm has a responsibility to the community where it got 
it started 
the american dream used to be you work hard the company 
prospers you prosper now you work hard the company prospers 
you lose your job he said noting that the layoffs came when gm 
still was making millions a year in profits 
gm critics accused smith of earning millions for himself while 
workers were losing their jobs while roger smith was pocketing 
this money we were standing in line for moldy cheese said one 
woman 
donahue was scheduled to do a single onehour show monday but 
decided to tape a second show immediately after the first because 
many in the crowd had yet to be heard after showing up before dawn 
monday for the 4 pm show 
donahue said gm declined to send anybody to appear with moore 
we are not interested in doing anything that might help 
promote a film that is inaccurate and totally unfair to the city of 
flint and the thousands of dedicated gm employees working there 
according to a gm statement read by donahue 
the company also asked its dealers not to advertise during the 
donahue show about the film donahue said 
moore and many in the audience objected to donahues suggestion 
that gm workers were to blame for the companys loss of market 
share and their jobs 
you made a lot of lousy cars donahue said 
but moore contended the company refused to listen to consumers 
and focused on making cars cheaper 
moore was booed when he admitted to owning a honda civic but 
said that even some socalled americanmade cars are built with 
many foreign made parts 
the show was shown live to about 40 cities and will be shown 
tuesday in more than 150 others

times arent good for the british bobby the 
policeman so admired and respected he never needed to carry a gun 
with disturbing regularity these days his image is being 
tarnished by scandals that range from evidencerigging to falsified 
crimebusting rates 
the scandals have triggered alarm about the integrity of the 
nations 146000member police force and prompted some highly 
public soulsearching by senior officers 
until recently the criticism came chiefly from leftwingers 
whom the police could dismiss as chronic malcontents where corrupt 
officers were exposed they were portrayed as the few bad 
apples in a fundamentally healthy barrel 
britons who follow the police developments closely say it is not 
the level of abuses that has increased but the publics awareness 
of them the criticism is coming increasingly from opinion makers 
who say the bad apple excuse is no longer good enough 
if the publics confidence in the police is lost i cannot see 
how it can be regained columnist bernard levin wrote in the 
times and if it is not regained the damage to our entire way of 
life would be immense so vital is the need for a force which can 
be relied upon 
a public opinion poll published in november indicated the police 
are held in esteem by only 43 percent of britons now in contast to 
83 percent in 1959 
the worst case of what the independent newspaper calls 
institutional rot occurred in october when the court of appeal 
freed four people serving life terms for bombing british pubs 
during a 1974 wave of irish republican army attacks the court 
quashed the conviction of the guildford four after seeing 
evidence that police from the surry county force falsified records 
and lied in court to strengthen their case 
civil libertarians are pressing to reopen other ira convictions 
notably the jailing of six irishmen for a 1974 pub bombing in 
birmingham in central england which killed 21 people the six 
claim they are innocent and were beaten into confessing 
in december a court ordered scotland yard in london to pay a 
record 100000 pounds 165000 in damages to a black man falsely 
accused of carrying illicit drugs it was one of a series of cases 
from 198485 in which police in the notting hill district of west 
london were accused of planting drugs on blacks 
in september investigators found that police in kent had 
increased crimedetection rates by pressing convicted prisoners to 
confess falsely to extra crimes it led to the dismissal of a 
detective sergeant and heavy fines for six of his colleagues 
public opinion was further inflamed by news that the policeman 
who exposed the corruption was being coldshouldered by his 
colleagues and was threatened with dismissal when he demanded a 
transfer 
the british force is divided into 52 constabularies mostly on 
county lines and usually officers from one county are called in to 
investigate suspected abuses by another 
commented the independent at the moment with half a dozen of 
our major forces investigating one another the police are in 
danger of running out of investigators to investigate the 
investigators 
signs of a dramatic new approach came in august when chief 
constable geoffrey dear of the west midlands force took the unusual 
step of dismantling his entire seriouscrime squad over allegations 
of fabricated confessions and doctored evidence more than 50 
officers were sidelined 
dear got what appeared to be crucial backing a month later from 
sir peter imbert commissioner of scotland yard in a watershed 
speech to a police conference 
sometimes it must seem that we set out deliberately to 
frustrate the inquirer and in doing so we manage to turn a 
grievance into a crusade he said police reticence he added 
carried quiet but strong implications of corruption 
the scope of abuses is expected to narrow sharply with the new 
police and criminal evidence act which requires interrogators to 
record every word said in the room and hold no one for more than 36 
hours without court authorization and access to a lawyer by 1991 
all interrogations will have to be taperecorded 
that law already has led to hundreds of detectives requesting 
transfers on grounds that they could not cope with the exacting new 
procedures said barry irving director of the police foundation 
an independent research group 
scotland yards imbert urges more emphasis on oldstyle policing 
based on close consultation with local communities especially 
ethnic groups 
the public have a right to be actively involved in determining 
how policing is developed he said in his september speech 
paj waddington a reading university expert on police says 
that policing is inherently scandalprone what seems to vary is 
the extent to which people perceive problems as being scandals 
waddington said in an interview that police malpractice is 
substantially less than at any time in our history and the 
fact that police violence still makes headlines demonstrates that 
it is still regarded as an unusual phenomenon 
but in recent times the old image of the friendly neighborhood 
bobby has been supplanted by a new breed hardened by innercity 
riots in the early 1980s and frequent picket line violence 
criminologist robert reiner of the london school of economics 
thinks the accumulation of gross abuses is extremely disturbing 
but i dont think its a sign the police have gone bad 
the police are doing their job as they always did he said in an 
interview the difference is that the public perception of them has 
changed 
there is a crisis in the public legitimacy of the british 
police he said

on the corner of dr david pages desk 
rests a foothigh stack of newly published genetics textbooks they 
matteroffactly describe the location of the sexdetermining 
factor the single gene that settles the question of whether a 
fertilized egg will be a boy or a girl 
the gene was pages discovery its rapid rise to the status of 
accepted wisdom is hardly a surprise for when he revealed it at a 
news conference the announcement was a major event in the world of 
genetics 
isolating the gene was a milestone in basic biology the prize 
in an exhausting race and the kind of achievement on which 
distinguished careers are built clearly a breakthrough in a field 
that uses the word sparingly 
or so it seemed 
the story was simple one tiny bit of genetic code rules gender 
if we have it at the moment we are conceived we will be male if 
not well be female 
just two years after pages announcement the precise location 
of the sexdetermining factor is a mystery again the gene he 
found while interesting and probably important is almost 
certainly not it 
the case illustrates the skittish and often whimsical way 
science moves rather than flowing forward in a neat sane way 
facts and theories cobbled together to fit them emerge in a 
jerky tango of discovery and setback a new set of lab results can 
turn breathtaking insight to smoke 
page is a staff scientist at the whitehead institute an elite 
center for genetics research across the street from massachusetts 
institute of technology while still in training at mit he used to 
smile at a cartoon on a biology professors door theory like 
mist on eyeglasses obscures vision 
pages theory accepted by many is now in shambles but its 
not the first time people have been wrong about the location of the 
sexdetermining factor a decade ago many believed it was a gene 
called hy and some textbooks still state this unequivocally 
pages quest to find the sex switch began in 1982 like others 
he tried to track it down by a process of elimination 
everyone is born with 46 strings of genes called chromosomes 
two of these called x and y are the sex chromosomes women have 
two xs while men have an x and a y scientists reason that the 
gene that makes men different from women must be located someplace 
on the y 
page and others have concentrated on apparent exceptions to the 
rule socalled xx males to all outward appearances these people 
are physically normal men but their cells contain the double xs 
of women through a genetic mixup one of their xs contains a 
tiny fragment of y enough to make them men 
among those he studied was an xx man with just half of 1 percent 
of a y chromosome within this bit of dna he found a gene that was 
shared by other xx males he postulated this was tdf 
testisdetermining factor the sex switch 
his description of the gene and his idea of what it did were 
published in december 1987 in the journal cell it was a depressing 
moment for dr peter n goodfellow at the imperial cancer research 
fund in london whose team was just a few months from making the 
same discovery 
page was almost certain he had correctly identified tdf but 
remembers feeling uneasy when colleagues flashed slides during 
lectures that confidently called it that you try as hard as you 
can to say that something is a working hypothesis and it gets 
boiled down even in a textbook to established fact 
to be on the safe side he named his gene zfy or ylinked zinc 
finger protein a reference to the kind of chemical structure it 
makes then he and other scientists searched for evidence that zfy 
is tdf but when new pieces of the puzzle emerged they didnt 
quite fit 
if you get something that is right more and more things start 
clicking into place said goodfellow what happened with the 
zfy story is that it didnt get stronger and stronger 
among the conflicting details 
page knew from the start that there was a related gene on the x 
chromosome but when its structure was decoded it was 
disquietingly like zfy if zfy is uniquely male why would females 
have a very similar gene 
all mammals have their own version of zfy but among the 
marsupials such as kangaroos the gene isnt on the y chromosome 
at all it lies on one of the nonsex chromosomes that presumably 
has nothing to do with sex determination 
other xx males turned up who did not carry zfy 
in mouse embryos the gene did not seem to be doing anything at 
the time when sex is determined 
efforts to transplant zfy into female embryos didnt produce 
male mice 
alone any of these tidbits could be explained away maybe the 
male mouse embryos werent producing the zfy protein because 
scientists were looking for it after the gene had already turned 
itself on and off maybe marsupials and their distant relatives 
among placental mammals have simply evolved different means of sex 
determination together though the tidbits raised doubts 
as the data accumulated it seemed to be more and more 
puzzling how it could be the sexdetermining gene said benajmin 
lewin editor of cell that is quite a common situation one sees 
an assumption a model is proposed and then more data accumulate 
that are not consistent with the model and then the model breaks 
the breaking point for this model came with a paper in december 
in the journal nature goodfellow had found four xx males who 
carried a bit of the y chromosome but not the part with zfy on it 
he argued that somewhere in the fragment they shared was the true 
sexdetermining factor 
while page was unmoved by the earlier skepticism over zfy 
goodfellows discovery was a shock it hit me sure in part 
because i did not know this was coming until it was published he 
could dismiss the other evidence as circumstantial but goodfellow 
had used precisely the same line of reasoning to attack zfys role 
as page had used to support it 
this makes it clear that zfy is not the only sexdetermining 
function on the y page said its possible that zfy has 
little if anything to do with sex determination 
goodfellow isnt gloating if he had found zfy first he said 
he would have written the paper page wrote a lot of people have 
said to me it shows that david page got it wrong everyone likes 
to see a hero fall 
its not really like that yes his interpretation was 
incorrect but if you go back and look at it he put forward what 
seemed to be the best hypothesis at the time 
now goodfellow and page are back where they were competing to 
find the sex trigger gene 
im not in the position of wanting to stand up and crow 
goodfellow said we are testing the most likely hypothesis that 
may be wrong or maybe david will publish finding a gene in this 
region tomorrow

once an economic power that drew ships from 
around the world to its piers at the head of the chesapeake bay 
the port of baltimore is losing ground to its competitors and its 
reputation for labor troubles 
even the unexpectedly quick settlement of a threeday 
dockworkers strike last week failed to appreciably brighten 
prospects for the 1 billion complex 
even a threeday walkout has reverberations its like the 
shot heard round the world baltimore goes out again said state 
delegate eileen rehrmann it sends a message all over the world 
that were unreliable 
the jan 19 strike by about 2000 members of the international 
longshoremens association stranded cargo containers on piers and 
prompted about a dozen vessels to divert to competing waterfronts 
officials said 
the dockworkers who struck over jurisdiction of clerical jobs 
went back to work tuesday and ratified a new contract that gave up 
60 of those jobs 
yet it may be more significant that the union gave up its rain 
clause a local work rule blamed for higher labor costs the new 
contract lets managers instead of the union decide when weather 
is too hazardous to work 
us rep helen bentley rmd who acted as a mediator in the 
contract dispute said eliminating the rain clause alone would save 
steamship lines about 25 million a year 
the damage has already been done internationally and within 
our own state said gov william donald schaefer who had 
threatened a state takeover of the ports operations long before 
last weeks strike 
schaefer returned from european and middle east trade missions 
last year complaining about the ports labor image abroad and for 
years has complained of lagging modernization to keep up with the 
boom in containerized shipping 
richard hughes head of the ila local representing clerical 
workers contends that the port should control its administrative 
costs eliminating such things as executive bonuses and make its 
rates more competitive with regional competitors 
hughes whose jurisdictional complaint led to the threeday 
strike said he doesnt consider the contract satisfactory raising 
the possibility of another wrangle when the pact expires in 
november 
ila district president horace alston who heads the five ila 
locals working in the port of baltimore didnt return a phone call 
baltimore a 12hour sail up the bay from the atlantic ocean 
once was insulated from hard times by its position as the harbor 
closest to the nations industrial heartland 
freight deregulation in the 1970s turned that into a liability 
with customers shopping for competitive truck and rail rates from 
ports that huge steamships could reach more conveniently 
in the mid1980s the port authority began to step into labor 
negotiations between the ila and dock employers represented by the 
steamship trade association 
port officials were anxious to obtain union concessions to 
improve the ports reputation for reliability and lower its costs 
but that only strained relations between the ila and the employers 
who lease the docks and hire from the labor pool 
richard trainor head of the maryland port commission said the 
economic effect of the strike goes far beyond the 2000 or so ila 
members 
he estimated that 30000 to 40000 people make a living from the 
ports business even that is far less than what used to be ten 
years ago a state study found the port directly or indirectly 
supported more than 100000 people 
port of baltimore officials say 28 ship lines have folded 
merged or deserted baltimore in the past five years 
while shipping volume has declined worldwide baltimores market 
share has been sapped by other atlantic seaboard ports especially 
virginias hampton roads complex at norfolk 
port of baltimore figures show that between 1982 and 1988 its 
share of midwestbound freight dwindled from 18 percent to 10 
percent while norfolks climbed from 6 percent to 9 percent 
baltimores midatlantic share went from 30 percent to 20 
percent while norfolks rose from 13 percent to 18 percent 
the sun in baltimore reported thursday that last year for the 
first time virginia ports probably surpassed baltimore in the 
amount of general cargo handled 
maryland port officials said their 1989 numbers werent yet 
prepared for publication but figures through september show a 64 
percent drop in general cargo from the year before 
trainor said the port must become more financially attractive to 
shippers 
if youre in business selling something for 1 and everybody 
else is selling it for 50 cents you might as well make up your 
mind youre in the wrong business because the public is going to 
make it up for you he said

the opposition coalition is suffering 
widespread losses even before feb 25 elections at least 150 of 
its municipal candidates and three national assembly candidates 
have quit the campaign in recent months 
officials of the united nicaraguan opposition or uno say some 
of those who withdrew were secret sandinista sympathizers who 
infiltrated uno to embarrass it 
but many others were taken in by a campaign of the ruling 
sandinistas that includes intimidation and warnings of a return to 
the dictatorship of anastasio somoza uno says 
for olivia bermudez who quit her local race in december the 
contra connection was the last straw 
mrs bermudez ended up accepting sandinista accusations that her 
own opposition coalition was linked to ussupported contra 
guerrillas and might bring back the days of somoza who was 
overthrown in 1979 
return to the past never said mrs bermudez sitting in a 
rocking chair on the front porch of her modest cement home her 
1yearold baby on her lap 
mrs bermudez 40 is a homemaker mother of 10 and owner of a 
couple of farms in the central province of chontales 
this is the cool lush heartland of nicaraguas cattle region 
where the rivers are made of milk and the stones of cheese as 
a local saying has it 
it is also contra territory the contras have the sympathy of 
many local cattlemen and small farmers who dont like anyone 
butting into their business seizing their land or forcing them to 
join coops 
raul bello cordero 50 withdrew in midjanuary as town council 
candidate for esquipulas a village in northcentral matagalpa 
province he said two local sandinista party officials threatened 
to have his house and truck confiscated if he didnt resign 
they said the front the sandinistas has already won the 
elections so if i didnt want to lose my property and have my 
family affected i should resign bello said 
another threat said bello was that his son would be drafted 
although the draft has been suspended at least for the duration of 
the campaign 
the sandinistas deny intimidation saying the candidates quit 
after seeing that uno is the civilian arm of the contras its 
a teme the sandinistas have hammered at in their campaign 
one staunchly progovernment newspaper el nuevo diario 
regularly refers to uno as gn1 gn are the spanish initials 
for national guard as the generally hated army was called under 
somoza and uno means one in spanish 
president daniel ortega seeking another sixyear term 
constantly calls uno and the contras the somocista guard he is 
running for the sandinista national liberation front against unos 
violeta barrios de chamorro publisher of the opposition newspaper 
la prensa 
uno does indeed include former members of the contra resistance 
but they say the sandinista attacks are unfair because they have 
given up arms and agreed to join the political process 
mrs bermudez who quit her town council race in middecember 
said the coalition has been hampered by constant bickering among 
its disparate parties that joined forces for the sole purpose of 
beating the sandinistas 
she said it also suffers from a lack of money for campaign 
activities 
lets face it nobody is in a position nowadays to shell out 
money from their own pockets said mrs bermudez the opposition 
has said the sandinistacontrolled bureaucracy is blocking 
distribution of its election funds 
candido moreno salgado 40 said he quit a national assembly 
race after men who identified themselves as state security agents 
visited his home and threatened to have his ranch confiscated 
unless he resigned 
moreno from the matagalpa town of dario said the ultimatum was 
preceded by telephoned death threats 
julio cesar fletes of the atlantic coast town of bluefields a 
candidate for the regional council in his area said he was 
pressured by military and state security authorities 
fletes said he was given a jar of a black substance and told to 
add it to food served at a uno gathering he said he was told the 
substance was poison and he refused to comply 
he has remained a candidate though he has fled to managua 
hernaldo zuniga head of a conservative party faction within 
uno said 40 cases of alleged intimidation had been presented to 
the supreme electoral council but no reply had been received 
zuniga said many of those who withdrew because of threats 
preferred to keep a low profile and would not complain

q the bush administration has been in place for a year now its 
long policy review has been completed and presidents bush and 
gorbachev have held their first summit meeting how would you 
describe the state of ussoviet relations and superpower efforts 
to solve regional conflicts 
a i believe that in analyzing sovietus relations we can on 
the whole look with satisfaction back to the past year and the 
prospects too seem to be favorable 
it has been possible not only to maintain the positive momentum 
in the development of relations between our two countries but also 
to elevate them to a new dimension both sides agree that having 
renounced the spirit of confrontation and achieved certain mutual 
understanding we must now move on to mutual action 
this need arises virtually in all spheres of sovietus 
relations not in the last instance in the area of solving 
regional conflicts that you have mentioned 
we have seen some tangible improvements here although 
difficulties persist too 
the successes of the past year to be credited also to 
sovietus contacts include the settlement in southwest africa 
and the achievement of independence by namibia 
the machinery to promote a cambodian settlement is shifting into 
higher gear it seems we can now see the light at the end of the 
tunnel there 
we keep constantly in sight the problems of the middle east it 
is important that israel too should take advantage of the 
opportunities that are there 
a political settlement in afghanistan is literally knocking on 
the door reliance on military force has outlived itself 
the peace process in central america has traveled a long and 
difficult path in this connection the us action against panama 
undertaken at a very crucial period for that region gives rise to 
grave concern we have expressed our attitude toward the use of 
force toward contempt for international law we hope that a sense 
of realism will prevail in washington and that respect will be 
shown for the legitimate interests of central american states and 
their right to free choice 
it can be seen from this brief inventory that there will be 
something for us to talk about with secretary of state james baker 
early in february in moscow we expect to have productive 
discussions 
q president bush has said that the united states wants closer 
cooperation with the soviet union and secretary baker has 
suggested that cooperation might include technical advice in areas 
such as international monetary affairs the us administration is 
moving toward removal of trade barriers what forms of cooperation 
would you say are most needed or would be most effective and what 
shortterm benefits are expected from improved trade relations 
a in the sphere of economic cooperation we think just like the 
united states does both of shortterm and longterm mutual 
benefits for all the difficulties of economic conditions in our 
country the situation is not such that we need the last straw 
we have vast reserves and the purpose of perestroika is to 
mobilize the reserves 
at this time perestroika is going through perhaps the most 
difficult period of transition from one economic management system 
and political structure to another it turned out that the most 
difficult revolution is a peaceful revolution a change in the 
minds of people 
we have a perestroika concept we are continuing our creative 
search for approaches to implementing some of its individual 
elements despite all the difficulties we keep moving steadily 
ahead and we are convinced of our ultimate success 
one of the elements of the economic program of perestroika is 
the integration of our country into the world economy system our 
economic ties with the united states could have no small role to 
play here the strategic goal is truly largescale mutually 
advantageous cooperation and interaction of soviet and american 
economies this would benefit both sides 
unfortunately what stands in the way is the remaining 
discriminatory barriers whether the absence of the 
mostfavorednation treatment or the outdated cocom regulations 
restricting hightechnology exports we hope that the readiness 
the us administration declared in malta to move toward 
normalization of trade and economic relations will be translated 
into concrete deeds

q the united states and soviet union are pressing for a 
strategic arms reduction agreement in principle by june and for 
signing of a start treaty this year yet there has been little if 
any progress reported on the most difficult longstanding obstacles 
to agreement will the soviet union sign and implement a strategic 
arms reduction treaty that does not limit sealaunched cruise 
missiles or restrict the us strategic defense initiative 
a one of the most important results at malta was the political 
decisions of the sides to conclude a start treaty in 1990 
generally speaking this year can become the disarmament year 
it is quite realistic to reach agreements also in areas such as the 
reduction of conventional armed forces in europe and the 
elimination of chemical weapons 
thus our joint policies have been defined very clearly it now 
remains to translate them into negotiating positions 
as to the fundamental issues that you have touched upon we 
submitted back in wyoming compromise proposals on sealaunched 
cruise missiles we are willing to limit them outside the treaty 
framework on the condition that the relevant provisions will be 
recorded concurrently with the treaty will be mandatory and 
subject to verification 
we are willing to sign and implement a start treaty even without 
agreement on space if the sides continue to observe the abm 
antiballistic missile treaty as signed in 1972 that was also a 
major step that we took in wyoming it is to be hoped that 
secretary baker will bring to moscow adequate responses to our 
initiatives it is not too long before he comes here 
q does the united states support for the independence of the 
baltic republics contribute to the separatist campaign in lithuania 
and elsewhere and will you seek a change in us policy as part of 
president gorbachevs effort to prevent breakup of the union 
a we know the position of the united states which does not 
recognize the entry of the baltic republics into the union our 
assessment of it must be well known to you too 
as to the specific aspects of establishing a truly federative 
structure of our country to supercede the unitarism that actually 
existed and setting up a new mechanism of relationships between 
the republics and the center these problems are addressed in the 
course of a broad dialogue in our country taking into account the 
interests of all the ethnic groups 
the secession of some particular republics from the union would 
produce not only additional militarypolitical and economic 
stresses for their population but could also result in a major 
destabilization of the existing international structure it is in 
no ones interest to see this happen 
the problems of interethnic relations are so delicate and 
sensitive that one should avoid any outside interference in the 
process of their development otherwise one can provoke 
unpredicatble repercussions 
i should say that on the whole we see that responsible 
politicians are aware of this 
thus recently the us administration has reaffirmed that since 
the establishment of diplomatic relations with the soviet union 
the united states recognizes the territorial integrity of our 
country the principles recorded in the helsinki final act to 
which the united states affixed its signature are also well known 
q an article signed z in the american magazine daedalus 
has provoked something of a sensation with its contention that 
president gorbachevs attempts at reform are futile and that the 
west should therefore not try to help them succeed perhaps the 
article is getting particular attention right now due to the 
climate with lithuania trying to break from moscow the caucasus 
ablaze with ethnic quarrels and the economy unable to provide basic 
food and consumer goods to people throughout the country how would 
you respond to z 
a i know about the article by z from its newspaper version 
it is strange that the bag of cliches it contains about the demise 
of socialism is portrayed as something of a sensation this was 
written and spoken about many times over the past 70 years and 
such forecasts always turned out to be in the dump of history 
the articles author who seems to be prone to stereotype 
thinking has completely distorted ideas about the content of 
perestroika and about the nature of the ongoing processes within 
soviet society it is our impression that the changes occurring in 
the world are not to his taste altogether and that he does not like 
the administrations course which is supported by most americans 
for a new closeness with the soviet union 
as to our own difficulties we do know about them and we do not 
conceal them but we are confident that these difficulties will be 
overcome because there is no alternative to perestroika 
there is much work ahead of us and we are prepared to do it

president mikhail s gorbachevs decision to send 
troops to quell the azerbaijanarmenian conflict has dragged native 
russians into the conflict throwing a volatile new ingredient into 
a simmering ethnic stew 
both armenians and azerbaijanis now accuse gorbachev and the 
russiandominated kremlin leadership of letting the 2yearold 
battle over the disputed nagornokarabakh region slip out of 
control 
the decision on jan 19 to send soldiers to crush armed 
nationalists in baku the azerbaijani capital has focused 
resentment on slavic soldiers their dependents and russians who 
live in the region 
while gorbachev pleaded for a united soviet union to help solve 
the caucasus dilemma russian mothers were telling him they were 
not interested in risking their sons lives to stop the killing in 
their view the armenianazerbaijani dispute was more like the 
unpopular war in afghanistan than an issue of internal security 
major gen sergei kupreyev a member of the special commission 
from moscow administering nagornokarabakh complained in the jan 
23 issue of the weekly new times magazine that neither armenians 
nor azerbaijanis wanted to compromise 
no reasonable words are accepted now he said we are 
doing everything we can to talk our informal leaders into starting 
negotiations but the war is going on and our efforts are all in 
vain 
the military move intended to restore order in baku after 
azerbaijanis began attacking and killing the minority armenians 
united azerbaijanis against moscow 
the azerbaijan government demanded withdrawal of the soviet 
soldiers and an end to the state of emergency it threatened to 
secede from the soviet union never before had it so openly defied 
moscow 
most of the republic went on strike in protest 
in an area where the truth often is obscured by a maddening 
blurring of the facts the number of people killed by the military 
was a source of exaggeration 
comrades in baku more than 9000 people were killed read 
one sign carried by two young men in a march in moscow the day that 
the dead actually were being buried in baku but in the azerbaijani 
capital there were not 9000 graves there were 119 and that 
figure was higher than that offered by official sources which put 
the toll at 83 including 14 servicemen and members of their 
families 
baku journalist shain hadjiev said most of the soldiers sent 
into baku appeared to be russians posters declaring gorbachev 
the butcher of the azerbaijani people were displayed during 
rallies in baku he said 
in a period of high ethnic awareness spurred by gorbachevs 
reforms russians now are regarded by some in republics such as the 
baltics and moldavia as unwelcome colonizers 
until now they had managed to stay out of direct involvement in 
the conflict between armenians and azerbaijanis 
but world chess champion garri kasparov a jewisharmenian 
native of azerbaijan who got 60 of his friends and relatives out of 
baku during the ethnic violence told a moscow news conference that 
the conflict in baku could envelope the russian population 
if clashes are provoked between russians and azerbaijanis and 
if there are victims or refugees among the russian population just 
think what might happen if they show up in moscow he told a news 
conference 
it was unclear how many of the victims in baku were family 
members of servicemen but soviet officials took the threat 
seriously by wednesday more than 16000 dependents had been 
evacuated 
officials reported that the evacuation program was suspended 
thursday because of assurances from the azerbaijan peoples front 
that dependents no longer were in danger 
the labor newspaper trud reported attacks on the homes of some 
of bakus 100000 russians and said azerbaijanis were refusing to 
sell food to russians the interfax news service a publication of 
the official radio moscow said antirussian and antimilitary 
speeches were being made at rallies in many azerbaijani cities 
russian parents were having none of gorbachevs appeals the 
flashpoint was a decision to call up reserves on russian territory 
north of the caucasus mountains to help restore order in armenia 
and azerbaijan 
i wont give up my son a woman shouted in film broadcast 
nationwide by soviet tv from stavropol gorbachevs political power 
base we put up with everything we put up with it we put up 
with it how long are we going to put up with everything 
we dont want the peoples of these republics to call us 
occupants we dont want another afghanistan said another 
faced with such ire the kremlin unceremoniously backed down 
kupreyev noted that the bitter experience in afghanistan and 
gorbachevs opening of soviet society had affected soldiers 
attitudes 
soldiers dont want to die in domestic ethnic clashes he 
said there is some displeasure among the troops

portauprince haiti ap haitians were outraged in 1988 when 
thugs beat a priest and killed 13 members of his congregation a 
coup ousted the ruling general and installed lt gen prosper avril 
as president 
now 16 months later many haitians are wondering whether avril 
is leading them back into the morass of corruption repression and 
fear they knew under his predecessor lt gen henri namphy and 
during the 29year reign of francois papa doc duvalier and his 
son jeanclaude baby doc 
over the past two weeks soldiers have reportedly rounded up 
arrested and brutalized a dozen political activists and forced at 
least seven into exile 
declaring a 30day state of siege avril suspended four 
articles of the constitution and then imposed censorship on 
television and radio stations the main source of news in a nation 
where 85 percent of the population is illiterate 
the military government declared the state of siege jan 20 one 
day after gunmen killed an army colonel his wife and their maid 
the clampdown avril said was necessary to protect democratic 
accomplishments against terrorism implying that enemies of the 
government carried out the assassination 
skeptics saw it however as a pretext for avril to consolidate 
his power and renege on his promise to hold legitimate elections in 
october 
the government will now either show its teeth and demonstrate 
there will be no elections or have elections without the 
oppositions participation with controlled candidates said paul 
latortue a haitian economist at the university of puerto rico 
president bushs administration has sharply protested avrils 
blatant attack on basic civil liberties and indicated there 
will be no early resumption of washingtons 60 million annual aid 
package 
anguished telephone calls at all hours to a reporter in 
portauprince the capital suggest an underlying sense of 
forboding in haiti 
mariemichelle de ronceray whose husband hubert was among the 
opposition politicians beaten and exiled tells of police cars 
arriving at her house every four hours with sirens blaring i 
dont know what my status is she said im not leaving the 
house 
im on the edge of a nervous breakdown said an adviser to a 
former presidential candidate all these events remind me of life 
under papa doc 
papa doc the country doctor who encouraged peasants to regard 
him as the personification of baron samedi the voodoo god of the 
dead ruled haiti by naked terror his agents were the omnipresent 
tonton macoutes in creole folkore a macoute is a bogeyman with 
their dark glasses sneers and guns 
by the time of his death in 1971 duvalier had amassed a 
multimilliondollar fortune through graft 
haiti which was once a lush french possession had become one 
of the poorest nations in the world an estimated 80 percent of the 
countrys 57 million people live in extreme poverty 
baby doc his slowwitted son carried on the family tradition 
but with more attention to throwing opulent costume balls in the 
national palace than to the affairs of state a popular uprising 
finally forced him into exile in france on feb 7 1986 
namphy then head of the army was left in charge but any hopes 
that he might move haiti toward democracy were dashed when the 
country attempted to hold the first fair elections in its history 
on nov 29 1987 
assassins in cahoots with the army shot and hacked to death at 
least 34 voters at polling stations giving namphy the opportunity 
to abort the election washington suspended its foreign aid 
the following january the army staged an election won by 
university professor leslie manigat but when manigat moved to 
control the army he was overthrown by namphy in june of the same 
year 
on sept 11 1988 hundreds of people elbowed their way into st 
jean boscos roman catholic church to hear the rev jeanbertrand 
aristide fiery champion of human rights and no 1 enemy of the 
military regime 
he had just begun his sermon when 20 or so thugs wielding guns 
machetes spikes and clubs burst in and set upon the congregation 
they killed at least 13 people and wounded 70 including a pregnant 
woman who was stabbed in the stomach and then burned the church 
in a nation accustomed to violence the outrage sent a new wave 
of revulsion through the population and the ranks of the army one 
week later noncommissioned officers overthrew namphy and avril 
the army adjutant became president 
having survived a soldiers rebellion last april with the 
support of his 1100man presidential guard avril appears secure 
for the time being

the super bowl victory celebration san

49ers fans in the mission district 
late in the fourth quarter with the 49ers well on their way to 
a 5510 victory over the denver broncos car horns were blaring on 
the citys thoroughfares firecrackers were popping and police 
said there were reports of some celebratory gunshots being fired 
crowds spilling off sidewalks in some areas blocked traffic and 
some groups of fans rocked stopped buses 
by early evening there were no reports of celebration violence 
such as occurred in 1982 the night the 49ers won their first super 
bowl 
fan ernesto gonzalez declared the 49ers are a great team and 
it was a great game it was lopsided but denver needed to be 
taught a lesson to be told where san francisco was coming from 
on monday the team will be honored with a parade down market 
street 
not everyone in the city by the bay shares the football 
enthusiasm 
teacher sonja jones took advantage of the sunny weather and 
empty streets to take a long bike ride while her husband was 
watching the game on tv with friends 
on super bowl sunday i kiss him off for about five hours 
ms jones said 
the streets were empty all you saw were big fat men waddling 
out of bars yelling the score she added its a mutual

foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze says 
secession by some independenceminded soviet republics would cause 
military political and economic problems for them and also could 
result in a major destabilization of the existing international 
structure 
it is in no ones interest to see this happen he said in a 
written response to questions submitted before a rare oneonone 
interview 
shevardnadzes home republic georgia is among those with an 
active nationalist movement 
the problems of interethnic relations are so delicate and 
sensitive that one should avoid any outside interference in the 
process of their development he said when asked if us support 
for the independence of the baltic republics of lithuania latvia 
and estonia contributes to separatist feelings there 
i should say that on the whole we see that responsible 
politicians are aware of this he said noting the united states 
has reaffirmed its recognition of the territorial integrity of the 
soviet union 
the interview in shevardnadzes woodpaneled office on thursday 
and the text of the written exchange with the associated press were 
released by mutual agreement on sunday 
the soviet foreign minister acknowledged widespread concern in 
the west for the survivability of president mikhail s gorbachev 
but ascribed it more to a popular desire that gorbachevs reforms 
succeed than to any real threat to the communist party chiefs 
political power 
asked about oftstated worries in the west that spreading chaos 
in the soviet union could cause a backlash that would sweep 
gorbachev from power shevardnadze replied i believe that this 
particular preoccupation stems from sincere feelings from sincere 
support for the process of perestroika that is under way in the 
soviet union 
the softspoken whitehaired georgian a gorbachev ally on the 
ruling politburo noted it was gorbachev who spearheaded this 
arduous but holy struggle 
there is some segment of the population that is definitely 
disappointed by gorbachevs efforts at reform he said but he 
claimed gorbachev and the political leadership of this country 
on the whole do enjoy the support of the bulk of the soviet people 
in spite of the fact that we are experiencing great difficulties 
we have empty shelves in stores we have a host of other social 
economic and interethnic difficulties 
shevardnadze 62 a longtime communist party boss in georgia 
before gorbachev tapped him to take over the foreign ministry 
nearly five years ago said the soviet leaders opponents do not 
really constitute a significant force 
communist party sources say the party is becoming more 
polarized with hardliners expected to mount a challenge to 
gorbachevs leadership when the national bodys central committee 
meets in moscow on feb 5 
a progressive faction also has formed and sources say it may 
stage an attack at the same meeting on the partys constitutional 
monopoly on power and demand a virtual apology for decades of 
totalitarian communist rule 
the strength of either group is difficult to measure but the 
problems for gorbachev who seeks to portray himself as a centrist 
have mounted in recent weeks 
lithuanias communist party broke with moscow last month in a 
campaign for independence this month longsimmering ethnic 
hatreds and territorial disputes burst into open warfare in the 
southern caucasus 
our life is not easy shevardnaze said in the interview 
speaking seriously from the outset about the domestic crises and 
ambitious foreignpolicy goals of the gorbachev regime its 
difficult but without drama there is no revolution it is 
something thats concommitant to revolutionary change 
he defended the decision to send troops into the southern 
republics of azerbaijan and armenia as one to use force for the 
purpose of saving people saying the outbreak of ethnic violence 
there was nothing short of civil war 
the decision he said does not correspond to either our 
internal convictions or to our sentiments in general because in 
principle we are opposed to use of any force anywhere 
as the situation in that region stabilizes we will gradually 
withdraw our forces from there he pledged 
juggling foreign policy issues and domestic problems which he 
said cant be entirely separated from each other shevardnadze 
predicted the most important event of this year will be the 
june summit meeting in the united states between gorbachev and 
president bush 
he expressed confidence that he and us secretary of state 
james a baker whom he referred to as my friend will make 
further progress toward an agreement to halve the superpowers 
strategic or longrange nuclear arsenals the two are to meet in 
moscow on feb 7 for a twoday session that was put off a day at 
the kremlins request to prevent its overlapping with the central 
committee meeting 
shevardnadze was asked if the kremlin would sign a strategic 
arms reduction treaty that did not limit sealaunched cruise 
missiles or the us star wars program two longtime sticking 
points in negotiations 
in a written response he said we are willing to limit the 
missiles outside the treaty framework on the condition that the 
relevant provisions will be recorded concurrently with the treaty 
will be mandatory and subject to verification 
we are willing to sign and implement a start treaty even 
without agreement on space if the sides continue to observe the 
abm antiballistic missile treaty as signed in 1972 
shevardnadze said 
noting that was an offer he made when he and baker met in 
jackson wyo last fall the soviet negotiator added it is to 
be hoped that secretary baker will bring to moscow adequate 
responses to our initiatives 
shevardnadze said soviet and us efforts to work together in 
solving potentially explosive regional conflicts led to the 
political settlement that helped namibia achieve independence 
the machinery to promote a cambodian settlement is shifting 
into higher gear he added and borrowing a phrase from the 
vietnam era he added it seems we can now see the light at the 
end of the tunnel there 
he called on israel to take advantage of the opportunities 
that are there to find peace in the middle east and said a 
political settlement in afghanistan is literally knocking on the 
door reliance on military force has outlived itself 
taking one jab at the united states for the dec 20 invasion of 
panama shevardnadze said the peace process in central america 
has traveled a long and difficult path in this connection the 
us action against panama undertaken at a very crucial period for 
that region gives rise to grave concern we have expressed our 
attitude toward the use of force toward contempt for international 
law 
we hope that a sense of realism will prevail in washington and 
that respect will be shown for the legitimate interests of central 
american states and their right to free choice

phil donahue claims competition from 
tabloid television is causing his 23yearold talk show 
increasingly to buck serious subjects for sensational issues that 
will draw an audience 
recent donahue shows have featured zsa zsa gabor and the 
australian tavern practice of dwarftossing 
i didnt toss the dwarfs protested donahue someone else 
did it and demonstrated that its being done actually as a 
commercial activity i dont apologize for a moment that i exposed 
this activity on my program its important 
there was a time when donahue could build his 60minute show 
around a single politician and focus a discussion on one issue 
now donahue said the only congressional representative he 
could construct a show around would be rep barney frank the 
homosexual democrat from massachusetts 
if you dont understand how we survive in tv no argument i 
make is going to make a difference donahue said in an interview 
published in sundays los angeles times we get paid to draw a 
crowd when we dont draw a crowd we dont get paid

the coast guard is opposing a planned 18000seat 
amphitheater at the metrozoo saying it could interfere with the 
war on drugs 
the amphitheater would lead to road congestion and noise 
problems for the 400 coast guard personnel and family members 
stationed at a nearby command post thats used to monitor drug 
traffic off florida cmdr george johnson has told dade county 
officials 
were not against the project per se but were against moving 
forward with it until the concerns weve expressed are dealt 
with said johnson who has asked the south florida regional 
planning council to delay action on the plans 
zoo officials say the amphitheater may help alleviate financial 
problems at the park about 15 miles south of miami 
under the present plan houstonbased pace entertainment would 
get a longterm lease for the amphitheater and metrozoo would 
receive a percentage of its income 
zev bufman one of the projects backers said the developers 
are planning to present blueprints and other details to the coast 
guard next month 
our architects and engineers will gladly sit down with their 
people and make whatever changes they recommend so they feel 
secure said bufman a coowner of the national basketball 
associations miami heat

white house reporters are mostly joking when 
they say they are nervous about covering the drug summit in 
cartagena colombia next month mostly but not entirely 
my mother has said plaintively to me dont go to 
colombia said one journalist who spoke on condition of 
anonymity what do you do i dont want to lie to her 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater says the secret service 
is confident it can provide protection for president bush in 
colombia on feb 15 but it has no authority to do the same for 
reporters 
some journalists said they have discussed the possible danger of 
the assignment but for the most part reporters covering the 
president regard it as part of their job 
its a trip said michel mcqueen of the wall street journal 
hes going so im going thats the way that goes 
under usual procedure a white house press pool of 11 reporters 
would travel on air force one and spend about four hours on the 
ground while bush meets with colombian president virgilio barco and 
officials of peru and bolivia on feb 15 
a larger contingent of reporters would fly in with the president 
in a chartered press plane with some organizations sending crews 
ahead of time on their own 
plans were thrown into uncertainty however by reports this 
week that colombian drug lords are plotting to shoot down the 
presidential plane although the white house scoffed at the 
reports cbs news said the secret service was considering other 
ways of taking the president to colombia no details were provided 
fitzwater said wednesday there was a good chance the white 
house would put most of the press in another country such as 
panama costa rica or venezuela during the summit taking only the 
small pool to colombia 
tentative plans called for the white house to set up facilities 
for the press at a commercial airport at cartagena near the 
expected summit site 
the white house spokesman said he talked with a number of 
reporters and they were generally favorable to having the filing 
center in another country 
meanwhile reporters cluster around the signup sheet in the 
white house press room looking at the names and joking about 
these brave souls or these idiots or whatever said karen 
hosler of the baltimore sun 
i am not worried about it she said but my family and 
friends have raised some questions 
movements of the press corps making the trip with bush are 
expected to be severely limited 
one reporter said the journalists most concerned were those who 
would be going down separately ahead of time 
if i were going in with bush i would feel a little better but 
i dont speak spanish even said this reporter speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
bill headline washington bureau chief of cable news network 
said we have had some informal discussion among producers and 
white house reporters but have not really decided what we ought to 
do and what not to do we will be looking at that in the next few 
days 
tim russert bureau chief for nbc news said we are still 
basically waiting for the white house as to what kind of 
arrangements will be made in terms of the president journalists 
want to report the news but people arent suicidal either so we 
will take every possible precaution that guarantees our peoples 
lives and still allows us to report the story 
russert said nbc cameramen are routinely provided with flak 
jackets for use on dangerous assignments and are certainly free 
to wear them whether they are reporting here or in colombia 
george watson washington bureau chief for abc news said the 
white house has indicated the secret service will do all that it 
can to protect the media in a more intensive fashion than they 
normally would do none of our producers correspondents or crews 
has declined to go or indicated in any way they dont want the 
assignment 
barbara cohen bureau chief at cbs said there had been no 
reluctance there either 
in the press corps in general theres the normal joking and 
kidding but thats very predictable said jim gerstenzang white 
house correspondent for the los angeles times 
nicholas horrock bureau chief for the chicago tribune said he 
and one other washington reporter were making the trip im 
looking at the guy horrock joked if hes reluctant to go to 
cartagena im going to kill him

gerard f scannell shudders when he recalls 
the amputations that some pharmaceutical workers suffered before he 
instituted safety reforms at johnson amp johnson plants worldwide 
as the head of the occupational safety and health 
administration hes banking on the conviction that corporate 
executives share that feeling 
but as a former executive himself he believes compassion can be 
bolstered by the bottom line safety expenditures save money in the 
long run 
he draws the conclusion from 11 years directing corporate safety 
for the new brunswick njbased drug giant where workplace 
injuries dropped more than 90 percent during his tenure 
i made money for them he says safety does pay 
at the labor department scannell began translating some of that 
corporatemindedness to safeguarding the nations workplaces even 
before his october confirmation 
my plan is to get to those ceos he says i was on the 
firing line out there in industry i think i know what im talking 
about and i think people know that its not going to be easy for 
people to bluff me 
health threats abound in office and factory air in dangerous 
machinery on construction sites in stresses and strains from 
unnatural movements scannell is worried about repetitive strain 
injuries in everything from the wrists of word processing typists 
to the arms of meatpackers 
he hopes to begin attacking the latter class of problems by 
releasing ergonomic guidelines for the red meat industry in 
february 
his agency also is battling dentists who argue they cannot 
afford to meet proposed standards to protect health workers from 
bloodborne pathogens that cause hepatitis and aids scannell hopes 
to get those standards in place by years end 
scannell 54 has hopscotched between jobs in government and 
industry including safety posts with aetna casualty amp surety co 
thiokol chemical corp and rohm amp haas co and a stint at osha 
from 1971 to 1979 he has shown a willingness to confront possible 
detractors by seeking out labor leaders industry officials 
academics doctors anyone who will listen 
one of the adversaries he faced is safety gadfly joseph kinney 
executive director of the nonprofit national safe workplace 
institute in chicago 
scannell is deeply committed to making progress kinney said 
in a telephone interview he came here twice it was kind of a 
surprise when he called us i said are you sure youve got the 
right organization 
after all kinney says government had not previously 
appreciated his groups work the reagan administration hated us 
passionately 
kinney is waiting to see whether scannell continues slapping 
companies with large fines such as the 73 million against usx 
corp last november for alleged safety recordkeeping and health 
violations 
but scannell prides himself most on being a negotiator who can 
elicit voluntary compliance from a company rather than collect a 
stiff fine while bad practices continue 
if i can get better protection for workers by lowering 
penalties im going to do it im going to extract more out of you 
in promises than i can probably legally cite you for scannell 
says i want more than what the standards require 
those who know scannell say that as the first person to 
dismantle a live sidewinder missile back in the late 1950s he did 
so as a navy explosives expert he knows what safety means 
but others worry he will be hamstrung by the office of 
management and budget 
scannell says he could use double the budget and personnel but 
notes labor secretary elizabeth dole has won from congress another 
149 million and 179 new inspectors 
i have the support to make things happen he says 
margaret seminario associate director for occupational safety 
and health at the aflcio sees promise with scannell serving under 
mrs dole 
my impression of him is hes a serious individual who wants to 
run a serious effective health and safety program she says 
although she doesnt doubt mrs doles commitment to a stronger 
osha she says questions remain about whether the white house and 
omb are similarly committed 
shes hopeful scannell can resist industry pressures to weaken 
proposed standards for bloodborne pathogens and work in confined 
spaces such as tanks and manholes 
jordan barab health and safety coordinator for the 12 million 
workers of the american federation of state county and municipal 
employees said he was encouraged when scannell reached out to 
labor before his confirmation and included a labor panel at the 
fall osha managers meeting 
his heart is in the right place barab says under reagan 
we always had the feeling bureaucrats at best wanted to do nothing 
and at worst wanted to dismantle

the number of poor americans has swelled 
but fewer people are using food stamps a paradoxical decline 
thats no surprise to participants 
its the same old story said mildred lee 76 of raleigh 
i had a hell of a hassle to get them ten dollars werent worth 
the hassle i had to go through 
mrs lee whose monthly income is a 406 social security check 
has been receiving about 10 a month in food stamps for a year 
analysts see many reasons for the food stamp decline an 
economic rebound reagan administration regulations and an outcry 
against assistance 
many also say mrs lee is right red tape keeps people away 
i think the declining rates have been a sign of the success of 
the economy but i think there are still plenty of people out there 
in need said phil shanholtzer a spokesman for the us 
department of agricultures food and nutrition service 
participation declined to an average of 188 million in 1988 
from 198 million in 1980 while the number of people living in 
poverty rose to 325 million in 1987 from 293 million in 1980 
according to the center on budget and policy priorities a 
nonprofit research group based in washington 
these figures are rather striking director robert 
greenstein said essentially we now know that the program has 
effectively been tightened and reduced in scope considerably 
more than has commonly been recognized 
food stamp usage has plunged in the northeast midatlantic and 
southeast during the 1980s according a statebystate study by the 
washingtonbased public voice advocacy group 
the greatest gains have come in the southwest the high plains 
and midwest where poverty rates also have been running higher 
participating households now are forced to make a monthly 
economic status forcing some eligible people to wonder why 
bother 
one of the dropouts is a former lenoir county resident who 
remained eligible even after she landed a job as a waitress 
the truth is see i worked and i got a little bit of child 
support and each month i had to fill out a monthly report said 
the 35yearold mother who was single at the time it was not 
worth the hassle of having to go up there and do a monthly report 
but when i did get them sometimes they helped a lot without them 
we would have starved 
the woman who spoke on the condition of anonymity said she 
received between 10 and 100 a month 
even when i got the 10 the 10 would help get a little extra 
something special for my daughter she said maybe she would 
want a hamburgers or pizza or something we didnt eat maybe with 
that 10 i would get her a small frozen pizza 
federal officials question any strict correlation between food 
stamp usage and the growing poor 
the two usually go hand in hand but that has been less so in 
the past few years and they dont know exactly why that is 
shanholtzer said weve heard too that some people dont 
participate because of the hassle involved 
in north carolina where participation is down more than 32 
percent from 10 years ago a task force is studying the programs 
waning popularity 
in addition to a low jobless rate federal policy changes that 
began around 1980 have had a tremendous impact said kay 
fields chief of public assistance in the state division of social 
services 
for example families living under the same roof such as a 
single woman with no children who is living with her parents can 
no longer receive a food stamp allotment separate from her parents 
fields said 
federal outreach funds also were cut in half during the 1980s 
she said 
and in rural areas smalltown pride increasingly appears to be 
winning out over need an attitude encouraged during the reagan 
years 
while participation fell in the southeast it grew 104 percent 
in the midwest and 183 percent in the high plains the first seven 
years of the decade 
wyoming experiencing an economic downturn due to lower oil 
prices had a jump of 81 percent over the last decade the state 
increased its outreach efforts to boost participation among 
lowincome elderly 
wyoming north carolina and other states are considering new 
approaches such as a food stamp credit card to help remove the 
stigma and cut down on lost and theft of stamps 
but others say participation wont increase until the benefit 
does 
the benefits arent really high enough said jane peel of 
new hampshires division of human services

new questions are being raised about 
armysponsored research on animals following the removal of a 
review panel member who voiced concerns about bonebreaking 
experiments on retired greyhound dogs 
the public would be outraged at the excessive amount of tax 
dollars that are being wasted on research which does not contribute 
to human health jan polon said this month shortly after her 
removal from the voluntary post on the animal use committee at 
californias letterman army institute of research 
polon an occupational therapist and the lone public 
representative on the review panel had expressed opposition to 
several animal experiments over four years 
but she blames her dismissal on two letters she sent to 
officials at letterman one complaining about the inadequate time 
committee members had to review protocols and reference documents 
the other requesting further review of the research protocol on the 
greyhound experiment 
the decision by officials at letterman located at the presidio 
in california prompted rep barbara boxer dcalif to question 
the operation at the research facility 
it seems clear that lair does not want any questions asked 
about what is going on behind closed doors boxer said in a jan 
5 letter to army col donald g corby commander of letterman 
the california democrat urged corby to reconsider his decision 
since it is certain to be perceived as punitive action which only 
elevates public concern about what is going on at lair 
a spokesman at the presidio said polon was simply let go and 
army officials in letters to boxer have steadfastly defended the 
experiments 
this research effort even to an untrained observer is not a 
waste of money or animals army maj gen philip k russell 
medical corps commander at the army medical research and 
development command at fort detrick md said in an oct 5 1989 
letter 
the removal of polon is just the latest controversy surrounding 
the experiments on greyhounds which has drawn members of congress 
animal rights activists defense department officials and 
representatives from the scientific community into the fray 
the experiments are on hold the result of language in the 
defense spending bill for fiscal 1990 prohibiting money for the 
tests until the army secretary certifies that the research has a 
military application meets specific guidelines set by an animal 
use committee and is not duplicative 
the experiments involve removing a piece of bone from the hind 
leg of each dog and replacing it with a synthetic compound after 
two months the greyhounds are killed and their legs examined to 
determine the effectiveness of the compound 
the purpose of the experiments on 118 dogs according to the 
army is to find better ways to treat battlefield wounds boxer 
argues that several physicians and veterinarians as well as the 
physicians committee for responsible medicine believe the 
experiments serve little scientific purpose and cause unnecessary 
suffering for the animals 
some physicians have suggested using dogs who have already 
suffered bone injuries boxer says 
the army in response said the tests must be conducted on 
uniform animals to prevent inconsistent findings the service is 
supported by several major organizations including the association 
of american universities the association of american medical 
colleges the academy of surgical research auburn university 
columbia university and the western surgical association 
in letters to boxer the groups have countered the criticism and 
stressed the importance of the experiments 
the proposed research project has been carefully reviewed by 
scientists and is most emphatically not an example of animal abuse 
faulty science or unnecessary research dr ralph b dell of 
columbia university said in a nov 3 letter 
animal research responsibly and humanely conducted saves 
human lives dr m ward crowe of the university of kentucky said 
in a nov 22 letter animal life is not equal to human life 
but dr elliot katz a veterinarian who heads the animal rights 
group in defense of animals said the greyhound experiments at 
letterman go against the grain of scientific standard operating 
procedure 
complicating the debate over the testing at letterman was the 
initial disclosure that the dogs may have been illegally sold to 
the army owners who thought they had given their dogs to racing 
circuits and local hospitals found out they had been sold to the 
army for the experiments 
the army later released 19 dogs to their owners or animal rights 
activists for adoption the service also promised to investigate 
possible legal action against the dealer who sold them the dogs 
boxer said the house armed services committee plans hearings on 
the issue 
polons removal is a terrible signal it says if you dont 
go along with the program youre out boxer said in a recent 
telephone interview its a slap to her a slap at me and a slap 
at taxpayers

president bush worshipping with a black 
congregation says it is time for all americans to reject racism 
and bigotry and accept the biblical admonition love thy 
neighbor 
bush today was sending congress his 123 trillion budget for 
fiscal 1991 and later was addressing the national religious 
broadcasters convention and meeting with douglas hurd britains 
new foreign secretary 
on sunday before watching the super bowl on television with 
friends and family the president and wife barbara attended 
services at john wesley ame zion church where a former bush 
aide was preaching 
bush briefly ascended the pulpit to speak out again about the 
stillunsolved racial violence that last month claimed the lives of 
a federal judge in alabama and a civil rights lawyer in georgia 
bush spoke of the new blossoming of liberty unfolding in 
eastern europe and elsewhere around the world and said it is 
exciting and our great country has played an important role in 
promoting this new breeze of freedom and working for peace 
but i am reminded we can only be a great nation abroad if we 
are a great nation at home said bush as voices in the 
congregation responded amen 
let us recommit ourselves to work for justice and for unity of 
all people and let me add no more letter bombs no more racism 
leave the entire baggage of bigotry behind said the president 
its about time in this country that we replace racism and 
bigotry with love thy neighbor said the president 
bush came to the church to hear the guest preacher thaddeus 
garrett whom he called my old friend and trusted adviser 
garrett a top aide when bush was vice president is now a 
private consultant here as well as associate pastor of wesley 
temple ame zion church in akron ohio 
bush and the minister joked that bush had asked garrett to keep 
the sermon short 
theyre episcopalians and they dont understand that 
sometimes we carry on a little bit said garrett who proceeded 
to deliver a pounding footstomping 20minute sermon based on a 
passage in luke 83135 about a naked crazy man who lived in a 
cemetery until jesus drove out his demons 
garrett likened him to todays homeless that people step over on 
their way to work every morning 
the world around him was sicker than he was because it 
provided no housing for him provided no comfort for him no care 
no love said the preacher 
it is not him who is sick it is we who pass him by said 
garrett 
he ended with an exhortation to the congregation to help those 
wandering through the cemeteries of life

president bushs nominee for the nations 
top civil rights job is white wealthy and not known for quoting 
martin luther kings i have a dream speech 
even the nominee himself former state sen john dunne says 
hes no civil rights activist 
nobody in candor can say i have been an outfront visible 
civil rights activist dunne 59 said last week those who 
criticize me for that have a factual basis 
but he added while i may not have been leading the charge i 
was certainly among the faithful 
on thursday bush nominated dunne to be assistant attorney 
general for civil rights a post that has been vacant since 
december 1988 bushs first choice william lucas failed to win 
senate confirmation last august 
dunne spent 24 years in the state senate where he was chairman 
of the judiciary committee he resigned in september after losing a 
battle for republican majority leader 
norman siegel executive director of the new york civil 
liberties union said that dunne has been invisible on civil 
rights issues 
ive never seen john dunne speak out or up on civil rights 
matters in any form added hazel dukes president of new yorks 
chapter of the national association for the advancement of colored 
people 
dunnes supporters said that in the republicancontrolled state 
senate it was dunne who championed confidentiality in aids testing 
and equality in rates for women seeking to buy insurance 
hes a man of unimpeachable integrity said new york court 
of appeals judge fritz alexander a democrat and the only black 
member of new yorks liberal top court hes a right thinker in 
terms of what needs to be done in society and with civil rights 
some of dunnes old friends say he is simply a product of his 
staunch republican background they say that while hes no 
hardcore conservative hes also not a trail blazer a sort of 
new york version of president bush 
dunne has that dapper country club look educated at georgetown 
and yale law school he is a partner in one of new yorks major law 
firms he lives in the affluent long island community garden city 
until last week dunne belonged to a menonly country club he 
ended his 32year membership in the garden city golf club after it 
was reported by his local newspaper he said his membership was 
inappropriate 
while in albany dunne regularly stayed at the exclusive fort 
orange club near the capitol the club began allowing women members 
just last year 
when inmates took over attica prison in 1971 they wanted dunne 
to help resolve the crisis dunne went to attica and was highly 
critical of thengov nelson rockefellers handling of the prisons 
retaking during which 39 inmates and guards were killed dunne 
then helped force changes in the states prison system 
its that sort of thing thats made dunne something of an 
enigma and his nomination by bush something of surprise 
its not that hes bad in these issues its that he doesnt 
really have a record on them said thomas stoddard of the lambda 
legal defense fund a homosexual rights group on the other hand 
he could have taken a leadership role on civil rights issues and 
didnt he was hardly an advocate 
others see the choice differently 
if the president has to pick a republican he couldnt pick a 
more decent person than john dunne said rep charles rangel a 
new york city democrat and one of congress most influential black 
members 
rangel said dunne has the legal experience that lucas did not 
a friendship with attorney general dick thornburgh brought 
dunnes name to the attention of the white house dunne was an 
early supporter of bush and is close to the presidents brother 
new york city investment consultant jonathan bush

the bitter sectarian warfare in azerbaijan has 
a senior bush administration analyst suggesting the soviet 
government may be mired in a situation comparable to northern 
ireland or lebanon 
no political solution is in sight no military solution is in 
sight said one administration source the caucasian region is 
on the way to becoming another lebanon or northern ireland 
dozens of people have died in the civil warfare in the southern 
soviet republic where moslem azerbaijanis have been fighting 
armenian christians and the red army 
but administration analysts for the time being have dismissed 
one worstcase scenario in which the violence might spread to 
other moslem areas of the soviet union or beyond 
a noted nongovernment analyst on soviet nationalities said he 
did not expect ethnic fighting in central asia to reach the 
intensity it has in soviet caucasia a mountainous southern region 
that includes the republics of armenia azerbaijan and georgia 
but the analyst paul goble said no end is in sight to the 
bloodletting in those three tumultuous republics 
there have been so many deaths in those three republics that 
with the tradition of blood feud in the caucasus you killed my 
sister i will now go kill your brother you are going to have 
constant incidents that will start this up again said goble who 
recently left the intelligence division of the state department to 
work at radio liberty the usfunded radio station that 
broadcasts to the soviet union 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev could have prevented much of 
the violence if he had quashed early demands by armenians to take 
over nagornokarabakh a region that is populated mostly by 
armenians but is administered by azerbaijan said goble calling 
kremlin policy on ethnic issues awkward and unenlightened 
it is very frightening in a sense given all this ethnic 
assertiveness you have a government in moscow which is 
increasingly out of step with that development goble told a 
small group of reporters recently 
gorbachev is the first soviet leader since lenin never to have 
worked in a nonrussian republic a single day in his career and 
the first to come to power ever without a single programmatic 
statement on nationality policy he said 
in caucasia even if gorbachev granted the demand of azerbaijani 
activists to unite as a separate country with ethnic azerbaijanis 
in neighboring iran the soviets likely would face crossborder 
fighting between the new nation and soviet armenia both goble and 
a senior administration analyst agreed 
president bush in a news conference on thursday said he did 
not object to gorbachevs use of force in azerbaijan 
i want very much for him to succeed bush said and i 
dont think anyone is faulting him for the difficulties that he has 
encountered in azerbaijan 
azerbaijan is separated from the republics of central asia by 
the caspian sea but both populations are largely moslem and speak 
dialects of turkish 
the central asians are unlikely to engage in radical opposition 
to gorbachev because they are very poor and depend on heavy 
subsidies from moscow said goble 
in central asia there is absolutely no move toward 
independence said goble 
the fighting probably will not spark unrest in central asia 
said the administration source there are other factors at work 
behind discontent in the central asian republics he said citing 
high unemployment rates a shortage of drinking water and a soaring 
infant mortality rate 
the cia has recently finished a study that reached the same 
conclusion an administration source said 
the people of azerbaijan are mostly shiite moslems like the 
majority in iran most people in the central asian republics of 
uzbekistan turkmenistan kirghizia and tadzhikistan speak 
different dialects of turkish and are by and large sunni moslems 
like the population of afghanistan to the south

although it may be some time before the dust 
settles from political upheavals in eastern europe and the soviet 
union an agriculture department think tank is already looking at 
the future of agricultural trade in the region 
the centrally planned economies branch of the departments 
economic research service used a computer model to estimate what 
eastern europe may buy and sell in the next decade or so says an 
article in the february issue of farmline magazine 
analysts said that for the region as a whole the best us 
export prospects are textiles highvalue processed foods and 
similar light industrial goods 
by nation the analysts expect increased grain purchases by 
yugoslavia poland czechoslovakia and bulgaria but average or 
lessthanaverage purchases by the soviet union the report said 
the computer study also indicated a general upward trend in 
oilseed imports by the east europeans 
hungary is expected to find it advantageous to export grain 
and import livestock and yugoslavia could become a livestock 
importer the report said poland and bulgaria are expected to 
increase livestock imports 
but the region has many political and economic challenges as the 
individual countries with the exception of albania adopt some 
form of market system and shift away from centrally planned 
economies 
key goals of all the nations are first to make their 
currencies fully exchangeable with other currencies a status 
known as convertibility and second to remove controls over 
prices and wages the report said 
although some of the countries get around convertibility 
problems by using some forms of barter us businesses prefer hard 
currency as of early january hungary poland and east germany 
were seen as making the most progress toward convertibility 
the soviet union has a twostepsforward oneback approach 
toward lifting economic controls the report said the usda 
specialists say moscow appears to be concerned about the 
speculative trading opportunities offered by an open marketplace 
and it does not want to be considered an ally of the middleman

agriculture department scientists say many 
farm crops show good resistance to acid rain and that there is a 
possibility of developing even tougher strains 
a team at the agricultural research services laboratory in 
raleigh nc exposed 216 varieties of 18 crops to simulated acid 
rain many times more acidic than found now in the eastern united 
states 
the simulated acid rain caused no significant injury nor did

tomatoes eggplant snapbeans cotton peanuts and soybeans 
were the only crops whose leaves showed damage of more than 5 
percent after the onehour exposure the report said the most 
sensitive variety of tomato had as much as 24 percent of its leaf 
area damaged by the single exposure 
but at the other end of the scale potatoes corn lettuce 
winter wheat orchardgrass melons fescue cucumbers alfalfa 
clover and squash all had less than 2 percent leaf damage 
crops that suffered the greatest damage in the shorterterm 
acute tests also registered the most damage in chronic tests for up

leaf damage varied greatly by varieties for tomatoes and 
soybeans raising the possibility of breeding hardier strains of 
acidresistant crops if those are needed someday the report said

a recently ordained homosexual priest said 
he may start his own church if he is forced to resign from the 
episcopal clergy because of his belief that monogamy is unnecessary 
for a christian relationship 
the rev j robert williams resigned saturday from oasis a 
church program ministering to homosexuals but said sunday he will 
remain an episcopal priest at all saints episcopal church in 
hoboken 
im not making a decision to leave the church unless they 
force me to leave the church williams said before i got 
ordained i was thinking of starting my own church and that may be 
something that ill have to do after all in order to tell the 
truth 
bishop john s spong said he will request an investigation of 
williams by the diocese of newark and may ask the priest to resign 
if he does not agree to uphold the principles of monogamy espoused 
by the church 
spong who said the diocese would find a replacement for 
williams in the oasis program ordained williams last month despite 
objections of many conservative episcopalians 
williams a texas native provoked further controversy at a jan 
13 church forum in detroit by calling monogamy as unnatural as 
celibacy the comments were carried by the religious news 
service the starledger reported sunday 
spong said in a statement that williams would not have been 
ordained had church officials known of his views on monogamy he 
said officials were unaware of it although williams had been 
screened for ordination for two years 
his own life needs to be conducted according to the same 
standards applied to all priests homosexual or heterosexual 
spong wrote if mr williams is not able to conform to the 
standards of this diocese then his resignation would be 
requested 
spong said he asked williams to apologize but the priest said 
he has no intention of changing his views on monogamy 
williams said few heterosexual or homosexual couples are 
faithful 
i think monogamy is an option he said some couples 
choose it and some couples dont i believe you can have a 
successful and a christian relationship either way 
the priest said he felt that spong was using him as a scapegoat 
for the pressure he was feeling from church authorities over his 
ordination 
williams has said hundreds of episcopal priests are homosexual 
but most keep their sexual orientation private the general 
convention of the episcopal church in 1979 approved a resolution 
saying it is inappropriate for the church to ordain a practicing 
homosexual 
williams 34 has lived with james skelly 39 a hospital 
administrator for four years

the world bank says people in countries that 
have gone deeply into debt enjoy higher living standards than the 
average third world country 
the bank calculates that third world countries owe a total of 
13 trillion some are in trouble with their creditors and have 
tried austerity measures to grow out of their difficulties but 
they still seem to be in constant crisis 
in many ways however debt seems to have little effect on their 
progress 
mexico the largest third world debtor after brazil has 
completed the biggest and most difficult arrangement yet for 
reducing the burden of the 104 billion it owes using the strategy 
proposed last year by treasury secretary nicholas f brady 
reduction in the actual debt is expected to be small because 
there also will be new lending to mexico more important is a 
reduction expected in the 7 billion that has been flowing out of 
the country every year mostly as interest and repayment of 
principal 
compared with many third world countries mexico is fairly well 
off the world bank found in 1988 the average mexican earned the 
equivalent of 1820 compared with 1970 for what the bank calls 
the average middleincome country a group that includes such 
diverse countries as malaysia and poland 
the bank this week distributed to reporters its social 
indicators of development the document includes only approximate 
dates because some countries compile their figures more quickly 
than others so that the latest statistics available come from

a us human rights groups investigation 
concludes that contra rebel forces were responsible for the new 
years day ambush and killing of two roman catholic nuns including 
an american in nicaragua 
the private human rights group americas watch said in a 
53page report sunday that its investigation which included 
numerous interviews and other data obtained in nicaragua found 
that the ambush was conducted by contra forces the report said it 
appears the attack was not aimed specifically at the nuns 
the two nuns including sister maureen courtney 45 of 
milwaukee wis were killed when the white pickup in which they 
were riding came under attack on a remote highway 165 miles 
northeast of managua a bishop and another nun survived the attack 
the contra rebels have denied any involvement 
it is our conclusion based on this investigation that those 
responsible were a unit of the rebel resistencia nicaraguense or 
contras firing indiscriminately at the vehicle without warning to 
stop but also without knowledge that the vehicle belonged to the 
church the report by americas watch said 
the group had been asked by five members of congress to 
investigate the shooting

the real estate agent dubbed robin hud who 
admitted stealing millions in federal housing funds and claimed she 
gave much of it to the poor said she sees prison as a chance to go 
to college 
marilyn louise harrell said she planned to plead guilty today at 
the start of her us district court trial 
she is accused of stealing more than 5 million in government 
funds lying to federal officials and filing false tax returns 
i dont want to spend taxpayers money in a court 
proceeding the 46yearold real estate agent from waldorf told 
the sun newspaper in a story published friday 
under an agreement with federal prosecutors harrell said she 
agreed to plead guilty to stealing government property and failing 
to report income for taxes 
in return she said prosecutors agreed to drop two other tax 
counts two counts of lying to hud officials and one count of lying 
to a bank on a loan application 
the two charges she said she would admit to carried a maximum 
sentence of 13 years in prison but she said that under federal 
sentencing guidelines she could serve 2 to 3 years in prison 
if convicted on all seven counts harrell would have faced up to 
31 years in prison and more than 1 million in fines 
harrell and her lawyer anthony r gallagher have unlisted 
telephone numbers and could not be reached for comment sunday the 
sun said gallagher declined to comment friday 
us attorney breckinridge willcox declined to comment sunday 
harrell said she hoped to be sentenced to perform community 
service but saw prison as a chance to get a college degree 
i told the kids just think of it as mom going away a few years 
for college harrell said of her son john and his wife vicki 
last year harrell told a congressional committee she took 
millions in us department of housing and urban development money 
and used most of it to buy cars and housing for the needy 
prosecutors said harrell took at least 567 million from hud 
money generated by sales of hud properties that harrell handled as 
a private escrow agent for the agency 
prosecutors acknowledged some of the money went to charities 
but alleged she spent most of the money on herself and her family 
but harrell said she has documents to prove that she took only 
475 million in hud funds and that less than 6 percent of the 
money benefited her family 
harrell said she has prepared herself for imprisonment since 
1985 when she started diverting hud funds 
i really truthfully consider it an honor to give up years of 
my life to help some of the people ive helped she said 
harrell who confessed to government officials in december 1988 
became a symbol of mismanagement at hud when scandal erupted there 
last summer following her indictment last november us attorney 
general dick thornburgh said the case was the largest involving the 
theft of federal funds by an individual

when the monroe township groundhog 
society members meet they shake hands and then snort at each other 
the snort as a form of greeting is no laughing matter to a 
society in which members wear fake fur and groundhog hoods with 
ears according to dr david steele the groups historian 
the society requires the 18 members to pass the snort test and 
take at least one snort a year 
the society was formed in 1929 but folded in 1935 with the 
discovery of some old society papers the group reemerged last 
january 
steele said that many people cant understand why a grown man 
wants to become a groundhog member although the civic group raises 
funds for community projects in the central indiana town about 30 
miles northeast of indianapolis 
each year we have 1000 to 1500 to put back into the 
community at the same time we get to act silly like little 
boys he said 
and to celebrate groundhog day in proper style 
on friday at the societys annual swill breakfast on 
groundhog day member sam lower will emerge from a groundhog mound 
made of pipe bushes and canvas only after hearing the groups 
chant 
groundhog groundhog we must know is it spring or is it

more than 15000 romanians mounted the 
largest antigovernment rally since last months revolution 
breaking through a line of soldiers and threatening to come get 
the new leader from his headquarters 
interim president ion iliescu struggling to free his government 
from any association with communism and the ousted ceausescu 
regime said later sunday that opposition parties had agreed to 
broad talks 
during the rally outside government headquarters in victory 
square protesters said the ruling national salvation front should 
resign because of its decision last week to compete in elections 
many called for opposition participation in the interim 
government claiming the front is not for example allowing its 
political competitors enough access to broadcast media 
i was in the revolution i protected iliescu and the front 
because i thought they were good people but they are not they are 
liars said mihai gheorghescu an official with the opposition 
national peasants party 
the protesters had rushed through a line of armed soldiers and 
assembled at the doors of the government headquarters some 
scurried atop a halfdozen tanks guarding the building 
the crowd booed iliescu when he appeared on an upper floor of 
the building and tried to speak the protesters chanted resign 
resign and get out or well come get you out 
iliescu was named head of a loose coalition of disaffected 
communists and intellectuals who assumed power after the revolt 
ousted the 24year regime of nicolae ceausescu who was executed 
with his wife elena on dec 25 
but the front has come under intense criticism since announcing 
its intention to compete in free elections set for may 20 against 
newly formed opposition parties 
critics say the front cannot fairly compete in balloting it will 
also administer they note that it contains some former ranking 
communists and contend it supports a return to oneparty rule 
progovernment demonstrators also crowded around the building 
sunday chanting iliescu we are with you but they were 
outnumbered and outshouted by the opposition forces 
the two sides booed and hissed at each other but there was no 
violence no injuries were reported as the line of soldiers about 
75 yards from the building gave way to the crowd the soldiers then 
reformed their line five deep at the buildings entrances 
after nightfall truckloads of progovernment demonstrators were 
brought to the square some shouting that the opposition protesters 
were provocateurs and gypsies 
after the reinforcements arrived iliescu reappeared and shouted 
over a microphone that the front had met representatives of the 
three parties sponsoring the protest 
all the political parties agreed to cooperate including the 
three that sponsored this demonstration iliescu said next 
week we will continue the dialogue 
he said all of the more than 20 parties seeking to run 
candidates in the elections would meet with front leaders thursday 
earlier a spokesman with the opposition peasants party said 
that party leaders met iliescu to demand that the front give way to 
a broaderbased interim government 
a small crowd held a separate protest at the headquarters of the 
state radio and television building and demanded access to the 
media to call for the resignation of the provisional government 
about 2000 of the national salvation fronts backers held 
another rally earlier at a nearby district government building 
chanting the front is us and we are the people 
earlier sunday iliescu had criticized the antigovernment 
demonstrators in a televised speech 
to destabilize the national salvation front right now means 
destabilizing the country he said

simmering beneath the winter wonderland 
facade of this glitzy ski resort town is an emotional issue 
whether to ban the sale of furs 
led by the mayor and his wife animalrights activists are 
urging residents to vote for the citywide ban in a special election 
feb 13 
it would be the first time a us city has taken such a step 
says katharine thalberg leader of the aspen society for animal 
rights and wife of bill stirling mayor of this city of 3500 
fulltime residents 
furs are frivolous stirling said aspen is not willing to 
earn sales tax on an industry based on cruelty 
and aspen stirling said is avantgarde the first 
community in the nation to pass an antismoking law to declare 
itself a nuclearfree zone and to pass a tax specifically to 
finance the acquisition of open space 
i see aspen again being out there at the head of the pack 
he said 
opponents say the ban would infringe upon consumers freedom of 
choice and could drive away bigspending tourists 
weve made our reputation on tolerance said furrier mark 
kirkland now were wrecking that ive had letters and the 
hotels have had guests tell them that if this passes theyll find 
another ski resort to go to 
richard parsons executive director of the washington 
dcbased fur information council of america denied that fur 
farms are inhumane in their management of furbearing animals he 
sees the issue as a local political question 
it appears the mayor is trying to take his and his wifes 
personal moral agendas and legislate them said parsons furs 
today who knows what restaurant theyll tell what to serve 
tomorrow 
on the ballot with the furban plan is a proposal to scale a 70 
million ritzcarlton hotel already under construction at the base 
of aspen mountain the profur people tend also to be proritz 
thalberg says 
meanwhile stirling and three of the four other city council 
members face a march 13 recall election for their handling of both 
issues 
an underlying factor in the election is the resentment of the 
incredible wealth that has been pouring in here said dave 
danforth publisher of the aspen daily news 
danforth noted that many aspen workers are forced to live up to 
65 miles away because of escalating real estate prices 
a popular somewhat bitter line in aspen these days talks about 
the billionaires driving out the millionaires he said 
last year the average home in the area sold for 11 million 
said gary feldman president of the pitkin county board of realtors 
there are few outward signs here of the heat generated by the 
proposed fur ban aside from some antifur posters calls to radio 
talk shows and letters to the editors of the two daily newspapers 
the purchasing of furs has and always will be a marked 
distinction of wealth and of those aspiring to wealth and the ban 
of such furs will do nothing but bring ridicule to the economic 
aspirations of such a fine cultural resort town wrote donna 
maier of denver 
but patrice stinson of reston va wrote that she would love 
the opportunity to spend some time in a furfree city 
imagine the increased revenue for your city when antifur 
animal activists learn that your city is furfree she wrote 
well have someplace to go that is tailored to our lifestyles and 
conforms with our views 
stirling scoffs at claims that the ordinance would keep visitors 
away saying the same arguments were made in 1985 when the town 
adopted its strict ban on smoking in restaurants offices and just 
about all buildings except bars and private homes 
freedom of choice was constantly rearing its head during the 
smoking debate just as it is now stirling said 
his wife who owns a bookstore predicts the ban will pass she 
notes that in 1986 voters approved an ordinance banning the sale of 
furs from animals caught in a leghold trap though it proved 
unenforceable 
this ordinance does not prevent the wearing of furs 
thalberg said as for selling them well trade is not entirely 
unrestricted in this country if society for whatever reasons 
decides something shouldnt be sold then legislation is passed it 
is not being shoved down anyones throat its an election

president fidel castro of cuba in defiant 
rejection of the democratic reforms sweeping other communist 
nations has declared that his country will stick to orthodox 
communism even if moscow ends all support 
castros remarks in speeches sunday quoted in news reports 
represented the first time he has suggested the soviets might cut 
off the assistance that helps power his 31yearold revolution 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has been urging cuba to 
liberalize its political system and moscow has cut back on aid 
castro said he understood that internal problems were leading 
the kremlin to cut back on its 5 billion in annual aid to cuba an 
apparent reference to separatist movements and economic troubles 
plaguing gorbachev 
the yankees are euphoric because they believe we will be 
isolated and cannot resist there are even some who have virtually 
extended condolences because they believe the revolution will not 
survive the changes in the socialist bloc castro was quoted as 
saying in a speech 
however he was quoting as saying cuba stands ready to live 
under a wartime economy if need be virtually all of cubas 
crude oil comes from the soviet union at cutrate prices 
castro said he would brook no political liberalization 
rejecting a petition for recognition by an opposition party 
we dont want fifth columns to be created here at a time when 
everything is at stake castro was quoted as saying he said cuba 
must resist us imperialism for the sake of all latin america 
the cuban government news agency prensa latina and the mexican 
government news agency notimex filed dispatches from havana on 
castros remarks which came in a threehour speech to 2500 
delegates at the annual congress of cubas labor federation and an 
address to a rally of 15000 people protesting us plans for a 
television station to beam special programs to cuba 
the agencies were monitored in mexico city 
the cuban revolution will not back down one millimeter not 
even if it is totally blockaded by the united states or if the 
soviet union totally cuts off its supplies said castro 
we have prepared ourselves to engage in the struggle by all 
the people in defense of socialism he said warning that cubans 
may have to tighten their belts and live at peace but under a 
wartime economy 
it will not be here where the history of other countries will 
be able to repeat itself and those who want to play at 
counterrevolution are going to have to face the people castro 
was quoted as saying in reference to demonstrations that have 
overthrown communist governments in eastern europe 
castro in power since a popular revoluton ousted dictator 
fulgencio batista in 1959 has staunchly resisted any talk of 
liberalizing his rule 
the sudden fall of president nicolae ceausescu of romania in 
december gave rise to speculation that cuba or albania would be the 
next country to undergo major changes 
in his remarks on yankee euphoria castro may have been 
referring to reports that the miami police department has 
established a contingency plan to control celebrations by cuban 
exiles if castro falls 
the united states imposed a trade and financial embargo on cuba 
more than 20 years ago accusing the island nations government of 
inciting revolution in other nations 
in his speech castro confirmed reports that his government had 
rejected a petition from the miamibased christian democratic party 
to be given legal status and allowed to take part in politics 
the secret of cuban resistance in these 30 years of revolution 
has been the unity of the government the people and the party and 
a multiparty system would only result in internal weakening 
castro was quoted as saying

social democrat oskar 
lafontaine has risen with an electoral triumph from the shadows of 
regional office to position himself as chancellor helmut kohls 
challenger in decembers federal elections 
the 46yearold governor of tiny saarland state an 
independentminded leftist led his party to resounding victory in 
regional balloting sunday virtually assuring his nomination as the 
partys candidate for chancellor 
kohls conservative christian democratic union was handed the 
latest in a string of local setbacks the free democrats his 
centrist partner in the governing bonn coalition also lost seats 
nationally wellknown and respected as a tough career 
politician lafontaine would be strong opposition in kohls bid for 
a third fouryear term as west german leader 
sundays vote in saarland was an unexpectedly strong endorsement 
for lafontaines entry into national politics as his party widened 
its absolute majority in the state parliament 
lafontaines campaign focused on the economic and social impacts 
of the wave of east germans resettling in west germany and the 
elections outcome illustrated the publics growing resentment over 
the influx 
the social democrats polled 544 compared with 334 percent for 
the christian democratic union and 56 percent for the free 
democrats 
the environmentalist greens party polled 27 percent short of 
the 5 percent needed to enter the regional parliament the 
ultrarightist republicans making their debut in saarland 
received 33 percent of the vote 
according to preliminary official results the social democrats 
won 30 of the parliaments 51 seats a gain of four kohls party 
won 18 down two while the free democrats dropped from five to 
three seats 
for kohl it was a damper after last falls sudden democratic 
changes in east germany stirred hopes for german reunification and 
boosted the chancellors standing 
lafontaine had urged that generous federal and state benefits 
for east german immigrants be cut to encourage them to stay at home 
and work for democratic change there 
he said sunday night that the saarland vote was a warning to 
bonn 
a majority of the population does not tolerate that one talks 
about future forms of statehood but not about current social 
problems he told west german television it is nonsensical to 
offer bounties for leaving east germany 
about 47000 east germans have fled political and economic

troops early today captured a key 
leader in last months coup attempt and the military chief said 
the arrest would severely weaken efforts to launch a new bid to 
topple the government 
brig gen edgardo abenina captured outside a house in suburban 
quezon city with two other rebel officers is believed to be the 
most important leader arrested so far in connection with the dec 
19 coup attempt 
abenina jumped a fence fleeing the troops but fell and injured a 
leg said brig gen rodolfo biazon chief of the national capital 
region defense command he then surrendered biazon said 
the two other rebel officers arrested at the hideout were a 
major and captain the military said 
biazon accused abenina of forming the coalition of soldiers and 
supporters of the late president ferdinand marcos who led the 
december attacks the sixth and bloodiest bid to oust president 
corazon aquino 
abenina was supposed to be a member of the military junta that 
would have replaced mrs aquino had the coup succeeded biazon said 
abenina a former philippine constabulary regional commander 
was believed to be the senior officer in the coup attempt 
at least 113 people were killed and more than 500 injured in the 
failed coup the most serious effort to topple mrs aquino since 
she was swept to power in the civilianmilitary uprising that 
ousted marcos in february 1986 
military chief of staff gen renato de villa said abeninas 
capture showed the determination of the armed forces to arrest 
those believed behind the coup attempt 
abeninas capture will undoubtedly weaken their movement and 
further reduce their capability to destabilize society he said 
de villa said the arrest was made possible because of the 
widespread support of concerned civilians but gave no details 
the military had offered a 45500 reward for abeninas capture 
mrs aquino told reporters she was very happy and very 
pleased about abeninas arrest and said the government would 
spare no efforts to capture all rebels still at large 
earlier this month sen joseph estrada released a letter from 
abenina in which he said the coup participants wanted to eliminate 
government corruption and usher in social economic and political 
reform 
the aquino government has failed abenina said in the 
letter it has failed to govern and ensure the safety and 
wellbeing of its citizens we need a government that reflects our 
virtues 
abenina was also implicated in an august 1987 coup attempt led 
by former lt col gregorio gringo honasan who remains at 
large abenina was removed from his command in the central city of 
cebu after that attempt

ousted panamanian dictator manuel noriega has been 
transferred from an apartmentlike holding area in the federal 
courthouse to an isolated cell in a nearby prison officials said 
noriega who faces federal drug charges had been held in the 
basement of the the downtown courthouse after being brought to the 
united states on jan 4 
he was admitted to metropolitan correctional center 25 miles 
south of miami on sunday evening said the warden stephen pontesso 
the prison is medium security but has some maximumsecurity 
cells 
pontesso refused to describe noriegas quarters in detail 
calling it simply a cell 
the miami hearld today reported that noriega was placed in a 
speciallybuilt large cell in the administration area where at 
least one guard will watch him at all times 
steven kollin a defense attorney confirmed that his client was 
being held separately from the prisons general population 
noriega who has appeared in court in his uniform wore civilian 
clothes and slumped down in the back of a station wagon as he was 
driven past the prison entrance 
he was taken there because it is the standard holding place for 
federal prisoners held in south florida said jim jones regional 
spokesman for the us bureau of prisons 
after noriega was moved kollin met with him at the prison 
our position is that he should not be at mcc kollin said 
afterward he should be at homestead air force base as a 
temporary measure because he is a prisoner of war and he should be 
at homestead only to await transfer to a neutral third country 
on friday us district judge william hoeveler ordered noriega 
held without bond after he and his attorneys refused to participate

some teenagers taking the college 
boards probably were surprised to see the person in the next chair 
had not quite reached puberty 
more than 35 percent of the 250000 students who take the 
standardized achievement test in january are 12 and 13 years old 
said roy nicosia of the educational testing service which develops 
and administers the test 
the threehour exam measures aptitude in math vocabulary 
reading comprehension and grammar and is used by 1600 american 
colleges to help determine admissions according to ets 
under a program called project talent the test usually 
reserved for juniors seniors and the occasional sophomore is open 
to seventh graders who excel in their schools 
whiz kids who score well on the test get to take advanced 
classes during summer school 
im a little nervous because i just feel im going to do bad 
because its for older kids and im not going to be able to do 
it said jennifer twomey 12 a seventh grader at the lincoln 
middle school in brookline 
jennifer who took the test saturday qualified for the talent 
search by scoring among the top 3 percent on an achievement test 
the town requires of its sixth graders said pam capece a lincoln 
guidance counselor 
i didnt even know people took the sats when they were in 
seventh grade jennifer said when i found out about it i was 
excited i wanted to see if i could do it 
johns hopkins university in baltimore coordinates the talent 
search for 19 states in the northeast and district of columbia 
duke university the university of colorado and northwestern 
university cover gifted students from the rest of the country 
linda barnett director of talent identification at hopkins 
said most of the seventh graders take the test simply to see how 
they do 
it doesnt carry the same kind of pressure that a junior or 
senior would feel its not going to affect whether they get into 
college she said 
thats not to say 12yearolds are too young to start thinking 
about college the program was designed to better prepare the 
brightest students for the rigors of higher education she said 
we want them to start thinking about it so when they are 
juniors or seniors they dont say omigosh why didnt i take more 
math barnett said 
not everyone agrees with that philosophy jennifer was one of 12 
students eligible for the program from lincoln but not all 
qualified students participate capece said 
its a very hard test said capece its extremely 
difficult and a lot of childrens parents dont want to subject 
their kids to standardized testing that they dont have to be a 
part of 
jennifer said she was getting some tips from her 16yearold 
sister angela a student at brookline high school who also took 
the test saturday 
she said youll probably do better than me because youre so 
smart jennifer said asked who she thought would do better 
jennifer said her sister likely would because shes learned most 
of the stuff 
the top score possible in each of the two categories on the 
sats verbal and math is 800 the average collegebound senior 
male scores 430 verbal and 500 math while average juniors and 
seniors score lower said barnett 
if the youngsters score as high as the average junior or senior 
they get citations awards and the chance to go to career symposia 
or oneday seminars in humanities and math barnett said 
those who score as high as the average collegebound senior male 
get to go to threeweek summer sessions in five locations 
throughout the country as well as geneva switzerland they take 
high school math and sciences or some college courses in language

a delta air lines jet that had taken off once 
and returned to the airport because of an engine warning light was 
evacuated during another takeoff try when smoke blew into the 
cabin authorities said 
only minor injuries were reported when passengers slid down 
emergency chutes in sundays evacuation of the boeing 727 
smoke also blew into the cabin of an american airlines dc10 
flying from dallas to los angeles on sunday night and the plane 
was diverted to phoenix an airline official said none of the 239 
passengers aboard was injured 
in tampa the pilot of delta flight 606 carrying 114 passengers 
and eight crew members was making his third attempt to fly to 
laguardia airport in new york when smoke was detected delta 
spokesman sam murphy said 
he said the source of the smoke was under investigation 
the plane first tried to take off 2 hours earlier but an oil 
warning light lit up while it was taxiing on the runway and the 
pilot returned to the departure gate murphy said 
maintenance workers fixed the problem and the plane took off 
about a halfhour later but the same warning light on another 
engine prompted the pilot to head back to the airport murphy said 
as he prepared for landing the pilot shut off the engine and 
dumped most of the jets fuel in the gulf of mexico airport 
spokesman paul macalester said he said dumping fuel is standard to 
lessen the chances of fire from landing trouble 
after the jet landed safely maintenance workers changed the oil 
filters in the two other engines and the plane prepared to take off 
an hour later murphy said 
the plane was taxiing when smoke blew from airconditioning 
ducts into the passenger cabin murphy said 
people were grabbing at the oxygen masks said christen 
cashman 21 a student at hofstra university in hempstead ny 
i wasnt really that nervous because there was a businessman 
next to us and he told us it was no big deal and these things 
happen all the time then we lined up and went down the evacuation 
chute 
the flight then was canceled 
on the american flight a loss of oil pressure in one of three 
engines caused smoke that the planes airconditioning system 
sucked into the cabin said an airline official speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
the official said the smoke dissipated when the engine was shut 
down but the plane landed at phoenix international airport

the leftist sandinista government in 
a policy reversal has agreed to let us congressmen monitor 
national elections set for february former president jimmy carter 
says 
in addition carter said sunday usbacked contra rebels have 
agreed to end all attacks on government forces to let the electoral 
process move forward smoothly he said they made the pledge at a 
meeting with him 
in another development four former rebel leaders returned 
sunday and announced their intention to give up the armed struggle 
and join the political process in what they called a more 
democratic nicaragua 
on saturday violeta barrios de chamorro the opposition 
presidential candidate demanded the vote count in the feb 25 
elections be conducted in public saying she fears the sandinistas 
are planning fraud 
she made the demand during a rally attended by about 10000 
people in the northern town of esteli the largest campaign 
gathering yet by the usbacked united national opposition 
carter also said that an agreement was signed sunday to expedite 
the release of money approved by the us congress for the 14party 
opposition coalition the congress appropriated 9 million in 
october 
the former president has been invited to observe the general 
elections he is chairman of the council of freely elected heads of 
government a group of former chief executives of the western 
hemisphere 
president daniel ortega who is seeking another sixyear term 
had vowed not to allow any us congressmen into nicaragua as 
official electoral observers and had denied such requests in recent 
months 
ortega said continued us nonlethal aid for the contra rebels 
indicated the united states did not support the nicaraguan 
elections 
but carter said the government had changed its mind and decided 
to allow up to 12 members of congress to serve as observers if they 
came as part of the carter group he did not give further details 
the election is seen partly as a referendum on a decade of 
sandinista rule but the government has charged that the contras 
are trying to sabotage the campaign by attacking sandinista 
activists in the countryside 
carter who spoke at a news conference said i think that 
both the contra presence in nicaragua and the contra military 
actions in nicaragua are very damaging to the electoral process 
two days ago i met with contra leaders in atlanta and asked them 
to do everything possible not to interfere with the electoral 
process to minimize any violence they gave me their assurance 
he said he met with comandante franklyn the nom de guerre of 
the contras supreme commander in honduras comandante blas the 
miskito indian leader among the rebels and dr henry another 
contra leader 
the four former contra leaders who returned sunday accepted a 
government amnesty in exchange for moving their struggle from the 
battlefield to the political arena 
we came to contribute to peace we believe that we should no 
longer continue the bloodbath among nicaraguans diogenes 
hernandez membreno told reporters on arrival at managuas airport 
he was accompanied by tirso moreno cesar chavarria and victor 
sanchez herdocia 
the four held important military positions in the nicaraguan 
resistance heirarchy but since the end of 1988 have opposed col 
enrique bermudez the contra military chief 
in recent months numerous former contra leaders have returned 
to nicaragua thousands of other contras remain in camps in 
honduras

the fbis focus on an enterprise 
businessman in its investigation of two mailbomb slayings prompted 
an insurance company to change its advertising plans during the 
super bowl 
the opening scene of new york life insurance cos 30second 
television spot during sundays game was to have focused on a water 
tower bearing the message welcome to enterprise alabama city of 
progress 
but publicity stemming from the fbi investigation prompted the 
decision to drop that scene 
the commercial featured new york life agent fred d donaldson 
63 of enterprise and his three sons who are all also agents and 
some of donaldsons clients the gibbs mccormick family of new 
brockton 
donaldson said he was disappointed but not surprised that the 
company changed the ad because of the probe into the december 
bombing deaths of us circuit judge robert vance of suburban 
birmingham and robert robinson a black lawyer in savannah ga 
we took part in the advertisement hoping there would be some 
favorable publicity for enterprise said donaldson who has been 
a new york life agent for nearly 42 years 
i was pleased they ran the ad at all he said we felt 
good about it that they ran the ad after having to make changes at 
this late date 
ben barron director of advertising for the company said the 
decision to air the commercial at a cost of 700000 during the 
super bowl was made tuesday 
donaldson said the deletion of the original opening scene was 
prompted by bad timing not at the request of the fbi or robert 
wayne oferrell the enterprise salvage dealer who authorities have 
investigated intensely since early last week 
oferrell who has not been charged went to church sunday and 
said later pray for the fbi that they will find who they are 
looking for and it sure aint me 
enterprise mayor jacquelyn thompson said sunday the purpose of 
the ad remained the same although it was refocused 
true we would have like for the ad to have opened with the 
original scene she said but the real purpose was to honor the 
donaldson family for what theyve done for our community and the 
company 
ms thompson sees some good coming from the intense media focus 
on the city of 19000 
a lot of media people have told me they have a different 
opinion now of a small south alabama town she said some 
thought we were a bunch of rednecks this case is the price we pay 
for people to see were not a bunch of rednecks

the ira apologized for a 
bomb that killed a teenager and injured eight other people during 
a parade attended by supporters of the guerrilla group 
the irish republican army which is fighting to oust the british 
from northern ireland claimed responsibility for sundays bombing 
and said it regretted the death of the bystander which it called a 
freak accident 
the bomb was intended to kill security forces monitoring the 
bloody sunday anniversary march by republican supporters the ira 
said 
bloody sunday occurred on jan 30 1972 when british troops 
shot and killed 14 people during a roman catholic civil rights 
march 
police today identified a teenager killed sunday as charles 
love 16 of londonderry the royal ulster constabulary said the 
blast also injured four police officers a soldier and three 
civilians 
a spokesman for the constabulary which serves as the provincial 
police said the ira claim of a freak accident was another 
example of their nauseating hypocrisy 
no one can be in any doubt that the sole responsibility for 
the events which led to the death of charles love rests with the 
ira terrorists said the spokesman who was not identified in 
keeping with british tradition 
they have yet again demonstrated their willingness to plant 
bombs without regard for anyone friends or socalled foe alike 
the spokesman said 
the ira placed the bomb beside a monument regularly used as a 
vantage point by security forces the constabulary spokesman said 
the teenager had been standing nearby waiting for the parade to 
pass 
police said the youth died in the hospital from head injuries 
when he was struck by masonry falling from a wall 
they said none of the marchers who support british withdrawal 
from northern ireland was injured and the parade continued through 
the citys largely roman catholic bogside and creggan areas 
in october the ira issued a statement of regret when its gunmen 
mistakenly killed a british servicemans infant daughter in west 
germany the 6monthold girl was with her parents in their car 
when gunmen attacked killing the father and child 
the month before the ira said it mistakenly killed the wife of 
a british soldier stationed in west germany it said the gunman 
mistook the woman for a soldier 
the ira is fighting british rule in northern ireland it wants 
to unite the predominantly protestant province with the 95 percent 
catholic republic of ireland

a pilot of older jetliners says fuel gauges on 
airplanes like the boeing 707 that crashed on new yorks long 
island are not highly accurate especially when tanks are low and 
fuel is sloshing around 
you could not trust them below 10000 pounds of fuel said 
john nance a former braniff pilot nance who lives in tacoma is 
an airline safety analyst 
the national transportation safety board which is investigating 
the crash has said gauges recovered from the wreckage of the 
23yearold plane indicate the plane had about 10000 pounds of 
fuel perhaps enough to keep it aloft the 15 miles from the crash 
site to its destination john f kennedy international airport 
investigators caution however that the fuel estimate could be 
wrong 
the avianca airliner crashed thursday night in the affluent 
community of cove neck ny killing 73 people and injuring 85 
because of the absence of engine noise before the crash the lack 
of fuel odor and the lack of fire after the crash investigators 
focused from the start on the possibility the airliner ran out of 
fuel 
nance said that with small amounts of fuel on older jetliners 
including the 707 and the mcdonnell douglas dc8 gauges reading 
the fuel splashing around in the several tanks were all over the 
map you really dont know what youve got 
he said that to burn under 10000 pounds is a dangerous 
procedure to burn below 5000 is an emergency 
boeing officials have said they dont know of any problems with 
fuel gauges on 707 airliners few of which are still in use by 
united states airlines 
spokesman jack gamble said sunday that each airline provides its 
own flight manuals to pilots for instruction on methods to check 
fuel levels 
airplane manufacturers are required to calibrate gauges before 
delivering planes he said after that however the worthiness of 
the gauges is up to the airlines and federal regulators 
nance who still flies as a heavy jet commander with the air 
force reserve said he never flew in boeing 707s but did pilot 
dc8s which have similar fuel gauges 
while the gauges lack accuracy he said the equipment 
represented the known technology at the time the planes were built 
beginning in the 1950s newergeneration jetliners he said have 
much more accurate fuel gauges 
on the older dc8s the gauges were so unreliable that we 
were directed by braniff to disregard them totally and keep a 
fuelburn chart he said 
jetliners are equipped with fuelflow gauges that measure the 
amount of fuel being burned at any given time he said and a 
flight engineers job includes keeping track of fuel flow and fuel 
used 
i would always want to make sure that i started a flight 
with a known quantity and keep track of the fuel burn i would 
never depend just on the fuel gauges he said 
he said 707 flight crews are aware of the systems limitations 
and become familiar with each airplanes idiosyncrasies he noted 
that avianca has been flying the 707 for some time and its staff 
would presumably know the aircraft he said any number of scenarios 
could have taken place thursday evening but that the crew might 
not have looked at the instruments might have seen the wrong 
indications on the gauges and believed them or might have 
misinterpreted the gauges the crew told controllers the plane was 
low on fuel but did not formally declare a fuel emergency 
nance cited the case of a united air lines flight into portland 
ore in december 1978 the dc8 ran out of fuel and crashed 
though the gauges indicated the plane had 4000 pounds of fuel 
left fewer than a dozen died

pope john paul ii told roman 
catholics today to resist abortion and contraception as they try to 
improve living conditions in this impoverished west african country 
celebrating mass outside the capital at a national pilgrimage 
site the pope said the church and its members should work to build 
up the country on the basis of respect for the human person and 
the family 
human life is inviolable the right to life should be defended 
ceaselessly john paul said 
he said life should be protected from conception until natural 
death and that couples should live a responsible fatherhood and 
motherhood 
he said couples must resist invasion of methods which go 
against the dignity of the woman and do not honor the man i appeal 
to all lay people to fight for the sanctification of the family 
the roman catholic church rejects artificial birth control and 
the church here has resisted government birth control plans 
the pope arrived here from mali on the fourth leg of an 
eightday tour of five african nations about 9 percent of burkina 
fasos 85 million people are roman catholics more than a third 
are moslems and most of the rest are animist 
on his way from the airport to the mass site the popes 
motorcade passed tens of thousands of people gathered by the 
roadside in front of thatched huts and concrete hovels a steady 
wind from the sahara desert blew sand and dust 
the country has been blighted by drought and expanding desert 
and the average per capita income is around 200 
john paul was greeted upon arrival from mali by president blaise 
compaore who took power in a 1987 coup in which his predecessor 
thomas sankara was killed 
africa is catholicisms fastest growing church with more 75 
million adherents the vatican expects to count 100 million african 
faithful by the year 2000 
however islam is a major challenger for converts and the 
catholic church is increasingly worried by the spread of islamic 
fundamentalism in some areas of africa 
in mali the pope celebrated a mass attended by 15000 
christians and 10000 moslems 
i rejoice that a climate of understanding reigns between the 
moslem and catholic communities in mali the pope said in his 
homily during the mass at bamakos soccer stadium dialogue 
between moslems and christians is more necessary than ever 
as the pope toured the stadium in an open mercedes both moslems 
and catholics stood waved and cheered 
about 1 percent of malis 8 million people are catholics while 
moslems account for 70 percent most of the rest are animists 
i hope that the dialogue between moslems and catholics 
improves even more and favors constructive cooperation john paul 
said 
earlier in the day the pope spoke of the churchs concern over 
intolerance toward catholics in some other countries in africa 
without naming any individual nations 
he also urged catholics to recognize and respect the authentic 
religious values of moslems 
dialogue with them is not always easy or desired by everyone 
and it is sometimes difficult to find a common language or 
representatives to talk to each other he said in a speech to 
malis bishops

president bushs unveiling of his 1991 budget 
proposal today sets off a legislative process that is outlined in 
law but still allows for months of delay fingerpointing and 
confusion 
bushs 123 trillion spending blueprint lays out the 
presidents priorities for the coming year he wants to increase 
federal efforts on space science environmental and antidrug 
efforts while trying to shrink the deficit without a broad tax 
increase n 
now congress gets its chance to make the changes it wants and 
the process slows to a crawl 
deadlines will be missed and lawmakers and the white house will 
blame each other for it virtually every committee in congress will 
get involved often working in opposing directions each side will 
accuse the other of using unrealistic numbers and at years end a 
growing dynamic will be everybodys desire to simply go home 
the budget year is already getting off to a late start with 
todays presentation of the spending plan it is supposed to be 
released on the first monday after jan 3 but the white house and 
congress agreed to an extension 
between now and the oct 1 start of fiscal 1991 a host of other 
deadlines will be missed as well the reason the budget is an 
extremely important political document and lawmakers see the 
fiscal choices they must make as primary there are no consequences 
for missing the deadlines anyway 
this is one of the most difficult budget years weve had in 
terms of trying to make ends meet with this process sen pete 
domenici rnm ranking republican on the senate budget 
committee said late last week 
domenicis prediction was founded on the expectation that there 
will be several timeconsuming partisan budget battles this year 
should easing tensions with the soviet union translate into 
pentagon spending cuts and where should those savings go how will 
the republicans thwart sen daniel moynihans efforts to cut social 
security taxes 
will bush finally get his capital gains tax cut and if so what 
will the democrats demand in return and where will congress and 
the administration find the 365 billion in savings they need to 
pare the deficit to 64 billion as required by the grammrudman 
deficitreduction law 
the law calls for the house and senate to approve a budget 
blueprint by april 15 a document that does not require the 
presidents signature a measure imposing new taxes and fees and 
spending cuts must be completed by june 15 thirteen separate 
spending bills providing money for federal agencies and programs 
are supposed to be enacted by oct 1 an event that has occurred 
only once since 1976 
while all this is going on congress will be grumbling about the 
administrations economic forecast which by law is used in the 
budget process 
those projections prepared by the office of management and 
budget are generally believed by lawmakers to be too rosy the 
healthier the economy the more revenue the government can estimate 
it will collect and the easier its deficitreduction job seems 
but by aug 15 the administration will update its forecast and 
if the economy is souring congress would suddenly be faced with 
finding even more savings than it thought were needed if by oct 
15 legislators and the president have not agreed to enough 
reductions to meet the grammrudman shortfall target the law 
automatically triggers enough spending cuts to satisfy the target 
this mix will be confused further by one more event the 
expiration of the governments legal authority to borrow money 
which should occur sometime in september the law extending the 
governments 31 trillion debt limit will likely attract all sorts 
of controversial items because of its mustpass nature 
congressional leaders hope to complete the years work by early 
october this being an election year whether they succeed or 
whether a special postelection session is needed is likely to 
depend on whether budget business is completed in time

the government is considering 
delaying nelson mandelas release from prison and slowing reforms 
because of concerns about current unrest newspapers said today 
an aide to mandela said the black leader will continue his 
antiapartheid fight if substantial reforms are not made even if 
it means spending more time in custody 
mandela has been in prison since 1962 and is serving a life term 
for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the government 
the south african media have been swamped with reports and 
speculation on when mandela might be released the government has 
said it intends to free him but has not said when 
several newspapers said today the whiteled government is 
thinking of keeping mandela in jail at least until march because of 
renewed unrest such as demonstrations against a tour by english 
cricket players defying a ban on sports contacts with south africa 
government leaders are concerned that releasing mandela and 
introducing other reforms would spur unrest and they want to hold 
off on changes to be sure they retain control of developments the 
reports said citing unidentified sources 
in addition the star newspaper said president fw de klerk 
does not want to legalize mandelas african national congress 
movement a condition set by mandela for accepting freedom 
de klerk is expected to outline government reforms friday in a 
speech at the opening of the new session of parliament he has said 
he wants to dismantle apartheid 
winnie mandela wife of the jailed nationalist leader said 
saturday that her 71yearold husband would refuse release until 
the government ends a state of emergency imposed in 1986 legalizes 
the anc and allows exiled anc leaders to return to south africa 
a veteran anc leader walter sisulu said today that problems 
have cropped in up plans for mandelas release but he said it did 
not know exactly what they were 
sisulu made his comments in oslo norway where he and five 
other anc leaders arrived to begin their first visit outside africa 
since being released from more than 25 years in south africa 
prisons 
the scandinavian countries have been strong supporters of the 
anc and were among the first countries to impose economic sanctions 
against south africa 
dullah omar a close friend of the mandela family told the 
associated press today that mandela has made it clear the 
government must enact basic reforms to clear the way for talks 
between whites and blacks 
if and when he is released and there have been no major 
changes then he will report back to his organization the anc 
that three years of talks with the government have been a waste 
of time omar said 
in an allusion to resuming armed struggle omar said mandela 
will go back to where he left off before he went to prison and 
will probably find himself back in prison in a month 
mandela has been having talks with government leaders on ways to 
resolve south africas political problems which stem from the 
countrys apartheid system 
under apartheid south africas 28 million blacks have no vote 
in national affairs the countrys 5 million whites control the 
economy and maintain separate districts schools and health 
services

only a few score soviet jews 
have settled in the occupied west bank since the new immigration 
wave began but their presence has drawn an outcry from the arab 
world and aroused us concern 
new arrivals say they fled antisemitism and did not come here 
to make a political statement 
i did not find any difference between the occupied 
territories and tel aviv said kira nefyodova a short 
bespectacled leningrad chemist im very far from politics i 
dont want anybody to think that im making a political move 
alex yankevitch a construction engineer and his wife liuba 
recalled finding a big yellow star of david painted on their door 
in leningrad one morning the work of an antisemite 
and what can i do in leningrad when the pogrom starts i can 
stand near my door and wait for the killers he recalled his 
lips trembling here the jewish army will defend me and my 
family 
even so palestinians view the presence of such soviet emigres 
in ariel a hilltop settlement 25 miles north of jerusalem as a 
potential threat 
in a protest to western consulates 25 prominent palestinians 
said up to 1 million soviet jews could come to israel and that 
their settlement in the occupied lands could undermine the peace 
process and further strain limited housing and jobs forcing 
palestinians to leave 
palestine liberation organization chief yasser arafat asked the 
soviet union not to allow soviet jews to emigrate if they are going 
to settle in occupied territories 
jordans king hussein told the jordan times that settlement in 
the territories was a serious and pending danger to stability 
in the region 
iraqi president saddam hussein today blamed the problem mainly 
on us immigration quotas criticism also has come from egypt the 
only arab state to have a peace treaty with israel 
writing in the englishlanguage daily mail cairos former chief 
un delegate ahmed tewfik khalil accused the americans and 
soviets of colluding against palestinians by failing to stop jewish 
immigrants from settling in the disputed lands 
the arab league took a different tact secretarygeneral chedli 
klibi said today that the soviet jews rights also are being 
violated because he said they are being forced to go to israel and 
settle in a territory they have never seen before 
the protests followed prime minister yitzhak shamirs statement 
that suggested israel needed the land it captured in the 1967 
middle east war to accommodate the new wave of immigrants 
us state department officials objected to shamirs remarks as 
not helpful the united states views the settlements as an 
obstacle to peace and washington has said it would not provide any 
aid to house immigrants there 
in ariel officials are not concealing their desire to increase 
the jewish population in the west bank and gaza which now is about 
70000 in more than 120 settlements 
ariel mayor ron nachman said that even if soviet jews settle in 
tel aviv the demographic reality will change and strengthen 
israels claim to the land 
his statement alluded to the position of the centerleft labor 
party which opposes further settling of the occupied lands it 
argues the jewish character of the state would be threatened by the 
absorption of 17 million arabs in the west bank and gaza and that 
this is the strongest argument for giving up the land there are 
37 million jews and 810000 arabs in the pre1967 boundaries 
but few new arrivals have come to the occupied territories and 
the overall immigration to israel has a long way to go before 
realizing official predictions of 300000 over the next three years 
absorption ministry officials said about 1 percent or less than 
200 of the 16000 soviet jews who arrived in the past 13 months 
have moved to the occupied lands 
the number of immigrants going there is not meaningful at all 
and its only a matter of headlines said uri gordon head of 
immigration at the jewish agency which funds immigrant 
resettlement programs 
many of those who do come to the west bank do so on the advice 
of friends or earlier immigrants and fail to grasp the complexity 
of living in the west bank only one of those interviewed said he 
was motivated by political ideology 
ariel provides friendly volunteers to help with official 
paperwork is encouraging veteran residents to adopt new soviet 
arrivals and is sponsoring hebrew classes 
the warm welcome is important 
we just felt welcome and needed here said yankevitch 38 
we were so nicely treated by everybody and this is so 
important after we left so much behind 
last week yankevitch rented a twofloor apartment from an 
israeli who left ariel as with any new immigrant his rent and 
most other expenses are covered in the first year by the government 
ariel officials say they receive virtually no other direct 
government support for their absorption program which brought 45 
soviet families to ariel in the last four months 
ms nefyodova 36 interviewed in her small kitchen surrounded 
by a donated refrigerator electric heater and gas stove appeared 
to be content 
i never expected to find myself in the territories and i did 
not expect to find such quiet cities here she said

president bush asked congress today to cut 
taxes on capital gains and create a new tax break to encourage 
savings 
bushs 1991 budget calls for tax increases of 157 billion 
although there is no proposed general increase in personal income 
taxes the budget recommends 56 billion increases in user and 
service fees and 18 billion worth of targeted tax cuts including 
a special credit of up to 1000 a year for each child under the 
age of 4 in lowerincome families 
although the most sensitive revenue proposal in the budget is 
the tax cut on capital gains the one with the potential for 
affecting the greatest number of taxpayers is the call for a reward 
for increased savings 
under this proposal a couple could avoid tax on the interest 
earned on special family savings accounts held for seven years 
or longer while interest would be taxexmept deposits to such 
accounts would have no tax advantage 
most couples would be allowed to invest up to 5000 a year in 
these accounts a single person could invest 2500 the tax break 
would be limited to couples with incomes below 120000 and single 
people under 60000 
bush also recommended that a firsttime homebuyer be allowed to 
withdraw up to 10000 penaltyfree from an individual retirement 
account in order to make a down payment on the home 
the proposed capitalgains tax cut is more sweeping than the one 
bush failed to win from congress last year democratic leaders have 
fought any such reduction on grounds that 80 percent of the benefit 
would go to those with incomes over 100000 a year 
a reduction in the capitalgains rate would help united states 
businesses in the face of increasing global competition bush 
said in a written message to congress he also repeated the 
administrations insistence that cutting taxes on capital gains 
which are profits from the sale of stock real estate and other 
investments would increase revenues 
under bushs plan capital gains from property owned more than 
one year would be taxed at lower rates than apply to wages and 
other income when fully phased in the provision would exempt from 
taxation 30 percent of profits from the sale of property owned at 
least three years 20 percent of gains from property owned more 
than two but less than three years would be exempt 10 percent of 
gain from assets held more than one year would be exempt 
thus a person whose regular income is taxed at 28 percent would 
pay an effective rate of 196 percent on capital gains from 
longheld property 
other revenue proposals include 
making permanent the 3percent tax on local and longdistance 
telephone service which is due to expire dec 31 
raising the 8percent tax on airline tickets to 10 percent 
increasing more than three times the fee on waterway shippers 
from 004 percent of value to 0125 percent 
requiring the 38 million state and local government workers 
who are not covered by a retirement plan to pay social security 
taxes also state and local workers hired before april 1 1986 
would be required to pay the 145 percent medicare tax most state 
and local workers already pay 
cutting oil industry taxes by creating four incentives for 
drilling in old fields 
imposing fees for a variety of government services including 
those provided by the coast guard and the food and drug 
administration 
requiring veterans except those with low incomes to pay part 
of their medical bills relating to nonserviceconnected ailments 
many veterans wold have to pay a 175 percent fee on new va housing 
loan guarantees

the communist leadership today promised 
to provide the opposition with details on bulgarias economic 
crisis but rejected a call for an independent commission to look 
into the staggering foreign debt 
the debt estimated at more than 11 billion is a major issue 
of contention between the communists and the union of democratic 
forces a loose grouping of 12 independent movements and parties 
in addition to a halt on new loans to bulgaria the opposition 
has demanded the dismissal of the directors of the national bank 
and the foreign trade bank apparently for their role in the 
mismanagement of western credits during years of hardline 
communist rule 
ventseslav dimitrov an economic adviser for the independent 
trade union podkrepa said a halt on loans is necessary because 
we dont know what the previous credits have been used for 
the leader of the communist delegation andrei lukanov reacted 
sharply to the oppositions stance saying there is no example 
in world history where the opposition negotiates with creditors of 
a country to stop credits 
he said it was inappropriate for the opposition to object to new 
credits deemed badly needed to help economic recovery 
the communists agreed to provide the opposition with information 
it wants on the national economy when the talks convene again feb 
6 
the oppositioncommunist talks emerged from the peaceful 
prodemocracy revolution that ended more than three decades of rule 
by todor zhivkov 
a communist party congress opens tuesday and is expected to 
result in a showdown between conservatives and reformers who favor 
a clean break with the past to shed the image associated with 
zhivkovs hardline leadership

the budget president bush sent congress today 
includes a new attempt to encourage family savings and a 
significant boost for head start while making a fresh effort to 
dramatically shift the focus of federal housing programs 
the 123 trillion fiscal 1991 budget proposal also includes a 
major cash infusion for the war on drugs and new initiatives in 
the form of higher spending for space and biotechnology programs 
other programs slated for significant spending increases are the 
federal aviation administration a proposal that relies heavily on 
dipping into an aviation trust fund and efforts to clean up 
hazardous materials at nuclear plants and other facilities run by 
the federal government 
some of the initiatives offered in the spending blueprint 
are indeed new others like the presidents childcare and 
capitalgains proposals are simply new attempts to win 
congressional approval of bush proposals that did not survive 
congress last year 
and for all its new and reworked initiatives the budget 
proposal also includes an attempt to head off one of the biggest 
initiatives likely to emerge on capitol hill an attempt to take 
advantage of the socalled peace dividend created by declining 
world tensions by spending money now earmarked for the military on 
domestic programs 
the sum of all such planned expenditures totals about 10 times 
the overestimated dividend which is itself perhaps five times the 
actual dividend budget director richard darman said in a message 
accompanying the budget thus washington entertains the notion 
of spending 50 times a dividend that has not definitively 
materialized a true wonderland phenomenon 
the battle over the real or imagined peace dividend is 
likely to be the biggest budget skirmish several of the 
presidents other initiatives also appear certain to alienate 
congress majority democrats while others likely will be accepted 
quickly perhaps with tinkering 
here are brief summaries of several bush policy initiatives the 
numbers are for proposed fiscal 1991 spending unless labeled as 
spending authority meaning that the amount shown is what the 
administration is asking to spend spent over several years 
family savings accounts in a bid to improve the nations 
anemic savings rate bush proposes exempting from income tax the 
interest paid on family savings accounts that are held for seven 
years the limit would be 5000 for those filing a joint tax 
return 2500 for individual returns withdrawals taken after the 
seven years would be tax free and a 10 percent excise penalty would 
be assessed on early withdrawals 
head start bush proposes adding 500 million in spending 
authority to the preschool education program in fiscal 1991 for a 
total of 19 billion the 36 percent increase should allow the 
program a favorite of democrats and republicans alike to enroll 
180000 more 4yearolds from lowincome families according to the 
administration about 450000 children now participate in head 
start programs 
housing the presidents 23 billion department of housing and 
urban development budget includes expansion of two of the pet 
projects of hud secretary jack kemp urban enterprise zones and 
tenant ownership bushs proposal to shift nearly 60 million from 
lowincome rental programs to a certificate program that allows 
tenants of housing projects and other federally subsidized housing 
programs to buy their units likely will face stiff opposition in 
congress from liberal democrats who do not believe tenant ownership 
will work on a large scale in many areas of the country 
the drug war bush unveiled this part of his budget last week 
proposing to boost federal spending authority for the drug war by 
11 billion to 106 billion 
space bush proposes increasing the national aeronautics and 
space administrations spending from 12 billion to 141 billion 
the budget projects a record 10 space shuttle flights next fiscal 
year at a cost of more than 8 billion and also proposes budget 
authority of 26 billion for development of the manned space 
station and 12 billion for exploration activities to support the 
planned moonmars mission 
air traffic control bush proposed an increase in overall faa 
spending that would see a reduction in the amount of direct federal 
spending for air safety while the amount taken from an aviation 
trust fund financed by user fees would increase sharply 
bush proposed outlays of 12 billion in federal funds for the 
faa next year down from about 3 billion in the current fiscal 
year while spending 6 billion from the trust fund up from 34 
billion this year bush said his proposed increase for the faa 
would allow for the hiring of 495 more air traffic controllers and 
300 safety specialists the administration said those increases 
were needed because of increasing number of commercial flights and 
the aging of the nations aircraft fleet bush proposed increased 
user fees to help pay for the increase 
hazardous cleanup bush proposes spending 42 billion to clean 
up hazardous materials at department of energy nuclear plants and 
other facilities run by nasa and the departments of defense 
interior agriculture and transportation that would be an increase 
642 million over the current fiscal year

thousands of people shouting support 
for the provisional government converged on bucharest today and 
urged leaders to stand firm against opposition demands that they 
resign 
it was the biggest progovernment rally in weeks and came one 
day after thousands massed in the largest antigovernment protest 
since the december revolution 
demonstrators marched down major city streets shouting support 
for president ion iliescu and his national salvation front which 
has been accused of supporting the same totalitarian tactics as the 
ousted communist regime 
another crowd of several thousand gathered outside massed 
outside the offices of opposition national peasant party which 
organized sundays antigovernment protest we wont leave until 
you dissolve the party the crowd chanted 
iliescu dont give up the country is your army 
demonstrators shouted as they marched past cheering shopkeepers and 
pedestrians 
iliescu told the crowd the front would not resign 
the front stands soundly on its own feet the front is not in 
danger we remain open to dialogue with the whole country and 
we stretch out our hands to all those who want to talk to work and 
to rebuild the country he said 
by late morning more than 10000 profront forces had gathered 
in victory square and thousands more were marching and even 
running toward the plaza where the fronts governing council has 
its headquarters 
it appeared the protest would attract more people than sundays 
antigovernment rally which drew about 15000 people it was the 
biggest such rally since the revolution that ousted dictator 
nicolae ceausescu 
the national news agency rompres said tens of thousands of 
people many of them just off night shifts in bucharest factories 
massed outside government headquarters and that many people had 
come to the capital from other areas of the country 
many groups of protesters arrived in trucks and how the crowd 
came together indicated workers may have been instructed to attend 
a tactic often used by communist leaders a smaller profront 
rally also was held sunday and one participant said he had been 
directed by superiors at work to attend 
a woman at todays progovernment rally alleged that people were 
bribed to attend the opposition protest sunday they were given 
dollars cigarettes and lei she said referring to romanias 
currency she refused to give her name 
the national salvation front a loose grouping of intellectuals 
and former communists and dissidents has been governing by decree 
since ceausescu fled the capital dec 22 he was executed dec 25 
the trial of four men who were close ceausescu associates 
resumed today before a military tribunal in bucharest the four 
went on trial saturday on charges of complicity in the murder of 
antigovernment protesters who were killed by security forces 
during the revolution 
the defendants are former communist party secretary emil bobu 
considered the no 3 figure in the ceausescu leadership former 
interior minister tudor postelnicu and former politburo members 
manea manescu and ion dinca 
only dinca has testified when he took the stand saturday he 
said he had done nothing to stop the shooting of protesters in 
december 
demands for the fronts resignation erupted tuesday when the 
leadership announced plans to compete in national elections in may 
critics say the front cannot fairly compete in an election that it 
also administers some accuse it of being a front for communist 
rule noting that it includes some former ranking communists 
the protesters sunday broke through a line of soldiers and 
rallied outside front headquarters many demanded the opposition be 
given positions in the provisional government 
they booed iliescu when he appeared on an upper floor of the 
building and chanted resign resign and get out or well 
come get you out as he tried to speak 
iliescu pledged later to renew dialogue with the more than 20 
political parties hoping to compete in the may election a promise 
he repeated today 
like the protest sunday todays demonstration violated a ban 
imposed by the front on rallies without advance police permission 
authorities made no attempt to disperse the profront 
demonstrators but there was a cordon of soldiers tanks and 
armored cars outside the foreign ministry building that houses the 
government headquarters 
some demonstrators commandeered heavy construction equipment and 
trucks to join in the processions 
the front is representing us shopkeeper viorica mustareata 
told the associated press as she yelled support from the sidelines 
the front is with the peasants the workers with everyone 
the antigovernment protest was called by the largest opposition 
party the national peasant party as well as the national liberal 
party and the social democratic party which joined the peasant 
party in calling for a broad coalition government until the 
elections in may 
after nightfall truckloads of progovernment demonstrators were 
brought to the square some shouting that the opposition protesters 
were provocateurs and gypsies

regional air controllers knew a colombian 
jetliner was low on fuel and needed priority landing clearance 50 
minutes before it crashed but local controllers never got the 
information investigators said 
the investigation into avianca flight 52s crash which killed 
73 people and injured 85 is focusing on the communication gap 
between the highaltitude air traffic controllers and those 
handling landings at three local airports said lee dickinson of 
the national transportation safety board 
dickinson said investigators planned to interview the regional 
controllers today investigators also returned this morning to the 
crash site in cove neck on long island they were expected to end 
the onsite investigation later today or tuesday 
records indicated the boeing 707 had more than enough fuel for 
the flight from bogota and medellin colombia to new york but the 
jet flew in three holding patterns totaling nearly 90 minutes along 
the east coast because of weatherrelated congestion before it 
crashed thursday night investigators said 
as the plane neared the end of its final 46minute holding 
pattern south of kennedy international airport the crew told 
controllers in the regional new york center about the fuel shortage 
and requested priority clearance to land dickinson said 
at that point controllers asked pilot laureano caviedes what 
his alternate landing site was and according to federal aviation 
administration tapes he replied boston i cant make it 
shortly afterward the regional controllers turned the aircraft 
over to the local controllers but after interviewing six local 
controllers who either handled or tracked the flight investigators 
determined they were unaware of the shortage 
for whatever reasons we dont know the controllers handling 
landings at kennedy did not know that dickinson told reporters 
late sunday 
i dont know why it wasnt passed on it may have been passed 
on in a different style if you will he said without elaborating 
he said the regional and local controllers had spoken to each 
other by telephone when transferring control of the plane 
at 924 pm the plane aborted an attempted landing at kennedy 
apparently because of bad weather and the pilot immediately said 
he wanted to try again saying twice to one of the controllers that 
he was low on fuel dickinson said 
that was the first time the local controller knew anything about 
a fuel problem dickinson said 
less than 10 minutes later the plane crashed the pilot and the 
other two members of the cockpit crew were among those killed 
a federal official close to the investigation who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said information obtained by investigators 
indicates the error appeared to lie with the regional controllers 
dickinson emphasized that when the pilot told the regional 
controllers he needed a priority landing the word emergency 
was never used and for that reason the severity of the situation 
may not have been relayed 
asked what procedures would have mandated an emergency he 
replied without elaboration there are certain phrases that the 
cockpit should tell the controller the word emergency was never 
used the word priority was 
dickinson noted that an american airlines flight that landed 
right before aviancas aborted attempt had 14 minutes of fuel when 
it landed the american pilot had told controllers he would declare 
a fuel emergency if he was not immediately cleared for landing 
many pilots are reluctant to declare a fuel emergency because 
the faa strictly monitors those cases according to aviation 
officials should the agency determine a pilot was not justified in 
declaring an emergency the pilots license can be suspended 
pilots are not anxious to declare an emergency he said 
because they then have to explain it to the faa the faa comes in 
and says ok whats the emergency here 
its embarrassing the new york times quoted an unidentified 
pilot as saying plus you have to write a lot of reports 
investigators determined during the weekend that none of the 
aviancas four engines was running when it slammed into a wooded 
hillside 
investigators earlier said the plane may have had up to 10000 
pounds or nearly 1500 gallons of fuel upon impact but ntsb 
spokesman mike benson said sunday that figure could be wrong 
because the fuel gauges may have given inaccurate readings 
boeing spokesman jack gamble in seattle has said that 1500 
gallons of fuel could have been enough to get the plane from the 
crash site to the airport 15 miles away but not much more 
benson said the ntsb planned to calibrate and test the gauges 
the boeing 707 fuel gauges cannot be trusted when the level goes 
below 10000 pounds said john nance a former braniff pilot who is 
an airline safety analyst 
officials changed survivor totals twice during the weekend 
after officials compared aviancas passenger list and hospital 
records they revised the tally of people on board from 161 to 159 
officials could not immediately explain the second change to 158 
more than 20 survivors remained in critical condition hospitals 
reported

a moderate earthquake jolted central new 
mexico strongly enough to rattle furniture this morning but no 
injuries were reported 
we felt the whole house shake said albert miranda of 
veguita a few miles from the quakes epicenter south of 
albuquerque it didnt last very long the chandelier shook but 
nothing was broken it was a fast shake 
the dog went wild barking in the house said albino salas 
jr of bernardo he was running all over the room 
pat jorgenson of the us geological survey in menlo park 
calif said the surveys national earthquake information center in 
golden colo measured the tremor at 45 on the richter scale 
the epicenter of the 616 am quake was 40 miles south of 
albuquerque almost exactly the same spot as one of the same 
magnitude on nov 28 1989 she said 
both quakes occurred along the rio grande rift which splits new 
mexico north to south paralleling the rio grande from colorado to 
el paso texas ms jorgenson said 
the last time before november that an earthquake struck the same 
area was july 1906 she said 
allan sanford a professor of geophysics at the new mexico 
institute of mining and technology in socorro said earthquakes are 
relatively rare in the state california he said has 100 times as 
much quake activity as new mexico 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographsan earthquake of 4 on the richter scale can cause 
moderate damage in the local area and 5 can cause considerable 
damage

how do you explain a 123 trillion federal 
budget with a deficit in the billions of dollars tucked away in 
nearly 190000 accounts and recorded in a book that runs to 1569 
intimidating pages 
budget director richard g darman used childs terms today to 
tell readers what it all means in an introduction to president 
bushs fiscal 1991 budget plan darman spoke solemnly of pacmen 
the cookie monster and wonderland 
to darman the federal budget might be seen as the ultimate 
cookie monster a reference to the gruff character on the 
sesame street childrens tv show who cannot resist gobbling 
up anything and everything that might be consumed especially 
cookies 
the budgets excessive tendencies toward consumption are not 
exactly ennobling darman wrote but at the same time its 
underlying motivation is clearly not malevolent 
what harm it may cause is largely unintended its massive 
presence might be understood as little more than a compilation of 
cookies received cookies crumbled and crumbs spewed forth 
darman says the cookie monster analogy isnt fair to the cookie 
monster or the budget in reality a budget is not just a 
monstrous mass of cookies and crumbs he says it is more an 
implicit statement of values and expectations for the future 
using the imagery of the pacman video game darman warns of 
rising costs of such federal liabilities as health care pensions 
mandatory benefit programs insurance coverage and environmental 
cleanup obligations 
each is like a hidden pacman waiting to spring forward and 
consume another line of resource dots in the budget maze the 
budget chief wrote 
then its off to wonderland darmans name for a political 
fairyland where he believes congress is heading when it starts 
tinkering with the budget 
darman says a new game on capitol hill is finding ways to spend 
the peace dividend the supposed savings in defense spending 
resulting from the recent easing of eastwest tensions 
it starts by overestimating the dividend he wrote then 
each player plans to spend the dividend in his or her preferred 
way the sum of all such planned expenditures totals about 10 times 
the overestimated dividend which is itself perhaps five times the 
actual dividend 
thus washington entertains the notion of spending 50 times a 
dividend that has not yet definitively materialized a true 
wonderland phenomenon darman says 
he also characterizes as a very dangerous game politically 
the recent congressional demands for a cut in social security taxes 
indeed wonderland seems to be running wild with attractive 
fantasies but without yet having established coherent direction 
he wrote 
in a footnote darman observed that the budget document was 
published this year in a single volume rather than the seven 
separate budget books issued in previous years 
the aim he said was to make the federal budget easier and 
perhaps more informative to read 
there is no formal record of the number of individuals who may 
have read covertocover the previous sevenvolume editions of 
the budget darman wrote nor are there epidemiological studies 
of their fate

angolan guerrilla leader jonas savimbi 
today said pressure from the superpowers and angolas weariness 
with bloodshed would bring an end to the 15yearold civil war this 
year 
savimbi made the comments on his first visit to lisbon since 
portugal granted independence to the african nation in 1975 when 
fighting began between his usbacked guerrillas and the marxist 
government supported by the soviet union and cuba 
portugal recognizes the existing government and savimbi had been 
banned until this year from coming to the country 
the pressure for peace from inside and outside angola will be 
so great i dont see how either side will be able to continue 
fighting in 1990 he said we are going to launch an enormous 
effort to end the war this year 
savimbis remarks came against a background of increased 
diplomatic efforts to break a deadlock in the angolan peace process 
as us envoy herman cohen traveled from angola to london where he 
was reportedly to hold talks with soviet officials on the war in 
angola 
a ceasefire agreement was signed in june in gbadolite zaire 
but it collapsed within days 
since december the guerrillas have been holding off what they 
describe as the biggest government offensive ever mounted against 
their strongholds 
savimbi also said the guerrilla group was involved in direct 
contacts with cuba to provide guarantees that his forces would not 
attack cuban soldiers cuba suspended the withdrawal of its troops 
from angola after four cubans where killed in a guerrilla raid jan 
21 
savimbi described the attack as involuntary and said the 
guerrilla group would provide cuba with assurances such incidents 
would not be repeated 
cuba began withdrawing its troops after south africa pledged in 
december 1988 to halt aid to the guerrillas and grant independence 
to neighboring nambia 
savimbi said the next step in the peace process should be a halt 
in the government offensive followed by moves to bring about direct 
talks between himself and eduardo dos santos 
the americans and the portuguese can play a more active role 
in the search for peace by establishing where the common ground 
between the two sides lies and using that to bring us together 
savimbi said 
he said washington and lisbon should act in support of peace 
efforts by president mobuto sese seko of zaire 
savimbi said the guerrillas backed mobuto as a mediator and 
cohen the us assistant secretary of state for african affairs 
had told him by telephone today that angolan president jose eduardo 
dos santos shared the same position 
the guerrilla leader was on the third day of a visit that marked 
the end of a 15year ban on his travel to portugal

east germanys communists agreed to share 
power with the opposition and move up elections by nearly two 
months because of growing civil unrest that threatens the countrys 
existence premier hans modrow said today 
the government said it would hold elections on march 18 instead 
of may 6 and form a governing coalition with the opposition until 
a freely elected leadership takes office 
also today authorities arrested former hardline leader erich 
honecker and a prosecutor said he would be tried for high treason 
in march 
chief prosecutor hansjuergen joseph told parliament that 
honecker and former politburo members erich mielke guenter mittag 
and joachim herrmann would be tried by the supreme court all four 
have been expelled from the party 
if convicted honecker who was ousted nov 10 in east germanys 
peaceful revolt against his 18year stalinist regime could face 
life in prison 
honecker 77 was taken to prison after being released from a 
hospital where he had undergone surgery for kidney cancer the 
official adn news agency said his lawyer wolfgang vogel asked 
prosecutors to free honecker from custody because he is too ill to 
stay in jail adn said 
in bonn west german chancellor helmut kohl today said he plans 
to make campaign appearances for conservatives running in the east 
german elections kohl a christian democrat said he will be 
talking this week with prodemocracy opposition forces and east 
germanys christian democratic leaders to decide which party to 
back 
opposition activists initially had resisted overtures by the 
stilldominant communists to join an interim government but 
apparently felt the situation had become so dire that they had no 
other choice 
east germanys economy is on the brink of disaster and many of 
its most promising young workers have joined a destabilizing exodus 
to the west as many as 2500 east germans have been fleeing daily 
modrow urged parliament today to support the agreement with the 
opposition 
the premier said strikes and the exodus of workers have worsened 
the economy and set off a chain reaction of economic breakdowns 
threatening the existence of east germany 
modrow said bomb threats and vandalism have spread protection 
of citizens can no longer be fully guaranteed modrow told the 
500member peoples chamber 
the current government coalition is proving increasingly 
fragile modrow said economic and social tensions have 
increased the economic situation is deteriorating in a worrying 
way 
opposition forces had wanted to stay out of the government until 
the elections to avoid sharing blame for the countrys economic 
catastrophe 
but modrows transition government a collection of relatively 
reformist communists who are trying to salvage their standing among 
the citizenry was beginning to unravel reforms to encourage 
western investment have been held up by disputes between communists 
and various opposition groups 
as a result a decline in production and living standards has 
hastened 
seeking to draw opposition leaders into a grand coalition to 
govern until the elections modrow opened talks sunday with 
representatives of nine reform movements and a handful of minor 
parties long aligned with the communists 
the communists suffered the defections of some leading reformers 
a week ago and the crisis deepened thursday when three ministers 
from the christian democratic union a party traditionally allied 
with the communists pulled out of the 27member cabinet 
modrow and more than 40 representatives of rival political 
forces agreed that a new cabinet will be submitted by wednesday to 
parliament 
the decisions were announced by martin ziegler a lutheran 
church official who said the new leadership would include one 
member from each of the nine opposition groups represented at 
weekly talks with government 
he said the ministers would be named without portfolio and it 
was not immediately clear if the cabinet would be expanded or if 
some current ministers would give up seats the government 
currently has 16 communist ministers 
wolfgang schnur of the opposition democratic awakening said the 
cabinet members will decide later how to distribute ministerial 
responsibilities 
all the political groups are vying for voter support in this 
country of 16 million 
many opposition parties held weekend congresses to chart 
election strategy but the meetings served more to highlight 
differences dividing the groups and preventing the emergence of a 
united force to challenge the communists 
new forum the largest of the prodemocracy groups previously 
claimed 200000 members but a moderate faction split off from the 
movement to form the german forum party over the weekend 
meanwhile christian democratic union leader lothar de maiziere 
announced he was prepared to seek an election coalition with 
democratic awakening and the german social union two east german 
opposition groups that support marketoriented reforms and closer 
ties with west germany

vice president dan quayle today 
praised panamas usinstalled government for its plans to change 
its banking system to curtail the laundering of drug money 
im impressed with panamanian president guillermo endaras 
willingness to move in a different direction in dealing with 
important issues like the laundering of drug money quayle told a 
news conference as he ended an overnight visit here before heading 
for jamaica 
changes will make it easier to detect this type of activity 
he said 
endara appearing with quayle did not detail what changes are 
being contemplated in the banking system but said he knows some 
must be made 
panamas bankers want reasonable changes which dont unduly 
change the banking environment endara said through an 
interpreter they know panama cannot continue to be the center 
for drug dollars we have to participate in the fight against 
drug trafficking 
alluding to the former panamanian government of gen manuel 
antonio noriega which was toppled in december after a us 
military invasion quayle said 
we now have a government here that will join the united states 
in the war on drugs where before we had a government that was 
cooperating in the transportation and production of illegal drugs 
a tremendous change has occurred in panama with the war 
against drugs and our campaign to get to the bottom of this taking 
a significant step forward with the commitment of president 
endara he added 
panamas system of confidential bank accounts similar to that in 
switzerland has attracted more than 100 international banks 
employing nearly 8000 people coded banking accounts can be opened 
in panama under government orders if the account holder is under 
investigation 
we do not know what they will be yet endara said of the 
changes bankers are not opposed to reasonable changes that do 
not affect the banking environment but they also know that panama 
cannot continue to be a center for narcodollars 
but we are opposed to fishing expeditions which is what the 
us officials want edgardo lasso president of panamas banking 
association said recently 
following the news conference with endara quayle flew to 
jamaica for the last leg of his threeday damagecontrol mission in 
the wake of the dec 20 panama invasion that offended leaders of 
many latin american countries 
in kingston quayle expected to hear complaints about a cutback 
of 25 million in economic aid to the caribbean country 
prime minister michael manley has said president bush is sending 
new aid to help with economic reform in poland and hungary at the 
expense of small countries like jamaica 
bushs newly announced plan to provide panama with 1 billion to 
help recover from the invasion adds to the sting manley said the 
cutback means his country will not have adequate resources for its 
war on drugs which he estimated at 29 million for its initial 
phase 
the new leaders in panama and the congregation of a 
proamerican church quayle attended sunday were in favor of the 
us military action 
at this moment the police forces are not quite capable of 
protecting the lives property and public order as the panamanian 
people want said endara after attending mass with quayle 
thats why we need the us forces in panama at this moment but 
we hope that in a very short time this will not be necessary 
quayle a day after being pressed by other latin heads of state 
to get the occupying troops out of panama insisted they will be 
withdrawn within a matter of weeks he and the leaders of costa 
rica venezuela guatemala el salvador and belize attended the 
presidential inauguration in honduras on saturday 
certainly there is concern about the security and the future 
of panama quayle said adding he had discussed with endara how 
to help build panamas police into a viable force 
bush he said wants to see the troops withdrawn and to obtain 
a level that we had prior to operation just cause as soon as 
possible quayle said 
one administration official predicted the troop level could be 
down from the current 17000 to the preinvasion 13000 within two 
weeks 
the vice president spent part of sunday in meetings with 
government leaders but he also visited a popular tourist viewing 
site on the panama canal bought bananas at an outdoor market 
stopped at a tshirt stand to buy shirts for his three children and 
watched part of the super bowl with us soldiers at fort clayton 
he also said in a television interview on abcs this week with 
david brinkley that he understands the reasoning of mexico and 
venezuela in not wanting him to visit their countries at this time 
they told him a visit would be inopportune due to antiinvasion 
sentiment but i will be visiting those countries later on 
quayle said 
offering a new rationale for the invasion quayle said that if 
manuel antonio noriega had stayed in power us adherence to the 
panama canal treaty would have been jeopardized 
implementing the treaty as ratified by the senate would have 
been a very difficult proposition he said on the brinkley show 
the agreement signed under president carter calls for the 
united states to cede control of the canal to panama at the end of 
this century 
quayle was warmly received by panamanians at cristo rey roman 
catholic church the rev javier villanueva who was renowned for 
his antinoriega sermons in preinvasion days said the us 
military intervention had helped end panamanian suffering

arrested and taken to prison today and a prosecutor said he will 
tried for high treason in march 
honecker 77 was detained after his release from east berlins 
charite hospital where he had undergone surgery for a malignant 
kidney tumor the official adn news agency said 
chief prosecutor hansjuergen joseph told parliament that 
honecker and former politburo members erich mielke guenter mittag 
and joachim herrmann would be tried by the supreme court on treason 
charges in march all four have been expelled from the party 
mielke was honeckers security chief mittag oversaw the economy 
and herrmann headed the partys propaganda department eleven 
members of honeckers ousted politburo already are in prison 
awaiting trial 
honeckers lawyer wolfgang vogel asked the chief prosecutor to 
free the former leader from rummelburg prison based on a doctors 
statement that he is too ill to stay in jail adn said vogel is 
east germanys most prominent lawyer 
one of honeckers doctors horst vogler said the former leader 
was very depressed and his mental state impaired following 
two major surgical operations since august 
west german television showed an impassive honecker being led 
out of the hospital by his wife margot in predawn darkness she 
kissed him goodbye before he was taken away in a large limousine 
honeckers daughter soninlaw and youngest grandchild also 
came to see him off at the hospital adn quoted vogler as saying 
the charge of high treason carries a maximum life imprisonment 
the conviction used to carry the death penalty but that was 
abolished in reforms that followed honeckers ouster oct 18 
east germany has been caught up in a virtual frenzy to root out 
corruption and abuse of office 
honecker the aging hardline stalinist leader who ruled east 
germany for 18 years had previously been declared too ill to 
withstand imprisonment 
adn said the director of charite urology clinic dr peter 
althaus repeated today that in his opinion honecker is still not 
well enough to be jailed 
on sunday west germanys masscirculation bild newspaper said 
honecker would be arrested but that he would be held at a prison 
hospital because of his condition adn did not say whether 
rummelsburg prison is equipped with a medical facility 
earlier this month east germanys luthern church had offered to 
put honecker up in a home for the aged upon his release from the 
hospital

two un planes flew to the rebelheld 
city of juba today to evacuate foreign relief workers who had been 
trapped by a civil war 
some of the foreigners apparently couldnt wait for the un 
jets and left on a plane belonging to a relief organization un 
spokeswoman pat banks said those who waited included the united 
nations sole representative in juba an american named bob 
brandstetter she said 
it was unclear how many foreigners were taken out of the 
southern city which has been shelled twice in the last 10 days and 
become the focus of an increasingly turbulent war 
the rebel sudan peoples liberation army promised in a radio 
broadcast to hold fire today from 6 am until 6 pm to allow the 
evacuation of foreigners the only foreigners believed to be in 
juba are relief workers and missionaries and estimates of their 
numbers range from 80 to 120 
a british embassy official said he understood that about 30 
people more than a dozen of them britons opted to be airlifted 
out a spokeswoman for the us embassy put the number at about 20 
and said they included four americans 
the united nations sent two canadianbuilt twin otter aircraft 
to juba from the sudan capital of khartoum 750 miles away and 
from lokichokio in kenya 
but ms banks said that by the time the planes arrived in juba 
all but four of the people planning to leave had already left 
aboard a special plane of the lutheran world federation which has 
been operating a small relief airflift to juba 
that group flew to nairobi kenya the four who waited for the 
un plane were to fly to khartoum ms banks said

christians and animists began fighting in 1983 to wrest 
concessions for the south from the arab moslemdominated central

legislation strictly controlling 
gun ownership will be submitted to parliament and two commissions 
will be set up to supervise the police the interior minister said 
monday 
the security forces have been reorganized since the formation of 
a noncommunistled government and the commissions will determine 
if new directives issued from prague are being followed nationwide 
said interior minister richard sacher 
there are still people in the security forces who understand 
the recent events only as a transitory period he said 
there are 130000 valid gun permits in the country allowing the 
legal ownership of 143000 firearms 135000 shotguns that can be 
used by hunters and another 135000 firearms held by registered 
collectors he said 
when you sum this up you have quite a nice army the 
minister said 
sacher said last week he was suspending all valid permits 
starting friday to force registration of firearms in private hands 
he said not only high ranking communist party leaders have been 
entitled to hold firearms but many lower ranking officials too the 
draft law on firearms and ammunition to be sent to parliament would 
much more strictly limit permits 
the minister the first noncommunist in eastern europe to be 
put in charge of a nations police indicated there could be an 
unknown number of weapons in circulation illegally describing a 
leak of firearms due to losses by their legal holders 
asked about rumors concerning a possible coup attempt sacher 
said im convinced there is no such possibility because there 
is no support among the people for such forces it could be perhaps 
only a local affair 
these reports can however be qualified as a criminal act of 
spreading alarming reports sacher added 
he said security forces in bohemia would be reinforced by the 
troops of the interior ministry while the slovak security forces 
would be reinforced by regular army troops

east germany will allow artists to turn part 
of the berlin walls bare eastern face into an outdoor gallery a 
west berlin art promoter said monday 
david monty said plans call for a nearly onemile stretch in 
east berlin to be set aside for painting and sculpture by 120 
artists 
an east german border guard official at a news conference with 
monty said authorities expect to leave that wall segment standing 
and indicated the defense ministry has no objections to the project 
monty said he hoped to enlist famous names to work on 20 percent 
of the 33foottall concrete panels making up the wall 
the artworks to be encased in clear plastic would be opened to 
the public in may he said all topics would be permitted except 
campaign slogans for east germanys elections and racism monty 
added 
contrary to the blank east german side the west berlin face of 
the wall in most places is covered with colorful graffiti 
east germanys communist authorities opened the wall nov 9 
interim president manfred gerlach later said it would be torn down 
and replaced with a less imposing installation officials say the 
wall panels will be sold abroad for hard currency with the revenue 
to be used for social causes 
last week border guards and soldiers removed a first 320yard 
stretch and carted the piece to a depot for storage

a maryland real estate agent dubbed robin 
hud after admitting she stolemillions of dollars in federal 
housing funds and gave some of it to the poor pleaded guilty today 
and said she felt terrific 
marilyn louise harrell smiled throughout the hearing in us 
district court in pleading guilty to charges that she stole at 
least 475 million and lied on her tax returns and to federal 
officials her trial was to have begun today 
the 46yearold ms harrell said she had decided to plead guilty 
as part of a plea agreement because she did not want to spend 
taxpayers money in a court proceeding 
she pleaded guilty to stealing government property and failing 
to report income for taxes as part of the plea bargain 
prosecutors dropped two other tax counts two counts of lying to 
officials from the us department of housing and urban 
development and one count of lying to a bank on a loan application 
but prosecutors said the still do not believe her story that she 
gave most of the money to charity because she is a bornagain 
christian 
my assertion that she has been her own biggest charity will be 
fact by april 20 the date she is to be sentenced us attorney 
breckinridge willcox said at the hearing 
prosecutors recommended a sentence ranging from 37 months to 46 
months roughly three to four years in prison the two charges to 
which she pleaded guilty carry a maximum sentence of 13 years in 
prison and 500000 in fines willcox said prosecutors would also 
recommend a fine but had not yet determined how large a one they 
would recommend 
if convicted on all counts she would have faced a maximum of 31 
years in prison and more than 1 million in fines 
asked by us district judge herbert f murray how she felt 
harrell replied terrific your honor 
harrell who confessed to government officials in december 1988 
became a symbol of mismanagement at hud when scandal erupted there 
last summer after her indictment last november us attorney 
general richard l thornburgh said the case was the single largest 
involving the theft of federal funds by an individual 
harrell went against the advice of her attorney and freely 
discussed taking the money in testimony before congress and in 
several nationally televised interviews 
prosecutors say harrell took at least 66 million from hud 
money generated by sales of hud properties that harrell handled as 
a private escrow agent for the agency 
harrell said she has documents to prove that she took only 475 
million in hud funds and she said that contrary to the 
prosecutors assertion that only a little went to charity in fact 
less than 6 percent of the money benefited her family 
harrell said she hopes to be sentenced to perform community 
service but regards prison as a chance to get a college degree 
i told the kids her son john and his wife vicki just 
think of it as mom going away a few years for college said 
harrell who will become a grandmother sometime next month 
harrell who lives in waldorf a small town in southern 
maryland said she has prepared herself for imprisonment since 
1985 when she started diverting hud funds 
i never did have a problem with pleading guilty on no 1 the 
embezzlement charge harrell said last week obviously thats 
something thats known nationwide 
i really truthfully consider it an honor to give up years of 
my life to help some of the people ive helped she said 
prosecutors had said earlier that she had taken at least 56 
million but they revised the figure today after identifying six 
more properties for which she allegedly did not turn settlement 
proceeds over to the government 
a handful of supporters who said they had benefited from her 
charitable contributions attended the hearing one held up a large 
card that said marilyn we are remembering you 
i thought id get caught a long time ago harrell said after 
the hearing i figured i was history and would help as many as i 
could before i went down asked if she was sorry she said of 
course im sorry it was not a good thing to do 
she has said in the past that she was a bornagain christian who 
took the money to help people in the name of christ

the number of significant earthquakes was down 
last year despite the world series quake in california and total 
deaths were well below average the us geological survey reports 
earthquake fatalities worldwide totaled 526 last year well 
below the longterm average of 10000 deaths per year 
the oct 17 california quake which has been named the loma 
prieta quake killed 62 people injured an estimated 3500 and 
caused damage totaling at least 56 billion 
in 1988 tremors claimed some 28000 lives most in the 
earthquake that struck soviet armenia on dec 7 of that year 
overall there were 55 significant earthquakes last year six 
fewer than in 1988 on average the world had about 60 significant 
quake a year 
a significant quake is defined as one that registers at least 
65 on the richter scale or one that has a lower reading but which 
causes casualties or significant damage 
in addition to the world series quake there were five other 
significant quakes in the united states last year including one in 
the los angeles area on aug 8 that claimed one life the others 
were felt in hawaii on june 26 southern california on jan 19 
alaska on sept 4 and the aleutian islands on oct 7 
last years deadliest quake occurred jan 22 killing 274 
persons in the tajik region of the soviet union ninety died in 
iran in a quake that struck on aug 1 
the strongest tremor of the year occurred may 23 in the south 
pacific it was a socalled great quake measuring 83 on the 
richter scale 
that scale measures the strength of earthquakes as shown by 
ground motion each increase of one whole number indicates 10 times 
more ground motion thus a quake of 63 is 10 times more powerful 
than one of 53

poor leadership not racism was the 
main cause of a riot during a labor day weekend gathering of black 
college students an independent panel has concluded 
the panel concluded that race became a factor only after 
violence began between students and police according to a report 
published sunday by the virginianpilot and ledgerstar newspaper 
of norfolk 
two days of looting during a gathering of 100000 students from 
predominantly black universities and other young people last 
september cost taxpayers more than 1 million the violence during 
greekfest damaged 124 stores in virginia beach and 50 people 
were injured in clashes with police and national guardsmen 
jack gravely president of the state national association for 
the advancement of colored people said today that his group 
supports the basic findings and conclusion of the report 
gravely however said there were some holes in the report 
concerning the arrest and detention policies of the various law 
enforcement agencies involved 
i think the police departments were let off the hook 
were not finished with virginia beach he said 
according to the norfolk newspaper the labor day review 
commission determined that poor preparation failure of 
communication and criminal actions by a small percentage of the 
crowd were responsible for the violence 
the commissions report was to be formally presented to virginia 
beach officials this afternoon city officials have said they wont 
comment until the report is released officially at that time 
the report said most police officers acted responsibly and 
professionally but it urged officials to review films of the 
violence and consider disciplining officers who violated procedures 
we believe some arrests were mistakenly made a few officers 
used inappropriate force and some subjected residents and visitors 
alike to abusive language the newspaper quoted the commission 
report as saying 
once the violence began the report said race then became 
a way to differentiate potential friends and foes 
better preparations by city officials could have helped head off 
problems during the gathering the commission said 
we believe that city council and the mayor should have been 
more active and should have exerted greater leadership the 
report said 
that sounds like a pretty fair assessment l victor 
collins who was director of minority student affairs at old 
dominion university in norfolk at the time of the riots said 
sunday 
the report recommended ways to promote a peaceful gathering as 
thousands of students are expected to return to the beach this 
september 
it must be understood that a repeat of labor day 1989 would 
without doubt strike a major blow to race relations in the city 
the region and the commonwealth of virginia the report said 
mayor meyera e oberndorf said city officials want to make this 
years greekfest a success 
we want to make september 1990 a winwin situation she said 
the report said city officials were out of touch with the 
gatherings practical problems and racial implications but it also 
condemned the looting and violence 
no amount of rationalization can excuse the behavior of those 
individuals who destroyed looted and generally violated the 
bounds of decency that circumscribe the actions of all who live in 
a civilized society it said 
the report urged appointment of an interracial committee 
including representatives of the city area colleges and 
universities and student civil rights business and religious 
groups to plan this years festival

the communists dissolved their 41yearold 
party today and split into two proreform groups that will try to 
find a place in the east blocs first democracy 
former communists today chose aleksander kwasniewski a 
35yearold sports official to lead the new social democracy of 
the republic of poland most of the former communist party 
members joined the party 
but a more radical reformer backed by solidarity leader lech 
walesa former gdansk party chief tadeusz fiszbach broke away from 
the larger group and created a smaller party called the 
socialdemocratic union that he said would not be tainted by the 
old guard 
poland has led the past years whirlwind of democratic reform in 
the east bloc and its communist party became the second in the 
warsaw pact after hungary to disband in an attempt to distance 
itself from a repressive past 
hungarys communists dissolved their party in october a month 
after the solidarity movement took control of polands government 
and ended 40 years of communist rule hungary is to hold free 
elections on march 25 poland held elections in june when 
solidaritybacked candidates won all but one of the seats they 
contested 
the social democrats elected kwasniewski who is close to the 
former communist leadership as their first chairman leszek 
miller a former communist party secretary was chosen as general 
secretary 
kwasniewski received 1049 votes and miller 926 votes out of 
1196 votes cast there were three candidates for each position 
we feel very moved by this election and also terrified 
because we are aware of the immense tasks kwasniewski told the 
delegates i hope we can do together what we have to 
kwasniewski who directs the governments sports committee has 
said he wants a party capable of rallying leftist opinions and 
winning popular backing following the demise of the communist party 
the most important thing is votes not members the better 
party is one with 100000 members and capable of getting 1 
million votes than a party with 1 million members and only 100000 
votes he said before the vote 
the latter case described the old communist party he said 
on sunday the main body of communists voted 122832 to create 
a new party with a platform calling for a multiparty system 
respect for human rights and a market economy with some state 
ownership of capital 
in a resolution it called for further strengthening of ties 
with all the emerging democracies in eastern europe and endorsed 
the idea of a common european home 
however it also said unemployment should not be accepted as a 
permanent part of the economy and that work is a natural right of 
man a clear attack on the solidarityled governments crash 
transformation of a centrally planned economy to free market 
capitalism 
the platforms final resolution accepted responsibility for a 
legacy of failures during the four decades the party held absolute 
power in poland from the crimes of the stalinist era to the 
countrys current economic crisis 
the communists last stronghold in poland is on the local level 
where elections are slated for april and their leaders 
acknowledged a fresh start was needed if they are to have any 
chance 
the new party inherits the disputed property and employees of 
its predecessor formally known as the polish united workers party 
walesa today accused the party of political arrogance for 
taking over the holdings of the communist party 
in a statement issued in gdansk walesa said the illegally 
acquired property of the former communist party belongs to the 
whole society that is why none of the newly created parties has 
the right to take possession 
young demonstrators forced their way into the provincial 
communist party headquarters in gdansk the northern port where 
solidarity was born in 1980 labor unrest on sunday and occupied 
the building demanding it be turned over for public use 
in the southern city of krakow an attack on a party building 
shattered groundfloor windows the official news agency pap 
reported 
anticommunist demonstrators have briefly occupied party 
buildings in cities nationwide over the last month demanding that 
party property be returned to the national treasury 
the solidarityled government has formed a commission to review 
the legal status of the buildings businesses and other communist 
holdings 
at the party congress fiszbach and about 100 followers declared 
formation of their own social democratic union based on 
completely different organizational and financial principles 
fiszbach a parliamentary deputy who quit his regional party 
chief job after the 1981 martial law crackdown on solidarity 
denounced what he called artificial unity and said it was 
impossible that all the old communists had instantly become 
believers in democracy 
the social democratic unions founders included about two doze 
formerly communist members of parliament in a statement the 
breakaway party said it would call a nationwide congress in coming 
months and likely field candidates in the local elections 
in his outgoing speech the old communist partys first 
secretary mieczyslaw f rakowski said the party played a great 
historical role in the polish state 
we are not putting it into a coffin but are closing a chapter 
of the polish revolutionary movement rakowski said just before 
the partys redandgold flag was carried out of the congress hall 
for the last time

a charismatic spiritual leader who has 
wide support among israels predominantly hardline north african 
jews on monday called for a palestinian state and talks with the 
palestine liberation organization 
weve had enough wars and bloodshed we are ready to talk even 
with those who murdered some of our sons said rabbi baruch 
abuhatzera known as baba baruch 
the rabbi who had made similar comments earlier this month 
spoke in an interview before joining thousands of pilgrims for the 
annual hilula a county fairstyle memorial for his father and 
revered holy man rabbi israel abuhatzera who was known as baba 
sali 
prime minister yitzhak shamir head of the rightwing likud bloc 
and a past ally was so angered by the rabbis statements that he 
canceled his visit to the hilula at the last minute 
the rift opened the door for the leftofcenter labor party that 
could improve its elections chances with the support of the 
traditionally conservative north africans particularly those from 
abuhatzeras moroccan community 
vice premier shimon peres the labor party boss and shamirs 
rival attended the memorial for the elder abuhatzera and 
delivered a speech 
this has great importance for the next elections said rabbi 
benjamin chen an aide to baba baruch there are about 800000 
north africans in israel they will remember that shamir didnt 
come to honor the memory of baba sali 
the north africans constitute a large segment of the sephardim 
or jews from middle east countries who in recent years have become 
a majority among the nations 35 million jews ashkenazim or 
european jews have been more supportive of the labor party 
reactions to baba baruchs new politics were mixed among the 
thousands of north african pilgrims who flocked to a whitedomed 
mausoleum on a muddy hilltop in this negev desert town to mark the 
sixth anniversary of baba salis death 
we should talk to the plo if that brings peace my youngest 
son will be drafted in two years and im already sick with 
worry said rina a 55yearold mother of six from the nearby 
town of beersheba touching the white marble grave 
rina who like the other pilgrims ascribes miraculous powers to 
baba sali and baba baruch said she prayed for peace at the grave 
she then placed a softdrink bottle filled with water on the grave 
saying it would become holy and rinse away ailments 
pilgrim david daninu criticized baba baruch saying he should 
not mix religion and politics 
if we are good jews god will help us baba baruch should not 
try to be a politician many people think its not good what he 
did said daninu 63 a retired turkey farmer from moshav bnosh 
an agricultural settlement 
daninu clutching a green plastic basket with sandwiches 
shouted over the arabic music blaring from booths where vendors who 
sold everything from baba sali pictures prayer caps and holy books 
to perfume detergent and sweaters 
baba baruch retained several hardline elements in his peace 
plan he wants israel to annex the west bank considered by 
rightwingers part of the biblical land of israel and establish a

president bushs 123 trillion budget drew a 
skeptical response from several democrats in congress today with 
one senator describing it as another fraud and a house leadthe united 
states to scale back its 
military presence 
bushs budget for fiscal year 1991 slows growth in military 
spending and dictates no general tax increase as part of a plan to 
cut the federal budget deficit in half the defense budget is a 
suggested 3033 billion a rise of 23 percent from this years 
2963 billion but a decrease of 2 percent after inflation figured 
at 43 percent is taken into account 
sen james sasser dtenn chairman of the senate budget 
committee said the budget is a 
listentowhatisayandforgetwhatido budget 
he said the figures translate into huge fiscal problems 
ahead without a change in course 
the low aspirations of this document may put a very low 
ceiling on what we can expect to accomplish with the deficit this 
year he said 
bushs budget projects a 1991 deficit of 631 billion far 
below this years estimated 1238 billion deficit bush said his 
plan would balance the budget by 1993 the same year the 
grammrudman deficitreduction law requires a balanced budget 
hollings said the administrations 1991 figures have a 
starting line some 20 billion ahead of where they really are 
he was skeptical about the white house proposal of adding to 
federal revenues with items such as asset sales 
the house democratic whip rep william gray of pennsylvania 
said he wouldnt call the budget dead on arrival but weve got 
to take a closer look at the specifics its got to be looked 
at its got to be examined 
he questioned bushs underlying economic assumptions saying 
they were quite rosy at a time when all the indicators 
indicate that were not going to have that kind of growth 
interest inflation that the administration is saying 
moreover gray said some of the ways bush plans to raise money 
such as collecting user fees from boaters are simply taxes on 
workingclass americans that have been rejected by congress in 
the past 
sen daniel p moynihan dny who recently generated intense 
controversy in congress by proposing a 62 billion cut in social 
security taxes this year and next noted that bush wants to balance 
the budget in 1993 the year after the next presidential election 
it is well known that the federal budget is always in balance 
three years from now never now moynihan said 
rep bob michel of illinois the house minority leader said the 
democrats obviously have a little bit different idea of where the 
priorities ought to be 
well have the usual kind of argument throughout the year and 
hopefully well just get done in time michel said house members 
all face reelection this year

new information appears to clear a man who has 
spent almost eight years in prison for a grocery store robbery and 
prosecutors will ask the state parole board to pardon him a 
district attorney said today 
dallas county district attorney john vance said police will be 
giving his office new information that will enable prosecutors to 
seek michael anthony wotens release woten had been sentenced to 
55 years 
we will ask for it just as soon as the dallas police 
department furnishes us information on the case if they havent 
already said vance then we will be in the process of doing 
that in the next day or two 
i believe my prosecutor has already confirmed it with the 
police we are just waiting for the police to physically give it to 
us so that we will be knowledgeable enough to ask the governor and 
board of pardons and paroles to pardon him 
the dallas times herald reported sunday that new evidence places 
woten with a truck driver on the outskirts of oklahoma city at the 
time a dallas safeway supermarket was robbed on april 16 1982 
vance said prosecutors will send a letter to the parole board 
setting out the facts as we know them and asking it to 
recommend to gov bill clements that woten be given a full pardon 
i wish that somebody in the process had found that evidence in 
1982 and convinced us not to file the case in the first place 
deputy police chief ray hawkins told the times herald 
woten 36 expressed disbelief when told by the newspaper that 
he might soon be a free man 
is this for sure he asked in all honesty this has 
happened so fast you know theyre not going to change their 
minds are they 
the times heralds twomonth investigation began after woten 
wrote to the newspaper claiming his innocence he enclosed an 
affidavit from fellow inmate russell everett chamberlain which 
said chamberlain committed the robbery 
earlier this month hawkins ordered a detective to reinvestigate 
the case but he told the times herald that chamberlains 
confession would not be enough to win wotens freedom 
then last week a times herald reporter interviewed a crucial 
witness in the presence of a dallas police detective 
former trucker don kangaroo fainter remembered picking up 
woten in oklahoma city and confirmed much of wotens alibi that he 
was hitchhiking to st louis the day two gunmen took 5200 from 
the safeway 
fainter who now runs a gift shop in claycomo mo recalls 
details of the ninehour trip with woten i gave him a ride id 
swear to that he said 
during his trial woten testified that at the time of the 
robbery he was hitchhiking with a truck driver who introduced 
himself as don and used the cb handle kangaroo however 
wotens attorney couldnt find the truck driver 
fainter came forward after hearing of an ad the times herald 
placed this month in a truckers publication searching for 
kangaroo he said he doesnt understand why he wasnt found and 
asked to testify in 1982 
i dont know why they couldnt find me i was right here 
fainter said 
evidence of the trip was found in the centerville ky office 
where fainters former employer stored company records 
the woten case is latest in a string of dubious convictions in 
dallas county 
randall dale adams subject of the film the thin blue line 
was freed last year after spending 13 years in prison after he was 
convicted of killing a dallas police officer he came within three 
days of the death penalty and his conviction was finally 
overturned after his case gained publicity from the documentary 
lenell geter was cleared of armed robbery charges in 1984 after 
he spent 16 months behind bars 
and joyce ann brown was freed in november after spending nine 
years in prison on an aggravated robbery conviction after her 
conviction was overturned by the texas court of criminal appeals 
prosecutors said they may try her again

president bush asked congress today to trim 
defense spending next year by 2 percent after inflation because of 
what the defense department called phenomenal changes sweeping 
the soviet bloc and diminished chances of a major land war in 
europe 
the likelihood of a warsaw pact attack on nato at this point 
is obviously very remote defense secretary dick cheney said at a 
briefing on the pentagons proposed 2921 billion budget for 
fiscal 1991 which starts oct 1 
cheney said some changes in us defense spending are in order 
because of budget constraints but he cautioned against wholesale 
cuts in major weapons programs given the enormous uncertainty 
surrounding political developments in the soviet union 
in his budget proposals to congress bush and cheney outlined a 
smaller us military force paring 38000 men and women from the 2 
million in uniform and calling for elimination of several weapons 
systems as well as the shutdown or reduction of 55 military bases 
at home and 14 overseas 
at the same time the bush administration called for five costly 
new b2 stealth bombers another 1 billion trident submarine and 
funds for two controversial intercontinental nuclear missile 
systems the president also proposed an additional 900 million for 
the strategic defense initiative 
weve seen phenomenal changes cheney said noting that many 
of the warsaw pacts leadership has been swept from power in a 
prodemocracy tidal wave in the past year he also noted reductions 
in soviet military spending 
but cheney said any attempt to reduce us military strength 
because of the budget squeeze has to be done carefully 
cautiously it has to be done deliberately 
bushs budget plan is certain to provoke a blistering battle on 
capitol hill where lawmakers cut bushs request for sdi funds last 
year and are unlikely to embrace military base closings in their 
own districts 
we cannot responsibly reduce the defense budget without 
looking at bases and production lines cheney said in a statement 
released with a list of targeted installations that ranged from the 
armys fort ord near monterey calif to the sprawling repair 
docks at the philadelphia naval shipyard 
the pentagon gave no estimate of eventual cost savings from the 
base closings which require congressional appropriations for the 
initial expense of shutting them down 
cheney said in a statement that the pentagon budget represents 
the first steps in responding to changes in eastern europe and the 
soviet union as well as tighter budget constraints our response 
includes reducing force levels closing military bases and ending 
weapons programs 
to help reduce spending cheney planned to announce later today 
a sweeping list of bases to be closed or reduced over the next five 
years from philadelphia to long beach calif and overseas 
the base closing proposals some already publicized have drawn 
angry protests from lawmakers whose congressional districts would 
be affected 
the pentagons fiscal 1991 budget plan for the 12 months 
starting oct 1 shows an increase in current outlays of 2868 
billion in outlays a 2 percent reduction after adjusting for 
anticpated inflation the administration projects a 43 percent 
inflation rate for the coming year 
the pentagon is seeking overall budget authority of 2951 
billion up from this years 2914 billion that figure does not 
include 111 million in spending for the nuclear weapons programs 
administered by the energy department 
looking ahead cheney projected a 2 percent decline in defense 
spending over the next five years 
by 1995 defense spending will be at its lowest level 
measured either as a share of the total economy or as a portion 
of total federal spending since before world war ii cheney said 
the fiscal 1991 plan calls for cutting activeduty armed forces 
by 38000 men and women trimming civilian defense department 
employees by 5000 and reducing reserve forces by 3000 
two army divisions would be disbanded by the end of the year 
they are the 2nd armored division at fort hood texas and the 9th 
infantry division at fort lewis wash 
production of the armys m1 tank would end after 225 are turned 
out this year 
the navy would lose two of its four battleships from the world 
war ii era the uss iowa and uss new jersey for an estimated 
savings of 75 million eight older attack submarines would be 
deactivated and two nuclear cruisers would be retired fourteen 
b52s also would be withdrawn from service 
overall cheney said he wanted to terminate 20 weapons programs 
in an attempt to save 29 billion 
among them are the marine corps v22 osprey tiltrotor 
aircraft the navys f14d jet fighter the phoenix and maverick 
missiles the apache helicopter the army helicopter improvement 
program and the f15e fighter 
congress last year rejected the administrations attempt to 
eliminate the osprey and ordered f14d production to end after 
several years 
the administrations move to protect several bigticket weapons 
programs from the budget ax faces opposition in congress 
the budget plan includes five b2 stealth bombers costing a 
total of 55 billion the batwinged radarevading plane has given 
lawmakers sticker shock with its 530 million price tag 
congress approved two of the three stealth bombers requested last 
year but the addition of five more is certain to be resisted 
funds for sdi a spacebased antimissile system would be 
increased by 900 million to 45 billion together with about 300 
million in energy department money the program would get 48 
billion under the budget plan 1 billion more than congress 
approved last year 
another controversial administration request is 202 million in 
continued financing of two landbased icbms the railbased 
multiplewarhead mx missile and the truckbased singlewarhead 
midgetman 
another costly budget request is 15 billion for one trident 
submarine and 17 billion for 52 trident ii nuclear missiles 
the budget includes 12 billion to involve the us military 
more deeply in bushs antidrug war and a 35 percent military pay 
raise 
many legislators are expected to demand more drastic cuts in 
defense spending in anticipation of a supposed peace dividend 
cheney has been accused of lacking a strategic plan for responding 
to recent political upheavals in the soviet union and eastern 
europe 
but cheney defended his budget plan as providing careful 
orderly prudent reductions at a time of international 
uncertainty he has said this is the worst possible time to 
contemplate changes in defense strategy

the trial of joseph hazelwood got under 
way today with the judge predicting it would take a fairly long 
time to select a jury to weigh the charges against the former 
tanker captain in the nations worst oil spill 
superior court judge karl johnstone spent much of the morning 
briefing reporters on courtroom rules in the highly publicized case 
hazelwood 43 faces a felony charge of criminal mischief and 
misdemeanor charges of operating a vessel while intoxicated 
reckless endangerment and negligent discharge of oil he was the 
captain of the exxon valdez when the tanker ran aground march 24 
spilling 11 million gallons of crude oil 
johnstone said jury selection in the case would not begin until 
tuesday and that he would spend the rest of today on pretrial 
motions in motions similar to ones that have been rejected in the 
past hazelwoods lawyers are seeking again to have his failed 
sobriety test prohibited as evidence and challenging the states 
jurisdiction in the case 
i expect jury selection will take a fairly long time 
johnstone said estimating it could take two weeks 
about 90 prospective jurors have been given standard threepage 
questionnaires and about 30 a day will be questioned the judge 
said a larger number will be screened if a panel of 12 plus 
alternates cannot be found from the pool of 90 people 
johnstone said he expects each side in the case to spend about 
three weeks presenting arguments 
largely for reasons of fairness the trial was moved here from 
valdez the port where the exxon valdez took on its cargo of north 
slope crude hours before the tanker struck charted bligh reef 
before he left his home state of new york to come here to face 
trial hazelwood said said he looked forward to arguing that the 
spill was a tragic accident not a criminal act 
id like to get rid of the misconception that i got drunk ran 
the ship aground and just shrugged my shoulders and walked away 
because thats just not what happened hazelwood said in an 
interview with the associated press last week in his new york 
lawyers office 
hazelwood who was not on the bridge when the accident occurred 
failed a bloodalcohol test 10 hours after the exxon valdez struck 
bligh reef in prince william sound 
the spill killed thousands of animals and disrupted commercial 
fishing seasons exxon says the cleanup has cost 2 billion 
the charges carry combined penalties of up to seven years three 
months in prison and 61000 in fines 
defense attorney dick madson planned to argue that hazelwood 
left clear instructions for the crew and cannot be held criminally 
responsible for their actions third mate gregory cousins was at 
the wheel of the 987foot vessel when it ran aground after leaving 
designated shipping lanes 
cousins was expected to testify he was served with a subpoena 
in tampa fla on friday at the request of assistant district 
attorney brent cole the hazelwood prosecutor 
cole alleged that cousins was not licensed to navigate in prince 
william sound cousins declined to comment before the trial 
in an affidavit cole also alleged that hazelwood was seen 
drinking at two bars within three hours before his ship left the 
port of valdez 
other witnesses madson said he will call include other crew 
members and an expert who will describe a computer simulation of 
the ships course and testify that the exxon valdez would have 
cleared bligh reef had the crew followed hazelwoods instructions 
the trial originally scheduled for october in valdez was 
delayed as courts dealt with reassigning judges processing thick 
legal motions and other matters 
the trial was moved to anchorage on grounds a fair proceeding 
could not be obtained in valdez and because alaskas largest city 
has a substantial jury pool and facilities for news media 
hazelwood was expected to be in the courtroom throughout the 
trial 
since being fired the seaman from huntington ny has been 
working as a lobsterman before his tanker ran aground the longest 
he had been ashore since he was an adolescent was two or three 
months 
i get stark crazy when i am too far from the salt water he 
said chainsmoking during the interview 
hazelwood said he was confident that once alaskans heard the 
case against him they will agree that this was a tragic accident 
nothing more

defense secretary dick cheney proposed closing 
or realigning more than 60 military bases in the united states and 
12 installations overseas today as part of a costsaving effort 
these proposed actions are part of an ongoing effort to 
streamline defense department operations in keeping with changing 
requirements and future budget realities cheney told capitol 
hill lawmakers in a letter that accompanied his list 
cheney released the list of suggested targeted military sites at 
a pentagon briefing in which he also discussed his 2921 billion 
fiscal 1991 spending plan 
among the domestic bases affected are several in california 
including fort ord which played a major role in the recent 
invasion of panama alameda naval aviation depot oaklands naval 
supply center moffett field naval air station and long beach naval 
shipyard 
the overseas bases include seven in europe four in asia and a 
naval air station in bermuda 
the european bases include two in greece hellenikon air base 
and navcommsta in makri one in west germany zweibrucken air 
base three in england raf fairford greenham common and 
wethersfield and one in italy comiso air base 
comiso and greenham common are home to air force cruise missile 
installations that are being dismantled under the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty with the soviet union 
signed in december 1987 
the asian bases on cheneys list are a navy base in san miguel 
philippines and three in south korea kwang ju suwon and taeguak 
no final decision has been made regarding closure reduction 
or realignment of installations the navy documents on the 
closings said 
the army cuts also apply to a number of reserve units including 
some in arizona california colorado connecticut illinois 
kentucky maryland and michigan 
reports of cheneys proposed closures have circulated for 
several days on capitol hill where they set off heated protests 
from lawmakers and prompted a warning from rep patricia schroeder 
dcolo a member of the house armed services committee that the 
shutdowns must not be partisan if the pentagon hopes to achieve any 
cuts 
however to discourage leaks pentagon officials waited until 
the weekend to print the entire base closure list and the 
secretary was to discuss his reasoning behind the base erasures at 
a twohour press conference today 
cheneys list is only a suggestion however since it costs 
money to shut bases down and legislation is necessary to accomplish 
the complex feat the savings are not usually accrued until years 
later 
in actuality cheneys list is a proposal to study which bases 
should be eliminated closing a base also requires a lengthy series 
of environmental impact statements which often lead to delays

opposition politician oskar lafontaine 
won a key endorsement monday in his bid to be the main challenger 
to chancellor helmut kohl in decembers elections 
lafontaine the governor of saarland state led the social 
democrats to a lopsided victory over kohls conservative party in 
state elections 
on monday social democratic party chairman hansjochen vogel 
announced he was backing lafontaine as the partys choice to 
challenge kohl he said lafontaine is a politician who can speak 
to the people and who can convince them 
vogel said the partys board will discuss lafontaines candidacy 
in march 
a final decision will be made at a special national party 
congress in autumn but vogels endorsement along with those from 
other influential social democrats is likely to assure lafontaine 
of the candidacy 
the independentminded leftist lafontaine is the partys deputy 
chairman 
the saarland governor told reporters he would take a threeweek 
vacation to consider whether he would accept the partys 
nomination but in recent weeks lafontaine has clearly stated he 
was willing to try to unseat kohl 
lafontaines already good prospects of becoming the social 
democrats standard bearer received a major boost after he led the 
party to a resounding victory in sundays local elections 
nationally known and respected as a tough career politician 
lafontaine is expected to be a strong challenger to kohls bid for 
a third fouryear term as the west german leader 
lafontaine 46 handed kohls conservative christian democratic 
union the latest in a string of local setbacks the free democrats 
kohls centrist partner in the governing bonn coalition also lost 
seats 
sundays vote in saarland was an unexpectedly strong endorsement 
for lafontaines entry into national politics as the social 
democrats widened its absolute majority in the state parliament 
the social democrats polled 544 percent compared with 334 
percent for the christian democrats and 56 percent for the free 
democrats 
according to preliminary official results the social democrats 
won 30 of the state parliaments 51 seats a gain of four the 
christian democrats won 18 down two while the free democrats 
dropped from five to three seats 
for kohl it was a damper after last falls sudden democratic 
changes in east germany stirred hopes for german reunification and 
boosted the chancellors standing 
lafontaines campaign focused on the economic and social impacts 
of the wave of east germans resettling in west germany the 
election outcome illustrates the publics growing resentment of the 
influx 
lafontaine has urged that generous federal and state benefits 
for east german immigrants be cut to encourage them to stay at home 
and work for democratic change 
he said sunday night that the saarland vote was a warning to 
bonn 
a majority of the population does not tolerate that one talks 
about future forms of statehood but not about current social 
problems he told west german tv it is nonsensical to offer 
bounties for leaving east germany 
about 47000 east germans have fled political and economic 
uncertainty in their communistdominated homeland since jan 1 and 
as many as 2000 arrive daily nearly 344000 migrated to west 
germany last year putting great strain on social services and 
housing markets 
lafontaine recently called himself a german patriot in the 
tradition of enlightenment and tolerance 
vogel has predicted outstanding achievements for lafontaine 
who began a meteoric political career at age 21 in the party youth 
organization in saarbruecken he became the youngest mayor of any 
west german city at age 32 
when he was voted deputy chairman of the social democrats in 
1987 he had become known as a gadfly opposed particularly to the 
partys conservative wing led by former chancellor helmut schmidt 
lafontaine vocally opposed plans to station us mediumrange 
nuclear missiles in west germany pushed by schmidt in the late 
1970s

the state department on monday praised east 
germanys decision to move up national elections to march and 
cautioned the interim rulers of romania against backsliding from 
the countrys revolution 
privately us officials were relieved that the east german 
government had decided not to wait until may 6 to hold the 
elections they had rated the communist goverments chances of 
surviving until then as no better than 5050 
those chances may have been improved by the parallel decision in 
east berlin to form a coalition government until the march 18 
elections with opposition elements a move that effectively ends 
the communists domination 
they seem to have accelerated the schedule in order to move 
quickly to a more stable more longterm regime thats based on the 
popular will thats something that we support richard boucher 
the state department spokesman said 
secretary of state james a baker iii visited potsdam last month 
to demonstrate us support for the new governnet he held separate 
talks with premier hans modrow and lutheran clergymen many of whom 
were critics of the ousted hardline regime 
baker is planning to go to czechoslvakia next week to show 
support for the relatively calm transition in that central european 
country but chances that he might also go to romania appear to be 
slipping in light of unsettled conditions there 
a final decision is expected shortly 
the stop in prague is part of a trip dominated by talks baker 
will hold in moscow feb 78 on arms control issues afghanistan 
and other topics with soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze 
spokesman boucher reiterated us support for trends in east 
germany in his statement the united states has i think clearly 
and consistently favored the process of democratic reform in east 
germany he said we think that only by meeting the desire of 
the east german population for reform can stability be maintained 
boucher addes that it remains critical that the elections be 
genuinely democratic free and secret he said the decision to 
move up the elections was designed to promote stability in east 
germany by establishing a government based on popular will 
we agree that the installation of a legitimate government 
based on free elections is the best guarantee of longterm 
stability boucher said 
turning to romania where an interim government has imposed 
restrictions on freedom of assembly the state department spokesman 
took a cautious stance 
we are carefully watching the almost daily demonstrations in 
bucharest which have protested the predominance of communists in 
the national salvation front and the fronts recent decision to 
run candidates in the election scheduled for may 20th he said 
the composition and policies of the salvation front will 
obviously be important issues in those elections we call upon all 
romanians both inside and outside the government to conduct 
themselves peacefully and in the true spirit of democracy to which 
they say they are dedicated boucher said reading from a 
prepared statement 
it concluded with this warning there should be no backsliding 
on the part of transitional officials as romania moves from 
revolution to democracy

democratic forces monday to join him in opposing the merger of 
the governing democratic justice party and two conservative 
opposition groups 
the leftist leader called the proposed merger a coup detat 
there is no precedent in our nations political history for 
such an infamous and traitorous action he said in a single 
day the ruling party which had not even a majority suddenly 
became threequarters of the national assembly this is a situation 
which makes possible total dictatorship 
changes in the constitution can be made with a twothirds vote 
in the legislature 
president roh taewoos party holds 127 of the 299 seats in the 
unicameral parliament compared with 71 for kims leftist party for 
peace and prosperity the merged party to be formed in a month 
would have about 220 seats 
in a statement he read at a meeting of the seoul foreign 
correspondents club kim said his party will welcome all 
moderate democratic political forces and will try to be the 
peoples party he said the proposed new ruling party was 
controlled by the forces of the extreme right 
rohs party intends to join with the reunification demcoratic 
party of kim youngsam and the new demcoratic republican party led 
by kim jongpil they are the second and thirdranked opposition 
parties after kim daejungs 
during a television appearance a week ago with the two other 
party leaders roh said they had agreed to form a new conservative 
political group with the aim of bringing stability to south koreas

a faulty airconditioning fan was blamed 
monday for sending smoke into the cabin of a delta air lines jet as 
the pilot tried for a third time to make the trip to new york 
the fan overheated sunday spreading smoke in the cabin of 
flight 606 through airconditioning ducts and forcing an 
evacuation said sam k murphy district marketing manager for 
delta there was no fire 
the flight bound for laguardia airport carried 114 passengers 
and a crew of eight 
four people suffered minor injuries when the passengers and crew 
used slides to evacuate the boeing 727 
the plane was taxiing at about 115 pm when the smoke was 
detected in the passenger cabin murphy said at that point he 
said the planes engines were shut down and the emergency chutes 
used 
people were grabbing at the oxygen masks said christen 
cashman 21 a student at hofstra university in hempstead ny i 
wasnt really that nervous because there was a businessman next to 
us and he told us it was no big deal and these things happen all 
the time then we lined up and went down the evacuation chute 
the aborted takeoff was the planes third attempt that day 
the plane had first tried to depart on schedule at 11 am but 
returned to the gate before liftoff because of an oil warning light 
on engine no 1 murphy said 
maintenance workers fixed the problem and the plane took off 
about a half hour later he said 
after about 20 minutes in the air the same warning light 
flashed on for engine no 3 and the aircraft returned to tampa 
international airport 
that indicates a potential problem and as a precautionary 
measure the pilot returned to have our maintenance people take a 
look at it murphy said 
as he returned for landing the pilot using standard 
procedures shut off the engine and dumped a significant 
amount of fuel over the gulf of mexico said paul macalester an 
airport spokesman he says the fuel is dumped to lessen the chances 
of fire from landing difficulties 
it would have been enough fuel to get from here to la 
guardia and some to spare macalester said you do this so you 
dont have any more fuel on board than you have to 
the jet landed safely and maintenance workers changed the oil 
filters in the two other engines as the plane prepared for take 
off an hour later the smoke was detected and the flight was 
grounded

president bush proposed monday to trim federal 
transportation outlays next year to 78 billion but to hire more 
employees to handle growing air traffic congestion and detect 
safety problems in aging airliners 
bushs proposed budget for fiscal 1991 which starts oct 1 
calls for a 264 million increase in funds for the federal aviation 
administration a 7 percent boost to 41 billion for the agency 
the higher funds would enable the faa to hire nearly 500 new air 
traffic controllers 300 new safety inspectors and additional 
security specialists there were 16921 controllers on the federal 
payroll as of dec 31 
additional staff are needed because of projected increases in 
aviation activity and because of the aging of the aircraft fleet 
the faa said 
the staffing increases will result in the largest air traffic 
control work force in the history of the faa and more than double 
the staff devoted to detecting the problems of aging aircraft 
the agency said 
the announcement came as federal investigators were exploring an 
apparent communications mixup between regional and local new york 
air traffic controllers in the crash of a colombian avianca 
jetliner on long island last thursday killing 73 people and 
injuring 85 others the plane which was low on fuel was trying to 
land at kennedy international airport 
overall bush urged reducing transportation department outlays 
from the current 92 million to 78 billion next year and 
putting greater reliance on taxsupported highway and aviation 
trust funds and publicprivate enterprises to finance major 
transportation improvements 
the trust funds are supported by a variety of user fees and 
excise taxes on such items as gasoline when they are taken into 
account total transportation spending would rise to 287 billion 
in fiscal 1991 compared with 282 billion this year 
other bush proposals included 
a ticket tax or surcharge on departing air passengers to help 
finance airport construction and improvements 
a fivefold increase in research spending on developing 
socalled smart cars and smart highways using stateofthe art 
electronics communications and computer technology to improve 
traffic control systems that warn drivers of dangerous situations 
and make more efficient use of the existing road system 
10 million to assess the potential of a publicprivate system 
of nonpolluting highspeed trains guided by magnets and achieving 
maximum speeds of 300 miles per hour 
the administration proposed a 12 percent increase from 65 
billion to 72 billion in programs to benefit air travelers as 
part of a longterm plan to modernize aviation facilities expand 
airport capacity and bolster aviation research and development 
the request for 190 million earmarked for research and 
development a 12 percent boost in current spending would 
finance a study of metal fatigue and corrosion in older aircraft 
and a new laboratory to perfect airport detection of explosive 
devices in luggage 
it also would pay for development of new ways to prevent 
aircraft fires and minimize fire injuries 
bush proposed cutting off operating subsidies to mass transit 
systems in cities with populations of 1 million or more saying the 
federal contribution represents less than 6 percent of those 
budgets

consumer spending posted its largest increase 
in three years in 1989 the government reported monday and 
analysts said robust incomes should result in continued purchasing 
strength in the first quarter of 1990 
the commerce department said spending totaled 347 trillion a 
73 percent gain over 1988 and the sharpest advance since a 61 
percent increase in 1986 
at the same time it said personal incomes rose 9 percent to 
443 trillion last year up from 76 percent in 1988 and the 
fastest advance since rising 95 percent in 1984 
you look at those numbers and you kind of wonder why everybody 
was talking about recession remarked michael k evans head of a 
washington forecasting organization those were pretty good 
numbers especially the growth in income which was quite robust 
the difference between 1989 earnings and purchases helped boost 
americans savings rate savings as a percent of disposable income 
to 55 percent from 42 percent in 1988 it was the highest rate 
since 1984s 61 percent 
despite the increases in 1989 incomes and consumption the year 
ended on a sluggish note with economic growth held back by high 
interest rates resulting from federal reserve efforts to slow 
inflation by keeping a tight grip on credit 
the commerce department reported last friday that the gross 
national product grew only 05 percent in the octoberdecember 
quarter down from a 3 percent advance in the third quarter the 
report on the gnp the nations total output of goods and services 
included a rare decline of 01 percent in spending in the fourth 
quarter 
the yearend economic sluggishness was further reflected in 
mondays report of a 05 percent increase in personal income in 
december down from the 09 percent gains in both october and 
november the december figure was the smallest advance since a 02 
percent rise last september and reflected a seasonally adjusted 
annual spending rate of 457 trillion 
the december increase was boosted by a return to work 
following strikes in the aircraft and telephone industries and was 
reduced by decreases in retroactive social security benefit 
payments and in subsidy payments to farm proprietors the 
commerce department said 
but at the same time consumers increased their spending in 
december by 1 percent up from 03 percent in both october and 
november and the largest increase since a 1 percent gain in august 
spending totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 358 
trillion 
much of the december increase commerce said was spent on fuel 
oil electricity and natural gas because of unusually cold weather 
nevertheless sandra shaber an economist with the futures group 
here said consumers still were spending as the year ended 
although cautiously 
well see an improvement in consumer spending in the first 
quarter of 1990 she said we already see an increase in car 
sales which made the whole fourth quarter look so bad 
purchases of durable goods bigticket items expected to last 
more than three years rose 67 billion in december after 
declining 28 billion the previous month nondurable purchases 
gained 62 billion after a 34 billion november increase 
spending on services increased 241 billion following a 96 
billion advance the previous month 
americans incomes after taxes rose 04 percent last month 
after a 1 percent gain in november the key component of the income 
category wages and salaries increased 169 billion in 
december reflecting in part the end of the boeing co aircraft 
strike wages and salaries rose 2 billion in november 
payrolls at manufacturing companies increased 23 billion after 
dropping 59 billion in november 
the december savings rate was 56 percent down from 62 percent 
in november

a program aimed at bringing the peregrine falcon 
back from the brink of extinction in illinois has reached its goal 
a decade earlier than expected the project director said monday 
when the chicago peregrine release program ends this summer 46 
of the crowsized birds of prey will have been reintroduced into 
illinois said director vicki byre 
before the program began in 1986 peregrines had not been seen 
in illinois for 35 years wiped out by pesticides that damaged 
their ability to reproduce ms byre said in a telephone interview 
by the end of 1960s peregrines were entirely extinct east of 
the rocky mountains she said 
but with the help of projects nationwide there are now likely 
more than 100 breeding pairs east of the rockies and probably 
more than that west of the rockies she said peregrines in the 
western united states have fared better because there is less 
cropland and thus less pesticide use ms byre said 
its because of man that they have disappeared so i think we 
owe it to our fellow living creatures to help them back she said 
changes have been made since the neardemise of the peregrine 
natures fastest bird and known for making spectacular swoops at 
200 mph to catch its prey smaller birds in flight 
the pesticide ddt was banned in this country in 1972 and the 
federal government declared the falcon an endangered species the 
following year 
the peregrines natural habitat mostly wide open cliffs also 
has changed places where it once roosted have been populated with 
homes trees and the falcons most deadly predator the great 
horned owl said carl becker chief of the illinois department of 
conservations division of natural heritage 
so most projects like chicagos release the birds into urban 
wilds ornithologists have discovered the lofty ledges of 
skyscrapers make ideal homes 
under the chicago program coordinated by the chicago academy of 
sciences and the conservation department 5weekold peregrine 
chicks raised in captivity are released in groups of about five and 
provided with food until they can thrive on their own each bird 
costs 1750 
the whole thing that we measure the success of the program by 
is not just if you can get them released in the wild but if they 
can mate on their own ms byre said 
so far peregrines in illinois have produced at least six young 
she said 
our goal was to try to get three breeding pairs into illinois 
by the year 2000 the program has reached that goal already because 
we do have three pairs ms byre said 
once the chicago program ends the conservation department will 
evaluate whether to attempt peregrine release elsewhere in the 
state becker said

the nature conservancy closed a deal 
monday to acquire the biologically diverse 321703acre gray ranch 
in new mexicos southwestern boot heel the environmental 
organization said 
it is the largest land acquisition in the nearly 40year history 
of the nonprofit conservancy which has protected more than 4 
million acres of ecologically significant land across the united 
states 
we acted as we did because we were concerned that it the 
ranch may be sold to another purchaser that may not share the kind 
of conservation goals that the nature conservancy had said bill 
waldman of santa fe director of the conservancys operations in 
new mexico 
more separate species and subspecies of mammals are found on 
the gray ranch than on any existing national wildlife refuge or 
national park in the continental united states waldman said from 
the groups national headquarters in arlington va 
the ranch supports an estimated 75 species and subspecies of 
mammals 150 species of birds and 52 kinds of reptiles and 
amphibians said michele merola operations and communications 
coordinator for the conservancy in santa fe 
the animals include three federally endangered species 
sanborns longnosed bat the bald eagle and the ridgenosed 
rattlesnake 
the state also has an endangered species list ms merola said 
and 21 plants and animals from that list are represented at the 
ranch including the whiteeared hummingbird the bunchgrass 
lizard nightblooming cereus greenflowered fishhook cactus and 
the white butterfly cactus 
in the middle of the ranch south of lordsburg sit the animas 
mountains covered with conifer trees like douglas fir pinon and 
juniper the flanks of the mountains give way to oak and shrub oak 
that is surrounded by semidesert grassland which makes up the 
bulk of the ranch 
last year congress postponed appropriations to buy the ranch 
and interior secretary manuel lujan jr placed an indefinite freeze 
on a proposed federal purchase of the ranch for use as a wildlife 
refuge 
lujans decision came after he and gov garrey carruthers toured 
the ranch last september at the time lujan expressed concern 
about its high cost 
the owners want 23 million but the appraisal is 16 million 
and by the time they buy surrounding ranches were looking at 50 
to 60 million instead lujan said 
the nature conservancy bought the ranch from gray land and 
cattle co which waldman said has owned the land for seven or 
eight years 
the price was not revealed but sen jeff bingaman dnm said 
last year that the group planned to buy the ranch for an estimated 
1825 million 
weve been actively involved in pursuit of protecting it for 
several years and weve been negotiating for two years waldman 
said 
the nature conservancy is acquiring 226664 acres of deeded 
land and will lease the remaining state private and us bureau 
of land management land waldman said 
the ranch was once the property of george hearst a california 
mining and livestock baron and father of publishing magnate william 
randolph hearst the conservancy said

jonas savimbi the angolan rebel leader 
said monday the civil war may end this year because of superpower 
pressure and his countrys weariness with bloodshed 
the pressure for peace from inside and outside angola will be 
so great i dont see how either side will be able to continue 
fighting in 1990 said savimbi who has us support we are 
going to launch an enormous effort to end the war this year 
he spoke to reporters during a tour of europe that also will 
take him to belgium switzerland west germany and possibly france 
in search of support for his unita guerrilla movement 
savimbi has fought the sovietbacked government since angola 
independence from portugal in 1975 
he said unita whose formal name is the national union for the 
total independence of angola had been in direct contact with cuba 
to give assurances the rebels would not attack cuban soldiers 
stationed in angola 
last week cuba suspended the withdrawal of its troops after 
four cubans where killed in a unita raid 
reports on monday from luanda the angolan capital said cuban 
soldiers killed 33 guerrillas in apparent reprisal for the jan 21 
rebel attack 
cuban soldiers had not been involved in fighting since the 
withdrawal began after south africa pledged in december 1988 to 
stop aid to unita and grant independence to neighboring namibia 
cuba originally had 50000 soldiers in angola and an estimated 
19000 remain 
savimbi said better superpower relations meant the kremlin would 
support a more active role for the united states in seeking peace 
us envoy herman cohen was in london on monday and reports said he 
intended to meet with soviet officials about angola 
a ceasefire signed in june at gbadolite zaire collapsed 
within days since december unita has fought off what the rebels 
describe as the largest government offensive ever launched against 
their strongholds 
halting that offensive and arranging talks between savimbi and 
president jose eduardo dos santos should be the next steps the 
rebel leader said 
the americans and the portuguese can play a more active role 
in the search for peace by establishing where the common ground 
between the two sides lies and using that to bring us together 
he said 
savimbi said the united states and portugal should support peace 
efforts by president mobuto sese seko of zaire who has mediated 
between the government and rebels he said portugal could serve as 
a channel of communication between the sides 
president mario soares and prime minister anibal cavaco silva of 
portugal met with savimbi separately over the weekend jose durao 
barroso secretary of state for foreign affairs flew to london on 
monday for talks with cohen 
savimbi met with roman catholic church leaders and labor union 
officials monday

the un human rights commission began its annual 
session on monday with a tribute to the late andrei sakharov who 
was hailed as a champion of freedom and human rights 
all members of the 43nation commission rose after the incumbent 
chairman marc bossuyt asked for a minute of silence in sakharovs 
memory and as a gesture of gratitutde for all those who 
courageously fought for human rights 
bossuyt a belgian international law expert also hailed the 
courage clearsightedness and selfsacrifice of political leaders 
who dared to abandon the methods of the past to confront realities 
in order to better respond to the needs of the peoples which 
they govern 
he said the past year had brought success for some human rights 
movements while others were drowned in blood 
in any case it is clear that the thirst for freedom can move 
masses throughout the world he said the last decade of the 
20th century has begun with that message 
bossuyt said he believed the commission remained silent on many 
past abuses too often every time a repressive regime collapses 
and human rights violations are revealed there is a certain 
embarrassment which some people try to hide in vain by feigning 
irgnorance he said 
the commission should concern itself less with the risk of 
displeasing some governments which violate human rights and should 
be more concerned by the fate of the victims of those violations 
he said 
jan martenson un undersecretarygeneral for human rights 
joined bossuyt in eulogizing sakharov we best honor his memory 
by maintaining the fight for justice and human dignity in the face 
of indifference and intolerance he said 
the crowded opening meeting was also attended by observers from 
many other un member nations and by representatives of more than 
100 nongovernmental organizations monitoring human rights 
purificacion quisumbing a senior legal official in the 
philippine government was elected to chair the 1989 session 
succeeding bossuyt 
the commissions agenda covers a wide range of issues from such 
traditional subjects as south africa and israel to special 
reports on a number of countries including iran and romania both 
nonmembers 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar has been asked to 
submit a note on the situation in china a member the note is 
to come in response to a cautious resolution adopted by a panel of 
the commission last august following the brutal repression of 
prodemocracy protesters in beijing 
the united states has said it will make a new effort to have the 
commission launch a special inquiry into the human rights situation 
in cuba also a member of the commission

artist mel bolden figured his portrait of 
space shuttle challenger victim christa mcauliffe would circulate 
around the world but he didnt expect it to go into orbit 
he learned monday that a photograph released by the soviet news 
agency tass shows a copy of his mcauliffe poster on the wall in the 
soviet mir space station 
orbiting soviet cosmonauts featured the poster and an official 
nasa photograph of the challenger crew to commemorate their deaths 
four years ago sunday when the shuttle exploded shortly after 
launch 
im just trying to figure out how they got a copy of the 
poster bolden said its beyond my wildest dream or 
imagination 
its an honor he said im flabbergasted 
cosmonauts alexander serebrv and alexander viktorenko conducted 
a lesson for children from space sunday to commemorate the 
challenger anniversary 
mcauliffe a concord high school social studies teacher was 
chosen in 1985 from among 11000 teachers to be the first ordinary 
american to travel in space her main mission on the flight was to 
have been to conduct classes from orbit to rekindle interest in 
space travel 
boldens poster shows a smiling mcauliffe in her blue nasa 
flight suit the shuttle headed for space in the background it 
also incorporates a classroom scene painted in her concord high 
classroom 
on the blackboard is a simple message any dream can come true 
if you have the courage to work at it 
bolden who turned 71 on sunday the blast anniversary figures 
nasa may have given the soviets a copy of the poster 
bolden said he and mcauliffe worked together to design the 
poster which was intended to be distributed to help raise money 
for science scholarships 
we were trying to get across the idea of education 
particularly science education and trying to inspire kids into 
getting into science and math bolden said 
after mcauliffe died bolden took his idea to pepsicola co 
which bought the portrait and donated it to the smithsonian 
institutions air and space museum in washington 
the mir station was launched feb 20 1986 the current crew is 
the seventh to visit the station serebrv and viktorenko were 
launched into space in june for a planned sixmonth stay in mir

britains foreign secretary douglas hurd said 
monday he had urged the bush administration to grant american 
passports to residents of hong kong working for american firms in 
order to help the islands transition from british to chinese rule 
in 1997 
the idea is to reassure islanders that they can stay in hong 
kong while having a secure fallback of an american passport should 
they wish to leave hurd told reporters after lunching with 
secretary of state james a baker iii 
hurd was meeting president bush and other leaders on his first 
trip to washington since assuming office last october his talks 
were focused on upcoming changes within the nato alliance in light 
of the changes sweeping away the old order in the soviet union and 
eastern europe 
hurd said that if hong kong residents holding key positions 
leave the territory stability could not be maintained during the 
complicated transition period he said he told baker that it 
would be enormously helpful if the united states provided 
passports to islanders working for american firms 
britain and other countries would also be providing passports to 
hong kong residents under this scheme 
the subject will come up again tuesday when hurd holds talks in 
congress where legislation on the matter is pending 
hurd said he had appealed to baker for us understanding of his 
governments handling of more than 40000 vietnamese boat people in 
hong kong 
the british want to send most of the vietnamese back but the 
united states wants a oneyear suspension of the forced 
repatriation to vietnam 
hurd said the problem will become more accute with the 
anticipated arrival of 30000 to 40000 more vietnamese in hong 
kong this spring and summer 
he said british efforts were concentrated on explaining to 
residents of vietnam the realities of life in overcrowded camps in 
hong kong and other asian nations too many vietnamese are taken in 
by smugglers who tell them they are assured of resettlement in the 
west hurd said 
only about 1 percent of those leaving fit britains definition 
of refugees or people fleeing persecution the rest are viewed as 
economic migrants seeking a better life 
hurd said he had told baker that the british government is under 
pressure to launch an aid program for the communist government of 
vietnam to improve conditions in the impoverished country the 
united states has imposed economic sanctions on vietnam defying 
critics who argue that us economic help could do much to stem the 
flow of boat people 
hurd said the decision announced earlier in the day by defense 
secretary dick cheney to shut down dozens of military bases at home 
and abroad including pulling out of three royal air force bases in 
britain was compatible with natos objectives were satisfied 
that the decision is reasonable and compatible with the vienna 
talks between nato and the warsaw pact on reducing their 
conventional forces in europe as well he said 
hurd said he and baker generally agreed that although problems 
are clearly accumulating in the soviet union we dont see any 
reason to suppose they put a question mark over the leadership of 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachev

president bush asked congress on monday to 
close military bases while spending more money on the strategic 
defense initiative establish a new foreign aid program to 
encourage democracy in eastern europe and give families with 
longterm savings a tax break 
here are some of the highlights of the presidents 123 
trillion spending plan for the fiscal year beginning oct 1 
defense 
the budget would raise spending from 2963 billion this year to 
3033 billion in fiscal 1991 a 23 percent increase the defense 
department said that after inflation of 43 percent is figured in 
the change amounts to a 2 percent reduction the pentagon would cut 
38000 men and women from the 2 million now in uniform 
secretary of defense dick cheney proposed closing or realigning 
more than 60 military bases in the united states and 12 
installations overseas 
two army divisions would be disbanded by the end of the year 
they are the 2nd armored division at fort hood texas and the 9th 
infantry division at fort lewis wash 
the pentagon would also terminate 20 weapons programs in an 
attempt to save 29 billion 
the budget calls however for five new b2 stealth bombers at 
a cost of 55 billion and 900 million for the sdi program often 
dubbed star wars both proposals as well as the base closings are 
expected to encounter stiff congressional resistance 
therell be a debate about defense theres no question about 
that said speaker of the house thomas foley of washington 
also in the defense budget are 15 billion for another trident 
submarine and 202 million in continued financing of two landbased 
missile systems the railbased multiplewarhead mx and the 
truckbased singlewarhead midgetman another 17 billion would 
be spent for 52 submarinebased trident ii missiles

175 million to help drugproducing andean countries attack the 
narcotics problem 
proposes to begin the repayment over a fiveyear period of 
620 million in back dues owed to the united nations on top of 
794 million in current payments another 279 million would be 
earmarked for overdue bills from multilateral development banks 
the two largest recipients of us military and economic aid 
would continue at their current levels 3 billion for israel and 
21 billion for egypt 
taxes 
recommends 157 billion worth of tax increases but no general 
boost in income taxes there would be a 56 billion increase in 
user and service fees 
also included is a capitalgains tax cut and 18 billion in 
other tax reductions including a credit of up to 1000 a year for 
each child under age 4 in poor families social security tax 
receipts would be used only to pay off government debt beginning 
in 1993 
the interest paid on family savings accounts held for seven 
years would be exempt from income tax up to a limit of 5000 per 
joint tax return or 2500 per individual return after the seven 
years withdrawals would be tax free before that there would be a 
10 percent excise 
farm 
the budget provides 234 billion for nutrition the largest 
general program in the agriculture department budget including an 
increase of 600 million for food stamps to cover higher food costs 
and increased monthly allocations to families the food stamp 
budget would be 154 billion 
there would be less than 52 billion for child nutrition 
however down 156 million from 1990 despite the decrease 
children from the poorest families would continue to get meals free 
and those in middlelevel poverty would pay 20 cents a meal instead 
of 40 cents as at present 
children from affluent families now entitled to have meals 
subsidized by the government would have to pay full price adding 
about 29 cents per meal to their outlay 
the budget also provides more money for farm price support 
programs nevertheless guaranteed prices for farmers as well as 
the direct payments they receive for major crops would probably be 
reduced if congress goes along with 15 billion in commodity 
program cuts being proposed separately 
the budget could increase farm spending by about 41 per cent 
pushing it from the current 482 billion to about 502 billion 
on the other hand the increase could be held to 1 percent if the 
lawmakers approve the unspecified commodity cuts 
space 
increases the national aeronautics and space administrations 
spending from 12 billion to 141 billion or 24 percent the 
largest increase for any major agency of the government calls for 
a record 10 space shuttle flights next fiscal year at a cost of 
more than 8 billion the spending blueprint proposes budget 
authority of 26 billion for development of a manned space station 
and 12 billion for exploration activities to support a mission to 
the moon and later to mars 
transportation 
shifts much of the cost of air traffic control from direct 
federal spending to an aviation trust fund financed by user fees 
currently 3 billion comes from direct spending and 34 billion 
from the trust fund bush would cut the direct federal share to 
12 billion and raise the trust fund portion to 6 billion by 
increasing the user fees he said this would pay for 495 more air 
traffic controllers and 300 air safety specialists 
head start 
adds 500 million of spending authority for the preschool 
education program for a total of 19 billion the administration 
said the 36 percent increase should allow the program to enroll 
180000 more 4yearolds from lowincome families about 450000 
children now participate 
housing 
shifts nearly 60 million from lowincome rental programs to a 
certificate program designed to allow tenants of federally 
subsidized housing to buy their units the 23 billion housing and 
urban development budget also provides more money for urban 
enterprise zones designed to encourage selfhelp in the inner 
cities 
drugs 
boosts overall federal spending authority for the drug war by 
11 billion to 106 billion 
environment 
calls for 42 billion to clean up hazardous materials at 
department of energy nuclear plants and other facilities run by 
nasa and the departments of defense interior agriculture and 
transportation this would be an increase 642 million over the 
current fiscal year requests 175 million for the first year of a 
reforestation program aimed at planting 1 billion trees a year on 
private land 
arts 
increases spending for arts and humanities programs such as the

500th anniversary of columbus voyage to america 
water projects 
no money is provided for new army corps of engineers projects 
the 32 billion budget for the agency is about the same as that

president bushs budget message monday 
suggested state and local governments build more toll roads to meet 
highway needs and charge air passenger fees to finance new airport 
construction 
a chapter of the fiscal 1991 budget document the administration 
sent to congress highlights efforts by states to come up with ideas 
to provide public services in the face of a shrinking federal 
ability to provide money 
it said local governments should encourage car pools including 
use of restricted lanes and turn to privately run city bus systems 
as an alternative to highercost public transit systems 
it recommends broader use of some of those state and local 
innovations and describes others as experiments worth watching in 
health care education the environment welfare and child care 
it is a picture of creative experimentation not social 
engineering but the natural flowering of variety inherent in a 
healthy federal system the budget report says of state and local 
efforts it is a picture that merits highlighting and federal 
government support 
the budget said states and local airport authorities are looking 
for alternatives to federal funding for expansion or construction 
and that a passenger facility charge is one prominent 
alternative 
congress prohibited such fees in 1973 but the administration 
will recommend congress pass legislation abolishing the ban the 
budget said 
a transportation department estimate said that by imposing a fee 
of 3 per passenger nearly 60 major airports would collect more 
than twice what they receive in federal airport formula grants 
toll roads while not a new idea have enjoyed a resurgence in 
popularity as federal highway money becomes more scarce federal 
law has prohibited use of federal money for construction of new 
toll roads but the government allowed several experimental 
projects in 1987 
the administration pointed to northern virginia where the state 
last year gave permission for investors to build a 14mile toll 
road the longest private toll road in the country 
for toll road users transportation costs will be higher but 
travel should be safer and quicker the budget said the 
administration will look favorably upon innovative means of 
financing highways including toll roads 
rae bond spokeswoman for the national governors association 
said that in highlighting state actions the administration did not 
address the governors call for the federal government to release 
some of the more than 16 billion accumulated in the highway trust 
fund 
the governors last summer asked the administration to release 
the money which is accumulating through federal excise taxes and 
the association contends could be used to pay for transportation 
needs in the states 
they appreciate the flexibility to do toll roads if thats 
appropriate and privatesector construction if thats appropriate 
but they have a concern about trying to force states to use toll 
roads or privatesector construction bond said the trust fund 
should be used first 
the budget said some cities have scaled back plans for rail 
rapid transit because of high construction costs and are 
substituting improved bus service 
private bus service has been successful sometimes for a portion 
of the total transit network the budget said adding that federal 
studies show private companies can operate 20 percent to 50 percent 
less expensively than public agencies largely because of lower 
labor costs 
it said carpools and use of buses should be encouraged as 
alternatives to mass transit and cited the approach in the 
virginia suburbs of washington where designated lanes of a primary 
commuter artery and an entire highway during rush hours are 
reserved for buses or carpools 
the budget cited a number of state programs aimed at encouraging 
poor youths to continue with their education including young 
welfare mothers and fathers 
among those it highlighted without endorsing was wisconsins 
controversial learnfare program which cuts welfare benefits if 
the familys children drop out of school 
it cited an oregan plan which will require a federal waiver of 
medicaid rules to expand health coverage to cover all whose 
incomes are below the poverty line 
while including more people oregon would limit cost by assuring 
only a basic package of medical services with additional 
medical services provided only if money is available the 
administration said the plan clearly breaks new ground in seeking 
to deal with a major problem and it is studying the idea

president bush on monday sent congress a 123 
trillion budget for fiscal 1991 that keeps new spending below 
inflation and recognizes remarkable changes in the world by 
scaling back defense and rewarding emerging democracies 
bush called the spending plan an investment in the future 
but democratic leaders in congress pounced on it as a standpat 
budget and challenged its claim to halve the federal deficit to 
631 billion 
fights loomed with the democraticcontrolled congress on a range 
of fronts bushs desire to cut medicare and capital gains taxes 
to close military bases he considers outmoded and on the other 
hand to preserve some expensive weapons 
bush would increase spending on space education the 
environment and the war on drugs losers this year are medicare 
college student loans farm subsidies energy conservation grants 
and mass transit 
the presidents budget for the fiscal year that begins oct 1 
calls for 365 billion in spending cuts and other 
deficitreduction measures 
it projects a 7 percent increase in revenues to 117 trillion 
without a general tax increase and just a 3 percent boost in 
overall spending more than a percentage point below the current 
rate of inflation 
bush proposed defense spending of 2921 billion a cut of 2 
percent measured against inflation while boosting foreign aid to 
eastern europe the philippines and latin america 
on the domestic front his budget would leave in place the 
social security tax increase that took effect earlier this month 
but it honors bushs 1988 campaign pledge to propose no general tax 
increase 
still the budget recommends 156 billion in lesser tax 
increases and a 56 billion increase in user and service fees 
most of them recycled from reagan budgets and previously defeated 
in congress 
the budget calls for family savings accounts under which 
families could bank up to 5000 a year and pay no tax on interest 
on deposits held for seven or more years 
with an eye toward future growth and expansion of the human 
frontier the budgets chief emphasis is on investment in the 
future bush said in a brief message to congress accompanying the 
1569page document 
but sen james sasser dtenn called it a document of low 
aspirations it predicts huge fiscal problems ahead and then 
goes on to propose no change in course 
and house majority leader richard gephardt dmo said i 
think its a standpat budget but he said lawmakers would take 
it very seriously rather than pronouncing it dead on arrival 
as democrats had done with several reagan budgets 
bushs budget direction richard g darman opened the annual 
budget battle by proposing a truce we fully expect to negotiate 
with congress over priorities he told a briefing 
bushs budget asserted it was meeting the 64 billion deficit 
target for fiscal 1991 under the grammrudman budget balancing 
law with specific and defensible measures and without 
gimmicks 
however critics claimed the administrations prescription for 
getting the budget deficit down to 631 billion from a projected 
1238 billion this year does rely on accounting gimmicks 
they continue to jimmy the figures said sen ernest f 
hollings dsc its another fraud 
for one thing bushs budget uses an optimistic set of economic 
projections that assume both declining interest rates and falling 
inflation the budget also calls for overall growth this year of 
24 percent this year compared to the 17 percent forecast by 
private forecasters and the congressional budget office 
the governments most recent figures showed economic growth 
slowed to an annual rate of 05 percent during the last three 
months of 1989 
obviously the slowdown in the fourth quarter makes everybody 
nervous treasury secretary nicholas brady conceded 
bush recycled many proposals which did not reach enactment in 
1989 a tightening of the clean air act a reduction in the 
capital gains tax rate a 3000 tax credit for adoptions tax 
breaks for child care and more money for fighting crime and drugs 
the most dramatic element of the budget was the scaleback in 
defense 
propelled by relaxed eastwest tensions the pentagon budget 
calls for a reduction of 38000 troops and closing dozens of 
military bases it was the most restrained defense budget submitted 
by the white house in more than a decade 
remarkable changes have occurred during the past year the 
berlin wall has been opened and democratic forces are on the move 
in eastern europe bush said as a result savings in the 
defense budget are now possible 
bush said defense and international policy must take advantage 
of the opportunities provided by these changes 
however claiming soviet military capability will remain 
formidable even after announced reductions bush said he was 
proposing a military budget that would allow the nation to hedge 
against an uncertain future 
his plan calls for five costly new b2 stealth bombers another 
1 billion trident submarine and funds for two controversial 
intercontinental nuclear missile systems he also called for an 
additional 900 million for the strategic defense initiative known 
as star wars 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash said defense spending 
will be a crucial battleground and predicted congress would make 
larger reducitons that bush proposed 
the presidents budget calls for a 3 billion increase in 
outlays for foreign aid to 142 billion it calls for 300 
million in special assistance for those countries in eastern 
europe that are moving toward democracy and another 200 million 
for the philippine government of corazon aquino 
it also requests 270 million in outlays for the andean 
countries of colombia peru and bolivia to help stem the 
international flow of drugs 
the administration renewed its call for a lower capital gains 
tax proposing that 30 percent of assets held for more than three 
years be exempt from the tax the measure was similar to a proposal 
that passed the house but was blocked by filibuster in the senate 
last year that would lower the effective rate of the tax on real 
estate stocks and other assets to 196 percent 
currently capital gains are taxed at the same rate as other 
income 15 percent 28 percent or 33 percent 
the administration did not embrace a proposal by sen daniel 
moynihan dny to provide a 62 billion cut in social security 
taxes this year and next however it proposed that after 1993 
when the budget is supposed to be balanced under the grammrudman 
law any surpluses in the social security trust fund be used to 
pay off the national debt 
as in past budgets the social security surplus masked the size 
of the deficit the 1991 deficit would be 70 billion higher 
without this surplus 
the various domestic cuts totalled 139 billion with 55 
billion coming from trims in doctor and hospitals payments in the 
medicare health care program 
other major program cuts included 18 billion in farm price 
supports and crop insurance and savings of 29 billion by limiting 
pension increases to federal civilian retirees and by restraining 
cost of living increases to civilian and military government 
workers aid to urban mass transit systems would be cut sharply and 
lowincome energy assistance would be trimmed by 340 million to 
less than 11 billion

former communists on monday elected a 
35yearold sports official to lead a new party in its quest for 
popularity in the east blocs first democracy 
but one day after its founding the new social democracy of the 
republic of poland was accused of political arrogance by 
solidarity leader lech walesa for taking over the holdings amassed 
by the communists during their rule 
it also contended with a breakaway group of reformers whose 
were organizing a rival socialdemocratic union that would have 
nothing to do with the old partys leadership or assets 
parliamentarians for the communist party which was officially 
disbanded early monday reflected the confusion among the remnants 
of their party 
twenty communist deputies lined up behind the social democracy 
party 25 joined the socialdemocratic union and the remaining 125 
members including caucus leader marian orzechowski withheld 
support from either side state tv reported 
in lopsided votes aleksander kwasniewski became the social 
democracy partys chairman and leszek miller a 43yearold former 
communist party secretary its general secretary 
kwasniewski who has close ties to the former communist 
leadership will lead the new partys supreme council while miller 
will be the administrator overseeing party bureaucracy 
kwasniewski received 1049 votes for chairman and miller 926 
votes for general secretary out of about 1200 votes cast 
the two men immediately were embraced and congratulated by 
mieczyslaw f rakowski the first secretary of the dissolved 
communist party 
we feel very moved by this election and also terrified 
because we are aware of the immense tasks kwasniewski told the 
delegates 
kwasniewski who leads the state sports and youth committee 
said he wanted a party capable of rallying leftist opinions and 
winning popular backing after the demise of the communist party 
tv reported that red flags were removed from party buildings 
nationwide 
the most important thing is votes not members the better 
party is one with 100000 members and capable of getting 1 
million votes than a party with 1 million members and only 100000 
votes he said 
he said the latter case described the old communist party which 
was in disarray after ceding power to a solidarityled government 
in august 
his party in a resolution adopted monday called for further 
strengthening of ties with the emerging democracies in eastern 
europe 
in gdansk walesa criticized the party for taking over the 
communist holdings which he said belong to the whole society 
taking the property would be an act of political arrogance 
walesa said in the conditions of revised political pluralism 
none of the parties can start from a privileged position 
there has been a public clamor for the state to confiscate the 
property acquired by the communists and walesa said he hoped a 
special government commission reviewing the issue would not 
disappoint social expectations 
the breakaway socialdemocratic union formed under reformer 
tadeusz fiszbach a onetime gdansk party chief who is close to 
walesa rejected any remnants of the old party 
fiszbach proclaimed the separate party on sunday and continued 
to sign up followers monday meeting in the same sprawling 
building where the social democracy party was in congress 
in our opinion what the social democracy party congress was 
incapable of doing was saying we are sorry to the society for all 
the abuses of the communist years said marek krol a newspaper 
editor who joined fiszbachs party this is one of the basic 
differences 
fiszbach said his party intends to participate in local 
elections in april 
the old communist party claimed to have 19 million members 
only a portion of which were expected to join either the social 
democracy party or the socialdemocratic union

for 35 years has been moved from house arrest to a prison for 
people accused of murder and other major crimes the chief 
prosecutors office said monday 
a statement carried by the official news agency bta said 
zhivkov ousted as communist party chief nov 10 was being 
questioned 
the 78yearold former leader already has been charged with 
misappropriating state property inciting ethnic hostility and 
abuse of power 
misuse of state property the most serious charge carries a 
maximum penalty of 30 years the ethnic hostility count arose from 
discriminatory policies against the ethnic turkish minority in 
bulgaria 
zhivkov is one of two former eastern european leaders charged 
with crimes 
in east berlin the chief east german prosecutor said erich 
honecker was arrested and imprisoned after leaving a hospital 
monday and will be tried for treason in march honecker 77 had 
been recovering from surgery to remove a malignant kidney tumor 
authorities detained zhivkov on jan 19 and placed him in 
investigative custody news reports said he was kept in a villa 
adapted for the purpose 
mondays statement from the prosecutor did not say when zhivkov 
was moved to the remand prison of the criminal investigation 
department which houses people suspected of or charged with 
serious crimes 
several relatives and close associates of zhivkov also have been 
accused of crimes the prosecutors statement announced indictments 
of his soninlaw ivan slavkov and an investigation of milko 
balev a former zhivkov aide 
slavkov president of the bulgarian olympic committee and a 
member of the international olympic committee was charged with 
illegal posession of a large quantity of firearms receiving 
considerable remunerations on questionable legal grounds and with 
malfeasance in office it said 
balev a former politburo member faces charges of malfeasance 
in office and misappropriation of public property the statement 
said it did not say whether the two were in custody 
negotiations began monday between the communist party and 
opposition 
the foreign debt of about 11 billion and growing economic 
problems were the main items of discussion by party delegates and 
the union of democratic forces a loose alliance of 12 independent 
groups and parties 
union spokesman georgi spassov said sunday the opposition would 
not join any coalition government before elections scheduled for 
may because it does not want to be a scapegoat for past economic 
failures or have reforms blocked by the communistcontrolled 
parliament 
but zhelyu zhelev chairman of the opposition delegation 
appeared to modify this view monday when he said we are no 
demagogues we can change our opinion however leaders of some 
groups within the alliance virtually ruled out any cooperation with 
the communists 
one must not strike compromises with compromised 
personalities said rumen vodenicharov who leads the independent 
committee for human rights 
the communist party convenes a congress tuesday at which 
reformers are expected to try to break with policies associated 
with zhivkovs tenure old guard communists likely will try to slow 
reform moves fearing the collapse of the party and the loss of 
their privileges 
spassov predicted conservatives would force out reformers if 
they tried to go too far 
other opposition leaders were less pessimistic 
the old guard will mount a strong challenge but i do not 
think it will be strong enough to topple the reformers said 
deyan kyuranov a senior member of the ecoglasnost enviromentalist 
organization

citizens of the soviet union especially the jews 
unbounded antisemitic propaganda the strenghtening of 
antisemitic groups murders and the threat of pogrom have become 
the norm of life for soviet jewry they said

the 1991 budget president bush released monday 
relies on spending cuts in defense and domestic programs for at 
least 142 billion in deficit reduction but the precise total 
depends on who is doing the calculations 
by all accounts however the presidents 123 trillion budget 
was relying on spending cuts for less than half the 365 billion 
in savings it sought in its quest to slice the federal deficit to 
631 billion 
the presidents own budget documents claim to reduce spending 
next year on programs ranging from medicare to military pay by a 
total of 169 billion below the rate at which they would otherwise 
grow 
but an analysis by senate budget committee republicans put the 
total at 142 billion the democratic staff of the house budget 
committee decided that all told bush has proposed 161 billion in 
spending reductions 
at any rate those totals are net spending cuts in fact bush 
proposed many billions more in reductions the number was not 
available monday that are offset by spending increases he wants 
in other areas 
its all part of the confusion that results every year the day 
the presidents spending plan is unveiled as budget technicians 
pore through the thick document often not finding the figures they 
hoped to locate 
everyone agreed that the biggest chunk of the savings 55 
billion would come from the medicare program that helps the poor 
and handicapped pay their medical bills 
of the total 335 billion of the cuts would come from 
reimbursements made to hospitals while payments to doctors and for 
other outpatient services would be reduced by 215 billion 
such proposals have had a hard time making it through congress 
in the past 
another 36 billion in savings would be earned by reducing 
various health and retirement benefits for federal employees that 
would include a freeze on annual costofliving increases for 
government civilian and military retirees and a separate proposal 
to have the postal service which is offbudget pay health 
benefits for retirees 
bushs call for a 3033 billion defense budget including some 
nuclear weapons work by the department of energy shrinks the 
military budget by 2 percent below the rate of inflation as the 
budget is calculated this counts for 32 billion in savings 
subsidies to farmers paid by the commodity credit corp would be 
reduced by 15 billion 
other spending cuts the budget lists include nearly 500 million 
by reducing payments for school lunch programs and for meals 
provided by daycare centers 100 million by limiting the 
governments costs of administering its foster care efforts and 
157 million by limiting the ability of distant relatives to 
inherit a deceased veterans benefits 
the balance of bushs proposed savings come from minor tax 
increases new fees for federal services and sales of federal 
assets

washington ap the internal revenue services 61 billion 
budget request for next year would enable the taxcollecting agency 
to start auditing more income tax returns 
the irs expects to audit only 97 of every 10000 tax returns for 
1989 an alltime low 
commissioner fred t goldberg jr told reporters that with 
improvements expected under the fiscal 1991 spending plan that 
president bush sent congress on monday that number should rise to 
102 per 10000 for 1990 returns and 103 per 10000 for 1991 returns 
those figures do not include irs computer checks of the returns 
of the 40 million taxpayers who file returns based principally on 
income from wages interest and dividends goldberg said 
irs computers automatically check those returns to make sure 
they include all income reported by employers banks and brokers 
while those computer checks are not audits goldberg said they are 
very thorough 
the fact remains that there has been a continuing decline in 
audit coverage for a number of years but now we are seeing a 
reversal of the trend he said 
the proposed irs budget increase to 61 billion next year 
represents an 116 percent increase in its current spending of 55 
billion 
goldberg also said the irs expects to spend as much as 6 
billion to replace its obsolete computer system over the next 
decade he said this will give agency employees faster access to 
taxpayer data so that taxpayers can get immediate telephone 
answers to questions about their accounts

a senate bill was introduced monday that would 
require telephone companies to allow customers to block caller 
id a new service that displays a callers phone number before 
the receiver is picked up 
sen herb kohl dwis said he was in favor of the new 
technology but that customers also should have the option of not 
giving out their phone numbers 
a privacy balance must be struck kohl said in introducing 
the telephone privacy act of 1990 
who decides whether the caller will reveal his or her 
number kohl said i think the decision must rest with the 
caller 
caller id which has been available in new jersey for more 
than a year and is just beginning to be offered in tennessee west 
virginia virginia pennsylvania and maryland uses a small 
terminal that displays the numbers of incoming calls the device 
costs 50 or more to purchase and the caller id service costs 
about 7 a month 
privacy rights advocates claim it is an orwellian intrusion on 
individual privacy unless a blocking option is offered phone 
companies such as bell atlantic which is phasing in caller id in 
the midatlantic states but not offering blocking say a blocking 
provision would defeat the purpose of the service 
california has passed legislation requiring blocking be offered 
with caller id and pennsylvania allows police and domestic 
violence agencies to block it some phone companies have said 
privacy concerns have delayed their plans to introduce the service 
kohl sits on the senate judiciary committee which according to 
congressional sources will consider caller id as part of 
hearings on a number of privacy issues this year 
kohl said he planned to sign up for the service whenever it is 
offered in his home district of milwaukee or in washington 
but there is a down side he said caller id will 
diminish our privacy as callers 
people with unlisted phone numbers are forced to divulge their 
numbers every time they contact someone who has caller id he 
said noting that a woman in a battered womens shelter may not 
want to reveal her number while calling her family 
under kohls bill calls to 911 emergency lines would not be 
blocked his bill does not specify however whether blocking 
should be offered on a percall or a subscription basis or whether 
it should be free 
david barasch consumer advocate of pennsylvania said he 
supported kohls bill and endorsed it on behalf of the national 
association of state utility consumer advocates kohls office said 
president bushs special adviser for consumer affairs bonnie 
guiton also backed the idea of blocking she said in a statement

the battle between congress and the bush 
administration over how to divvy up the peace dividend could 
make the cold war look like a sunday school picnic 
the sniping began in earnest monday with delivery of president 
bushs 1991 budget request to congress and will likely continue for 
several years as us policy makers try to adjust to a new world 
symbolized by the crumbling of the berlin wall 
the central questions revolve around the magnitude of defense 
savings made possible from lessened eastwest tensions and which 
programs will receive additional funds as a result 
at present there is nothing approaching a consensus on the 
answers to either of those questions 
the apectations about the peace dividend in the 
first place 
defense secretary richard cheney announced last november that he 
was searching for pentagon cuts totaling 180 billion over the next 
six years however cheney was calculating his savings against an 
administration plan projecting a buildup in defense forces that 
congress had already rejected 
thus the actual savings will be far less 
no one disputes that there will savings but the scale of the 
windfall will be much more modest especially in the next few years 
in 1991 for example the administrations new budget puts the 
peace dividend at 32 billion that figure is arrived at by 
comparing what the administration is seeking in total military 
outlays 3033 billion compared to the 3064 billion that would 
be required to let the pentagon keep pace with inflation 
the 32 billion figure left democrats definitely unimpressed 
with many accusing darman of playing his own political game by 
proposing steep cuts in military personnel coupled with a whole 
new round of base closings while protecting the administrations 
pet multibilliondollar weapons programs 
democratic leaders left no doubt that they would be looking for 
deeper cuts in some of the weapons programs favored by bush 
there will be a debate about defense no question about 
that said house speaker thomas foley dwash 
but after all the arguing over how much money can be wrung out 
of the pentagon a new battle will commence over where the extra 
funds should be spent 
a whole array of advocates for domestic programs have begun 
lining up seeking extra money for everything from cleaning up the 
environment to taking care of the disadvantaged and rebuilding 
americas crumbling road and bridge system 
social advocates sense a golden opportunity after having to 
endure a long dry spell of austere budgets in the reagan era of 
large pentagon buildups 
takes together the proposals for increased domestic spending 
exceed 200 billion a year far dwarfing any windfall from defense 
but there is another worry with everyone looking for the 
newfound pot of gold what will that do to the discipline needed to 
reach a consensus for cutting the federal budget deficit 
we have to keep reminding people that even if we get new money 
from a peace dividend we still have a budget deficit which 
means we still have to find places to cut spending said sen 
pete domenici rnm and senior republican on the senate budget 
committee

a kidnapped 12yearold boy whose finger was cut 
off to persuade his drugdealing brother to pay ransom was found 
dead in a pile of plastic bags just days after the brother was 
killed police said monday 
a man collecting cans on a bike path sunday discovered the body 
of william porter who was abducted dec 5 as he walked to school 
the boys 25yearold brother richard thomas porter had 
refused to cooperate with the police investigation of the 
kidnapping detectives speculated he may have been negotiating his 
brothers release before he turned up fatally shot jan 4 not far 
from where william was found in the new york borough of the bronx 
a police spokesman lt raymond odonnell said williams body 
was identified monday by family members an autopsy report on the 
cause of death was not complete ellen borakove a spokeswoman for 
the city medical examiner said monday 
detectives believe the boy was kidnapped for up to 500000 in 
ransom from richard porter reputed by police to be a midlevel 
drug distributor who controlled several street dealers in harlem 
a police source who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
williams right index finger was severed and left dec 6 with a 
short taped message from him in the bathroom of a manhattan 
restaurant 
they cutted my finger off the sixthgrader cried on the 
tape the daily news said in jan 5 editions please help i 
love you mommy 
richard porter was found shot in the head and chest his wallet 
with more than 2000 in it was found on his body at the time his 
slaying police refused to comment on the kidnapping because the 
12yearold had not been found

calls notes and the taped message from william all on dec 5 and 
6 
the kidnappers had told richard porter in a telephone call to go 
to the restaurant bathroom but he sent another family member 
instead 
the last contact with the kidnappers came dec 10 when a woman 
handed a note to a child in manhattan and told him to deliver it to 
williams aunt who lived in the area 
the note said the boy was in pain and needed medical attention

a 7yearold boy identified photographs of 
a man and the mans bicycle as those of the person who raped and 
sexually mutilated him and left him for dead a prosecutor said 
monday in his opening statement 
his eyes got very wide he was sure pierce county deputy 
prosecutor james roche said of the boys identification of earl 
kenneth shriner he was sure that was the man who had attacked 
him 
shriner 40 who has a history of sexual attacks is charged 
with firstdegree attempted murder firstdegree assault and two 
counts of firstdegree rape 
the savageness of this case in which the boys penis was cut 
off has sparked major proposals in the current legislature for 
dealing with predatory sex offenders proposals range from civil 
commitment to castration 
immediately after the attack the boy was incoherent and afraid 
hed done something bad roche told the jury 
but the child who has turned 8 since the may 20 attack 
recovered and identified his attacker he is scheduled to testify 
the jury was selected last week in bellingham 120 miles north 
of tacoma because of extensive pretrial news coverage jurors are 
being sequestered in tacoma during the trial 
roche said testimony from the boy as well as microscopic 
analysis of hair and blood recovered from shriners clothing and 
other personal effects would tie shriner to the crime 
but dino sepe one of shriners defense lawyers said shriner 
is the wrong man and the evidence is going to show that man is 
the wrong man 
immediately after the attack the boy pretty much rambled 
incoherently at one point he said ive been bad the 
prosecutor said 
but by the next day the boy was able to identify shriner from a 
photo montage that included the pictures of five other men roche 
said the boy also identified a picture of the bicycle shriner 
allegedly used to lure him into woods near the childs home 
blood taken from shriners jacket matched the boys blood type 
and 15 hairs found on a yellow braided cord recovered from the 
pocket of shriners jacket also match roche said 
seven of those 15 hairs showed root damage as if they had been 
pulled out of the head said the prosecutor 
sepe cautioned jurors that they had to find evidence for every 
element of every crime beyond a reasonable doubt to convict 
shriner 
shriner willingly let police in his house when they arrived at 
his door on the morning of may 21 sepe said 
he told them he had nothing to hide he knew he had nothing to 
hide he fully cooperated with the officers sepe said he told 
them he had no contact with any children that night 
sepe said the blood and hair samples were not conclusive 
theres millions of people with that similar type of blood 
he said

president bushs budget promises to save your 
family 114000 in taxes over the next 25 years if you can set 
aside 5000 a year it makes enticing promises too if you love 
trees have a houseful of tots or are fascinated by magnetic 
levitation 
but in budgetry an exercise somewhat removed from reality the 
budget that giveth also taketh away 
the taking would come from people who ride amtrak or the 
airlines go boating on weekends or work for the federal government 
dont bank on the 114000 windfall or get rid of your boat by 
august when congress usually focuses on budgets januarys 
proposals have a habit of changing or vanishing altogether 
bushs proposal to require a 25 decal on any recreational or 
commercial boat using waterways patrolled by the coast guard 
revived an idea originally floated by president reagan congress 
balked and the idea sank 
so too did reagans proposal to drop the federal subsidy 
received by the amtrak rail passenger system reagan said it would 
be cheaper to hand an airline or bus ticket to every amtrak 
passenger than to pay a subsidy averaging 30 for every amtrak 
rider 
bushs fiscal 1991 budget plan drops that argument but retains 
the proposal his budget director richard darman told reporters 
monday that the federal governments responsibility is not to run 
the railroads 
magnetic levitation is something else again the budget document 
describes it as a new transportation technology that relies on 
the use of magnets for propulsion and levitation rather than 
conventional steelwheelonrail technology bush proposed 
spending 97 million to check it out 
in the meantime bush proposed eliminating subsidies to keep 
bigcity mass transit systems operating darman said thats a local 
responsibility 
air passengers would pay more a boost in the 8 percent ticket 
tax to 10 percent but would get more for airport construction 
and hiring 495 more air traffic controllers to help the 17000 now 
scanning the skies 
the 3 tax on international flights would double 
heres how that 114000 windfall would work for families able 
to save 
families with incomes under 120000 would be able to open two 
savings accounts in which husband and wife would deposit a total of 
5000 if the accounts were left untouched for more than seven 
years the interest earned would escape taxation early withdrawal 
in less than three years would carry a 10 percent penalty on top 
of the regular tax on interest 
treasury secretary nicholas brady figures that in 25 years a 
family would save 395000 of which 114000 would otherwise have 
been paid in taxes he assumed the family pays income tax at a 28 
percent rate and can find a bank paying 8 percent interest 
poor families would get a tax credit of 1000 subtracted from 
taxes owed for every youngster under age 4 and parents who adopt 
children with special needs could deduct 3000 to start those 
tots on the road to school bush proposed making room for 180000 
more head start youngsters in a program that now enrolls 450000 
needy preschoolers 
for investors who hold onto their stocks for three years or 
more 30 percent of the profits when they finally sell the stocks 
would be taxexempt thats more generous than the capital gains 
tax proposal that with bushs backing passed the house but 
stalled in the senate last year 
federal workers would be among the losers in the budgetary game 
of winners and losers bushs budget proposes a threemonth delay 
in a federal pay raise that is scheduled to take effect oct 31 
and the 30 percent of state and local government workers who are 
exempt from social security taxes and benefits would lose that 
status 
what the president proposed for trees was to plant more of them 
one billion a year through a 175 million reforestation program 
plus another 30 million through a community plant a tree 
initiative 
his budget message said growing more trees across america would 
fight the threat of climatic warming known as the greenhouse 
effect an acre of trees removes up to 9 million tons of carbon 
dioxide from the air but the country is losing 700000 acres of 
trees annually it said 
finally grim prospects for tax sharpies the budget proposes 
more money for enforcement of the tax laws specifically for 
collecting delinquent taxes checking out fake dependent claims 
auditing mortgage interest deductions and matching what the 
taxpayer says he received in interest against what interest payers 
say they paid 
those steps said the budget should close the gap between 
taxes owed and taxes paid

many azerbaijanis heeded their leaders call to 
put our grief aside and return to work in their capital monday 
but the defense minister said soviet troops could not be withdrawn 
yet from the caucasus 
the situation is not the best defense minister dmitri t 
yazov told the government daily izvestia about the ethnic turmoil 
in the southern soviet union 
he cited attempts by extremists to keep workers from their jobs 
in baku the azerbaijani capital on the caspian sea weapons still 
held by those insurgents and their attacks on government buildings 
yazov did not provide details 
asked by izvestia when soviet troops who stormed the oil center 
of baku more than a week ago would be pulled out yazov responded 
troops will remain until the required order is restored 
azerbaijans top politicians and political activists have been 
demanding for days that the troops be withdrawn saying they are 
not needed to keep order and are infringing on the republics 
sovereignty 
the official news agency tass said most of bakus businesses 
resumed work monday and mass transit was operating on most routes 
baku radio broadcast an appeal by the republics communist party 
and government leaders for citizens to return to work 
we have to put our grief aside for the sake of all those who 
continue to live and for the sake of the welfare of the children 
the women the elderly and each and every family said the 
appeal monitored by the bbc in london 
we call on you to report to work to give a new life to each 
and every house town district and city it said 
tass said leaflets circulated in the city urged the strikes to 
continue and izvestia reported that extremists went to apartments 
and threatened to attack people if they went to work 
soviet media reported more arrests of nationalist leaders in 
azerbaijans capital 
the extremist strongholds with stocks of food and ammunition 
are being detected radio moscow said monday 
a moscow spokesman for the azerbaijani peoples front a group 
that has organized antiarmenian protests reported that as of 
monday more than 200 members had been arrested in baku 
one of those arrested blamed militant peoples front leaders for 
the bloodshed saying they had ignored official warnings to halt 
attempts to seize power and prevent soviet troops from entering 
baku heibulla balash agayev made the remarks on azerbaijani 
television sunday and tass reported them monday 
yazov has said troops moved into baku to destroy the peoples 
front and other smaller groups that were about to seize power 
soviet tv showed empty seats in baku classrooms and said many 
students and teachers were staying away from school because they 
feared attack 
in another development the mainly christian armenians and 
predominantly moslem azerbaijanis on sunday began pulling back from 
the border between armenia and nakhichevan an azerbaijani 
territory bounded by armenia iran and turkey tass said there were 
no new ethnic clashes in nakhichevan 
the withdrawals went without incident sunday according to yusif 
samedugli a leader of the nationalist azerbaijani peoples front 
and armenian activist rafael popoyan 
last week activists agreed to a truce at that border one of 
the most bitterly contested areas 
armenians are demanding control of nagornokarabakh an enclave 
of azerbaijan populated largely by armenians the two soviet 
republics have feuded intermittently over nagornokarabakh for two 
years 
the conflict exploded into antiarmenian riots on jan 13 in 
baku and led to battles between armenians and azerbaijanis in the 
countryside soviet troops stormed baku on jan 20 
at least 197 people have been killed in the neighboring 
republics since jan 13 by official count with 125 of the deaths 
following the arrival of soviet troops 
signs in baku blame president mikhail s gorbachev for the 
deaths labeling him a killer with blood on his hands the british 
television company itn reported from baku 
peace talks between representatives of the armenian national 
movement and the azerbaijani peoples front are scheduled for 
thursday in riga latvia 
both sides say they will discuss troop withdrawals refugees and 
other humanitarian concerns some reports said the territorial 
dispute will not be on the agenda 
the goal is to stop senseless bloodletting said dainis 
ivans a latvian peoples front leader and one of three mediators 
the baltic nationalist movements initiative to sponsor the 
talks between armenians and azerbaijanis reflected how much clout 
the burgeoning movements have gained in the past year and their 
concern over kremlin intervention 
another latvian peoples front mediator romas razukas said the 
baltic groups have experience in achieving change peacefully and 
this could be a lesson to armenians and azerbaijanis 
we would like to persuade them of the value of diplomacy and 
the use of parliamentary means to resolve disputes we want them to 
understand how much we have achieved through those means razukas 
said 
tass reported monday that three leaders of the azerbaijan 
peoples front the most powerful nationalist group in the 
republic had been detained by the kgb the news agency also said 
about 10000 leaflets calling for civil disobedience were seized at

president bush asked congress on monday for 
300 million in fiscal 1991 to reward emerging democracies in 
eastern europe and proposed major aid increases to andean countries 
to help stem drug production 
but the presidents overall 182 billion foreign affairs budget 
for the fiscal year that begins oct 1 was largely devoid of 
details including specific requests for most us aid recipients 
around the world and a description of exactly what bush wants to do 
in eastern europe 
also missing from the budget is any mention of panama 
the administration will seek a special appropriation this year 
to send about 500 million in cash and a like amount in noncash 
benefits to help the panamanian economy recover from us sanctions 
and invasion 
however the administration apparently has not decided what it 
wants to do for panama in fiscal 1991 
the 300 million for countries behind the crumbling iron curtain 
was billed as a special assistance initiative but appeared to 
some to be primarily the second installment of a threeyear aid 
package congress approved last year for poland and hungary 
a senate budget committee analysis called the proposal a cut 
from last year 
i dont see much for eastern europe to be frank said house 
budget committee chairman leon panetta dcalif 
senate foreign relations committee chairman claiborne pell 
dri was poised to introduce his own package of aid to the 
eastern european countries tuesday including easing trade 
restrictions and some direct aid 
it appeared likely that last years criticisms of bush as too 
timid toward eastern europe were likely to be replayed 
the budget document promised that legislation will be sent to 
capitol hill spelling out more clearly how the money would be used 
to encourage freemarket economic reform and development of 
democracy 
secretary of state james a baker iii who is still struggling 
with aid allocations for the current year is likely to be 
questioned about the administrations intentions when he testifies 
thursday before the senate foreign relations committee 
acknowledging that the bipolar superpower era is over the 
budget puts a new emphasis on international organizations that 
contrasts with the skepticism showed such groups by bushs 
predecessor ronald reagan 
bushs budget promises to pay off pastdue debts to the united 
nations and multilateral development banks left by reagan 620 
million in back dues to the un plus 794 million for the 
regularly scheduled payment and 279 million to clear a backlog 
for the banks 
a nearly 80 percent boost is proposed in aid for the war on 
drugs including 175 million in what the budget terms new aid 
for the economies of those countries that evidence a 
determination to attack seriously the narcotics problem 
under pressure from capitol hill the administration apparently 
is seeking some of that aid to help coca farmers switch to other 
crops coca is used to produce cocaine 
in addition law enforcement aid of 20 million is sought for 
colombia where a crackdown on cocaine cartels has brought violent 
retaliation 19 million for peru the worlds largest coca leaf 
producer and 157 million for bolivia 
the estimated outlays for all international affairs categories 
foreign aid maintaining embassies and running the state department 
would be 182 billion in 1991 an effective increase of nearly 
12 percent 
the 1990 figure is estimated at 146 billion but has been 
artificially reduced by onetime income of 17 billion from early 
repayment of past military aid loans 
the budget proposal would continue the two largest recipients of 
us military and economic aid at their current levels 3 billion 
for israel and 21 billion for egypt 
it asks as well for 200 million to pay the second installment 
of a fiveyear 1 billion pledge to an international aid effort 
for the philippines in addition 21 billion is requested to make 
payments to nato countries and the philippines in return for rights 
to maintain us military bases on their soil 
there also is a request for a longterm appropriation of 270 
million to rebuild the new us embassy in moscow which was 
penetrated by soviet listening devices of that amount only about 
10 million is estimated to be spent in 1991

more than 20000 demonstrators chanting 
were fed up rallied in front of the parliament monday to 
demand pay raises and to protest price hikes in foodstuffs and 
public transport 
we do not want to use our final weapon the general strike 
but we are not ruling it out either said sandor nagy general 
secretary of the official central trade union federation which 
helped organize the protest 
about 4000 demonstrators later marched to the television 
headquarters to demand their views be broadcast the official mti 
news agency reported 
the demonstration followed a series of price increases earlier 
this month part of a government plan to cut the budget deficit and 
let the market set prices meat prices rose 32 percent dairy 
products 42 percent bread 20 percent and cigarettes and liquor 
more than 20 percent 
on thursday public transport fares will go up 55 percent 
the austerity program is designed to prove to the international 
monetary fund that the government is serious about cutting 
subsidies a condition for receiving western credits 
the official unions said the program will push almost a third of 
hungarys 106 million people below the proverty line set at 83 a 
month 
protesters carried banners with the slogans european wages for 
european prices and we always sacrifice but to what result 
one protester amalia kis living on 56 a month said she 
bought no fuel during the winter and spent her days in the public 
library because they have heat there 
the demonstration was called by the iron workers union and 
endorsed by the national council of trade unions to press for an 
increase in the minimum montly wage to 85 and an 8 wage increase 
premier miklos nemeth has rejected higher wages without 
corresponding increases in productivity 
members of the league of independent trade unions did not attend 
the rally and a spokesman said workers should talk with company 
managers instead of the government which will turn over power 
following elections in march 
we understand the peoples anger it is fully justified but 
this demonstration is unnecessary and harmful said csaba oery 
the leagues spokesman

a 15 billion cut in commodity programs the cuts which were not 
detailed would likely mean that farmers would get lower guarantee 
prices and reduced direct payments for major crops such as wheat 
feed grains and cotton 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter called the proposed budget 
austere but by no means dracronian the bush 
administration projects inflation this fiscal year at 41 percent 
if congress does not go along with the commodity cutback the 
usda budget could balloon by 42 percent next fiscal year from 
482 billion to 502 billion 
details of the proposed 15 billion in commodity program cuts 
were left to negotiations between the bush administraton and 
congress initial democratic response was not enthusiastic 
nutrition programs would account for 23 billion of the usda 
budget with about 154 billion going for the food stamp program 
that is up about 600 million from this year mostly because of 
higher food costs and upward adjustments in monthly allocation to 
needy families 
state child nutrition programs at 48 billion would be down 
about 150 million from this year but would allow for an increase 
in school lunch subsidies for middlepoverty children who now pay a 
reduced rate for meals children from the lowestincome categories 
get meals free 
under the proposal the reducedrate meals would cost a child 20 
cents instead of the current 40 cents 
the women infants and children wic program would account for 
22 billion up from 21 billion this year and a reflection of 
rising participation 
the bush budget for the year beginning oct 1 calls for scaling 
back the federal crop insurance corp which provides subsidies to 
farmers who carry allrisk protection for crop loss the agencys 
budget 12 million this fiscal year would fall to 430000 
in place of the crop insurance program a new disaster 
assistance program would be worked out with congress 
net outlays for usda commodity programs a wide range of 
subsidies for crops dairy products honey and wool were 
projected at more than 102 billion in 1991 
but that assumes congress will approve the 15 billion in cuts 
if lawmakers reject the plan commodity subsidies would rise to 
about 117 billion in 1991 from 84 billion this year 
that would still be far less than the record level of 258 
billion in 1986 the subsidy programs provided by the departments 
commodity credit corp dropped to 224 billion in 1987 and to 
125 billion in 1988 
rep kika de la garza dtexas chairman of the house 
agriculture committee said in a statement that efforts to 
balance the federal budget cannot be allowed to destroy one of our 
greatest accomplishments which is to provide safety net levels 
of support for farmers 
sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the senate agriculture 
committee said the administrations budget suggests they will 
continue to cut target prices and price support loan rates until 
the farm programs are effectively abolished 
under the system the ccc payments mostly run a year behind the 
events meaning that the 1991 budget proposed by bush will be for 
crops grown in 1990 and so on 
the sharp drops in net outlays the last two years reflect the 
1988 and 1989 droughts which reduced production and drove up 
commodity prices that meant less need for payments to farmers 
thus reducing ccc outlays 
with farmers planting larger acreages this year and a probable 
continuation of normal yields for the major field crops total 
spending on commidity programs is expected to jump in 1991 
the budget also proposes a sharp reduction in farmers home 
administration spending to about 58 billion in 1991 from 71 
billion this year 
most of the fmha savings would be in farm loan programs rural 
housing and the elimination of business and industrial programs 
to help improve local communities the budget calls for a further 
shift from direct loans by the agency to guarantees for private 
lenders

regional treaty that also calls for phased withdrawal of cuban 
troops from angola namibias northern neighbor more than 6000 
un military and civilian personnel have been supervising the 
transition process since last april 
the constituent assembly also has been debating a democratic 
westernstyle constitution and is to begin voting on the document 
tuesday articlebyarticle 
no major disagreements are expected because all leading parties 
represented in the assembly say they support the proposed 
constitution 
the draft constitution contains a declaration of fundamental 
rights including freedom of movement freedom of speech and 
freedom of the press it foresees a multiparty democracy regular 
elections an independent judiciary and an executive president 
limited to two fiveyear terms

had fought a bush war for independence from south africa since 
1966 won 41 seats in the assembly and will form the first 
government swapo leader sam nujoma is expected to become namibias

force and the southwest african police fought swapo in the 
northern part of the territory in a war that killed 20000 people 
mostly guerrillas over 23 years the last fighting in the country 
of about 15 million occurred in april 1989 at the outset of the 
unsupervised independence process that resulted in elections in

authorities said monday theyll seek a pardon for 
a man who has spent almost eight years in prison for robbery 
because of new evidence supporting the mans alibi 
michael anthony woten 36 was found guilty of robbing a grocery 
store of 5200 on april 16 1982 he was arrested may 7 1982 
convicted of aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon and sentenced 
to 55 years in prison 
during his trial woten testified that he was hitchhiking to st 
louis on the day of the robbery but woten could only identify the 
truck driver who picked him up with his citizens band radio handle 
of kangaroo said deputy police chief ray hawkins 
we had what we thought then was a pretty strong case said 
hawkins five witnesses were pointing the finger at woten 
the dallas times herald recently tracked down the truck driver 
through an ad in a truckers publication former trucker don 
kangaroo fainter told the newspaper he remembered picking up 
woten in oklahoma city and confirmed much of wotens alibi that he 
was hitchhiking on the day of the robbery 
evidence of the trip was found in the centerville ky office 
where fainters former employer stored company records 
dallas county district attorney john vance said prosecutors are 
awaiting written information from the police before proceeding with 
a pardon request 
we are just waiting for the police to physically give it to us 
so that we will be knowledgeable enough to ask the governor and 
board of pardons and paroles to pardon him vance said 
hawkins said woten had written several news agencies claiming 
his innocence after which the times herald interviewed him and 
brought police a written outline of what woten said had occurred 
we investigated it and were able to find some written 
documentation that substantiated what he had to say hawkins 
said while there is a modicum of evidence that he still might be 
guilty there is now a reasonable doubt and that is all that is 
required to turn him loose 
woten had enclosed an affidavit from a fellow inmate which said 
the inmate committed the robbery authorities have not said what 
if any action will be taken against the inmate 
is this for sure woten told the times herald when informed 
he might be freed in all honesty this has happened so fast you 
know theyre not going to change their minds are they 
it could not be determined monday when woten would have been 
eligible for parole calls by the associated press to various state 
officials were not returned 
the woten case is latest in a string of dubious convictions in 
dallas county the most publicized was that of randall dale adams 
subject of the film the thin blue line who was freed last year 
after spending 13 years in prison after he was convicted of killing 
a dallas police officer

the bush administrations proposed 1991 budget 
requests more spending on the healthcare needs of the nations 27 
million veterans but would require down payments on on its home 
loans for the first time 
the proposed budget also asks for congress to approve 
legislation ending the mobile home loan program the veterans 
department cited high foreclosure losses particularly among active 
duty military personnel as the reason for ending that vietnamera 
program 
in another area the administration proposes nominal fees for 
middleincome veterans who seek treatment for nonservice connected 
disabilities at va facilities none of the individual fees for such 
services as prescriptions and outpatient visits would exceed 10 a 
day the measure is supposed to bring in 112 million 
the proposed 301 billion budget for the department calls for 
spending of 124 billion for health care compared with the 108 
billion sought last year by the administration after an increase 
by congress and a slight cut to meet grammrudman targets spending 
this year is estimated at 114 billion 
the total budget request would exceed current spending by 14 
billion 
this is the first va budget proposal since the va achieved 
cabinet status secretary edward j derwinski attributed the 
increased funds to his agencys greater public visibility 
i think the president understood early on that they cant 
shortchange us derwinski said 
sen alan cranston dcalif chairman of the senate veterans 
affairs committee praised derwinski a former republican 
congressman from illinois saying the health care budget is the 
best va medical care budget request by a president in more than a 
decade 
secretary derwinski took his case directly to president bush 
and did a tremendous job in convincing im that the downward spiral 
in va health care must be halted he said 
this is a fair and realistic budget coming from the white 
house and one of the best weve seen in years for veterans said 
rep gv sonny montgomery dmiss chairman of the house 
veterans affairs committee 
lawmakers and veterans groups have complained that vas ability 
to care for an increasingly aging veterans population was eroded by 
the reagan administration 
the va does substantial work with aids victims and those 
suffering from drug abuse and cares for a growing number of 
elderly patients the budget shifts more funds in those directions 
the budget gives more than 500 million in pay increases to the 
current staff and adds 100 million to hire more than 2300 people 
including 800 nursing positions the hirings would bring the total 
staff to close to the 194720 mandated by congress 
the house and senate are currently working on legislation to 
increase nurses pay and both veterans committees in both houses 
have promised legislation this year to raise salaries and benefits 
for doctors and dentists 
amvets disabled american veterans paralyzed veterans of 
america and veterans of foreign wars say 134 billion is needed 
just to return basic services to the level available in 1988 
the bush proposal also proposes a 4 percent down payment for va 
loans and an increase to 175 percent in the in the fee borrowers 
must pay to a va mortgage insurance fund 
down payments have never been required by the government in the 
history of the program and the insurance fee had already increased 
from 1 percent to 125 percent in january 
raymond h avent the acting chief benefits director defended 
the proposal saying the impact would be minimal and is necessary 
to save the program from huge loan losses 
he said that since the first 25000 of a loan would be exempt 
from the fee and the usual home costs 80000 the home loan would 
require only a 2200 to 2300 down payment 
the potential is much greater that the borrower will not 
walk away from a mortgage with that much money invested in it 
avent said 
veterans organizations complain that va is constantly blaming 
veterans for problems in the loan system instead of its own 
mismanagement of the program 
cranston called the down payment feature the most 
objectionable feature of the budget proposal 
congress created the program in 1944 precisely to allow 
hundreds of thousands of veterans to purchase homes even though 
they could not come up with a downpayment he said the same 
need is here today

president bush asked congress on monday to 
increase nasas 1991 budget by 175 percent including money for a 
start on his plan to send astronauts back to the moon and later 
to mars 
nasa would be authorized to spend 141 billion in the fiscal 
year beginning oct 1 an increase of 21 billion over this fiscal 
year 
the space agencys spending authority different from the 
oneyear budget in that authority includes money for projects that 
wouldnt be completed and paid off until later years would rise 
by 24 percent from 123 billion to 151 billion 
bush also was generous to other fields of scientific research 
adding 895 million for basic nondefense research for a total of 
109 billion and a 21 billion increase for applied research and 
development for a total of 144 billion 
among the areas proposed for a boost was the national science 
foundation 22 billion a 13 percent increase aids research 
increasing by 749 million to 32 billion and the superconducting 
super collider budgeted for 293 million a 56 percent increase 
bush also asked for a 20 percent rise in financing science and 
engineering education proposing to bring federal investment in 
that area to 871 million 
the presidents request to congress demonstrates the 
administrations continued strong support for nasa and the civil 
space station nasa administrator richard h truly told a news 
conference 
it reflects the presidents belief that investment in space 
yields substantial benefits vastly expanding scientific 
knowledge developing valuable new technology and especially 
important lifting the dreams imagination and spirit of our 
nation 
a major beneficiary would be the manned space station which the 
united states hopes to have in orbit late in the decade authority 
for the station would increase from 17 billion to 24 billion as 
the project moves from design to the fabrication stage the first 
construction flight is scheduled for the spring of 1995 
if approved by congress the space budget would pay for starting 
the socalled mission to planet earth an ambitious program to 
study the earths environment using satellites and instruments 
the budget request includes 661 million in spending authority 
to study the earth including money to start two polarorbiting 
platforms the first of which would be launched in 1998 it also 
would initiate the development of earth probes a series of smaller 
instruments focused on specific highpriority data needs 
including ozone depletion the first would be launched in 1994 
the budget proposes a total of 33 billion for space science 
and 101 million for programs to promote the commercial use of 
space space science includes such major flight projects as the 
galileo mission to jupiter and the magellan mission to venus both 
underway plus the hubble space telescope set for an april launch 
proposed funds directly relatable to exploration are a little 
bit less than 1 billion truly said when exploration 
expenditures included in the budgets of the defense department and 
other agencies are added in he said the amount will be more than 
13 billion 
last july on the 20th anniversary of mans first landing on the 
moon the president set a goal of having the united states return 
to the moon and then to begin manned exploration of mars early in 
the next century 
the budget request reflects the first steps toward that goal in 
a 179 million authority item for exploration technology which 
includes 45 million for lunar and mars science and 11 million 
for nuclear propulsion studies 
bushs proposal also envisions development of two new robotic 
missions the lunar observer and lifesat the latter would be a 
series of reuseable satellites designed to carry living speciments 
into orbit and be returned to earth for analysis of the effects of 
longterm exposure 
the national aerospace plane a joint nasa and air force 
project would receive a total 277 million in spending authority 
an additional 129 million in joint funds is proposed for develping 
a new family of launch vehicles 
nasa had planned a record 10 flights in calendar 1990 but had to 
postpone one because of delays in flying the recent satellite 
retrieval mission and a delay in the anticipated spring launch of 
the hubble space telescope the budget calls for 10 flights in each 
of the next two fiscal years leading up to a planned flight rate 
of 12 a year 
the budget would also enable nasa to increase employment from 
23735 to 24466 
with more than 85 percent of nasas appropriation going to the 
private sector we simply must have the inhouse expertise to 
manage contract performance truly said

president bush on monday proposed a nearly 1 
billion increase in spending authority to modernize decrepit us 
nuclear weapons plants and clean up their environmental messes 
bushs proposed budget for the fiscal year beginning oct 1 
includes 995 billion for nuclear weapons development and 
production as well as environmental cleanup at the 17 major 
weapons facilities owned by the energy department 
that compares with slightly more than 9 billion currently 
allocated to the energy department for those purposes 
all the figures are for budget authority which represents 
ceilings on actual outlays to be determined separately the 
department used budget authority figures for the plant 
modernization project because funds are spent over several years 
under longterm contracts 
about twothirds of the proposed 1 billion increase is for 
energy secretary james d watkins new plan to clean up radioactive 
contamination and toxic wastes at the weapons plants and bring the 
facilities into compliance with environmental laws 
bush called for 275 billion in spending authority for cleanup 
and waste management for fiscal 1991 an increase of about 600 
million over current levels estimates of the total cleanup costs 
range from 65 billion to 100 billion in spending over 30 years 
watkins said most of the rest of the increase would go toward 
making nuclear weapons plants safer and more modern 
bush also proposed a 20 percent boost in spending on development 
of two new nuclear reactors to produce tritium a critical 
ingredient in nuclear warheads the new reactors would replace 
damaged facilities at the savannah river site near aiken sc 
watkins said its possible that only one new reactor would 
suffice but he stressed his view that no such cutback should be 
made until more is known about how reforms under way in the soviet 
union will affect western security interests 
watkins also confirmed that he decided to halt plans for 
building a hightechnology plutonium refinery in idaho the 12 
billion project known as the special isotope separation plant 
will be phased out starting april 1 he said 
the energy secretary said the department had determined that the 
idaho refinery was not needed to meet plutonium requirements for 
weapons production but that overall spending on the weapons 
complex must increase to meet defense needs 
until arms control is a fait accompli we have to demonstrate 
that we have the will to keep our strategic stockpile adequate 
watkins told a news conference 
he said a viable weapons production complex was as important as 
the warheads themselves in deterring a soviet attack 
watkins said the government had failed for years to invest 
adequately in nuclear weapons plants thus leaving them vulnerable 
to breakdowns and unsafe operation many key facilities are closed 
for safety and management improvements 
were trying to put the investment back in here to ensure that 
this doesnt become the achilles heel at the arms control 
bargaining table for the united states he said 
watkins also announced that a facility at the hanford nuclear 
reservation near richland wash that had been designed to 
provide plutonium for the space program would be shut down over 
four years beginning this year he said the department decided it 
would be cheaper for the savannah river plant to provide the 
plutonium

things faith not the least of them he said that as 
prodemocracy demonstrations spread across europe the day of the 
dictator did end 
the president praised the role of religious figures in 
democratic revolutions and singled out a romanian orthodox priest 
gheorghe calciu who spent 21 of his 64 years in jail and was

return to your native land

news reports monday indicated 
the release of nelson mandela may be delayed because of unrest and 
an aide said the black leader will resume his political struggle 
even if it means going back to jail 
the government is considering delaying mandelas release until 
march because of renewed unrest including protests against a 
touring english cricket team that has defied a ban on sports 
contacts with south africa according to several newspapers 
on monday police fired tear gas at a roman catholic church to 
break up about 1000 people who gathered to plan a protest rally 
against the cricket team 
organizer paul ntuli said dozens of people suffered minor 
injuries at the pax nova church near the central city of 
bloemfontein police confirmed the incident but declined to give 
any details 
in downtown johannesburg police used batons and tear gas to 
disperse more than 1000 black railway workers following a union 
meeting no injuries or arrests were reported 
government leaders were concerned that releasing mandela and 
other pending reforms would inflame unrest and officials want to 
slow down reforms to ensure they retain control of developments 
said reports citing unidentified sources 
the star reported monday that no decision had been made on when 
to release mandela and the decision would be left to president fw 
de klerk 
de klerk had not set a date for release because he did not want 
to meet demands that the government also legalize the african 
national congress the main black group fighting the whiteled 
government the paper said 
mandela 71 has been imprisoned since 1962 and is serving a 
life term for helping plan the start of the ancs antigovernment 
sabotage campaign 
the south african media has been swamped with reports and 
speculation on when mandela might be released and the issue is 
dominating political life the government has said it intends to 
free mandela but has not given any date 
de klerk is expected to outline government reforms friday in an 
opening address to new session of parliament de klerk who says he 
wants to end discrimination could announce mandelas release 
however the rev allan boesak a leading antiapartheid figure 
said mandelas release must be accompanied by reforms such as 
lifting the state of emergency and legalizing the anc and other 
banned organizations 
it has not yet been shown that mr de klerk has either the 
vision or the courage to make this moment a moment of historic 
importance boesak said 
an antigovernment demonstration is planned outside parliament 
to coincide with de klerks speech 
winnie mandela wife of the jailed nationalist leader said 
after seeing her husband in prison saturday that problems had 
arisen and his release could be delayed 
in oslo norway veteran anc leader walter sisulu said mandela 
is ready for release at any time i know that mandela would be 
making certain demands but i do not know if they are conditions 
dullah omar a close friend of the mandela family said mandela 
has made it clear the government must make basic reforms to clear 
the way for talks between whites and blacks 
if and when he is released and there have been no major 
changes then he will report back to his organization the anc 
that three years of talks with the government have been a waste 
of time omar said 
in an allusion to resuming armed struggle omar said mandela 
will go back to where he left off before he went to prison and 
will probably find himself back in prison in a month

congressional democrats attacked president 
bushs 1991 budget on all fronts monday calling the 123 trillion 
spending plan too soft on the pentagon too harsh on domestic 
programs and too reliant on rosy economic projections 
republicans leaped to bushs defense even though many of them 
had to concede that parts of the presidents proposal would never 
be enacted and that the budget year likely would be a tough one 
i wouldnt be surprised if we were unable to reach agreement 
up here this year sen pete domenici of new mexico the senate 
budget committees ranking republican conceded to reporters 
in a preview of a theme likely to dominate the years capitol 
hill fiscal wars majority democrats pounced on bushs call to 
spend 3033 billion for overall defense spending 
that figure a 2 percent cut from this years 2963 billion 
when compared to the costs of inflation was derided by many 
democrats as being too generous to the military at a time of easing 
tensions with the soviet bloc 
it is becoming apparent that if there is to be a peace 
dividend that amounts to anything this congress is going to have 
to carve it out complained senate budget committee chairman 
james sasser dtenn youd think joe stalin had come back and 
entrenched himself in the kremlin 
it is a rip van winkle budget that has not yet awakened to the 
changes in the world or the major challenges at homes said sen 
edward kennedy dmass 
yet noticeably lacking was the phrase that became the reflexive 
reaction among democrats to many of the budgets that president 
reagan sent the lawmakers dead on arrival 
i think well take it very seriously said house majority 
leader richard gephardt dmo 
but like other members of his party gephardt called the 
spending blueprint a standpat budget that fails to seriously 
address many of the nations problems 
senate appropriations committee chairman robert byrd dwva 
lauded bushs proposals to boost spending on the head start 
preschool program for lowincome children by 500 million to 19 
billion but he chided the president for offering overall education 
increases to 246 billion that fail to keep abreast of 
inflation and for cutting heating bill subsidies to the poor 
a budget should make a statement about a nations priorities 
and aspirations byrd said the only clear statement made by 
this first bush budget is read my lips not my actions 
also criticized were bushs projections for an economy growing 
26 percent this year well below the rate that congressional 
economists and many private analysts expect more optimistic 
forecasts allow the white house to boost its projections for 
revenue collections thus making the deficit appear smaller 
the return of the rsy scenario said rep william h gray 
iii the houses no 3 democratic leader referring to the name 
adopted for the economic estimates reagan used dancing all over 
the american economic landscape when all the indicators indicate 
that were not going to have that kind of growth 
commenting on what he said was a lack of a bold attack on the 
deficit which the administration thinks it will cut from an 
estimated 1238 billion this year to 631 billion in 1991 house 
budget committee chairman leon panetta dcalif said this is a 
take two aspirin and call me in the morning budget 
the democratic barrage prompted some republicans to retort that 
if democrats dont want to adopt the bush proposal it is up to 
them to produce an alternative 
congress always feels the need to be different no matter what 
the president suggests said the house budget committees ranking 
republican rep bill frenzel of minnesota but congress is 
obliged to produce a budget resolution of its own or to signify a 
willingness to negotiate with the president right off the bat

defense secretary dick cheney recommended 
monday closing or scaling back more than 72 us military 
installations and ending operations at 12 overseas facilities a 
plan that immediately drew congressional fire 
i understand the problem theyre faced with but its 
absolutely vital that congress have the guts to make the right 
decisions as we go through this period of time cheney said as he 
released his 2921 billion fiscal 1991 spending plan with the 
base closing proposal and signaled lawmakers that the battle has 
begun 
cheney said he had no figures yet for the potential savings from 
the moves he said the numbers were still being analyzed 
but because it costs money to shut bases down and legislation is 
needed to do so the savings are not usually accrued until years 
later 
the plan far less extensive than the 86 closings and five 
realignments that congress adopted last year from a federally 
mandated commission calls for closing a significant number of 
facilities in california 
among the candidates for closure there are fort ord alameda 
naval aviation depot and naval air station long beach naval 
shipyard moffett field naval air station and oakland naval supply 
center in california 
asked whether politics influenced the choices on the closing 
list which largely targets bases in the districts of liberal 
democrats on capitol hill cheney said the charge wasnt a valid 
one 
i did not assemble this list said the former republican 
congressman from wyoming the list was complied by the services 
said cheney who smiled at suggestions that the services may have 
been political in their choices 
other cheney proposals include deactivation of the 2nd armored 
division at fort hood which would involve the loss of 12000 
troops a republican sen phil gramm of texas rushed into action 
to try to work out a deal to save the division 
we worked out an agreement that if we are able to successfully 
negotiate round one of the conventional disarmament agreement with 
the soviets that would bring home 21600 army personnel from 
europe and the first 12000 of those would go to fort hood 
gramm said in texas 
but he added the army is looking at a reduction of 135000 
men in uniform theres no way you can do that without affecting 
us we want to minimize that effect 
the overseas bases where the united states would end its 
operations or realign forces include seven in europe six in asia 
and a naval air station in bermuda of the 14 all would be closed 
except the bermuda air station and naval communications station in 
the philippines which would have some forces shifted 
the european bases include two in greece hellenikon air base 
and the naval communications station in makri one in west germany 
zweibrucken air base three in england raf fairford greenham 
common and wethersfield and one in italy comiso air base 
comiso and greenham common are home to air force cruise missile 
installations that are being dismantled under the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty with the soviet union 
signed in december 1987 
the asia bases on cheneys list are a navy base in san miguel 
philippines two bases in turkey eskisehir munitions storage site 
and erhac air base and three in south korea kwang ju suwon and 
taegu 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee said in a statement that the base closure proposals 
will be controversial 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo a senior member of the house 
armed services committee said her military installations 
subcommittee will be taking a close look to ensure that the 
closings are not partisan 
cheneys list actually is a proposal to study which bases should 
be eliminated closing a base also requires a lengthy series of 
environmental impact statements which often lead to delays 
a handful of bases on cheneys proposed list were part of the 
closure and realignment list congress approved last year including 
fort sheridan in illinois fort meade in maryland letterkenny 
depot in pennsylvania 
the recommendations from the defense secretary would effectively 
cancel or completely realign the remaining work at some of those 
facilities 
sen pete wilson rcalif a member of the senate armed 
services committee and a gubernatorial candidate whose state is 
particularly hardhit by the base closings said he didnt think 
some of them make sense particularly the long beach shipyard 
which has met target dates on spending and repairs 
wilson said the closings will have to be examined thoroughly 
because of the previous shutdowns the savings were peanuts 
in long beach the areas chamber of commerce president bob 
creighton said the closing of the shipyard could mean as much as 
100 million a year to the local economy 
the chamber plans to work quite closely with our city 
officials our congressional delegation and the shipyard employees 
themselves to do everything we can to convince congress that the 
closing of our shipyard would be a mistake creighton said 
meanwhile the british foreign secretary douglas hurd said the 
us decision to withdraw its forces from three royal air force 
bases was compatible with natos objectives 
were satisfied that the decision is reasonable and 
compatible with the current conventional arms talks in vienna

the israeli government monday outlined a 313 
billion budget for 199091 that is intended to cope with a growing 
number of soviet jewish immigrants and hold the line on defense 
spending 
immigration and what it encompasses is determining the fate of 
this years budget finance minister shimon peres said in 
presenting the spending plan to the knesset or parliament for 
approval 
peres later told army radio israel has to think of other 
possible sources of money for absorbing immigrants 
the budget would increase the valueadded tax by one percentage 
point to 16 percent and hike taxes on fuel and cigarettes 
but peres rejected any other taxes or special assessments 
saying they could slow the pace of getting out of the recession 
and increase the rise in inflation 
parliament is expected to approve the budget with little debate 
or change 
the finance ministry said the proposed budget takes into account 
two main events the expected growth in the immigration from the 
soviet union and the stagnation in economic activity in 1989 
the economy grew just 1 percent each of the last two years and 
israeli officials have largely blamed the palestinian uprising 
against israeli rule in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
under the proposed budget spending would grow by 53 billion 
or about 19 percent over the 198990 budget however when 
adjusted for inflation about 20 percent in 1989 there would be 
little change in real value 
the deficit is projected at 211 billion last years budget 
provided for a 900 million deficit but it wound up at 234 
billion 
the finance ministry said the budget would provide 600 million 
to cover immigration costs for 40000 soviet jews in the new fiscal 
year or double the amount spent in 198990 it said another 200 
million would be provided by the jewish agency from donations 
abroad 
but the ministry said revised estimates indicate as many as 
100000 soviets could come this year and that an additional 500 
million would be needed to resettle that number of immigrants 
the defense budget anticipates the palestinian uprising now in 
its 26th month will continue in 199091 
at total of 627 billion is budgeted for defense up from 53 
billion in the previous year but the increase of 18 percent does 
not make up for inflation military experts said 
the defense ministry estimates its uprisingrelated expenses at 
about 225 million but it has budgeted only 75 million so it 
will have to cover the balance by cutting spending in other areas 
the ministry said

president bushs 1991 budget would spend at 
least 1 billion more to protect the environment in programs 
ranging from planting a billion new trees to tougher enforcement of 
pollution laws 
the environmental protection agency would be given an additional 
332 million to spend on an array of programs including cleaning up 
toxic waste dumps tougher enforcement of existing laws and 
implementation of stricter air pollution requirements now being 
considered by congress 
the agencys overall proposed budget for the fiscal year 
beginning in october is 58 billion 6 percent more than this 
years estimated expenditures the administration projects 
inflation this year to be 41 percent 
today a consensus is emerging that investments in 
maintaining and restoring the health of the environment can now be 
seen as a responsible investment in the future said the 
presidents budget document sent to capitol hill 
under a broad category of activities that encompasses more than 
a half dozen agencies and departments the administration said it 
wants to spend 76 billion for major programs to protect the 
environment including a number of initiatives under an umbrella 
program entitled america the beautiful 
the spending would reflect an increase of about 12 billion for 
the various programs officials said 
reflecting the heightened concern about global environmental 
issues such as the effect of pollution on the earths warming and 
on the destruction of the ozone layer the budget calls for 
authorizing 1 billion in spending for research into global 
changes 50 percent more than now is being given such efforts 
in another initiative aimed at dealing with global warming bush 
proposed spending 175 million next year to begin a longterm 
program aimed at planting a billion trees a year on private land 
across the country the program also would help local communities 
begin tree planting efforts 
trees absorb carbon dioxide a leading pollutant linked to 
global warming scientists suggested the treeplanting effort would 
have only marginal effect on overall global warming however 
bush who has vowed to end the dramatic decline in recent years 
of environmentally vital marshlands called for spending 460 
million next year on wetland protection under programs administered 
by a half dozen agencies an increase of 88 million over this year 
the president also proposed buying additional lands for national 
parks and said the forest service would eliminate below cost 
timber sales at nine national forests located near urban centers 
and make those forests more accessible for recreation the budget 
provides 10 million for additional recreational facilities at the 
nine forests 
the budget shows a marked departure from nearly a decade of 
decline and destruction of americas environmetnal programs said 
paul prichard president of the the private national parks and 
conservation association 
but some environmentalists were not as enthusiastic 
it falls far short of what is necessary to restore 
environmental protection in the united states and around the 
world said brent blackwelder a vice president of friends of the 
earth he said many environmentalists believe at least 5 billion 
in new environmental spending is called for 
epa administrator william reilly said at a news conference that 
the presidents budget at a time when new money is very hard to 
come by represents a significant commitment to assure that 
the public is protected from the most serious environmental threats 
now and in the future 
reilly noted that the budget calls for hiring 245 additional 
people to help administer the clean air act which he expects to be 
approved by congress later this year and for hiring 292 additional 
people in the agencys enforcement program

cubas un envoy said monday his nation 
will jam planned us television transmissions to cuba and warned 
broadcasters face serious disruptions in this socalled radio war 
or tv war 
ricardo alarcon de quesada who assumed his post last week said 
the us governments plan to transmit tv broadcasts into cuba 
violates international telecommunications agreements 
it is the same as taking from us part of our land our sea 
our air space he told reporters 
we are not creating this socalled radio war or tv war they 
are the ones who did that he said of us broadcasters 
alarcon said cuba has previously disrupted transmissions from 
the united states and warned further interruptions will have 
serious consequences for us stations 
we have given them some examples just to remind their 
technicians that it is perfectly possible alarcon said 
you can disrupt our tv services or our radio services but they 
can also suffer the same consequences if you do the same from the 
south to the north 
the united states has been broadcasting radio transmissions to 
cuba via radio marti named for cuban patriot jose marti for 
about five years last year congress provided money for television 
broadcasts to cuba 
on another matter alarcon said cuba will not resume the 
withdrawal of its troops from angola until it is assured that 
usbacked rebels in the african nation will not attack cuban 
soldiers 
an estimated 50000 cuban troops supporting the angolan 
government in a 15yearold civil war with the national union for 
the total independence of angola unita began a phased pullout a 
year ago under an accord signed by angola cuba and south africa 
unita was not party to the accords but pledged not to attack the 
cubans as they withdrew 
news reports from havana said cuba and angola temporarily 
suspended the withdrawal pending an investigation into a unita 
guerrilla raid jan 21 on a water pumping station guarded by cuban 
troops four cubans were killed and seven wounded un officials 
said 
the rebels have said they didnt know cubans were in the area at 
the time 
as long as we dont receive a satisfactory explanation of what 
happened and also the necessary assurances that such a thing cannot 
ever be repeated the withdrawal continues to be suspended 
alarcon said 
he also said his nation is pleased it will have an opportunity 
to play a heightened role in un negotiations next month as 
president of the 15member security council the rotating 
presidency will give cuba reponsibility for setting the councils 
agenda and more involvement in negotiations between member nations 
cuba was elected to the council last year as representative of 
the latin american nations the first time since the cuban 
revolution in 1959 that it has served in that capacity

the government accused opponents 
monday of attempting a coup and supporters rallied behind it 
occupying the offices of one opposition party and forcing anothers 
leader to flee in an armored car 
more than 15000 people rallied in bucharest to support the 
selfappointed government that took over when communist dictator 
nicolae ceausescu was deposed and executed last month news media 
reported similar demonstrations in several other cities but gave 
no details 
on sunday about 15000 people protested in the capital 
demanding the resignation of the council of the national salvation 
front the name adopted by the government that is running the 
country until elections planned for may 20 
after initially declaring its only purpose was to guide romania 
through the immediate postrevolutionary period the front recently 
said it would enter candidates in the elections 
that decision angered the fledgling opposition which says the 
front 150 intellectuals technocrats and former communists has 
an unfair advantage 
many opposition politicians have pointed to the communist pasts 
of leading front members and suggested it really is the communist 
party in disguise 
as the thousands of progovernment demonstrators gathered monday 
outside front headquarters in victory square three of ceausescus 
henchmen pleaded guilty in court to complicity in genocide 
former interior minister tudor postelnicu former central 
committee secretary emil bobu and former politburo member manea 
manescu along with ion dinca a former politburo member who 
pleaded guilty saturday admitted supporting ceausescus order to 
shoot demonstrators at the revolutions outset 
about the sunday protest front member silviu brucan said it was 
organized by the peasants party which was a dominant presence in 
parliament before world war ii and is thought to be the strongest 
opposition party now 
brucan a ranking communist who fell out with ceausescu after 
criticizing his dictatorial methods told reporters the rally was 
an attempt to overthrow the front 
their shock troops came close to the main entrance of the 
building he said the whole event amounted to a putsch a coup 
detat 
peasants party spokesman ion ratiu said of brucans allegations 
the whole thing was turned around to justify their actions 
today 
he spoke at a news conference called in the hotel room he has 
called home since returning last week from decades of selfexile in 
britain 
ratiu a wealthy shipbuilder and real estate investor accused 
the front of staging mondays demonstrations many protesters 
arrived at victory square in buses and trucks 
another progovernment rally formed around the building that 
houses peasants party headquarters about two miles from the front 
building and at the nearby liberal party headquarters 
we wont leave until you dissolve the party demonstrators 
chanted as they forced their way into liberal headquarters 
peasants party leader corneliu coposu was evacuated building by 
soldiers in an armored car 
no injuries were reported at either headquarters brucan said 
three people suffered stab wounds to the back during sundays 
protest but that none was in serious condition 
brucan denied ratius claim that the front staged and paid for 
the demonstrations monday but several people outside the peasants 
party building indirectly suggested they had been under pressure to 
demonstrate they said they worked in state factories and had 
joined their bosses at the progovernment rallies 
a woman who would not give her name claimed the sunday 
demonstration also was less than spontaneous they were given 
dollars cigarettes and lei she said referring to the romanian 
currency 
both days of demonstrations violated a ban the front has put on 
rallies that lack advance authorization from the police 
the front has decreed that rallies should not take place during 
working hours but made no attempt to disperse mondays 
progovernment demonstration

head start the highly touted preschool 
program would receive 500 million more under the 1991 budget 
proposal president bush sent congress on monday the 36 percent 
increase would be the largest onetime jump for the program since 
it began 24 years ago 
bush is asking congress for 19 billion budget in multiyear 
spending authority for head start for fiscal 1991 enough to raise 
enrollment from 450000 to 667000 70 percent of children aged 3 
through 5 from lowincome families 
bushs budget message to congress called the program a key 
component in achieving the readiness of all children to start 
school 
besides giving preschoolers the social and learning skills to 
help them thrive in grade school head start an agency of the 
health and human services department screens children for medical 
and dental problems and gives them two meals a day 
the president seeks an identical 500 million in budget 
authority for the education department 246 billion compared to 
241 billion this year 
for fiscal 1991 alone bush asked congress to approve a budget 
of 237 billion a 62 percent increase over this years 223 
billion budget the administration expects inflation this year to 
be 41 percent 
the education budget targets 18 billion for initiatives and 
priority areas including preschool elementary and secondary 
education mathematics and science education dropout prevention 
adult literacy and drug education 
for the chapter one program which provides special educational 
services for lowachieving elementary and secondary students bush 
requests a a 600 million increase to 51 billion 
and for the even start program which provides basic education 
srvices to parents together with their children aged 1 through 7 
bush seeks to double the multiyear budget authority to 48 million 
in the area of education for the handicapped the budget 
proposes spending 22 billion in fiscal 1991 a 500 million 
increase that would provide more services to 355000 preschool 
children and would enhance the state programs that serve all 
infants up to the age of 2 and their families

programs to prepare children for school and for discretionary 
education programs said the budget 
however bushs budget requests cuts in certain student loan 
programs for college students including a 600 million decrease in 
the guaranteed student loan program to 32 billion from 38

expenditures would fall in 1991 because of a projected decrease in 
interest rates 
while bush requests a 473 million increase in the pell grants 
program which provides money to college student over the current 
48 billion the budget seeks to cut the program next fall by

at least two ethnic albanians were 
killed and 20 seriously injured monday in battles with police on 
the sixth day of unrest in troubled kosovo province 
eight deaths have been confirmed since last wednesday in the 
latest wave of violence between police and ethnic albanians who 
demand free elections and the lifting of a 12monthold state of 
emergency 
the official news agency tanjug said one protester was killed in 
urosevac 30 miles south of pristina capital of kosovo and the 
second died in gnjilane 6 miles south of the city 
tanjug said without elaboration that several policemen 
were injured in clashes with demonstrators throughout the province 
yugoslavias collective state presidency and the government 
issued separate statements both describing the kosovo situation as 
extremely grave and promising resolute action against 
ethnic albanian extremists and separatists 
riots began last year after the serbian republic of which 
kosovo is an autonomous province made constitutional changes to 
take tighter control 
about 90 percent of the people in the impoverished southern 
province are ethnic albanians predominantly moslem the minority 
christian serbs say the moslems in kosovo which is adjacent to 
albania want to force them out 
tensions were heightened monday by the resumption of trial 
proceedings against 14 ethnic albanians including the provinces 
former communist leader charged with inciting a wave of unrest 
last year that left at least 25 people dead 
after a brief court session the trial was rescheduled for feb 
5 apparently because of the tense situation the state tanjug news 
agency said 
in the city of podujevo about 30 miles north of pristina riot 
police lobbed tear gas and used a water cannon to disperse about 
2000 demonstrators 
tanjug said 8000 people assembled at drenica 25 miles 
northwest of pristina for peaceful demonstrations 
hundreds of people lined up on the sidewalk of pristinas main 
street to sign a petition calling for democratic elections the 
lifting of martial law and the release of all ethnic albanian 
political prisoners

head of the association of sociologists and philosophers his group 
is part of the opposition coalition that drew up the petition 
berisha said 2000 people had signed the petition in the first 
two hours 
we expect more than one million people to sign it said 
zekeria cana secretary of the kosovo human rights committee 
another coalition member 
bogdan kecman a leader of kosovos minority serbs rejected any 
dialogue with the ethnic albanian movements however describing 
them as terrorists and separatists 
we demand that the state give us weapons to protect lives from 
the albanians he told reporters

the fbi would lose 400 agents under president 
bushs proposed 1991 fiscalyear budget largely because of a new 
overtime law that will cost the bureau an extra 42 million 
officials said monday 
congress never eager to cut the fbi budget must approve the 
proposal 
if congress agrees the reduction will be absorbed by the 
resignation or retirement of agents usually between 450 and 480 
each year deputy fbi director floyd clarke said 
but right now our hiring program will have to be almost 
stopped in 1991 if the budget is not changed clarke told 
reporters at a budget briefing we just have to work harder he 
added we will get the job done 
the cuts at the fbi contrast with proposed increase in the 
number of drug enforcement administration agents from the current 
level of 3167 to 3547 in the next fiscal year 
there is no question the drug war is receiving a very high 
priority said deputy attorney general donald b ayer it is 
the highest priority in the department 
at the fbi the manpower cut would mark only the second time in 
11 years the bureau has reduced the number of agents on its 
payroll the 1981 fiscal year budget cut 93 agents from the fbis 
workforce 
proposed increases for such highpriority fbi efforts as 
organized crime and whitecollar criminal investigations will 
partially offset the reductions in the bureaus workforce which 
includes more than 10000 agents 
but even these sections of the fbi will experience net cuts in 
manpower despite attorney general dick thornburghs repeated vow to 
attack crime in the suites that has spawned fraud in the 
savingsandloan and securities industries 
those priorities remain the attorney generals priorities 
said justice department spokesman david runkel but the fbis job 
is to manage the operation within the budget provided them we will 
be working with the bureaus management to ensure there 
will be no diminution of effort in the priority areas 
the proposed 154 billion budget calls for a net loss of 41 
agents assigned to whitecollar investigations and six agents 
investigating organized crime clarke said 
to meet deficitreduction targets 257 million will be cut 
from the fbis budget eliminating 227 agents in addition the fbi 
plans to cut 559 agents from its payroll to finance the higher 
costs of overtime under a new law enacted by congress 
budget increases for such highpriority enforcement programs as 
whitecollar and organized crime would add 388 agents to the fbis 
authorized workforce a net loss of 400 agents according to budget 
documents 
paying fbi agents at higher overtime rates will cost the bureau 
an estimated 419 million in the 1991 fiscal year according to 
budget documents 
under the new law agents overtime is paid at a rate pegged to 
their actual pay grade previously all agents over grade 10 earned 
overtime pegged to that salary grade 
the change means that a senior agent will earn up to 15000 in 
overtime each year instead of 6000 or 7000 runkel said 
virtually every fbi agent earns overtime and runkel suggested 
that the bureau could better manage the time of agents to reduce 
this expense 
the new overtime law sponsored by rep mary rose oakar dohio 
will cost the justice department more than 66 million the figure 
includes overtime increases for border patrol immigration and dea 
agents 
the office of management and budget originally agreed to finance 
the additional overtime expenses but later forced the department to 
absorb that cost through program cuts said a department source 
who spoke on condition of anonymity

the president of lebanons american 
university of beirut said monday that a threeday meeting had eased 
tensions between campuses in moslem west beirut and the citys 
christian sector 
students at the branch campus in christian east beirut have 
refused to attend classes for two weeks alleging the university 
administration based in the moslem sector was discriminating 
against them 
university president frederic p herter flew from new york to 
the port of larnaca on the south coast of cyprus to attend the 
meeting of administrators and faculty from both campuses 
he denied reports that the east beirut branch wanted to become 
an autonomous university but conceded it had inadequate 
representation of interests on the main campus 
herter said faculty at the east beirut branch want more students 
admitted charging the administrators in west beirut who review 
applications had discriminated against christians 
there have been no irregularities or prejudicial activities in 
the admissions on the part of the main campus he said 
enrollment at the christian branch dropped this year from about 
1000 to about 900 about onefifth of the 5100 students at the 
main campus also are christian 
herter said it will take a lot of good will to resolve 
problems with faculty on both sides willing to go back and 
forth between the two sectors of beirut 
the extension was set up in 1977 when continued fighting made it 
more and more hazardous to cross the green line that divides the 
city into sectarian zones 
the usaffiliated university has suffered heavily in lebanons 
14yearold civil war 
fighting last year forced the campus to close for six months it 
reopened oct 9 
herter has not been to beirut since 1985 when moslem extremists 
began kidnappings of westerners including several faculty members 
at american university three have been killed 
two are still being held acting dean of agriculture thomas 
sutherland a scottishborn us citizen and brian keenan an 
english language professor who holds dual irish and british 
nationality 
herter said it was good news that sutherland kidnapped in 
beirut on june 9 1985 had been reported alive and well by a 
london newspaper 
the sunday correspondent said iranianbacked shiite moslem 
sources in beirut confirmed sutherland was being held with briton 
john mccarthy a television journalist kidnapped on april 17 1986 
the hostage held longest is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press he was kidnapped march 16

president bush pledged monday to work with 
congress to prevent some individual farm operations from collecting 
excessively large federal subsidies 
failure to do so will result in a loss of public confidence 
and support for the farm program bush said in his proposed 
budget for fiscal 1991 the taxpayers rightly expect these abuses 
to be curbed 
the 1985 farm law limits the amount of incomesupport payments 
under various crop programs to 50000 per person each year the 
limit on total federal subsidies is 250000 per year for each 
person 
those ceilings have been routinely exceeded because a 
person is defined as an individual or business entity such as 
a corporation or trust the budget document said 
the report included diagrams of how illegal joint ventures using 
family members and other entities were set up to evade the 50000 
limit in 1988 and collect 912089 in federal subsidies another 
example showed payments of 801619 
both examples were included last year in reports by the 
agriculture departments inspector general 
the budget document said that while reducing farm program costs 
is important the bush administration also is concerned about the 
distribution of those subsidy payments 
a significant portion of benefits goes to larger wealthy 
farmers it said in an era of limited resources this is hard 
to justify 
in 1987 for example 30 percent of the 224 billion in 
commodity related subsidies went to 4 percent of the farmers who 
had average net cash incomes of more than 100000 per year and net 
worths of nearly 850000 
this should be changed congress was told one option for 
achieving savings of approximately onehalf billion dollars would 
be to eliminate direct payments to farm operators with adjusted 
gross incomes of over 100000 per year 
the budget document added this income level after all 
represents three times the average for an american family of four 
up to a billion dollars could be saved by withholding direct 
payments to farm entities with gross sales of 500000 per year or 
more

the government reversed itself monday and shelved 
plans to use identity cards as a means of reducing violence at 
soccer games 
the decision was announced after publication of a report on the 
overcrowding that led to 95 spectators being crushed to death last 
april at hillsborough stadium in sheffield northern england 
judge peter taylor of the appeal court prepared the report 
which said using identity cards could cause crowding at turnstiles 
and more deaths by crushing 
prime minister margaret thatcher had supported the card idea 
against a host of critics in politics and the soccer world 
she indicated last week however that she would back down the 
reversal was confirmed monday when home secretary david waddington 
told parliament the government have decided not to proceed with 
the establishment of a football membership authority 
the authority was supposed to control hooliganism by issuing 
cards to fans that would admit them through computerized 
turnstiles the cards of known hooligans would have been 
invalidated 
among problems with the plan was the unresolved question of 
whether the courts or soccer authorities should decide who was a 
hooligan also the entire system would have had to operate through 
a central computer register whose ability to handle up to 400000 
fans a week never was established 
waddington said the legislation would stay on the books for 
possible activation if other methods failed 
abandonment of the card plan removes the cornerstone of the 
government antihooliganism strategy while britain is preparing to 
send teams from england and scotland to the world cup tournament in 
italy this summer 
hooliganism devastated english soccer in the 1980s with riots 
field invasions and street battles involving english fans abroad 
in the worst incident at a brussels stadium in 1985 39 people 
were killed when liverpool fans went on a rampage 
judge taylor recommended legislation to outlaw running onto 
soccer fields throwing objects from the stands or shouting obscene 
or racist remarks 
he also supported experimenting with surveillance of suspected 
hooligans by attaching electronic tracers to their legs but 
expressed grave doubts about the feasibility of the national 
membership scheme and serious misgivings about its likely impact on 
safety

president hashemi rafsanjani of iran 
thanked parliament and its oversight committee on monday for 
reviewing and approving his 112 billion fiveyear plan tehran 
television reported 
the ambitious plan is designed to revive irans warshattered 
economy 
the islamic republic news agency reported earlier this week that 
the 12member guardian council which screens legislation for 
conformity with islam and the constitution sent parts of the plan 
back to parliament for amendment 
irna did not say what portions of the plan were found 
objectionable nor has it reported on its subsequent approval 
mondays broadcast quoted rafsanjani as saying i thank the 
guardian council and the parliament for approving the fiveyear 
plan and express the governments readiness to implement it in its 
entirety 
both the telecast and irna were monitored in nicosia 
it was not clear whether rafsanjani was thanking the council for 
giving the goahead to parts of his plan or whether the blocked 
portions of the plan had also been approved 
he was speaking at an unusual meeting of irans top leadership 
that the broadcast said was called to plan celebrations for the 
upcoming 11th anniversary of the 1979 revolution that brought the 
clergy to power the anniversary is feb 111 
the 270member majlis or parliament passed rafsanjanis plan 
after leading radicals blocking the plan bowed to a stern warning 
by irans spiritual leader ayatollah ali khamenei 
the radicals led by former interior minister ali akbar 
mohtashemi objected to rafsanjanis call for foreign investment in 
reconstruction projects and his plan to privatize inefficient 
government projects 
mohtashemi said this month he opposed any direct foreign 
investment in iran 
but deputy finance minister mandi navvab said saturday iran 
welcomed foreign investment and that tehrans policies provided 
grounds for mutual cooperation with foreign companies irna 
reported earlier 
it quoted navvab as saying foreigners were legally free to 
invest in joint ventures with iranian partners as long as the 
foreign stake in each project did not exceed 49 percent 
the rafsanjani plan aims to triple nonoil exports in 199095 to 
9 billion a year iran now relies on oil and gas exports for about 
95 percent of its foreign exchange 
the program would rebuild industries following the eightyear 
war with iraq

a wood products giant has been promoting 
a takeover attempt involving 21 million acres in maine with 
newspaper advertisements showing a smiling sportsman with a big 
fish 
theres just one little problem its the wrong fish 
georgiapacific corp has been running the fullpage ad for 
weeks in state newspapers to win the favor of residents in its 
battle to buy great northern nekoosa corp for 38 billion 
at least two experts say the fish held by the fisherman in the 
ad appears to be a striped bass which lives in coastal waters and 
not in northern maine the location of the 21 million acres at 
stake in the takeover 
i think it was a poor choice state fisheries biologist paul 
johnson said monday if theyre going to show somebody with a 
fish they should show a fish from northern maine 
the advertisement is headlined the maine facts about 
georgiapacific 
at the state department of marine resources in augusta the ad 
caught the attention of another fish expert 
theyre nowhere near the land that theyre trying to 
acquire said lewis flagg director of the departments 
anadromous fish division anadromous fish such as salmon and 
striped bass return from the sea to rivers and streams to spawn 
georgiapacific spokeswoman gail smith reached at her office at 
the companys atlanta headquarters said she had little information 
about the fish picture 
it was taken somewhere in new england ms smith said 
its intended to be a representation of sporting activities 
johnson said from the department of inland fisheries and 
wildlife office in greenville that workers in his office began 
laughing at the ad when it first began running he said he was 
surprised when it kept appearing over and over 
it just finally grated on my nerves said johnson who wrote 
a letter to the editor of the maine sunday telegram 
the striped bass is hardly an appropriate species to choose in 
promoting its quest to take over management responsibility for more 
than 2 million acres of inland forest and water resources 
johnsons letter said 
wouldnt a picture of a trout togue or salmon provide a more 
persuasive demonstration of georgiapacifics commitment to 
maine the letter said 
the striped bass has been introduced in some freshwater bodies 
particularly in the south and flagg said the state is trying to 
develop a population in the kennebec river 
johnson said the fish will probably never swim in the waters of 
great northerns land 
were a long way from the coast he said they should just 
change that damn picture in their advertisement

the government will not prosecute a british moslem 
leader who addressed a rally in october where crowds reportedly 
supported a death threat against writer salman rushdie the lord 
chancellor said monday 
rushdies book the satanic verses is considered blasphemous 
by many moslems and the author has been in hiding since last feb 
14 when the late iranian leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini called 
for rushdies death 
at a rally oct 21 in manchester in northern england dr kalim 
siddiqui was quoted as asking participants to raise their hands in 
agreement with khomeinis death sentence 
in its report on the meeting the daily telegraph said nearly 
all of the 250 moslems present raised their hands 
the director of public prosecutions allan green decided there 
was insufficient evidence to prosecute siddiqui on charges of 
incitement to murder said lord mckay the lord chancellor who is 
the countrys chief legal officer 
lord mckay made the announcement in answer to a legislators 
question in the house of commons 
the satanic verses caused worldwide protests last year and 
the publisher has delayed plans for a paperback version because of 
continued moslem death threats the observer newspaper reported 
sunday 
it said rushdie was angered by the decision and is now 
claiming that his life will never be safe until the publishing 
cycle is completed 
in a statement later sunday publisher viking penguin said no 
firm date has been established but even if it had it would not be 
the companys policy to reveal such information for obvious 
security reasons 
a viking penguin spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity 
denied there was animosity between the publisher and rushdie 
the observer quoting an unidentified company source said the 
publishers will not produce the paperback as long as there is risk 
to its staff bookshops or the public 
the hardcover edition of the satanic verses has become an 
international bestseller with sales of more than 1 million copies 
despite being banned in more than 20 countries it was published in 
fall 1988

avianca flight 52s declaration of a fuel 
shortage was relayed from regional traffic controllers to 
controllers handling its approach but the urgency of the warning 
wasnt clear authorities said monday 
the controllers were not told by the pilot that there was an 
emergency federal aviation administration spokesman fred farrar 
said from washington 
farrar said the word used was priority which has no 
particular meaning in air traffic control if there is an 
emergency you use the word emergency 
the faa report conflicts with information provided sunday night 
by the national transportation safety board which said the 
regional controllers had not relayed word of the fuel shortage to 
the local controllers 
the boeing 707 fell powerless into a secluded neighborhood of 
cove neck on new yorks long island on thursday night killing 73 
of 159 people aboard including the cockpit crew more than 20 
survivors remained hospitalized in critical condition monday 
inspection of the crash site on a wooded hillside was nearly 
complete monday and investigators focused on conversations of the 
crew and controllers 
the investigators said tapes show the crew warned a regional 
control center that it was low on fuel about 45 minutes before the 
crash as it was circling over new jersey in a holding pattern 
the jet flew in three weatherrelated holding patterns totaling 
nearly 90 minutes along the east coast as it flew from colombia to 
new york citys john f kennedy airport 
we think we may need priority a crew member told the 
control center about 845 pm according to preliminary 
transcripts farrar said monday 
a regional controller replied how long can you hold before 
you have to go to your alternate the alternate landing site was 
boston 
wait a minute the cockpit replied pausing apparently to 
check the faa said we can hold five minutes shortly 
thereafter the cockpit said its alternate site was boston i 
cant make it 
at that time the faa said the regional controller telephoned 
the control center that handles approaches and departures for 
kennedy 
the regional controller said avianca 52 had just come out of the 
holding area and can only do five more minutes of hold can you 
take him now 
the local control replied slow him to 180 knots and i will 
take him 
after the call the plane was released to kennedy airport and it 
made a landing attempt 37 minutes later through rain and fog but 
aborted the approach because it was coming in too steeply 
authorities said 
investigators say the avianca crew agreed to a controllers 
suggestion that the plane loop back over long island and come in 
for a second attempt it did so the cockpit saying twice it was 
low on fuel but the engines soon quit and the plane crashed 
investigators are looking at the fuel shortage as a cause 
ntsb investigators monday were interviewing regional controllers 
and kennedy tower controllers to determine the extent of their 
knowledge of the fuel problems and what was done about it 
asked about the conflicting reports of what information was 
relayed between controllers ntsb spokesman mike benson said the 
phone message from the regional center may not fully reflect what 
went on there may be more to that conversation it may need to be 
judged in a fuller context 
the faas duties include the nations air traffic controllers 
the ntsb investigates transporation accidents 
the faa and the ntsb as well as the controllers association 
stressed monday that aviancas message was not urgent and did not 
use the word emergency which would have brought the plane 
quickly back to kennedy and cleared the way for a second landing 
attempt 
faa standards for flight emergencies spell out instructions to 
pilots 
common sense and good judgment will determine the extent of 
assistance to be given in minimum fuel situations the faa 
instructions say if at any time the remaining usable fuel 
supply suggests the need for traffic priority to ensure a safe 
landing the pilot should declare an emergency and report fuel 
remaining in minutes 
the words emergency or minimum fuel according to r 
steve bell president of the air traffic controllers association 
would have triggered an emergency response by controllers 
stating that you are low on fuel does not imply an immediate 
problem 
in washington secretary of transportation samuel k skinner 
said that while he could not predict the outcome of the 
investigation he does not believe a lack of a sufficient number of 
air traffic controllers was to blame 
you should not prejudge an investigation before all of the 
people are interviewed and all of the facts are in but i believe 
that when the evidence is all in staffing will not be a factor 
skinner said declining to answer further questions

veteran journalists in panama are 
only half joking when they say panama still has no opposition news 
media even after the overthrow of gen manuel antonio noriega 
noriega had suppressed virtually all opposition outlets last 
week officials of the inter american press association said 
freedom of expression had improved very much since the us 
invasion in december 
also however the iapa officials expressed concern about 10 
radio and two television stations taken over by the government and 
the arrests of journalists connected with the old regime 
members of the committee led by ed seaton of seaton group said 
the government assured them the cases would be dealt with in 
accordance with panamanian law 
in a country where the concept of freedom of the press has been 
subjective the old regimes collapse resulted in public 
recriminations and confusing legal situations regarding old and new 
media 
there was little opposition to noriega and not one media outlet 
now criticizes the us invasion 
la estrella owned by a close friend of noriega now supports 
president guillermo endaras government as strongly as it did the 
dictator 
la prensa which noriega closed resumed publication earlier 
this month and supports the new government 
el siglo reopened and attacked everyone and everything connected 
with the old regime especially la estrella it called maj gen 
henry cisneros commander of us army south the most popular man 
in panama 
another publishing company panama america was taken over 21 
years ago when the government moved in during disputes between 
minority and majority stockholders 
after the invasion the old majority owners returned took over 
the modernized facilities and started publishing two papers 
critica libre and panama america 
the immediate losers were 68 journalists who worked for the 
pronoriega newspapers critica matutino and la republica they 
seek either reinstatment or severance pay but the publishers say 
the workers are not and never have been employees of panama america 
we are professional journalists said eva montillo former 
assistant editor of la republica we did our job as journalists 
the newspapers policy or ideology is something else 
aristides calvo editor in chief of editora renovacion as the 
company was called in the noriega years is the only journalist 
still detained by the new government complaints have been filed 
against him that include extortion and apology for crime 
endaras government has taken custody of at least 10 radio 
stations and two television stations owned by people believed to 
have been connected with noriega 
most continue operating government officials say they were 
taken over so investigations could determine whether public funds 
were used to buy them 
some may have to be returned including the largest television 
station channel 2 its owners include former pronoriega 
presidential candidate carlos duque and eduardo diaz herrera 
former secondincommand of the panamanian defense forces 
diaz herrera broke with noriega in mid1987 accusing the 
general of electoral fraud drug trafficking and other crimes 
less clear is the case of channel 5 which seemed to belong to 
whoever was president 
it first was owned by former president ricardo de la espriella 
whom noriega forced to resign 
when noriega made eric arturo delvalle president delvalle also 
got control of channel 5 when noriega had delvalle dumped the 
television station became the property of the government agency 
that had financed its purchase 
panama america may become a serious headache for the new 
government both in ownership and labor problems 
we will have to face it sooner or later a government 
official said privately the old group left scared by the us 
army it was a de facto situation there are no legal documents 
involved 
majority stockholders sued the government when their facilities 
were taken over and they kept the case open 21 years they told 
iapa they will go to the supreme court to clear up the matter

former exxon valdez skipper joseph 
hazelwoods attorneys on monday lost another bid to have charges 
against him dismissed on the opening day of his trial in the 
nations worst oil spill 
i feel that this show should not go on at least not 
here hazelwood attorney dick madson said in arguing that the new 
york seaman should have been charged under federal rather than 
state law 
hazelwood 43 was the captain of the exxon valdez when the 
tanker ran aground march 24 spilling nearly 11 million gallons of 
north slope crude oil into prince william sound 
he faces a felony charge of criminal mischief and misdemeanor 
charges of operating a vessel while intoxicated reckless 
endangerment and negligent discharge of oil if convicted on all 
counts he faces up to seven years and three months in prison and 
61000 in fines 
superior court judge karl johnstone denied madsons motion for 
dismissal of the charges saying it lacked substance earlier 
defense efforts to get the indictment against hazelwood dismissed 
also failed 
madson said federal law prevails to guarantee consistent rules 
from port to port regardless of which state a vessel is in 
federal laws and regulations have covered this field for 200 
years and theres a good reason for it he said 
hazelwood sat in the courtroom as johnstone dealt with 
preliminary matters for 90 minutes before instructing attorneys to 
spend the rest of the day examining standard threepage 
questionnaires completed by prospective jurors 
johnstone said he expects jury selection to take less than the 
two weeks attorneys in the case predicted 
still pending is a defense motion to keep from evidence the 
results of a bloodalcohol test that hazelwood failed about 10 
hours after the tanker struck bligh reef and began spilling oil in 
earlymorning darkness 
the spill blackened shores and killed wildlife resulting in 
what exxon corp calculated was a 2 billion cleanup some state 
officials and others say the work is not over and should continue 
this spring and summer 
about 90 people have been summoned as candidates for the 
12member jury 
the questionnaire for jurors includes questions about experience 
with vessels work in the oil and fishing industries familiarity 
with the oil spill and personal economic loss or gain tied to the 
spill 
the trial is expected to last more than six weeks defense 
attorneys and prosecutors have said each side will need about three 
weeks to present its case 
hazelwood originally was scheduled for an october trial in 
valdez the port from which the tanker sailed a few hours before 
the crash but the trial for the huntington ny seaman was moved 
to anchorage to increase the chance of a fair proceeding and to 
take advantage of a larger jury pool and facilities 
about 30 prospective jurors a day will be considered the judge 
said a larger number will be screened if a panel of 12 plus 
alternates cannot be found from the pool of 90 
nearly all of the people in the courtroom monday were from the 
news media johnstones first business of the day was a briefing 
for reporters photographers and camera crews concerning courtroom 
rules

vice president dan quayle won 
assurances monday that panama will reform its banking practices to 
deter drugmoney laundering but public details were few and 
panamas president suggested any changes would be not that 
profound 
quayle later flew to jamaica as he wound up a threecountry tour 
to latin america and the caribbean during which leaders in the 
region criticized the us invasion of panama and pressed for 
withdrawal of american troops 
jamaican prime minister michael manley said his government is 
not ready to agree to us urging to recognize the panamanian 
government of guillermo endara manley also complained that 
potential us cuts in aid will hinder his nations ability to 
fight illegal drugs 
in panama city endara stood beside quayle at a news conference 
and declared that panama cannot continue to be a center for narco 
dollars but endara facing opposition from panamas bankers 
also said we dont know yet what exact changes will have to be 
made in our banking laws were working on that now 
endara who was installed as president at the start of the us 
military strike that ousted manuel antonio noriega said that some 
of what the bush administration wants can be accomplished simply by 
enforcing current laws 
during noriegas rule panamanian banks were accused by us 
authorities of serving as centers helping traffickers launder 
drug money sanctioning transactions that made it difficult to 
track the money 
quayle said he was impressed with endaras willingness to move 
in a different direction where we will be able to detect this 
type of activity much easier than before 
quayle who arrived back in washington on monday night told 
reporters en route from jamaica that he had telephoned president 
bush with a very upbeat report on the trip 
he said that while venezuela and jamaica both insist on some 
sort of election in panama before theyre willing to recognize the 
endara government as far as were concerned hes legitimized 
now 
quayle said the election last may 7 that was invalidated by 
noriega was won fairly by endara it was a free and fair 
election 
however he said its up to the new panama government to decide 
whether it will hold new elections 
the vice presidents talks with the endara government produced 
agreement on a need for stricter enforcement for stronger 
requirements for banks to report large deposits and for 
negotiations on exchanging tax information concerning people under 
investigation in drug cases said a senior official traveling with 
quayle 
i dont think that the bankers are opposing just any 
changes endara told reporters the bankers want changes that 
are reasonable and will not duly change the banking environment 
they know that panama cannot continue to be a center for narco 
dollars 
jamaica was the last stop of quayles threeday trip that 
focused on regional ramifications of the dec 20 us military 
invasion of panama 
manley said the vice presidents visit did not change his 
governments opposition to the military action 
although jamaica strongly opposed noriega manley said we 
also feel very strongly about the principles of sovereignty that 
are involved in the invasion of any country by another 
although we have an understanding of what led to the action 
we could not agree with it he told reporters in a joint news 
conference with quayle 
we are good friends but friends do not always agree he said 
of usjamaica relations jamaica is worried about pending cuts in 
us economic support because if there is a cut at all it makes 
it that much harder to fight the war on drugs manley said 
he previously has complained that the united states planned to 
cut all of jamaicas 25 million in economic support money which 
was part of a total 124 million aid package in 1989 
quayle assured him we simply are not going to stand by and 
allow a zeroing out of the economic support funds 
we take that very seriously he said about the potential 
impact on antidrug efforts 
quayle noted that a majority of the foreign aid money is 
earmarked for a handful of countries he said the administration 
wants congress to provide more flexibility in distributing the 
remaining money 
after his talks with six heads of state at saturdays 
presidential inauguration in honduras and with the panamanian 
leaders quayle was receptive to the idea of more aid to the 
beleaguered countries of the region one aide said 
panama had sought 2 billion to help it recover from the 
invasion and the economic stranglehold of two years of us 
sanctions against noriegas regime 
president bush last week said he was prepared to supply panama 
with half that amount 
before leaving panama city quayle took a driving tour of the 
impoverished chorrillo neighborhood several blocks were leveled by 
fire and bombing during the us attack including the headquarters 
of noriegas panamanian defense force 
as his motorcade slowly drove by the area onlookers gathered in 
groups and peered out windows watching in stony silence their 
reaction was in stark contrast to the enthusiastic cheering sunday 
from a welldressed congregation at a roman catholic church quayle 
attended in another neighborhood

iraqi president saddam hussein blamed the 
united states on monday for an influx of soviet jews to israel an 
increase that arab officials fear will drive palestinians out of 
the israelioccupied territories 
the soviet union also drew arab fire as newspapers echoed plo 
chief yasser arafats call saturday for moscow to reverse itself 
and curtail migration of its jews to israel 
the kremlin on monday blasted the israeli governments decision 
to settle soviet emigres in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
and said the move complicates plans to allow even more soviet jews 
to emigrate 
we strongly condemn endangering soviet emigres by using them 
to crowd palestinians out of their own land said the soviet 
statement which was reported by the official tass news agency 
this policy reveals plans to create a greater israel above all 
at the expense of the palestinian people 
in jerusalem spokesman yosef amihud of the israeli foreign 
ministry attacked the soviet statement as having many 
irregularities concerning the israeli position and added 
as for the insinuations that israel was using the jews coming 
out of the soviet union to crowd palestinians out of their own 
land this has no base 
the government of israel has no policy that determines where 
an immigrant will live and every immigrant is free to choose where 
he will live 
amihud said moscow had not followed up an agreement reached with 
israel a year ago in cairo that teams of experts from the two 
countries meet 
he said israel hopes that the soviet union will use its 
influence on arab nations to answer the israel peace plan 
and that the soviets pursue freedom of entrance and exit 
immigration activists in jerusalem asked monday for an emergency 
evacuation of more soviet jews who they said are endangered by 
antisemitism and possible pogroms 
israeli officials have predicted 300000 soviet jews will arrive 
in israel within three years under relaxed soviet emigration 
procedures 
speaking in cairo saddam said the influx is causing plain and 
serious harm to the palestinians 
we regard the united states as a participant in this 
immigration because of its policies said saddam standing beside 
president hosni mubarak whose egypt is the only arab country at 
peace with israel and is among washingtons closest arab friends 
if the united states were preventing nationals of other 
countries from settling in it we would say that this is a general 
practice he said 
but for the united states to let in all kinds of immigrants 
and prevent only jewish immigrants from the soviet union and east 
european countries this can only mean that it is opening only one 
door to them namely israels door 
the united states has a countrybycountry quota for immigrants 
with an annual global total of 270000 
until the soviet union removed many of the restrictions on 
potential emigrants the us quota never was filled its 50000 
quota for the fiscal year ending in june much higher than 
previously was filled by a backlog from last year and as many as 
400000 more are expected to apply for refugee status in the coming 
year 
in tunisia the arab leagues secretarygeneral chedli klibi 
on monday discussed jewish immigration with robert h pelletreau 
jr the us ambassador to tunis and washingtons designated 
channel for dialogue with the plo details were not revealed 
arafat and other arab leaders say settling soviet and other 
immigrants in the israelioccupied lands would make a middle east 
peace settlement more difficult if not impossible 
israel took the two territories from egypt and jordan following 
the 1967 middle east war if hundreds of thousands of jewish 
immigrants settled there the arabs fear israel would be reluctant 
to relinquish any part of the territories the plo want as a 
palestinian state in confederation with jordan 
about 70000 jews live in the west bank and gaza home to about 
17 million palestinians 
the united arab emirates newspaper albayan quoted farouk 
kaddoumi head of the plos political department as saying arab 
foreign ministers will meet feb 5 in tunisia he said their 
subject will be whether to approach soviet and east european 
officials to stop their jews from going to israel

parents who refuse to accept a 
jurys innocent verdicts in the mcmartin preschool child 
molestation trial urged prosecutors monday to keep the case alive 
parent robert currie failed as promised to produce new evidence 
during two news conferences that drew about 50 reporters to this 
beachside community that was the focal point of the nations 
longest most expensive criminal trial 
raymond buckey and his mother peggy mcmartin buckey were 
acquitted jan 18 of 52 child molestation charges in connection 
with the nowdefunct mcmartin preschool jurors deadlocked on 13 
other counts against raymond buckey 
in announcing the news conferences currie sent out notices 
stating among other things that he would display hundreds of 
police reports 
instead he appeared at the first news conference outside the 
manhattan beach police department and read a childs graphic 
descriptions of a molestation that allegedly occurred in 1985 
claims similar to those rejected by the jury during the trial 
as he stood on the street surrounded by news cameras a driver 
passing by shouted kill buckey 
asked why he had called the news conference currie said to 
show the people and to show the jury they have made a mistake 
he said he wanted to bring pressure on district attorney ira 
reiner to refile the 13 undecided molestation charges against 
raymond buckey a decision on that matter is to be announced 
wednesday 
curries child was not a complaining witness in the trial 
although he alleges the boy was molested 
at the second news conference a mother leslie floberg told 
reporters she believes her son was molested six years ago at a 
preschool at st cross episcopal church in nearby hermosa beach 
that preschool is now closed 
church officials were questioned during the mcmartin 
investigation because one of the alleged victims said he was taken 
to a church where animal sacrifices were held no charges 
however were ever filed against church officials or workers 
though three of the churchs priests have since resigned 
the churchs volunteer youth minister was arrested recently on 
sex abuse charges the youth minister has since been fired by st 
cross 
i came because the media was depicting st cross as a victim 
of the mcmartin case mrs floberg said there are things going 
on here that need to be questioned we have a moral 
responsibility

czechoslovak president vaclav 
havel on monday offered to mediate peace talks between israel and 
palestinian leaders and invited plo chief yasser arafat to visit 
prague his spokesman said 
israeli vice premier shimon peres visited prague jan 21 to 
discuss restoration of diplomatic ties broken off in the 1967 
mideast war and a future visit by foreign minister moshe arens 
last thursday havel received the plo ambassador to prague 
samil abdul fattah and spoke of czechoslovaks seeking peace in the 
middle east 
czechoslovakia could play the role of a mediator in the 
israelipalestinian dialogue should the two sides so wish 
havels spokesman michael zantovsky quoted the president as saying 
havel received the palestine liberation organizations 
ambassador to prague samil abdul fattah last week 
zantovsky said the president supported the right of the 
palestinian people to their own home while expressing 
understanding for israeli anxiety based on thousands of years of 
painful experience of the jewish nation 
after zantovsky spoke to a news conference havel himself 
appeared one reporter asked whether his latest diplomatic 
initiative was not of a messianic nature 
havel said he hoped to make up for decades of czechoslovak 
passivity in the middle east czechoslovakia was an active early 
supporter of israel but the past two decades adopted a foreign 
policy style that havel and foreign minister jiri dienstbier close 
friends and former dissidents are now activating 
if somebody makes an offer to two countries involved in years 
of tragic war to help and yet makes the impression of a messiah 
than you can call it that havel commented 
we are all responsible for the situation in the world for 
years we czechoslovakia have been doing nothing we were a mere 
passive colony he commented 
zantovsky said havel invited arafat to visit czechoslovakia but 
gave no date 
the dalai lama the tibetan spiritual leader is due to visit 
czechoslovakia feb 26 at havels personal invitation a move that 
drew strong chinese reaction 
i have explained to the chinese ambassador that the dalai 
lamas visit to czechoslovakia is of a private nature i wanted to 
invite him a long time ago when i was not yet a president havel 
said i want to meditate with him 
if the chinese republic is not satisfied with this 
explanation i am sorry the dalai lama is coming havel added

a canadian forces fighter jet that was 
to intercept a us cruise missile crashed shortly after takeoff on 
monday military officials said 
cbctv reported the singleseat cf18 plane exploded in flight 
and the pilot was killed however maj jan martinsen spokesman 
for the cold lake base said the pilots fate was unknown 
the crash occurred near inuvik northwest territories shortly 
after the plane took off at 802 am martinsen said 
the cruise flight was not affected and the cigarshaped missile 
about the length of a fullsize car landed on schedule almost four 
hours later on the primrose lake air weapons range surrounding cold 
lake 
it traveled 1365 miles from the beaufort sea over the 
mackenzie valley british columbia and alberta to primrose 
martinsen said 
she said the cause of the cf18 crash is not known thats for 
a board of inquiry to determine she added 
the canadian press identified the pilot as capt richard corver 
of toronto quoting martinsen as saying corver had flown cf18 
fighter planes for three years 
searchers at the site found no sign of the pilot near the 
fuselage which was scattered over a snowcovered area 3 miles east 
of the airport runway at inuvik in the northwest territories 
this investigation will be very difficult because its dark 
its very cold and its a very difficult area to reach said 
martinsen the only access to the area is by helicopter or 
snowmobile 
the cf18 was part of the canadian forces team participating in 
the 15th test of the cruise missile over canada the aircraft and 
other planes were to hunt down and simulate shooting the missile 
this was the first time a fighter plane had crashed in testing 
of the cruise missile 
the unarmed us cruise missile was released from a b52 bomber 
over the canadian arctic 
the test was the 15th over canadas northwest since the canadian 
and us governments signed an agreement in 1983 the cf18s were 
included in the military exercises for the first time last year 
residents of inuvik said the crash area is dotted with lakes and 
lightly wooded with spruce and pine trees temperatures in the area 
hover around 30 degrees below zero

80s and the 90s and the symbol of the regions resilience after 
a year of disasters left it rattled but not ruined 
it helped tremendously leo bigley 30 said of the 49ers 
victory the quake happened right during the football and 
baseball seasons and took the spirit out of it when the niners 
came back it wasnt hysteria but all felt a commitment to this as 
a way to show we can rebuild

president daniel ortega monday 
promised to free more than 1000 political and rebel prisoners 
before next months national elections 
tomorrow i will ask the national assembly to release all these 
prisoners ortega said 
his announcement was widely seen as a move to upstage his main 
opponent in the presidential race violeta barrios de chamorro the 
candidate of the 14party united national opposition coalition or 
uno 
she has drawn enthusiastic responses at rallies for promising to 
free all political prisoners if she wins the election viewed as a 
referendum on a decade of sandinista rule 
the permanent commission on human rights a private nicaraguan 
organization says there are currently more than 4000 political 
prisoners 
ortega announced his plans after meeting with nicaraguas 11 
roman catholic bishops and he said he was releasing the prisoners 
at the request of cardinal miguel obando y bravo the archbishop of 
managua 
we as pastors are interested in reconciliating men with god 
and reconciliating men among each other said obando y bravo a 
leading critic of ortegas leftist sandinista government we are 
happy therefore that we are advancing along these lines creating 
a climate of peace 
ortega who is seeking a second sixyear term in the feb 25 
elections also urged the ussupported contra rebels to release 
hundreds of people the government claims they have kidnapped 
i think this would be a good time for those kidnapped to be 
set free because the mothers of those abducted suffer as much as 
the mothers of those imprisoned ortega said 
he said the political and rebel prisoners he has agreed to free 
include 39 former members of the national guard of dictator 
anastasio somoza who was overthrown by the sandinistas in 1979 
and about 1000 others imprisoned on charges of being contras 
the sandinistadominated national assembly is expected to give 
rubberstamp approval to ortegas request 
last march the government released 1984 former national 
guardsmen who had been jailed since the sandinistas took power 
the government kept 39 guardsmen it considered highly 
dangerous in prison a decision that has been the source of 
repeated complaints by human rights groups and the mens families 
ortega who has lately been courting the religious community 
also said he will speak with his brother defense minister humberto 
ortega and interior minister tomas borge about allowing priests to 
hold religious services at prisons and in military barracks 
the idea is that the priests can go to the barracks and that 
the soldiers and everyone else who would like to can receive 
ministrations from the priests ortega said

israeli and east german diplomats 
began talks monday on opening diplomatic relations prevented for 
40 years by the shadow of the nazi holocaust said amos ganor the 
israeli ambassador in denmark 
neither side would say where the talks were being held in the 
danish capital or how long they would go on 
ganor said the talks touched on israels insistence that east 
germany accept part of the moral responsibility for the murder of 6 
million jews by the nazis during world war ii an issue that 
blocked building of formal relations 
but the talks are about more than just diplomatic relations 
and reparations for survivors of the holocaust ganor said 
without elaborating 
an east german spokesman reading a brief statement following 
the talks said the meeting was conducted in a businesslike 
atmosphere and would resume tuesday 
east germany was the only soviet bloc country not to establish 
ties with israel after the jewish state gained its independence in 
1948 all except romania severed the ties after the 1967 middle 
east war 
west germany accepted blame for the holocaust and paid billions 
of dollars in reparations to israel and to individual survivors 
east german prime minister hans modrow said friday that 
following the ouster of the previous communist regime his country 
was ready to discuss relations with israel and open up the issue of 
reparations 
ganor said east germanys movement toward democracy gave impetus 
to the talks 
michael shiloh headed the israeli delegation and reiner neumann 
represented east germany both are foreign ministry officials 
hungary renewed ties with israel last september the soviet 
union czechoslovakia and poland have moved recently toward 
repairing relations with israel

dictator nicolae ceausescu ordered the 
defense minister killed for opposing his order to shoot protesters 
during last months revolution a top member of the deposed 
communist government told a military tribunal monday 
emil bobus disclosure came as he former interior minister 
tudor postelnicu and manea manescu vice president of the state 
council under ceausescu pleaded guilty to charges of complicity 
to genocide 
they face up to 30 years at hard labor if convicted in the first 
of a series of trials of top ceausescu henchmen 
ceausescu told an emergency politburo meeting on dec 22 that 
defense minister vasile milea was a traitor and had committed 
suicide 
hours later he and his wife fled bucharest when the army sided 
with protesters in the popular uprising 
the ceausescus were executed christmas day after they were 
convicted at a secret military trial of genocide and ruining the 
national economy that tribunal also blamed the ceausescus for 
about about 60000 deaths during the dictators 24year rule 
recalling the final politburo meeting bobu said my intimate 
opinion is that the organization of the assassination of gen milea 
was made by the traitor ceausescu 
bobu said ceausescu earlier had threatened to put milea in 
front of a firing squad because he tried to oppose an order to 
shoot demonstrators in the western city of timisoara where the 
revolution began dec 15 
milea was extremely outraged at the order said bobu no 3 
in ceausescus government and the former secretary of the communist 
party central committee 
on saturday former politburo member ion dinca the fourth 
person on trial testified that milea told ceausescu on dec 17 
that he had reviewed military regulations and didnt find 
anywhere that the armed forces should shoot the people 
the testimony did not indicate who would have killed milea 
dinca said monday that he believed all four defendants agreed 
with ceausescus orders to shoot because they wanted to save their 
positions 
postelnicu denied he had control over the hated securitate 
secret police force which he said was personally commanded by mrs 
ceausescu and partially by ceausescu 
postelnicu speaking forcefully said ceausescu wanted to get 
rid of him and milea because the armed forces had not used tanks 
and ammunition against the timisoara demonstrators 
he said four politburo members opposed the dismissals however 
and ceausescu threatened to resign as leader of the government 
bobu and several others then insisted ceausescu stay postelnicu 
said 
asked by the tribunal president col andrei nitoiu whether 
that was a moment that could have ended ceausescus dictatorship 
postelnicu replied 
i think this could have been the unique moment in the last 20 
years in my five years as a nonvoting member of the politburo 
this was the first time that anyone contradicted him i could 
have done it but i didnt do it 
nitoiu read off the inventory of goods found at postelnicus 
home including 22 pounds of jewels 27500 in romanian currency 
extensive video equipment and 440 pounds of meat which was 
severely rationed by ceausescus government 
nitoiu said investigators found more than 444500 in romanians 
lei currency at manescus home along with gold and jewelry

fuel shortages like the one that may have 
occured before last weeks avianca crash are not routinely given 
emergency treatment unless the pilot actually declares a fuel 
emergency under federal rules for air traffic controllers 
fred farrar a spokesman for the federal aviation 
administration said monday that it is not the responsibility of 
the controllers to relay information other than the flights route 
and number unless the pilot specifically calls an emergency 
air traffic controllers have have one primary job to keep 
aircraft from getting too close farrar said its the 
captains job to fly the airplane its not the controllers job to 
make judgments for him 
however faa investigators said the regional controllers did 
relay information by telephone to the control center that handles 
approaches and departures at kennedy international airport but the 
urgency of the matter wasnt clear 
that conflicts with information provided sunday night by the 
national transportation safety board which said the regional 
controllers had not relayed word of the fuel shortage to the local 
controllers 
the regional controller said avianca 52 had just come out of the 
holding area and can only do five more minutes of hold can you 
take him now 
the local control replied slow him to 180 knots and i will 
take him 
under standards set by the faa if a pilot tells air traffic 
controllers he has minimum fuel both he and controllers know 
that no undue delay can be accepted 
but according to the faas air traffic control manual this is 
not an emergency situation but merely an advisory that indicates an 
emergency situation is possible should any undue delay occur 
a minimum fuel advisory does not imply a need for the aircraft 
to be given a traffic priority the faa rules state 
but if the pilot takes the next step and declares a fuel 
emergency the entire controller system is geared to help 
the faa manual puts it this way 
if at any time the remaining useable fuel supply suggests the 
need for traffic priority to ensure a safe landing the pilot 
should declare an emergency and report fuel remaining in minutes 
as he circled over the seaboard in holding patterns before 
crashing on long island the captain of avianca flight 52 never 
declared he had an actual fuel emergency 
the crash killed 73 people and injured 85 others 
on sunday lee dickinson of the national transportation safety 
board told a news conference in melville ny there was an 
apparent communications gap between highaltitude regional 
controllers and those handling landings 
as the plane neared the end of its final 46minute holding 
pattern south of kennedy international airport the crew told 
controllers in the regional new york center about the fuel shortage 
and requested priority clearance to land dickinson said 
shortly afterward the regional controllers turned the aircraft 
over to the local controllers but after interviewing six local 
controllers who either handled or tracked the flight investigators 
determined they were unaware of the shortage dickinson said 
r steve bell president of the national air traffic controllers 
association aflcio called the safety boards assrtions highly 
misleading and premature 
the avianca pilot never declared a fuel emergency he said 
no one knew how perilous was his situation until it was far 
too late bell said the air traffic controllers would have 
moved heaven and earth to make for a safe approach for the crippled 
aircraft but the pilot never sent out the key words that he was in 
mortal danger

erich honecker who ruled east germany for 18 
years until his downfall in october was arrested immediately after 
his release from a hospital monday and will be tried for treason 
the national prosecutor said 
plans to put the former communist party chief and three members 
of his politburo on trial in march were announced by prosecutor 
hansjuergen joseph at a session of parliament where premier hans 
modrow offered a grim account of the state of the nation 
the swift action against honecker 77 indicates the strength of 
a nationwide backlash against corruption in his stalinist regime 
economic problems and widespread unrest have forced modrow the 
embattled communist premier to move the countrys first free 
elections up from may to march 18 and bring the opposition into a 
coalition that will govern until then 
in washington state department richard boucher said they 
seem to have accelerated the schedule in order to move quickly to a 
more stable more longterm regime thats based on the popular 
will thats something that we support

fragile modrow said economic and social tensions have 
increased the economic sitution is deteriorating in a worrying 
way 
strikes work slowdowns and the flight to the west of up to 
2500 people a day have worsened the already stagnant economy and 
demands for higher wages and benefits are threatening the 
existence of east germany he declared 
these failures have had a chain reaction of consequences for 
many other facilities and for provision and care of the

report on the ecology

volume of pollutants emitted in west germany which has its own 
smog problems 
more than 44 percent of the forests are dead or dying and at 
least 10 percent of the people drink water that does not meet 
public health standards he said 
sulfur dioxide emissions are nearly nine times higher those in 
west germany and considerably worse than in czechoslovakia and 
poland which along with east germany are the most polluted nations 
in europe diederich said 
the minister said he would press the government to give the 
environment equal rank with economic performance

pope john paul ii on monday 
exhorted developed nations to help poor african countries by 
treating them as equals and sharing the resources and knowledge 
needed to escape poverty 
how would history judge a generation that having all the 
means to feed the earths population refused to do so in 
fratricidal indifference the pope asked in what the vatican 
described as the major speech of his fivecountry african trip 
this subsaharan country whose name means land of the upright 
men symbolizes the chronic problems of drought hunger disease 
and expanding deserts that afflict much of the continent the 
average per capita income in burkina faso is about 200 a year 
i must point out the gravity of the ills that wound the 
peoples of africa so much the pope said in a speech at the 
headquarters of the west african economic community 
if we want to help africa overcome its handicaps a public 
awakening is needed more than ever he said 
the pope spoke at a ceremony marking the 10th anniversary of an 
appeal he made on behalf of the subsahara region or sahel during 
his first visit to ouagadougou 
that appeal led to the creation in 1984 of the john paul ii 
foundation for the sahel funded primarily by west german 
catholics the organization has invested more than 3 billion to 
combat desertification and finance health agriculture and other 
development projects 
but the sahel and all of africa still needs help john paul 
said 
once again i must launch a solemn appeal to humanity in the 
name of humanity itself in the name of justice i beg my 
brothers and sisters in humanity not to scorn the starving of this 
continent not to deny them the universal right to human dignity 
and the security of life he said 
the world must know that africa suffers deep poverty he 
said speaking in french available resources are declining the 
earth is becoming sterile over immense areas malnutrition is 
chronic for 10 of millions of humans death claims too many 
children can not such destitution be considered a wound in the 
side of all of humanity 
john paul said developed nations must view poor nations as 
partners and share scientific knowledge to help promote progress 
they should not see the poorest countries only as clients or 
more or less solvent debtors he said this attitude conscious 
or not has led to too many dead ends 
he also emphasized the responsibility of public officials in the 
needy natons 
it is the moral quality of the people which must be respected 
and all forms of intolerance corruption resentment and debasement 
must be abolished he said 
earlier the pope told roman catholics to build a society in 
burkina faso based on respect of the human person and the 
family 
human life is inviolable he said at mass at a national 
pilgrimage site outside the capital the right to life should be 
defended ceaselessly from conception to natural death 
john paul said couples must resist invasion of methods which 
go against the dignity of the woman and dont honor man 
the local church has resisted the governments birth control 
programs and there is similar opposition from moslems a survey 
last year found only 4 percent to 6 percent of women using modern 
birth control methods 
the birthrate in this country of 85 million people is 29 
percent one of the highest in the world catholics make up about 9 
percent of the population 
international aid agencies including the world bank and 
african governments themselves have identified population growth 
as a key factor in the poverty that afflicts the sahel 
the popes african tour began jan 25 he returns to rome on 
thursday after a stop in chad the pope has also visited cape 
verde guinea bissau and mali

in moscow soviet foreign ministry spokesman vadim perfiliev 
said of the proposed 2 percent cut in the us defense budget 
both the us and the ussr have agreed the cold war is over 
any vestige of that should be relegated to history

mastrobuoni declared the announcement is a sign of the times 
the news expresses the new reality of the climate of 
cooperation between east and west 
british prime minister margaret thatcher a firm opponent of any 
significant disarmament by the west despite the crumbling of 
communist governments in the east bloc had no objections said 
a spokeswoman at her 10 downing st office 
weve discussed the proposals with the united states we have 
no objections the spokeswoman said she spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the greek parliament was due to vote monday on a sixmonth 
extension of the 1983 agreement covering us bases but postponed 
the vote for two days 
instead defense minister tzannis tzannetakis announced two of 
the four major military installations in greece are to go 
hellinikon base outside athens used by reconnaissance aircraft 
that shadow the soviet fleet in the mediterranean and nea makri a 
us naval communications base 22 miles from the capital 
the bases are among 14 us foreign military installations and 
more than 60 in the united states that defense secretary dick 
cheney announced he wants to close or realign to save money 
community leaders and business people in several areas near 
bases expressed concern at what will amount to losses of millions 
of dollars annually 
besides greenham common two other of the 66 us military 
installations in britain were being closed fairford a base for 
18 kc135 airtoair refuelling tankers in southcentral england

in addition the british defense ministry said a squadron of 
american f16 fighters based at bentwaters in eastern england was 
to be disbanded

lt col sam giammo director of public affairs for the 3rd us 
air force based at mildenhall in the eastern england county of 
norfolk 
jean hutchison 54 a longtime member of a ramshackle camp on

its stunning news this has been an amazing thing to live 
through 
missiles are being removed from greenham comiso and other us 
cruise and pershing ii nuclear missile bases under the 1987 
agreement between the superpowers to eliminate their mediumrange 
nuclear missiles 
giammo said greenham common and fairford will be put on a 
standby basis he said the united states will maintain a small 
presence at each site in case it needed to reactivate the base the 
last cruise missiles are to be removed from greenham common next 
year wethersfield will be handed back to britains royal air force 
about 3000 american personnel will be withdrawn from britain

monday he added 
us officials in seoul quickly reassured south koreans tuesday 
that closure of three us air bases in taegu kwangju and suwon 
and cutback of 2000 personnel would not affect americas 
commitment to maintain peace on the divided korean peninsula that 
it shares with north korea 
these changes are in response to budgetary realities and do 
not signal a lessening in the united states commitment to the 
republic of korea said a statement issued by brig gen jimmy l 
cash vice commander of the 7th us air force based in south 
korea 
newspapers there made cheneys announcement a banner story 
tuesday and korean broadcasting quoted the south korean defense

three children were wounded monday when 
the car carrying them to school was struck by sniper fire as 
christians and moslems battled across beiruts dividing green line 
police said 
in southern lebanon security sources said norwegians serving as 
un peacekeepers went on alert following threats by militiamen of 
the israelibacked south lebanon army to kill all the norwegians 
in the area 
police in beirut said the children two brothers ages 3 and 10 
and a 4yearold boy were shot in the predominantly shiite moslem 
suburb of rweiss in south beirut 
all were taken to a nearby hospital for treatment 
the fighting erupted sunday along the threemile demarcation 
line that splits beirut into moslem and christian sectors 
the thud of exploding shells echoed across the capital through 
the night as christian army units and syrianbacked moslem 
militiamen battled with tanks and artillery but the fighting died 
down monday morning 
mondays victims raised the casualty toll from green line 
fighting this year to four killed and 15 wounded 
the hostilities violated a sept 22 ceasefire brokered by the 
arab league that halted six months of murderous artillery battles 
between troops commanded by maverick christian leader gen michel 
aoun and the syrian army 
more than 900 people were killed and nearly 3000 wounded in 
that round of fighting in lebanons 14yearold civil war 
meanwhile a security source in the town of tyre said four 
members of the south lebanon army told norwegian soldiers manning a 
checkpoint in the village of ibl elsaqi we shall kill all the 
norwegians in this area 
the source who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
680man norwegian battalion went on alert and sent reinforcements 
to the checkpoint which is inside the zone israel controls 
the norwegians are part of the united nations interim force in 
lebanon which refused to comment on the incident 
according to un records 167 peacekeepers have been killed 18 
of them norwegians since the observers deployed in south lebanon 
in march 1978 about 70 percent were killed in action the rest in 
traffic accidents and similar incidents 
there has been frequent tension between the un peacekeepers 
and the south lebanon army since israel retained the border zone in 
1985 when it withdrew the bulk of its army three years after 
invading lebanon 
the 5800strong un force drawn from nine nations mans a 
narrow buffer separating the zone from predominantly shiite moslem 
areas 
the norwegian battalions area of operations overlaps with some 
sections of the sixto10 mile border zone controlled by 1500 
israeli troops and the south lebanon army the force is mostly 
christian militia of 3500 men who are armed trained and funded by 
israel 
also in southern lebanon police said a ceasefire was holding 
between rival shiite moslem factions that have been fighting for 
the last month 
the truce between the syrianbacked amal militia and the 
proiranian hezbollah or party of god was called sunday by 
algerian mediator mohammed taher 
by police count 98 people have been killed and 286 wounded in 
the battles between the two groups 
they have been fighting intermittently since may 1987 for 
control of lebanons 12 million shiites the countrys largest

the pentagons proposal monday to shut down or trim dozens of 
us military installations has government and business officials 
in affected cities worried about their economies and promising a 
fight especially in california 
ten california bases with about 35000 soldiers and 22000 
civilian workers are among the more than 72 installations 
recommended for closure or reduction by defense secretary dick 
cheney who also proposed ending operations at 12 military 
facilities overseas to save money 
government officials in the san francisco bay area where 
several facilities would be affected expressed dismay over the 
recommendation that came as part of cheneys 2921 billion 
spending plan for fiscal 1991 
this is really a terrible thing to hear and were not going to 
lay back and let it happen were going to fight like the dickens 
to keep this base open said alameda calif mayor chuck corica 
referring to the alameda naval air station that cheney targeted as 
a candidate for closure 
coricas city of 77000 people just across the bay from san 
francisco is home to 8300 soldiers and 5100 civilians employed at 
the air station which has an annual payroll of 340 million 
theyve been here for more than 50 years corica said of the 
navy we consider them part of our family 
corica said he will join with members of californias 
congressional delegation other mayors in alameda county 
businesses and the facilitys civilian workers to urge congress to 
keep open the air station which is the home port of the nuclear 
aircraft carrier carl vinson and three guidedmissile cruisers 
also on the list of candidates for closure is the long beach 
naval shipyard in southern california 
naturally we oppose it naturally well do whatever we can 
to make sure that it doesnt become reality said long beach 
assistant city manager john shirey 
the shipyard is one of the port citys largest employers and 
closing it could take up to 100 million a year out of the local 
economy said bob creighton president of the long beach area 
chamber of commerce 
the closing of the shipyard would have a ripple effect not 
only with the companies and industries doing business with the 
shipyard but also with businesses throughout the city he said 
the shipyard employs 4700 civilians and 300 military personnel 
the largest possible california candidate for closure is the 
armys fort ord near monterey home of the armys 7th light 
infantry division which played a key role in the recent us 
invasion of panama 
the base about 120 miles south of san francisco has 15000 
soldiers and 3000 civilian employees with an annual payroll of 
732 million and an estimated impact on the local economy of more 
than 885 million a year 
two california installations on the list for study are in 
oakland the naval supply center which provides support for the 
us pacific fleet employs 61 servicemen and 1700 civilians with 
a 42 million payroll and the oakland naval hospital which has 
1600 military and civilian workers with a payroll of 66 million 
oakland city manager henry gardner estimated that 2000 of the 
citys 360000 residents were employed at the two installations 
pledges to fight the pentagon recommendations which must be 
approved by congress also came over bases targeted elsewhere in 
the united states including pennsylvania and alabama 
pennsylvanias two us senators republicans arlen specter and 
john heinz talked with reporters monday outside the philadelphia 
naval shipyard which cheney recommended for closure 
it wont happen specter said 
the shipyard employs about 8600 people 
in alabama cheney proposed closing the armys fort mcclellan in 
anniston the base employs 2700 military personnel and 1500 
civilians 
alabamas two us senators democrats howell heflin and richard 
shelby and us rep glen browder a democrat who represents the 
fort mcclellan area held a news conference in oxford to assure 
several hundred community leaders that they would fight the 
proposed closing 
if they are looking for a political fight theyve come to the 
right place were ready browder said

both turkish and moslem greece recognizes only their religious

president bush on monday sent congress a 123 
trillion budget for fiscal 1991 that keeps new spending below 
inflation and recognizes remarkable changes in the world by 
scaling back defense and rewarding emerging democracies 
bush called the spending plan an investment in the future 
but democrats in congress pounced on it as not bold enough on 
defense cuts and too harsh on social programs they also disputed 
the presidents contention that his budget would halve the deficit 
to 631 billion saying its economic assumptions were too 
optimistic 
this is a taketwoaspirin and callmeinthemorning 
budget said rep leon panetta dcalif chairman of the house 
budget committee which opens hearings on the new budget on tuesday 
fights loomed with the democraticcontrolled congress on a range 
of fronts bushs desire to cut medicare and capital gains taxes 
to close military bases he considers outmoded and on the other 
hand to preserve some expensive weapons 
bush would increase spending on space education the 
environment and the war on drugs losers this year are medicare 
college student loans farm subsidies energy conservation and mass 
transit 
the presidents budget for the fiscal year that begins oct 1 
calls for 365 billion in spending cuts and other 
deficitreduction measures 
it projects a 7 percent increase in revenues to 117 trillion 
without a general tax increase and just a 3 percent boost in 
overall spending more than a percentage point below the current 
rate of inflation 
bush proposed defense spending of 2921 billion a cut of 2 
percent measured against inflation while boosting foreign aid to 
eastern europe the philippines and latin america 
on the domestic front his budget would leave in place the 
social security tax increase that took effect earlier this month 
but it honors bushs 1988 campaign pledge to propose no general tax 
increase 
still the budget recommends 156 billion in lesser tax 
increases and a 56 billion increase in user and service fees 
most of them recycled from reagan budgets and previously defeated 
in congress 
the budget calls for family savings accounts under which 
families could bank up to 5000 a year and pay no tax on interest 
on deposits held for seven or more years 
with an eye toward future growth and expansion of the human 
frontier the budgets chief emphasis is on investment in the 
future bush said in a brief message to congress accompanying the 
1569page document 
but sen james sasser dtenn called it a document of low 
aspirations it predicts huge fiscal problems ahead and then 
goes on to propose no change in course 
and house majority leader richard gephardt dmo said i 
think its a standpat budget but he said lawmakers would take 
it very seriously rather than pronouncing it dead on arrival 
as democrats had done with several reagan budgets 
bushs budget director richard g darman opened the annual 
budget battle by proposing a truce we fully expect to negotiate 
with congress over priorities he told a briefing 
but sen pete v domenici rnm senior republican on the 
senate budget committee said that getting a budget agreement this 
year would be tough its not childs play he said 
and house minority leader bob michel rill said obviously 
the democratic majority has a little bit different idea of where 
the priorities ought to behopefully well just get it done on 
time 
bushs budget asserted it was meeting the 64 billion deficit 
target for fiscal 1991 under the grammrudman budget balancing 
law with specific and defensible measures and without 
gimmicks 
however critics claimed the administrations prescription for 
getting the budget deficit down to 631 billion from a projected 
1238 billion this year does rely on accounting gimmicks 
they continue to jimmy the figures said sen ernest f 
hollings dsc its another fraud 
for one thing bushs budget uses an optimistic set of economic 
projections that assume both declining interest rates and falling 
inflation the budget also calls for overall growth this year of 
24 percent this year compared to the 17 percent forecast by 
private forecasters and the congressional budget office 
the governments most recent figures showed economic growth 
slowed to an annual rate of 05 percent during the last three 
months of 1989 
obviously the slowdown in the fourth quarter makes everybody 
nervous treasury secretary nicholas brady conceded 
bush recycled many proposals which did not reach enactment in 
1989 a tightening of the clean air act a reduction in the 
capital gains tax rate a 3000 tax credit for adoptions tax 
breaks for child care and more money for fighting crime and drugs 
the most dramatic element of the budget was the scaleback in 
defense 
propelled by relaxed eastwest tensions the pentagon budget 
calls for a reduction of 38000 troops and closing dozens of 
military bases it was the most restrained defense budget from the 
white house in more than a decade 
remarkable changes have occurred during the past year the 
berlin wall has been opened and democratic forces are on the move 
in eastern europe bush said as a result savings in the 
defense budget are now possible 
bush said defense and international policy must take advantage 
of the opportunities provided by these changes 
however claiming soviet military capability will remain 
formidable even after announced reductions bush said he was 
proposing a military budget that would allow the nation to hedge 
against an uncertain future 
his plan calls for five costly new b2 stealth bombers another 
1 billion trident submarine and funds for two controversial 
intercontinental nuclear missile systems he also called for an 
additional 900 million for the strategic defense initiative known 
as star wars 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash said defense spending 
will be a crucial battleground and predicted congress would make 
larger reducitons that bush proposed 
the presidents budget calls for a 3 billion increase in 
outlays for foreign aid to 142 billion it calls for 300 
million in special assistance for those countries in eastern 
europe that are moving toward democracy and another 200 million 
for the philippines 
it also requests 270 million in outlays for the andean 
countries of colombia peru and bolivia to help stem the 
international flow of drugs 
the administration renewed its call for a lower capital gains 
tax proposing that 30 percent of assets held for more than three 
years be exempt the measure was similar to one blocked in the 
senate last year that would have lowered the effective rate of the 
tax to 196 percent 
currently capital gains are taxed at the same rate as other 
income 15 percent 28 percent or 33 percent 
the administration did not embrace a proposal by sen daniel 
moynihan dny to provide a 62 billion cut in social security 
taxes this year and next however it proposed that after 1993 
when the budget is supposed to be balanced under grammrudman any 
social security surpluses be used to pay off the national debt 
as in past budgets the social security surplus masked the size 
of the deficit the 1991 deficit would be 70 billion higher 
without this surplus 
the various domestic cuts totalled 139 billion with 55 
billion coming from trims in doctor and hospitals payments under 
medicare 
other major program cuts included 18 billion in farm price 
supports and crop insurance and savings of 29 billion by limiting 
pension increases to federal civilian retirees and by restraining 
cost of living increases to civilian and military government 
workers lowincome energy assistance would be trimmed by 340 
million to less than 11 billion

an attorney for manuel noriega said monday he hopes 
to get a ruling this week on a request that the ousted panamanian 
dictator be declared a prisoner of war and moved to a neutral 
country 
us district judge william m hoeveler scheduled a status 
conference for thursday on the drug trafficking case against the 
dictator overthrown during the us invasion of panama last month 
hoeveler also heard arguments on requests that two codefendants 
be released on bond but delayed until thursday a decision on lt 
col luis del cid 46 and daniel miranda 36 
noriegas attorneys stunned a packed federal courtroom friday by 
asking that their client be declared a pow and moved to a neutral 
third country because he was captured during an armed invasion 
noriega was moved sunday night from a special holding cell in 
the federal courthouse in miami to a federal prison about 20 miles 
south of the city on sunday night the federal metropolitican 
correctional center is a mediumsecurity facility but contains 
some maximumsecurity cells 
noriega who wore civilian clothing as he was taken to the 
prison reportedly will be kept separate from other prisoners said 
jim jones a regional spokesman for the us bureau of prisons 
defense attorney steven kollin on monday reiterated that the 
federal metropolitan correctional center is not the proper place 
for a prisoner of war 
the defenses legal argument has been given little chance of 
success because courts have consistently upheld the governments 
right to prosecute foreign defendants no matter how they were 
brought to the jurisdiction 
but kollin said hes not concerned about critics of the defense 
strategy were not worrying about what other lawyers say our 
concern is with the judge he said 
kollin said he expects noriega will be in the courtroom thursday 
for a discussion of pending motions and the setting of a more 
realistic trial date 
hoeveler earlier this month set a trial date of march 5 but 
said at the time he didnt expect that date to hold up 
kollin said he expects a ruling on several defense motions 
were hopeful well get a ruling from the judge on our motion 
that general noriega will have status of prisoner of war he 
added

the san francisco 49ers fresh from their 
5510 super bowl slaughter of the denver broncos made a triumphant 
return monday in a huge victory parade through the heart of an 
adoring city 
cheers of go niners were drowned out by the blaring of 
thousands of red plastic horns as 75000 fans paid tribute to 
quarterback joe montana coach george seifert team owner eddie 
debartolo and other players riding in flashy convertibles 
office workers leaned out of windows to watch and some sent 
showers of paper down on the parade which began near the 
waterfront and continued for about a mile along market street 
fans many sporting the team colors of red and gold arrived up 
to two hours early to claim spots in front or perches on lamp posts 
or newspaper racks 
theres no team in the nfl that can beat us said wayne 
rayburn of sausalito wearing a pair of 49ers boxer shorts over his 
jeans to complement his official national footbal league team 
jacket 
if i wore them under my jeans you wouldnt be able to see 
them he said 
rayburn crouching on a concrete garbage can vowed to claim the 
same spot and wear the same shorts again at next years super bowl 
victory parade like other fans he predicted the 49ers would win 
an unprecedented third consecutive nfl championship 
threepeat next year he said 
the parade followed the 49ers easy win sunday over the broncos 
in new orleans it was san franciscos fourth super bowl victory in 
nine years and the second in a row 
the 5510 score was the largest margin in 24 super bowls but 
some fans who expected an easy niners victory regretted the score 
wasnt even more lopsided 
i wish we could have had at least 75 points rayburn said 
domonic johnson of walnut creek begrudged denver anything on the 
scoreboard 
i predicted the game at 550 but they did score those 
points johnson said while waiting for the parade i guess it 
did keep it from getting too boring for some people 
fans waved banners clutched red and gold balloons and held 
small children high for a clear view of the parade led by 
debartolo mayor art agnos and seifert who displayed the gold 
super bowl trophy to the roaring crowd 
they were followed by montana who passed for five touchdowns 
and earned his third super bowl most valuable player award the 
quarterback and his wife jennifer waved as they rode with their 
three small children in the back of a red convertible

new government figures have confirmed what soviet 
shoppers already know most industries in 1989 failed miserably at 
fulfilling president mikhail s gorbachevs promise of more 
consumer goods 
a diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity said what little 
increase there was in consumer goods could be attributed to 
inflation a greater emphasis on producing alcohol and imports 
from the west 
wheat farmers had a good year but they were about the only ones 
in agriculture according to statistics printed in most newspapers 
this weekend after an investment of 110 billion in agriculture in 
1989 food production rose just 1 percent not the 66 percent 
expected 
most of that small increase came in grain sugarbeets and 
potatoes soviet consumers will find the increase in the last 
category hard to comprehend since the normally ubiquitous potatoes 
are hard to find and are several times more expensive on the 
farmers markets this winter

julie brown wants you to know that her 
character on mtvs just say julie is to put it simply sort of 
crazy 
if youve seen her ditsy cartoon of an emptyheaded valley girl 
you might agree its a persona shes honed with albums like 
goddess in progress and such songs and videos as homecoming 
queens got a gun i like em big and stupid and trapped in 
the body of a white girl 
she cowrote the movie earth girls are easy in which she 
also had a starring role from one of her songs 
browns weekly halfhour show is a tongueincheek way of 
introducing rock videos its set in her tacky condo where friends 
and relatives occasionally drop by 
i make fun of the videos brown said some of them are 
pretty lame after all if its rock n roll it should be a 
little rebellious poking fun at them is in the spirit of rock n 
roll mtv never told me to do that they just said heres the 
show 
you know when television first started ernie kovacs did a 
lot of experimental comedy she said that was before the 
networks started research to see if their shows would appeal to 
people i think research is killing a lot of good shows before they 
ever get on the air it destroys innovation and originality 
brown speaks from experience her pilot julie brown the 
show was broadcast by cbs last summer 
i got amazing reviews she said but the research wasnt 
good enough to get it on the air then they came up with something 
called peaceable kingdom no wonder the networks are losing their 
audience to cable because cables still willing to experiment 
peaceable kingdom was an undistinguished drama on cbs fall 
schedule that died a quick and merciful death 
brown is in her second season on mtv of the cable music 
networks three female video jockeys two are named julie brown 
the other is better known as downtown julie brown 
dont think for a moment that brown is like her character she 
did grow up in the san fernando valley the valley girls natural 
habitat but she studied acting at the prestigious american 
conservatory theatre in san francisco shes been a standup comic 
and she writes her own offbeat songs 
she and her regular writing partner charlie coffey they wrote 
the earth girls are easy screenplay with terence e mcnally 
have several more movies in development medusa portrait of a 
pop legend in which brown would play a pop music superstar and 
totally witchin a musical about a woman possessed by a 
witchs spirit 
brown began doing a standup comedy act with coffey while 
attending act in san francisco 
most female comics were taking sexuality out of their acts 
she said i thought that was a shame marilyn monroe could be 
sexy and funny at the same time when i started 11 years ago a lot 
of women were doing selfdeprecating humor i cant get a date 
i wasnt going to do that i thought i was attractive 
charlie and i were very successful in san francisco but 
people in los angeles didnt understand our humor she said 
charlie left the act and i was doing a single its tough because 
you have to be aggressive with the audience then i began singing 
and once i did that it became a whole new thing 
brown appeared in such movies as any which way you can and 
police academy 2 and was a guest on such shows as the 
jeffersons happy days laverne and shirley and 
newhart where she appeared several times as airhead weather 
girl buffy denver 
before starting her halfhour show on mtv she had made several 
guest appearances as a video jockey in her early appearances she 
came on and said she was downtown julie brown who is black at 
the time she was promoting her album trapped in a white girls 
body 
when mtv offered her a show she said she didnt want to move 
to new york 
im an actress and i felt that would take me out of acting 
she said we reached a solution and i do the show here as long 
as i show three videos on each show i can do anything i want i 
can break into a video and say stop i have something to say

the making of jonathan marc shermans women 
and wallace premiering tonight on public tvs american 
playhouse was unique says david m davis executive director of 
the pbs series 
it was explains david m davis executive director of the 
pbs series the only time we had to schedule a production when 
there was a school break at bennington 
the reason sherman all of 19 when his comedy first was 
produced at offbroadways young playwrights festival was a 
student at the small vermont college when davis production of the 
play for tv was being planned 
but things were sorted out shermans tv adaption was taped 
directed by don scardino its stage director 
because of all this author sherman now a grizzled senior of 
21 will go forth with two notable artistic credits when he 
graduates in june 
sherman seems to take all this in stride but then he did time 
in show business when younger he acted in plays one at the 
american jewish theater here and did one nbc childrens special 
and some commercials he says 
still he is supposed to be of the mtv generation only video 
spoken there why write plays 
sherman blames it on his early exposure to theater i think 
doing that really influenced by interest in writing plays all my 
thoughts came to be as stageplay ideas rather than as video 
ideas the stage really helped that 
his women and wallace the dark kind of comedy is about a 
young man whose mother died when he was 6 it concerns the 
characters efforts over a 12year period to relate to women and 
stop using humor as a defense in his dealings with them 
as is the case of many plays and novels this play is partly 
autobiographical says sherman who lives in livingston nj 
but it has a sadder reallife basis than most 
his mother he says committed suicide when he was 6 twelve 
years later having begun writing with one play given a staged 
reading at the young playwrights festival he started work on 
women and wallace 
i did it mostly to deal with my thoughts about my mom and to 
try to deal with it in a realistic way not try to make it a 
movieoftheweek treatment of suicide he says i tried to 
really get down to the stuff i went through 
he submitted it to the festival which has an age limit of 19 
for all applicants and was begun in 1981 by broadway composer 
stephen sondheim 
out of 600 submissions it was one of four chosen for 
production the reviews for the rookie were good sherman 
goodnaturedly professes not to know why the critics were kind 
maybe it was a good day for them or something 
delegates from american playhouse it produces for film 
public tv and theater came saw and bought it was the first 
young playwrights festival play the company ever has purchased 
davis says 
we thought it was outstanding we were very very impressed 
with it and we made the deal its as simple as that 
after bennington says sherman a theater major he may go to 
graduate school or continue acting and writing he has two new 
plays in mind and another he says will get a workshop tryout at the 
los angeles theatre center 
he also plans to give screenwriting a try but doubts he ever 
will call hollywood home i dont know about moving there he 
says amused at the idea i dont know about being attached to my 
car that much

overweight a cartonaday smoker arianna stassinopoulos 
huffington portrays pablo picasso as a manipulative abusive genius 
who ground a cigarette into a lovers cheek 
biographies that paint lessthanglorious portraits of cultural 
figures are not new robert frost and sinclair lewis come off 
poorly in the definitive biographies by lawrence thompson and mark 
shorer 
and there have always been those who dismissed the biographer as 
lowlife biography like biggame hunting is one of the 
recognized forms of sport and it is as unfair as only sport can 
be wrote philip guedalla in 1920 
but recent biographies have been more graphic less decorous 
less respectful of their subjects why 
this country is publicity mad this is all part of the 
information revolution of our time says critic alfred kazin 
there is a preoccupation with gossip and with personal quirks 
he says and there is an academic mania for the collection of 
personal papers if you publish one novel in america the 
university of southwestern idaho wants your files and love 
letters he said 
we live in an era in which there is remarkable license says 
albert goldman author of biographies of elvis presley and john 
lennon 
goldman himself has been accused of excessive intrusions into 
his subjects personal lives and of being inaccurate 
friends and admirers rushed to debunk goldmans depictions of 
presley as a drugaddicted recluse with limited talents and of 
lennon as a volatile debauched drug user who had a homosexual 
affair with manager brian epstein 
goldman says however there is a growing understanding among 
biographers that drugs and alcohol profoundly affect a persons 
life and psychoanalysis has made it clear that sexual matters are 
allimportant 
but what is gained from these kinds of revelations about 
artists some biographers say it helps explain the artists work 
others say they set out to create a complete account of a life and 
these things can hardly be ignored 
goldman says his subjects are more than artists and require 
more than a lowkeyed critical biography john lennon was 
ultimately far more than an artist he was a saint and a martyr 
elvis presley was a myth 
some disclosures have fueled debates within the academic 
community disclosures that philosopher martin heidegger was a 
member of the nazi party and that paul de man founder of the 
school of literary criticism known as deconstruction wrote 
antisemitic articles in belgium in the early 1940s do their 
transgressions invalidate or explain their theories 
a wider debate involves joseph campbell the mythologist who 
gained national fame when his conversations with bill moyers were 
broadcast posthumously by the public broadcasting service 
campbells credo that you should follow your bliss ignore 
convention to find ways to be happy drew converts his books 
became best sellers 
but brendan gill longtime new yorker magazine editor and 
critic complained in the new york review of books that not only 
were campbells philosophies vague and imprecise but he had 
privately made antisemitic remarks after man landed on the moon 
campbell allegedly told a student that the moon would be a good 
place to put the jews

since september when gills article was published the war has 
raged between those who believe him and those who say campbell was 
innocent gill is unyielding when he became a conspicuous public 
figure and got a response of millions of people then i had to take 
up arms against him 
it is not clear that his efforts to alter campbells reputation 
have had much effect theres still an extraordinary interest in 
his point of view sales have been excellent on the campbell book 
the power of myth for the past four months said stuart 
applebaum a spokesman for bantam books 
campbell of course is not around to defend himself he has 
been dead more than two years most biographers do not have living 
subjects to contend with and the dead cannot be libeled 
but when ian hamilton attempted to write a biography of jd 
salinger he found that the reclusive writer was very much alive 
and willing to fight back 
salinger took hamilton to court to prevent him from quoting from 
his private letters which he had copyrighted salinger won and 
hamilton was reduced to writing a book about how he tried to write 
a salinger biography 
surviving relatives of cultural figures can be divided into 
three camps 
some cooperate with biographers some have become biographers 
themselves when novelist and short story writer john cheever died 
his daughter susan disclosed his alcoholism and homosexuality in 
a memoir home before dark 
i did it out of anguish and love she said 
cheevers son ben published his fathers letters including 
sexually explicit love letters to men and women and is preparing a 
volume of his fathers journals 
but other survivors are reticent and some are angry stephen 
joyce grandson of james and nora joyce was angered by brenda 
maddoxs use of a sexually explicit correspondence between the 
joyces in her book nora the real life of molly bloom 
stephen joyce destroyed letters he had received from his aunt 
lucia james joyces daughter who spent time in a mental 
institution and letters from playwright samuel beckett to lucia 
beckett had requested that his letters be destroyed the rest were 
destroyed to guard his aunts privacy 
i firmly believe that there is a part of every man or womans 
life no matter how famous he or she may be that should remain 
private stephen joyce wrote in a letter to the new york times 
furthermore i believe that the joyce familys privacy has been 
invaded more than that of any other writer in this century enough 
is enough even too much 
writing in the times janna malamud smith daughter of novelist 
and short story writer bernard malamud said her family might burn 
her fathers papers 
biographers she said can extract a high and often hidden 
price in exchange for satisfying our curiosity too often readers 
end up with theories about hemingways identity confusion or 
alcohol abuse but lose their pleasure in his fiction some mystery 
about the writer helps maintain the work i remember how much my 
father enjoyed knowing little about shakespeares life relishing 
the untethered quality that absence conferred upon his plays 
but goldman says biography should not affect how we look at art 
a biographer is concerned with the man a critic is concerned 
with the art nor will americans be culturally bereft if they 
find their idols have feet of clay says kazin if we had any 
culture in america it would be harder 
mencken did not destroy his diaries he placed them in the enoch 
pratt free library in baltimore to be sealed for 25 years after 
his death and then to be opened to students engaged in critical 
or historical investigation he did not mention publication the 
trustees debated the issue before going ahead 
the book is mostly a list of menckens daily doings mixed with 
a few observations about people and events and the complaints of a 
notorious hypochondriac just a few words are objectionable 
kikes and shrewd jew and linthead among them 
the editor charles a fecher says the diaries prove mencken 
was an antisemite and felt that blacks were inferiors the 
revelations led the national press club to consider renaming the 
mencken memorial library and induced the winner of an award named 
after mencken to refuse the honor 
but new york times columnist russell baker who knew mencken 
from his early days at the sun in baltimore noted that there is no 
evidence that mencken ever acted in a bigoted way the diary 
entries were night faults baker said 
others argue that the offensive jottings were more reflective of 
menckens times an era when words like kikes and hunkies 
and wops were the stuff of conversation than of mencken 
himself 
what would mencken have said should a mans private musings 
affect the way his public accomplishments are regarded the 
public demands certainties it must be told definitely and a 
bit raucously that this is true and that is false but there are no 
certainties he once wrote 
but he also wrote nothing can come out of an artist that is 
not in the man

now that theyve won their freedom what does 
the future hold for the people of eastern europe hard times are 
ahead it seems to make economic reforms work in the new 
democracies will require a lot of personal sacrifice and massive 
infusion of aid from the west 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in eastern europe ideology has 
once again come facetoface with hard reality making a revolution 
is often easier than fulfilling its goals 
after overthrowing four decades of rigid communist rule the 
people of eastern europe are facing enormous problems the outlook 
is grim 
the years of centrally planned systems and communist 
mismanagement have left east european economies in such ruins that 
a lot of help from the west and plenty of sacrifices of their own 
will be necessary before the countries can stand on their own feet 
it will take years during the adjustment to a freemarket 
system the governments will have to deal with unemployment 
bankruptcies inflation huge debts and other problems even an 
atrophied work ethic 
poland owes 40 billion to western creditors hungary and 
yugoslavia about 20 billion each yugoslavias inflation rate is 
more than 1500 percent annually 
solidarity leader lech walesa acknowledges that the 
shocktherapy plan to tame inflation and transform poland into a 
freemarket economy is painful and needs massive infusion of 
western aid 
we are like a car with four wheels running in different 
directions moving fast but slipping backward nothing can be done 
from inside the car walesa recently told an associated press 
reporter in gdansk 
he said foreign aid already promised is insufficient 
it is too slow and too little this is why i see this reform 
plan as blacker and blacker we cannot reform our old system 
within our own means this is impossible without outside help 
poland was the forerunner in the democratic transformation when 
it became the first eastern european country to establish a 
noncommunist government in 1990 leaders of other nations will be 
watching poland to evaluate the progress of its economic recovery 
the plan which went into effect on jan 1 decontrolled prices 
foreign exchange and centrally allocated industrial quotas it is 
based on a restrictive budget policy designed to bring down 
inflation within six months and is coupled with a tight wage policy 
it is the most radical daring economic reform program ever 
attempted in eastern europe 
the course of our reforms is giving stimulation to the changes 
in other countries of the region the failure of the efforts could 
make more difficult the evolution occurring in central and eastern 
europe polish premier tadeusz mazowiecki told parliament on jan 
18 
yugoslavias similar plan includes a sixmonth wage freeze 
strict monetary controls closing down of unprofitable companies 
and liberalized imports to provide more competition to domestic 
industries a currency reform is designed to make the dinar 
convertible 
both poland and yugoslavia were advised on their programs by 
jeffrey sachs a professor of economics at harvard 
although the wage freeze has already triggered a fresh wave of 
strikes in yugoslavia sachs predicts they will gradually cease as 
cheaper imports bring down domestic prices 
the political focus in the area will be on free elections that 
are scheduled for 1990 throughout the region 
also poland and czechoslovakia have asked the soviets to 
withdraw their troops from the two countries and budapest has 
requested an accelerated pace of the soviet pullout from hungary 
free parliamentary elections are scheduled in east germany 
hungary romania and czechoslovakia and local elections in poland 
are expected to be moved up to april 
in the soviet union all 15 republics will hold local elections 
that will offer a choice of candidates for the first time bulgaria 
is also expected to hold free elections although the date has not 
been fixed 
in nonaligned yugoslavia the communists are expected to 
compete for the first time with other groups in parliamentary 
elections that could take place as early as april 
although it broke away from the soviet bloc in 1948 and for 
years followed its own model of more liberal communism yugoslavia 
has fallen behind in the pace of political reforms going on in 
other east european countries 
like the soviet union yugoslavia is a country of a delicate 
ethnic balance and different republics where nationalist feelings 
could jeopardize the transition to democracy 
the baltic states of lithuania latvia and estonia are pushing 
for independence from the soviet union strong nationalist 
movements have emerged in georgia and moldavia which borders 
romania while armenia and azerbaijan are practically at civil war 
moscow has sent thousands of soldiers to quell an uprising in 
the predominantly moslem azerbaijan in the latest challenge to the 
kremlins authority 
the westernmost yugoslav republic of slovenia is also toying 
with secession and its economic relations with the largest republic 
of serbia have been cut 
a 10year drive for more autonomy by the ethnic albanians most 
of them moslems in the southern province of kosovo resulted in 
violent street demonstrations put down by security troops at the 
cost of nearly 30 lives last year

tension continues and police used tear gas and water cannon on 
jan 24 to disperse 40000 ethnic albanians demanding an end to the 
state of emergency still in force in the province 
relations between serbia and croatia the second largest 
republic are also tense and the prodemocracy opposition is split 
along nationalist lines the ruling communist party is split into 
factions with very different ideas about the future course of the 
country 
the disputes came to a climax at the emergency party congress 
that broke up in disarray on jan 22 when slovenias delegates 
walked out unhappy with the scope of reforms being proposed 
earlier the congress had voted to give up the partys monopoly on 
power but hardliners from serbia vehemently opposed the slovenian 
partys drive for more autonomy and a looser party structure 
neighboring albania remains the last bastion of stalinism in 
eastern europe but is showing cautious signs of emerging from its 
selfimposed isolation reports in yugoslav and greek newspapers of 
recent disturbances in albania have been strongly denied by tirana 
thousands of bulgarians have demonstrated against restoring the 
rights of moslem ethnic turks 
such outbreaks of nationalism and ethnic fighting are reviving 
fears of instability that once made the balkans the powder keg of 
europe they could sap the energies needed for an orderly 
transition to democracy and take precious time away from pressing 
economic problems 
the communists have lost their constitutionally guaranteed 
monopoly on power in most eastern european countries but they 
still have powerful assets that give them an organizational 
advantage over the opposition in the campaigns leading to the 
elections 
while getting rid of the old stalinist leaders the communists 
have reorganized themselves changing their names in some cases 
and are not going to give up without a fight at the ballot box 
in east germany for example the communists still exercise 
extensive control over the media and are using it skillfully to 
undermine the disorganized fractured and inexperienced opposition 
lack of faith in reforms is driving more than 1500 east germans 
daily to resettle in west germany last year more than 340000 
east germans moved to west germany and bonn officials say the 
number could double in 1990 
the communist party will get many votes unless it splits up 
says markus meckel a leader of the east german social democratic 
party 
ulrich stockman another member of the party says it is hard to 
organize people politically after 40 years of apathy under 
communist rule 
people have felt lost with all these new parties coming up 
all the time after decades of political unawareness stockman 
said 
krisztina bokor a 50yearold budapest manager recently 
expressed some of the pessimism building up in hungary in the wake 
of revolutionary euphoria 
the elections will be characterized by apathy most people are 
apolitical because there is no real motivation to get them to 
become involved 
the country has no political culture i do not expect any 
positive changes to come about in my lifetime nor in that of the 
next generation mrs bokor said 
mrs edit somlai a 29yearold budapest teacher said the 
country was moving toward democracy but unfortunately it wont 
bring a better economic situation in our lifetime 
unlike poland or czechoslovakia where worldfamous novelist and 
playwright vaclav havel has become president east germanys 
prodemocracy movement lacks charismatic leaders that could unite 
the mushrooming groups in hungary opposition groups also are 
bickering weakening their election prospects 
but a democratically elected government in east germany can 
count on west german aid to prop up its sluggish economy 
for all the problems facing eastern europe they pale in 
comparison with those that are confronting mikhail gorbachev 
president of the soviet union 
bloody ethnic strife in the transcaucasia the uprising in 
azerbaijan and strivings for independence of baltic states threaten 
his political future 
perestroika and glasnost have been a huge success for 
gorbachevs image abroad but at home the stores are empty 
food rationing continues in most parts of the vast country with 
monthly ceilings on the amounts of tea meat sugar matches and 
other staples that soviets can buy 
perhaps the most crucial issue of 1990 will be to determine the 
communist partys role in the soviet society and its monopoly on 
power the provision already has been struck from the constitution 
in lithuania in favor of a multiparty system and latvias 
legislature has moved to do the same 
gorbachev says that any move to alter the partys role must be 
linked to wider reforms the 28th national party congress is 
scheduled for october in moscow and is expected to make the 
communists role one of its major topics 
in the local elections voters will be able to choose between 
several candidates voters in many areas are expected to reject 
communist candidates in favor of nationalists populists and 
maverick communists not backed by the local party potentates

in south africa feminism is viewed with 
suspicion as a foreign philosophy even among many women with 
racial discrimination the overriding social issue sexist practices 
go unchecked in both white and black communities there are few 
protests for a variety of reasons 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in a country where racial 
segregation is a way of life most women in south africa endure an 
additional pervasive form of discrimination that draws little 
protest or publicity sexism 
black and white women experience and react to it differently 
but most accept paternalism and restriction of their freedom as a 
routine part of life 
while attitudes toward women in south africa may be no worse 
than in many third world countries south africans like to point to 
the first world standards of their society but their tolerance 
of male chauvinism sexist treatment in the media and the inferior 
legal status of women would provoke outrage in north america and 
most of europe some examples 
john bishop the evening news announcer on governmentrun 
television says coming up next acceptance by the south african 
air force of its first girls for pilot training 
the countrys premier black actor john kani gives a newspaper 
interview about being directed in othello by actress janet 
suzman i am an african man and as such i find it hard to take 
orders from a woman but janet is very wooing she makes you feel 
well cared for 
foreign minister pik botha tells a heckler who opposes his 
politics i dont argue with pretty women i do other things with 
them 
the comments dont prompt letters to the editor pickets 
protests or calls for the ministers resignation as they might in 
many western countries 
the average south african woman doesnt notice that because 
shes conditioned to that kind of thing says sheena duncan a 
prominent member of several antiapartheid organizations including 
the black sash a civil rights group founded by white women 
there is so much to do one gets tired im not saying the 
struggle for black political liberty takes priority but in 
practical terms you have got only so much time and energy and 
skill to devote 
antiapartheid groups such as the african national congress and 
the congress of south african trade unions have antisexism clauses 
in their antiracist constitutions 
but in practice despite the examples of women who have marched 
staged sitins endured beatings detention and assassinations 
black men are no more shy than whites about ridiculing or 
patronizing women 
at last julys national convention of the mostly black congress 
of south african trade unions a resolution to condemn sexual 
harassment in unions was defeated amid comments that women brought 
such treatment on themselves and had contributed little to the 
labor movement 
emma mashinini 60 who founded one of the largest black unions 
the commercial catering and allied workers union says shes 
disappointed that no woman has been elected to the congresss 
executive committee 
of the dozens of black and white officials and activists who 
have streamed to victor verster prison farm in paarl to discuss the 
political future of south africa with anc leader nelson mandela 
only a halfdozen have been women including his relatives and old 
friends 
its very prestigious these days to say you have gone to see 
mandela mashinini says when she called the trade union congress 
to complain about the absence of women in the union delegation a 
woman told her it was all right because mandela had named those he 
wanted to see 
the issue of sexism is totally subordinated to larger 
political questions in this country and women are allowing it 
says joanne collinge a journalist who worked for many years at 
the star the nations largest daily 
a beauty queen or some other young woman in a swimsuit or shorts 
is on the front page of most mainstream papers several times a week

from time to time a suspect under the strain of 
questioning will confess to a crime he didnt commit heres a 
strange case in west virginia in which two men confessed to the 
same murders the first was freed and the second was tried and 
convicted now hes going to be tried a second time 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a decade ago paul reggettz iii spent 11 
months behind bars after confessing that he murdered his wife and 
their two children he was freed after a former neighbor confessed 
to the same crime 
reggettz has spent the past 10 years struggling to rebuild his 
life painfully aware of the stares and whispers of those who still 
think hes guilty 
now the second man who confessed john moss jr is to stand 
trial again in march his previous conviction on three 
firstdegree murder counts was overturned because of a judges 
mistakes 
i dont want to keep reliving that nightmare reggettz says 
every five years will i have to because of the state supreme 
court where are my rights id like to have the right to get on 
with my life 
the nightmare began on dec 13 1979 the cold rainy day 
reggettzrushed into a restaurant a block up the narrow dirt street 
from his familys onestory house in nearby st albans he called 
police and said youve got to help me my wifes dead 
police found vanessa reggettz 26 lying on the bedroom floor 
beaten strangled and stabbed with a pair of scissors their 
7yearold son paul eric was found in the bathtub apparently 
choked with an electrical cord before being drowned their 
4yearold daughter bernadette had been strangled and was hanging 
from a cord strung over a door 
as the bodies were carried from the white frame house reggettz 
then a 36yearold united parcel service worker was taken to state 
police headquarters for questioning he was interrogated for 21 
straight hours with no food or sleep police deny any 
improprieties but reggettz says he was bullied threatened 
knocked to the floor and had a gun held to his head 
finally he says the shock of seeing his family murdered 
combined with the terror of the interrogation overwhelmed him 
broke his will he confessed 
the children were screaming and crying he told 
investigators my head felt like it was going to explode and i 
had to put a stop to the noise 
reggettz was taken back to the house where his family had been 
slaughtered and reenacted the slayings for police and kanawha 
county prosecutor mike roark 
i was put under so much pressure tremendous pressure 
reggettz says now whats pressure to me might not be pressure 
to you you might stand 10 times the pressure i was put in a 
pressure situation where i would have told them i was anybody or 
anything doing anything they wanted anything 
and people say you mean to tell me you would lie and say 
that i didnt want to lie why would i want to say something 
i didnt do 
but lying got to where it didnt mean anything out of fear 
fear won over the lying i would have told them anything 
anything to get them to leave me alone and not put pressure on 
me 
an autopsy report estimated the time of death at midnight well 
before reggettz left for work at 145 am 
the case seemed cutanddried and circuit judge john hey sent 
reggettz to jail without bond charges against reggettz were 
dropped before he went to trial but he lost his job while behind 
bars 
three times and im not trying to get dramatic three times 
i planned suicide in there reggettz says i came to the very 
end of my rope three different occasions 
i thought dying would have to be better than living 
ten months after the slayings and the day after hey refused to 
throw out reggettzs confession moss told police he committed the 
murders 
in jail in cleveland on other charges at the time moss was a 
former neighbor of the reggettz family he had been named in 
reggettzs indictment as a participant in the slayings but he 
wasnt indicted then because he was 17 
tests showed that some of the blood found in the reggettz home 
didnt come from the victims or from reggettz but did match moss 
blood type 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO> AP900129-0194 </DOCNO>
<TEXT>
moss also was linked to several items reported stolen from the 
reggettz home 
the medical examiner changed the estimated time of death which 
he had based on reggettzs confession to sometime in the early 
morning after reggettz had left for work 
roark finally conceded he believed reggettz was at work 25 miles 
away in rand when the murders occurred and hey dropped the charges 
against him 
moss contended he also was forced into a false confession by the 
state trooper who interrogated reggettz but hey refused to throw 
out his taperecorded statement his defense lawyer argued that 
reggettz committed the murders picturing him as a volatile father 
with no affection for his family and as a former motorcycle gang 
member who worshipped satan 
a jury deliberated 14 hours before convicting moss in 1984 five 
years after the slayings 
but the state supreme court in december 1988 ordered a new trial 
for moss on three grounds 
the court said the judge erred when he refused to poll each 
juror about possible exposure to prejudicial comments made by the 
prosecutor and broadcast on local radio and television stations 
during the trial 
the court also said the judge allowed the prosecutor to make 
prejudicial comments during his closing arguments including 
statements that moss has a ruthless vicious diseased criminal 
mind and should never be released to slaughter women and 
children in kanawha county 
the court also said hey failed to allow admission of evidence 
regarding a polygraph test reggettz took 
despite moss widely publicized trial reggettz still runs 
across people who assume he was guilty 
all this many years later they act like i was the one who was 
tried and im out running around when i ought to be locked up 
he says i have a problem understanding that 
if you liked me before this stuff happened youll probably say 
i didnt do it and if you didnt like me youll probably say i 
did it ive seen it with my own eyes 
during a recent shopping trip for example reggettz says he 
waited outside a discount store while his wife he remarried seven 
years ago went through the checkout line 
i was standing outside looking through the window waiting for 
her and the woman checking her out said you know who that is 
thats paul reggettz thats the guy who killed his family and my 
wife said thats my husband the woman didnt know what to say 
reggettz 46 now lives in south charleston and earns his living 
doing odd jobs a selfdescribed bornagain christian who refound 
his faith in jail he and his wife have no children but he said 
theyre considering adoption 
a member of a pentecostal church reggettz struggles to explain 
his concept of good and evil when asked why his family died 
i believe theres a god in heaven he said i believe 
theres a satan a real live living devil 
hes an evil thing out to destroy kill and i think he was 
the instigator he used somebody to destroy my family hell use 
anybody thats open to his influence 
explain to me why a guy suddenly one day he walks off the job 
and goes home and gets three or four guns and a thousand rounds of 
ammunition and goes to a school and starts shooting up kids i 
dont believe that one day the man says i think im going to kill 
a bunch of kids today im sure a lot of them have thought that 
but they may have help thinking of it 
ten years later reggettz says hes not bitter about what 
happened to him 
i used to be he says it took me a long time to get to 
where im at today 
the state of west virginia the state police some of them 
made mistakes fine everybodys going to make mistakes the 
states not perfect the state police are not perfect mike roarks 
not perfect the judges arent perfect 
i know a lot of people made big mistakes in my case but the 
mistake would be even worse if i let it eat me alive

when an ordinary man leading an ordinary life 
wakes up one morning to discover that he can fly his life is 
transformed right not in the fantasy world of randy cohen where 
people seldom have their feet on the ground 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
randy cohen isnt able to fly or live in a tree 
but he likes to think about it 
so cohen does the next best thing he writes about people who 
do 
his strangely talented people appear as a series of comic pieces 
in his book diary of a flying man published by knopf 
cohen a softspoken amiable 41yearold occupies an office in 
midtown manhattan that looks out on a building he regards as an 
architectural inconvience full of hardworking people no crimes 
being committed no affairs blossoming nothing 
the wall above his desk houses a large collection of pictures 
all of children a closer look reveals they are all of the same 
child its my daughter sophie 2 i took a lot of pictures of 
her so people would think i have a big family 
while in the office cohen works as a writer for the late 
night with david letterman television show he and nine other 
staff writers are responsible for generating amusing things the 
ongoing task that awaits weekly during his six years with the 
show cohen has come up with ideas as varied as attaching a 
miniature camera to a monkeys head and having him shoot the show 
that night as well as a musical piece trivializing glasnost 
the pieces in his book are not from the tv show the book is a 
lot darker and bleaker than the show but i like to think it is 
very very funny cohen says 
the title piece tells of an ordinary man leading an ordinary 
life who wakes up one morning and finds he can fly 
he exults mankinds oldest dream has become my reality i can 
fly this morning running after a 5 bill blowing along the 
pavement i simply lifted into the air what profound 
transformation will my life undergo unfortunately the five turned 
out to be a torn page from sundays fashion supplement 
which pretty well sums up cohens way of looking at things as 
he says the man believes the ability to fly will transform his 
life it doesnt instead of walking to the cash machine and 
finding it doesnt work now you can fly there and find it doesnt 
work i think that if all your dreams come true things would still 
be the same say you get superstrength so you lift up the phone 
book and order in a pizza then you tear the phone book in half 
big deal the pizza will still be cold when you get it assuming it 
arrives at all 
as for the men who live in trees the thesis is says cohen 
that men lead crude primitive lives and should be pathetically 
grateful that women invite them indoors left to their own devices 
men will revert to barbarism but the guys in the trees are happy 
they can eat food without sauces and throw their clothes on the 
floor in this case on the branches 
as one tree dweller puts it i dont have framed prints on the 
wall i dont give little dinner parties i havent ironed anything 
since 1973 what kind of life is that its my life 
here is an excerpt from one of the pieces in the diary its 
called sleep problems 
connies postal obsessions keep her up for hours i worry how 
long the lines will be at the post office tomorrow did i put 
enough postage on the letters i mailed today did i casually apply 
a stamp that will be worth thousands to collectors in 30 years is 
it unethical to use the rutherford b hayes commemorative when i 
disapprove of so many policies of his administration particularly 
his use of federal troops against striking railroad workers its 
all so trivial but my mind grinds on then i panic if i dont 
fall asleep right now tomorrow ill be too tired to get anything 
done at that point im doomed i get up put on my robe go into 
the living room phone someone i loathe and threaten them in a 
disguised voice usually this highpitched nasal twang 
cohen came to humor writing in a funny way 
i used to play drums in a rock n roll band and i could 
introduce a song with funny banter since i was a flamboyantly 
inadequate drummer it was suggested to me that i give up drums and 
become a standup comic so i became a freelance writer i sold my 
pieces and i made enough to eat modestly freelance writers are 
famous for low cholesterol 
he says he applied for a job with the letterman show when he 
found his wife planned to work at home and it terrified us that 
both of us would be at home i turned in a sample of my work sort 
of a comedy writing test and i was hired im sure it was a 
clerical error the piece i submitted can still conjure up visceral 
embarrassment at its inadequacies

robert urich believes theres more to the 
story of convicted wifekiller rob marshall than is revealed in his 
portrayal of marshall in the tv miniseries blind faith 
the twopart nbc series on sunday and monday is based on the joe 
mcginniss book about marshall who was sentenced to death on a 
charge of arranging for the murder of his wife in toms river nj 
in 1984 
i think this might be described as one scenario of what 
happened says urich its based on the book which is based on 
interviews im convinced theres more to it than comes out in the 
book or the miniseries 
but its not an actors job to make moral judgments about the 
character this is the first time ive played in a real documented 
story it bothered me that we might take license with the real 
story 
i play a man who says hes innocent the story is told from 
other peoples points of view if they say he looked suspicious or 
broke down and cried thats what i had to do overall i had 
problems of accurately nailing down his mood and tone 
urich has returned to california after ending his bostonbased 
role as the tough private detective in abcs spenser for hire 
he has sold his 20room 15acre home near boston and bought a 
smaller house in the san fernando valley 
last spring urich was seen as jake spoon a former law officer 
who also worked as an outlaw in the hit cbs miniseries lonesome 
dove he is now preparing for his first situation comedy since 
his brief appearance in soap 12 years ago 
it was knowing i was going to do a comedy that allowed me to 
do something as different and as dark as blind faith he says 
urich says he felt fortunate that roby marshall one of 
marshalls three sons acted as an adviser and was available on the 
set of blind faith 
this was a man who presented the picture of a perfect 
father urich says there was something compelling about this 
guy i did have the benefit of having his son roby by my side i 
felt i could believe him when he said his fathers hand shook or he 
lost his composure 
blind faith was adapted by john gay and directed by paul 
wendkos it also stars joanna kerns as robs wife maria david 
gray as roby jay underwood as son jay johnny galecki as son john 
dennis farina as prosecutor kevin kelly robin strasser as 
marshalls mistress felice richmond joe spano as marshalls best 
friend sal coccaro doris roberts as a friend of marshalls mother 
and william forsythe as the man who testified he arranged for 
marias murder 
as much as anything its a story of the survival of these 
boys and how this catastrophe affected their lives urich says 
after completing spenser for hire urich went to texas for 
his role in lonesome dove then he did movies for disney usa 
network and cbs 
spenser was based on robert parkers books about the tough 
boston detective 
the problem with spenser or any detective on a network is 
you cant really pinpoint the audience urich says you cant 
do the violence or the language or the elements necessary for the 
story spenser in the books was probably more ruthless but i felt 
america didnt need another hero who broke the law and all the 
rules 
in his new comedy american dreamer created by gary david 
goldberg family ties for nbc urich plays a former broadcast 
journalist named tom nash who returns to his hometown with his 
children after his wife is killed in a terrorist bombing he writes 
a column for a chicago newspaper 
i call it a version of our town for television he says 
its one mans reflection on life he brings along all his 
emotional baggage he stands in a spot of life and travels back and 
forth in time then a scene lights up and he steps into the action 
i play the role at all ages 
urichs last appearance in a theatrical film was in turk 182 
in 1985 although people remember him most for ice pirates in 
1984 
id like to do more features but ive managed to stay 
unavailable because of my work for television he says 
hes also acquired a small publishing company beaver dam press 
in nashville tenn and plans to reissue the outdoor books by 
nash buckingham

on any given night in prime time 
85 million of brazils 150 million people stare into their 
television screens eagerly consuming the fare offered up by 
85yearold roberto marinho and his tv globo network 
thats an astounding share of brazils potential viewing public 
of 100 million even those who say they hate what marinho stands 
for and want his network broken up cant resist the magnetic pull 
not only is it brazils largest network it is the largest in 
the third world and on a global basis is generally considered to 
rank fourth after nbc abc and cbs in the united states 
an average of 966 million americans watch tv each night 
according to ac nielsen co with the three major networks 
attracting 60 million of them 
thus roberto marinho and tv globo with a whopping 85 percent 
share of the brazilian audience soars into the ratings 
stratosphere 
the network has 15000 employees and 70 stations reaching nearly 
all of brazils 4000 cities and towns 
all of that however leaves some brazilians deeply worried that 
marinho has far too much influence for brazils good 
none of the three other brazilian networks independents or 
educational tv come near to competing with tv globos recognized 
quality or popularity 
president fidel castro of cuba is a fan although he would place 
himself at the opposite end of the ideological field from marinho 
castros addiction is a tv globo soapopera sold throughout latin 
america titled a escrava isaura isaura the slave 
tv globos soaps called novelas draw the largest number 
of viewers the network also attracts an audience with firstrun 
movies dubbed into portuguese such as raiders of the lost 
ark it offers sophisticated farranging news coverage first 
on the scene of fires floods bus crashes and cabinet resignations 
yet the cries often go up break up tv globo 
books magazine articles and politicians charge that so vast a 
tv network is simply too powerful most particularly in a country 
where millions barely can read and turn to television for 
information as well as entertainment 
the direct target of the criticism is the iconoclastic 
billionaire marinho who also has his hand in newspapers radio 
book and magazine publishing and communications systems 
critics charge that marinho uses his conglomerate to push a 
rightwing probusiness antipopulist political message 
marinho whose physical bearing belies his age by 15 or 20 
years doesnt deny it 
we openly supported the candidacy of fernando collor de 
mello marinho unabashedly told a group of reporters in rio de 
janeiro recently he was referring to the victor in brazilian 
elections in december the first free presidential vote in almost 
30 years 
conservative profree enterprise collor de mello defeated a 
marxistoriented opponent in a final runoff by a slim margin and is 
to take office march 15 
but when marinho asserted that his media conglomerate also gave 
time and space to competing candidates skeptics sharing a widely 
held belief that marinho ordered slanted coverage to favor collor 
de mello laughed aloud some walked out 
the silverhaired magnate envisions his media might with a 
proselytizing mission this is not the united states we have an 
obligation to reach not only the cultured people but also those of 
the lowest classes 
and indeed the first signs of modern progress in brazils 
wretched favelas or hillside slums often are tv aerials 
sprouting from the roofs of miserable shacks 
brazil cannot be governed with roberto marinho having the 
power he does says the leftistpopulist leonel brizola former 
governor of rio de janeiro and one of 21 candidates who ran for the 
presidency 
during his unsuccessful campaign brizola promised on the 
first morning of my first day in office i will reexamine the 
monopoly of the tv globo party the biggest party in brazil that 
network must be taken off the air 
brizola finished third and was eliminated from the deciding 
runoff 
tv globo is agile and efficient with a level of quality that 
makes it the leader in the ratings said professor jose marques 
de melo the head of the school of communications and arts at the 
university of sao paulo the nations largest and most prestigious 
learning center but its professional conduct during the 
elections left a lot to be desired 
brazil needs a code of ethics for news media marques de 
melo added 
ricardo kotscho the press spokesman for the losing presidential 
candidate in the finals luis inacio lula da silva said marinhos 
extremely successful newspaper o globo of rio de janeiro which 
openly endorsed color de mello lost all its credibility in the 
campaign and also its morals 
in his session with the newsmen marinho said a newspaper can 
support whomever it wants he added that o globo gave coverage to 
the other candidates even though he personally didnt like them 
i have been called a fascist marinho said but when i was 
young i boxed and practiced jiujitsu and karate i know how to 
hit as well as get hit 
marinho inherited the newspaper o globo the world after his 
father irineu marinho died just three weeks after founding the 
paper in 1925 he expanded into radio in the 1940s and now runs a 
moneymaking nationwide radio network 
tv globo went on the air in 1965 timelife broadcasting of the 
united states once held a minority interest in it leading to 
charges that tv globo was a mouthpiece for american 
imperialism but now the globo empire belongs exclusively to 
marinho his brothers and his sons 
tv globo spends lavishly to produce its primetime novelas 
which draw ratings of over 90 percent at home translated from the 
portuguese they are exported to the rest of latin america western 
europe scandinavia the middle east the orient and us 
spanishlanguage stations 
marinho lives in the best mogul style in a fabulous estate high 
in the hills overlooking rio near the famous christ the redeemer 
statue on corcovado peak 
the roberto marinho foundation finances free art exhibits and 
openair concerts and operas for brazils poor masses and also a 
televised adulteducation course that has given some 4 million 
brazilian dropouts a chance to acquire high schoolequivalency 
diplomas 
in 1964 when a rightwing military regime seized power and 
ruled for 21 years marinho and his media voices were solidly 
behind it 
brizola exiled during the military dictatorship but later 
granted amnesty says i am not against roberto marinho 
personally but in brazil an essential public service such as radio 
and television must be made more democratic 
marinhos response mr brizola can provoke me all he wants 
it wont do him any good 
married twice and recently estranged from his second wife 
marinho did not flinch when a reporter asked him about his current 
relationship with a rio society figure lily de carvalho an old 
flame from his younger days 
she is a widow and a free woman he said 
age does not interfere with companionship i dont drink i 
dont smoke i exercise i go underwater fishing without an 
aqualung i dont spend any sleepless nights

do you remember that day in 1969 when you and your family 
huddled around the television set for an unbelievable sight neil 
armstrong stepping down to the powdery surface of the moon and and 
saying one small step for man one giant leap for mankind 
if you were a parent you probably took photographs of your 
children watching this milestone of human history 
our memories are linked to flickering images on the 17inch 
screen now the moonexploration experience can be viewed on the 
big screen in the way that the astronauts saw it a new feature 
documentary for all mankind takes you inside the space 
capsule and onto the surface of the moon in color and with absolute 
clarity 
a magazine writer named al steinert is responsible for the film 
ten years ago he began wondering about all the movies that the 13 
astronauts took during their flights and lunar explorations the 
film 6 million feet of it remained in the nasa vaults 
available for public view nobody had ever thought of reviewing all 
of it al steinert did 
the most dramatic sequences were selected then painstakingly 
expanded from 16mm to 35mm film as a result the film is 
remarkably clear even on huge screens only the shots at the 
johnson space center betray graininess 
despite the familiarity of all the moon adventures for all 
mankind seems entirely new it is far more exhilarating than a 
star trek movie and it evokes renewed awe at the courage of 
the astronauts 
steinert wisely allows the astronauts themselves to relate the 
story in their communications with earth and in reminiscences he 
recorded in recent times he tells the story linearly starting 
with the suiting up at cape canaveral the awesome liftoff and the 
silent dreamlike soar through the outer limits 
the moon sequences are blissfully lyrical aided by the 
otherworldly music by brian eno roger eno and dan lanois the 
understated comments by the astronauts add immeasurably to the 
storytelling 
for all mankind which was produced by reinert and betsy 
broyles brier has been appearing in test engagements around the 
country having acquired no distributor the film is unrated but 
it offers a profound experience for all ages particularly 
youngsters to whom space travel seems unremarkable running time 
80 minutes

women on the verge of a nervous breakdown orion home video 
vhsbeta 7998 rated r 
 
women on the verge of a nervous breakdown is a hilarious 
dark farce of the trouble men cause women full of improbable 
relationships and impossible coincidences this subtitled film from 
spain has been a big hit in the united states and for many good 
reasons 
among them is carmen maura who plays the passionate beautiful 
pepa the central character of director pedro almodovars movie 
pepa and ivan fernando guillen share a penthouse apartment in 
madrid and when ivan abruptly leaves her pepa sets off on a 
desperate course to get him back along the way she encounters her 
friend candela who is involved with a man who turns out to be a 
shiite terrorist ivans wife who spent 20 years in a mental 
hospital a feminist lawyer who is her successor as ivans lover 
and a taxi driver who supplies his fares with music magazines and 
drinks 
there is melodrama galore a suicide attempt a nearly hijacked 
jetliner an unplanned pregnancy barbituratespiked gazpacho and 
stakeouts but women on the verge never resorts to slapstick 
pepa and ivan are actors pepa playing the mother of a murderer 
in a television show they also both dub films and in one she 
plays a bride at the altar the priest whispers that she must not 
trust any man not even her husband and then hands her a condom 
throughout there is a sense of loss of control a frantic pace 
everything is just out of wack and that is the part of the 
wonderful charm of women on the verge

feel rca human drama 
 
sometimes you can judge a record by its cover 
johnny indovina the singerleader of human drama poses on 
feel with bare chest beads and necklaces black nail polish 
and crucifix earring his face darkened by shadows his hair 
hanging in front of his eyes like a mask 
this is music for the white makeup black leather and big 
moussed hair set its gloom and doom rock with plenty of angst 
thrown in 
feel is this los angelesbased groups first album its 
similar in tone to the smiths joy division or the cure but on 
the despairometer human drama comes out on top 
indovina yelps favors a sobby vibrato and uses the pained 
hiccup effect in his vocals 
his alienated voice is alienating his songs may have arisen 
from genuinely deep pain but its difficult to share that pain 
with him his lyrics are mostly obscure and cryptic 
send in the undertakers or maybe a psychiatrist 
so deep it burns i burn until i cry i die indovina sings 
on death of an angel then on dying in a moment of 
splendor indovina relates i am an artist with a vision seeing 
hell his destiny and in there is only you indovina sings 
about coming close to suicide though it might be just fantasy 
so johnny feels bad but why 
is it the ozone layer toxic wastes love gone sour addiction 
indovina refers to an inner battle between good and evil which 
could be tied to the struggle with addiction he relates in 
tumble and never never 
references to angels heaven god demons easter the golden 
rule and prayers are sprinkled through feel its too bad a 
little holy water couldnt have been sprinkled too because this 
record sounds anything but celestial 
it takes more courage to sing about inner struggles than about 
cars and girls but indovina lacks the directness of a tracy 
chapman or bruce springsteen that makes the pain personal enough to 
touch the hearts of an audience

smoking in the fields rca the del fuegos 
 
the del fuegos color the world like autumn burnt orange 
russet siena sepia 
on smoking in the fields they sound like theyve been 
through the lighthearted spring and summer and now are living in a 
season where things are more serious and the winds blow harder but 
where flashes of color and cozy blankets give warmth 
ill stand by you when youre feelin tired gray and old 
honey i will be too dan zanes sings on stand by you the 
track is the most strippeddown on the album featuring just zanes 
an acoustic guitar and a little help from unobtrusive strings and 
backing vocals 
most of the rest of this album is barroom stomp rock that would 
be in good company alongside jason and the scorchers or the leroi 
brothers the fuegos get pumped on move with me sister and no 
no never then slow down into the midtempo part of this 
earth and a bluestinted jam on lost weekend 
guitars carry the tunes and tom lloyds bass is mixed up high 
enough to give a weighty feel horns add brightness but harmonica 
work by the j geils bands magic dick lends the most distinctive 
texture to the album 
zanes whiskeyovergravel voice trademarks the stuff as the 
fuegos 
its been 2 years since the last del fuegos album the bomb 
stand up since then the band has switched record labels and 
producers 
mitchell froom who produced the bands first three records is 
replaced by dave thoener the result smoking in the fields is 
an ok rock album with a gritty tinge but it doesnt dazzle

in ohio students learned math in japanese after 
seeing a kabukistyle othello in new jersey a teacher used 
musical rhythms in a lesson on syllables in upstate new york a 
storytellers yarns brought a shy schoolboy out of his shell 
all were inspired by the lincoln center institute for the arts 
in education a program that brings a unique blend of culture 
academia and personal growth to thousands of students each year 
were not trying to teach respect or love for the arts said 
mark schubart director of the institute what were trying to do 
is more basic to teach about how people think and react and view 
the world 
each year the institute commissions a dozen productions 
including dance concerts and plays that are appropriate for 
children teachers preview the pieces on videotape and choose one 
for their school 
what makes the program special is the involvement of artists in 
the summer artists hold workshops at lincoln center to help 
teachers experience the creative process and to show them how to 
reach students through the arts in the fall the artists go into 
the classroom and help teachers prepare students for the production 
theyll be seeing 
in one workshop last summer composer john king had teachers 
clap sing and bang coffee cans to demonstrate contrapuntal 
techniques 
im not teaching them how to be musicians said king im 
teaching them how to look at music by experiencing rather than 
listening 
gail krehel a secondgrade reading teacher in paramus nj 
said she planned to use clapping to teach students how to divide 
words into syllables 
last fall elementary school students in new york city who were 
scheduled to see an adaptation of rudyard kiplings just so 
stories read the book discussed themes and characters played 
games to improve their concentration and acted out scenes to learn 
what its like to be a performer 
an actors got to change his voice and change his moving and 
his body and wear different clothes explained jesus mendez 7 
they dont look like real people when they have those things 
on said aaron tye 5 referring to the masks worn by the just 
so stories troupe 
aaron had worn a mask himself while portraying a dog during his 
classs improvisations i felt great i felt like an animal he 
said 
his classmate tavona cooper played a horse 
she came home and told me all about it said her mother 
donna she galloped around the house and showed me how the horse 
moves his hoofs 
cooper said she noticed a change in tavona since those 
improvisational sessions with an actress from the institute 
shes more outgoing more motivated now cooper said 
tavonas teacher gloria toro explained as theyre learning 
their selfesteem grows because theyre having so much fun and they 
love what theyre doing 
louise trucks of the aesthetic education institute in rochester 
which is affiliated with the lincoln center institute agreed 
children can learn things through the arts that they might not 
have found in other ways she said one child reached by the 
rochester program had been a withdrawn child not involved with 
other kids in the classroom until a storyteller began visiting the 
class 
by the time this storyteller left this boy was writing 
stories he was participating in the class telling stories and 
recruiting other children to do so she said 
the lincoln center institute began in 1976 with a handful of 
schools today the program reaches 100000 children in 289 schools 
in new york city long island westchester and rockland counties 
new jersey and connecticut the schools finance half the 
institutes 24 million annual budget the rest is paid by private 
and government grants 
programs modeled on the institute have sprung up in albany 
binghamton buffalo rochester syracuse and utica in new york as 
well as in san diego memphis and nashville tenn tulsa okla 
and other cities 
in bowling green ohio teachers used a kabukistyle performance 
of othello as a springboard for lessons on japan we had 
first graders doing arithmetic in japanese said director michael 
moore 
but the dividends are not solely academic were training kids 
how to ask aesthetic questions he said we have thirdgraders 
who can give critiques of plays we have kindergarteners who will 
sit through 90 minutes of a performance and not move were 
training people to be intelligent consumers of the arts 
barbara davis of the texas institute for the arts in education 
in houston agreed the children can relate to a contemporary 
dance piece or an opera she said its not just a bunch of 
people moving around on stage anymore

ranging from the purple people eater to early 20th century 
comedy to rapscratchin takeoffs on star trek 
every week the show is on 193 commercial radio stations through 
the westwood one radio networks and on 35 college stations and 
about 500 armed forces network stations on ships or bases 
hansen whose trademark is a tux and top hat is celebrating 
20 years on commercial radio despite his goofy voice and 
noisemakers he calls himself a straight man to the records he 
plays 
hansen isnt really a doctor but if anyone were handing out 
phds in music of all persuasions he would be first in line his 
knowledge of music spans the blues folk classical rock and 
novelty tunes 
he occasionally helps casey kasem choose old songs for caseys 
top 40 introduced weird al yankovic to the world and influences 
other radio personalities 
i think hes great i love him ive been a fan for years 
said scott shannon vice president and program director at both 
westwood one and los angeles pirate radio kqlz 
it all began when hansen was 4 years old just a pup in 
minneapolis he was already fascinated by the familys gramophone 
and could handle playing the fragile 78 rpm records himself 
his father an arts aficionado brought home some spike jones 
records including cocktails for two the 1945 recording starts 
with a man crooning about an exquisite rendezvous but goes 
crazy with loud crashes guns going off and people screaming 
whoopee 
it planted the seed in my little brain which 25 years later 
became the dr demento show hansen said in an interview during 
a recent visit to his alma mater reed college 
when he was in junior high he happened across a thrift shop 
record sale two 78s for a nickel it was the beginning of a 
collection that now numbers about 250000 its not the largest 
collection in the world but its up there he said 
he has so many records that the floor of one room in his sherman 
oaks calif home collapsed in december actually contractors 
told hansen the floor should have been able to hold the records 
an estimated five tons 
hansen got his start in radio at reeds station krrc where he 
was manager and the deejay for different shows 
after graduating in 1963 he took off for the smogberry 
trees of los angeles he worked at the ash grove music club 
introducing such greats as lightnin hopkins bill monroe and arlo 
guthrie he did short stints as a roadie for canned heat and 
spirit produced a couple of records and put together reissues for 
specialty records 
hansen also took a masters degree in folk music studies at the 
university of california at los angeles and wrote record reviews 
for early issues of rolling stone magazine 
at a party in 1970 he met two men who worked at kppc one of 
the new fm underground progressive radio stations that were 
popping up around the country hansen showed them his record 
collection then about 40000strong and was invited to do an 
oldies show 
his first time behind the mike he played classics by carl 
perkins screamin jay hawkins and others and threw in a nutty 
teen car crash tune transfusion by nervous norvus somebody 
said youve got to be demented to play that on the radio 
hansen said the name dr demento stuck 
i found the most bizarre and outrageous things were the ones 
that got the biggest response so he gave the audience what it 
wanted 
hansen moved to los angeles kmet in 1971 went into syndication 
in 1974 and watched radio change 
when he started at kmet djs mixed up classical country jazz 
and rock all in one show but during the 70s the station got 
rid of all but its rock records hansen said then management 
started telling djs exactly what they had to play from those 
albums and the next step of course was putting it all on computer 
programs hansen said the same is true at most every other 
commercial station 
but dr demento survived 
he switched to los angeles klsx in 1987 where he does a live 
version of his show thats sometimes wilder than the syndicated 
prerecorded program 
my show in a way is the last vestige of freeform programming 
on commercial radio hansen said 
a major source for that free form is tapes sent in by dr 
dementos fans who number anywhere from 300000 to 1 million 
hansen receives 20 to 30 tapes a week most containing several 
songs of those tapes one or two songs will get played on the show 
during that week 
in 1976 one 16yearold sent in a tape about the food in his 
school cafeteria that was weird al yankovic who also supplied dr 
dementos most exciting moment in the studio when he and friends 
did a live performance of another one rides the bus 
another artist barnes amp barnes whose fish heads is dr 
dementos mostrequested song ever started out by submitting a 
tape of the vomit song which hansen rejected other rejects 
are tapes that are racist libelous or obscene or that feature for 
example 8yearolds singing bad parodies of george michael songs 
still he said i try to be outrageous 
hansen is grudgingly aware of guidelines set by the federal 
communications commission but as far as song selection goes i 
would like to have stations that are my clients make that 
decision for me rather than the federal government he said 
a miami station was fined for playing a song candy rapper 
that hansen once played on his klsx show this is just a simple 
little song about candy hansen quipped it uses names of candy 
items such as mounds and big hunk to tell what could be an 
xrated story without any explicit language 
the crowd attending hansens january performance at reed went 
wild for candy rapper and other selected hits of dementia 
including dead puppies arent much fun theyre coming to 
take me away hahaa and pencil neck geek 
hansen wishes commercial radio and major record labels would 
show the same enthusiasm for novelty records which had their 
heyday in the 60s but if not hell continue as the king of 
novelty making this world a happier place to live

in joseph girzones new testament epilogue 
christ peddles his 2000yearold carpentry skills for chicken 
recipes buses tables to pay his way to the vatican and quips that 
he hasnt had kosher in ages 
and like the christ who became a heavy tipper among the 
moneychangers in jerusalem girzones latterday jesus has radical 
ideas to change humanitys relationship with god 
girzones latest book is joshua and the children the second 
of his bestselling parablenovels about christs second comings 
and goings in todays world both are published by macmillan 
publishing co 
this is my attempt to present the clear and simple message of 
jesus thats been lost over the centuries girzone a retired 
roman catholic priest said in an interview at a catholic retreat 
in this adirondack town about 100 miles north of albany he lives 
in the albany suburb of altamont 
the chief persecutors of that simple message have been churches 
themselves more intent on preserving their authority than 
spreading truth girzone said 
i see the terrible terrible hurt the anguish people 
suffer the author said people are desperately trying to find 
an answer to find a god that makes sense i want to present them 
with a god that finally makes sense 
religions his own included have failed their followers 
constructing artificial barriers and rituals that christ wouldnt 
have respected girzone said 
christians fighting each other in the name of christ its so 
hypocritical he said my remedy is to plop jesus plop joshua 
right in the middle of it 
in the first book jesus returns to earth and takes the name 
joshua setting up shop as a carpenter and woodcarver he lives 
simply earning just enough to get by and captivates people of all 
faiths with talk of a god who forgives human weakness who did 
not intend to make humans little gods 
to be perfectly human as god made us should be our goal 
joshua says if we appear to be religious or pious weve missed 
the point and our piety becomes a caricature and unauthentic 
like christ joshua clashes with the establishment he advises a 
troubled priest to fight the catholic celibacy requirement for 
priests offends religious leaders by attending services at church 
and synagogue alike and faces a hostile panel of vatican 
inquisitors he also annoys the pope by calling him peter after 
the rock of an apostle on which the catholic church was founded 
joshua tells vatican leaders that churches are ruled by 
unfeeling and arrogant shepherds who hurt the flock and do 
irreparable damage to gods people with complete immunity to 
threaten gods displeasure when people do not follow your rules is 
being a moral bully and does no service to god 
girzone 58 retired from the priesthood for health reasons in 
1981 after 26 years at schools and parishes in new york city 
pennsylvania and the albany diocese too young for a church 
pension he turned to writing and lecturing to make a living 
he selfpublished three books before writing joshua which 
sold 60000 copies under his own companys imprint richelieu court 
publications girzone sold copies to people who came to his 
lectures and people who had read joshua began ordering copies 
to give to friends and relatives 
joshua made waldenbooks bestseller list in 1986 a rare 
achievement for a selfpublished book the sequel the first 
printing of which totaled 175000 copies broke the top 10 of the 
new york times bestseller list 
collier book s a division of macmillan has sold nearly 400000 
copies of joshua since issuing a paperback edition in 1987 
sales today are greater than when macmillan published joshua 
two years ago said barry lippman president of macmillans adult 
trade division 
its not some slick fad thats caught on he said within 
two or three pages theres something about the book that really 
clicks with people it shows you can have faith without thinking of 
yourself as part of a church 
the books have become the centerpiece for girzones whole new 
approach to christianity how you reconcile the freedom jesus 
taught with the authority of the church he said i hope it 
will undo some of the damage the church has done to people 
much of girzones vision replays christs saga in modern terms 
instead of raising lazarus from a tomb joshua brings a rabbis son 
back to life after he has broken his neck in a fall instead of 
making five loaves and two fish feed a crowd after a sermon joshua 
stretches two sandwiches to feed 25 children on a picnic instead 
of a last supper with his disciples joshua is the guest at a 
surprise party on a thursday before leaving for rome 
in between healing the sick and restoring sight to the blind 
joshua preaches against drugs and ocean pollution uses tv 
evangelism to get his message across and buys gallon jugs of table 
wine from liquor stores 
theres even ascension and resurrection scenes joshua makes a 
lockedroom departure in the first book from a vatican boarding 
house after telling the pope what hes doing wrong in the second 
book joshua vanishes from his coffin after being gunned down by 
religious fanatics in northern ireland 
unlike joshua girzone has drawn few harsh words for his ideas 
hes been called a closet protestant by some conservative 
catholics but most religious leaders say they see the truth in 
what girzone preaches 
the joshua stories are told simply in artless prose 
reminiscent of christs new testament parables girzone said he 
wrote simply so the story wouldnt be lost in the words 
before joshua writing had been an agony for him girzone 
said but the words came effortlessly for his parable of jesus as 
if a voice whispered the words in his ear he said 
i cant help but feel god wanted something done and is using 
the book to accomplish it he said

downstairs a sellout crowd of 1400 stretched 
across the clattering casino fans in cowboy boots and fancy suits 
lining up to see the oak ridge boys 
upstairs in a room overlooking the glitzy las vegas strip duane 
allen recalled another era in this city when the oaks on stage 
outnumbered their sparse audience 
times change 
we always required our supporting acts to go out in the 
audience and help bolster the crowd said allen a grin flashing 
across his bearded face 
one night we had 23 or 24 people in the audience it was the 
smallest crowd we ever worked for 
its only a matter of blocks from the landmark hotel where the 
oak ridge boys nursed a flagging career in the mid1970s to the 
posh celebrity room at ballys resort where they headline today 
but the difference for their career is immeasurable 
back in those landmark days we had many nights where we had 
more people onstage than in the audience said bass richard 
sterban gazing across a room that was beginning to take on a glow 
as the neonbathed strip took life below 
those were the days the oaks were trying to switch from gospel 
music to country and were having trouble finding their niche 
the landmark which has since fallen on hard times and is 
currently in bankruptcy kept their hopes alive allen said 
they took us under their wings for five years he recounted 
working at the landmark for 6000 a week we didnt try to set 
our goals too high that place still has a good feeling for us i 
still get a chill when i walk by there they saved our career they 
gave us work 
i dont forget those times allen added ive seen from 
one end of the scale to the other 
today they are a top attraction in a city that boasts such acts 
as frank sinatra diana ross wayne newton and barbara mandrell 
now they play vegas four or five weeks a year at more than 40 
times the landmark pay 
last year the oaks played 243 dates in 113 cities venues 
ranging from state fairs to concert halls to the posh showroom at 
ballys on a recent night at ballys the crowd was standing room 
only 
joe bonsall wearing red tennis shoes and tshirt to match led 
with their popular hit my baby is american made sterban in a 
black tux followed with dream on his deep bass voice sending 
shudders through the sophisticated sound system 
by the time they got to yall comeback saloon the 1977 
smash that transformed the oaks from a gospel group to a country 
hit the sedate showroom was reverberating with the handclapping 
fervor of a revival hall 
allen says these are the best of times for the oaks who have 
known their share of the other kind 
the group started in knoxville tenn in 1945 borrowing the 
name of the nearby atomic plant it has had more than 40 members 
disbanding in 1946 and again in 1956 they stretched the limits of 
southern gospel music in the 60s and 70s before such a trend was 
accepted and soon faced an identity crisis stuck between country 
and gospel and some 100000 in debt 
those starving days taught us not to take the prosperous times 
for granted said sterban who joined the oaks in 1972 
they switched to country in 1977 signed with mca then abcdot 
and zoomed to the top of the charts with yall come back saloon 
since then theyve had more than a dozen no 1 country singles 
their hit elvira went platinum nine albums have gone gold and 
two platinum there have been five grammy awards and a host of 
country music association awards 
the past few years havent been turbulencefree there were 
wellpublicized differences with william lee golden before he split 
from the group in early 1987 
it was a very emotionally draining thing allen said it 
was an emotional strain for three years before it became public 
it takes full effort to be a member of a group said allen 
who has been with the oaks 24 years if you have other interests 
that draw your attention away everybody feels that it became very 
obvious that william lee wanted to be a solo artist we wish him 
nothing but the best 
the split found the group needing to have a breath of life 
breathed into us allen said it made us realize how much more 
important the three of us were to each other 
goldens replacement steve sanders had been a member of the 
band since 1982 moving out front in the spring of 1987 bonsall 
has been with group since 1973 
one of the things hes added is energy allen said of 
sanders we needed to be pumped up again the group needed some 
outside influence to help create that energy 
the oaks credit religious backgrounds with values they retain 
today 
we used to give 10 percent of our dates back to the 
business allen recalled we still give 10 to 15 percent to our 
charity work always have 
thats the way we were all raised to tithe our money and our 
time sterban added 
i think ones religion is and should be a very significant 
part of your life allen said its an integral part of the oak 
ridge boys i would hate to think id have to go through a day or a 
week or a month or a year without giving god the credit

bob hover isnt sure what prompted a friend to tell him that a 
deteriorating old house standing empty in troy mich would be 
just right for him 
most likely it was because he had already turned a defunct fast 
food place into a nice restaurant in detroit says his wife jenny 
several months later he drove by the site and bob hover fell in 
love with the dunn homestead a late victorian clapboard house with 
gingerbread trim 
i had an immediate vision of how it would look when i had 
restored it recalls hover now more than a decade later his 
vision has been vindicated in january he won an award for the 
renovation from the national trust for historic preservation 
the hovers nowproud home of about 2700 square feet has a 
large living room dining room kitchen with new cabinets leaded 
glass cabinet fronts and a marble countertop four bedrooms two 
full baths a utility room and a full attic 
from the beginning hover an entrepreneur and an artist was 
convinced that he had the design and physical skills necessary to 
bring the house back to its former glory his willingness to tackle 
the restoration led delores dunnjohnson to sell it to him 
she and her sister irene dunnhouse were born in the homestead 
built by their grandfather terrence dunn in 1888 their memories 
old photos and other materials helped the hovers carry out the 
detective work necessary to rehabilitate the home delores johnson 
is now the hovers nearest neighbor 
when he bought the house and one acre for 40000 in 1979 bob 
knew it was going to take a long time to rehabilitate it i was 
26 and single so i didnt have to account to anyone 
the place had suffered substantial fire damage and had not been 
lived in for years it was in fact condemned by the town fire 
department 
he spent the first four years clearing away rubble filling a 
large dumpster 20 times with rubble from the site and running up a 
carting bill of about 4000 
town officials didnt think the house could be rebuilt and had 
scheduled it for demolition getting a building permit took four 
years and the help of the troy historic district commission and the 
two dunn granddaughters 
after the permit came through in january 1984 hover began the 
reconstruction work building professionals confirmed his opinion 
that virtually everything would have to be replaced he needed new 
plumbing electrical wiring and heating as well as a new roof 
kitchen appliances and walls 
all that was really left inside the house were the original 
doors some floors some hardware and the framing he recalls 
outside much of the trim was gone 
he set up a woodworking shop in what are now the living and 
dining rooms spending about 12000 on circular and band saws an 
industrial grade sander and router and a number of hand tools 
this enabled him to make all the wood components it would have 
cost tens of thousands of dollars to have the work done by somebody 
else he says 
he used existing woodworkoften brokenas patterns for 
exterior ornamentation wood frames and hoods for the 35 windows 
corbels corner blocks kitchen cabinets and newel posts for the 
staircase 
his father pete who is retired often helped him the work was 
done on weekends and most evenings from 4 to 11 pm hover did all 
the woodwork and painting but hired professionals to do the 
plumbing and electrical work and to lay the cedar shake roof 
the hovers moved into the house in 1987 a little prematurely 
they say in something of an understatement 
we didnt have a stove for seven months and the rooms were 
covered with plaster dust recalls mrs hover 
we weathered living with wild animals falling plaster no 
kitchen and several rooms with no floors a typical dinner 
consisted of peanut butter and sawdust sandwiches on our dining 
room table saw says hover 
in hindsight however his wife says the hardships have made 
them feel very tied to their new home which is now almost 
complete they are furnishing it in appropriate late victorian 
style with reproduction wallpaper lace curtains an old fashioned 
clawfoot bathtub and pedestal sink and victorian furniture 
one of the most difficult tasks in tackling a restoration 
project of this size was to secure the necessary financing 
convincing a bank that my boarded up condemned home was just a 
fixerupper was almost impossible says hover after getting a 
brushoff from several local banks hover was finally able to secure 
financing from his credit union which advanced funds in 
installments and checked on progress frequently 
hover says he has spent about 100000 in addition to the 
original purchase price a local real estate broker has estimated 
the property at about 170000 he says 
despite or perhaps because of all the hard work he put into 
his home bob hover looks back on the past decade as fun i loved 
doing the work from time to time i would take off a night or a 
weekend and i often wondered if i would be able to bring it off 
this was especially so when he had to redo work after 
reconstructing a staircase he realized it was in the wrong place 
so he ripped it out and rebuilt it in the right place 
every year he documented his progress with videotape and 
photos to remind him how far he had come with a project like 
this you need that kind of encouragement he says

you might not think of them as heroes yet some of the people 
who rehabilitate old buildings into homes are much like the 
american pioneers who blazed a trail across new territory 
robert hover wasnt daunted by the job of rehabilitating a 
condemned building swaying in the wind in troy mich for his work 
he won an award from the national trust for historic preservation 
the stories of the trusts 14 prizewinners and their projects 
could serve as a primer on house renovation 1990style 
an unusual chapter would be todd canterburys story he turned a 
76foothigh silo into a 3100squarefoot home in fairfax county 
va winning a first prize for adaptive reuse of a building 
robert hodges of baton rouge la not only rescued a derelict 
house and moved it to a new lot but resurrected the forgotten craft 
of bousillage to recreate authentic walls of mud and spanish moss 
also singled out were the restoration of a 1784 anglogerman 
stone house in virginia recreation of victorian detailing that 
had been stripped from a new york city apartment renovations to 
make a home accessible for a wheelchairbound occupant in 
philadelphia and restoration of beautiful pine woodwork in a texas 
home a job took five men five months and 11 55gallon drums of 
stripper 
the stories people wrote about what they did on their houses 
show they had a dream of what a house could be they did enormous 
amounts of research to make their dreams come true says anne 
powell editor of historic preservation the national trust 
magazine which pictures the winning entries in its winter issue 
there is an overall trend to be more meticulous 
the trust is planning a second competition 
the first contest brought 182 entries from 31 states the 
majority of entries 76 percent were submitted by homeowners 
themselves 
the judges noticed that many of the doityourself projects 
could not be distinguished from projects executed by highpriced 
professionals says clem labine one of the judges and founder of 
the oldhouse journal a publication which was at the vanguard of 
the restoration trend 
most of the homes dated from 1880 to 1895 although the oldest 
was built in 1672 and newest about 50 years ago economics are part 
of the growing interest in preserving late 19th century homes 
earlier homes have gotten more expensive and increasingly difficult 
to find as more people covet them early 20th century homes have 
become more desirable as the late 19th century places become more 
expensive 
the jewel in the rough that you could buy for 25000 and fix 
up is a thing of the past says labine the high cost of 
acquiring and redoing an old house is forcing some people to 
convert them to profitmaking properties such as bed and breakfast 
inns the historical bampb which didnt even exist 10 years ago 
is an avenue for people who want to own an old house but cant 
afford to 
redoing an old home with historical accuracy is creating an 
interest in architectural conservation many local history groups 
are changing their focus from genealogy to architecture according 
to labine 
an approach we see often is for owners to renovate a building 
itself with historic accuracy and furnish the interior in 
contemporary fashion he says at the opposite extreme is the 
period museum approach 
as a rule the more carried away you get with historical 
accuracy the greater the danger of committing the cardinal sin of 
real estate overimproving says labine you can spend a lot 
more money in restoration than by using conventional mainstream 
products from the local building center but some of the benefits 
of an accurate restoration are measured in quality of life rather 
than dollars and cents he says 
as restorer of an old house and former president of the old 
northside neighborhood association in indianapolis ind paul 
smith says the appeal of living in an old house is far more than an 
aesthetic appreciation for wonderful old detailing an important 
motivation is the sense of community in a neighborhood of old 
houses 
i can tell you the names of people who live seven or eight 
blocks away a common bond is that we are restoring an old house 
if i need a plumber i call my neighbor for the name of one who is 
sensitive to old houses he says 
the restoration trend has inspired an increase in the number of 
products available to do the work in 1976 there were 205 
suppliers of goods or services for restoration our current census 
found 1973 companies engaged in supplying products or services for 
sympathetic rehabilitation of old houses says labine 
and he notes preservation has become commercial because many 
people prefer old or quality reproduction homes the traditional 
buildings are sold out and the contemporary buildings are going 
begging in the marketplace the trusts second competition 
closes june 30 1990 for entry requirements and a nomination form 
send a selfaddressed stamped envelope to home awards the

housing industry officials doubt home prices 
will decline significantly in the near future but falling mortgage 
interest rates mean both the overall cost of buying a home and 
monthly payments are dropping 
the median price of a new home this year will be 127200 
compared with 120000 last year according to figures compiled by 
the mortgage bankers association it says the median price of an 
existing home will be 96500 in 1990 up from 92600 in 1989 
the median price means that half of the homes cost more half 
less 
some analysts say that while housing prices may be falling or 
leveling off in some areas they are not declining on a national 
basis 
jay shackford a vice president of the national association of 
home builders notes there are thousands of housing markets 
around the country each of which has its own dynamics driving it 
different economies rates of growth types of households so 
that prices might be rising in some areas while falling in others 
overall shackford says the home builders expect prices 
nationally to increase at or slightly more than the general 
inflation rate the labor departments consumer price index was up 
49 percent at an annual rate through last november 
new home prices should continue to outpace inflation while 
existing home prices should rise at about the rate of inflation 
says david berson chief economist for the federal national 
mortgage association 
according to john savacool a real estate economist with the 
wefa group a bala cynwyd pa forecasting organization the 
last time home prices fell at the national level was during the 
depression in the 1930s 
writing in the current issue of the national association of home 
builders builder magazine savacool notes 
even following the stock market crash in october 1987 when 
25000 people lost their jobs in the new york area home prices 
simply went flat for a year they did not decline on an annual 
basis 
other studies however suggest that with the aging of the baby 
boom and fewer births in the subsequent baby bust era demand for 
housing will decline causing property values to drop as well 
but whether home prices will or will not decline falling 
interest rates are making monthly mortgage payments smaller and 
thus affordable for more people 
federal home loan mortgage corp weekly surveys show rates for 
30year fixedrate mortgages dropped from 1122 percent last march 
to 978 percent by years end 
for a person financing a 75000 home a 10 percent rate 
translates into monthly loan payments of about 658 compared to 
about 714 for a rate of 11 percent according to the home builders 
for someone financing a 150000 home the lower rate reduces 
total monthly prinicpal and interest payments from about 1428 to 
1317 
the mortgage bankers association forecasts that interest rates 
will continue to drop this year to 94 percent on an annual basis 
fannie maes berson also expects interest rates to continue to 
drift downward for a few more months 
the national association of realtors index measuring the ability 
of a typical family to buy a home stood at 1058 last november 
that meant that a family with a median income of 33482 had 1058 
percent of the income needed to buy a medianpriced existing home 
costing 93000 
the monthly principal and interest payment to finance that home 
would total about 236 percent of that familys income the 
realtors said 
another advantage of home ownership is that the mortgage 
interest payments are totally deductible from federal income taxes 
only 10 percent of the interest on most other loans can be deducted 
this year and none will be permitted in subsequent years 
but while moderating interest rates tend to help prospective 
middleincome earners many firsttime buyers are unable to qualify 
financially for a typical starter home 
the realtors most recent affordability index for firsttime 
buyers shows that during the third quarter of 1989 firsttime 
buyers had only 71 percent of the income needed to move from 
renting to owning 
and even if they earned enough to make the monthly payments 
many are unable to raise the 5to20 percent down payment now 
required for many mortgages 
the home builders said the home ownership rate for households in 
the 2529 age group fell from 433 percent in 1980 to 354 percent 
by mid1989 and from 611 percent to 537 percent in the 3034 age 
group

bob hover says financing was the most serious problem he faced 
in his effort to rehabilitate a home in troy mich 
i looked into it but discovered there were no programs for 
which i qualified he says in order to get the funding the 
housing would have to be registered as a landmark 
according to ian spatz director of the center for preservation 
policy studies at the national trust for historic preservation 
federal tax incentives for historic preservation exclude 
owneroccupied buildings but they do apply to rental buildings 
such as bed and breakfasts or apartment buildings 
he says that a number of states and localities offer tax breaks 
or loans in connection with preservation programs but there is no 
central clearinghouse of information on these 
its up to the homeowner to call a local historic group or a 
state preservation agency to inquire if any tax grant loan or 
technical assistance programs exist at the city county or state 
level says spatz who tracks governmental policies on 
preservation as part of his job 
one of the more popular state programs is property tax 
abatement sometimes tied to income level of occupants and 
sometimes to the type of building or neighborhood he says this 
type of help is a local option in connecticut georgia oregon 
washington and illinois 
another typical incentive is a direct tax credit against state 
income tax in maryland says spatz localities are permitted to 
offer such a tax credit and in some owners can save 10 percent on 
property taxes if they spend at least 50000 on restoration in 
wisconsin a 25 percent tax credit is available and colorado is 
considering a similar guideline he says a state income tax saving 
is also available in new mexico and rhode island 
in each state restrictions are made according to the type of 
building and nature of the work standards usually allow changes 
for new use but require retention of basic historic features in 
many localities the building must be located within a historic 
district and be listed with the national register of historic 
places there are 700000 buildings within national register 
historic districts says spatz 
i am not aware of any program that gives you an incentive for 
just purchasing a historic building the incentives are all geared 
to fixing them up he says 
in some localities preservation organizations have loan 
programs a north carolina group for example uses a fund to buy 
historic places in danger of demolition and sells them to people 
who want to fix them up a sweat equity program in new orleans 
makes it possible for people who are willing to restore a building 
to own it the citys preservation resource center works with local 
banks to arrange financing according to spatz 
information if not funding is widely available to those who 
choose to rehabilitate an old building the oldhouse journal is a 
monthly magazine which covers most aspects of buying restoring and 
owning an old house call 18008889070 
the us department of the interior publishes the catalog of 
historic preservation publications which lists government 
pamphlets and books of interest to restorers of old houses its 
free and available from the departments preservation assistance 
division 1100 l street nw washington dc 20013 the national 
trust a private nonprofit organization supported by private funds 
membership dues and some government funding is one of the first 
places to turn for information members receive a monthly 
newsletter and bimonthly magazine and reduced fees for programs 
the national trust answers telephone queries on old house 
restoration conducts workshops and seminars all over the country 
and can put you in touch with preservation organizations in your 
area write to the group at 1785 massachusetts avenue nw 
washington dc 20036 phone 2026734000 
often the first question a prospective owner has concerns the 
property itself the first step should be a complete deed or title 
search in the countys records 
for urban areas sanborn maps that date back to 1867 can be 
invaluable copies of these maps are often found in libraries and 
historical societies which sometimes also can identify other 
sources of local historic information or old photographs that are 
helpful in reconstruction says the trust 
look in the public library for howto books on all aspects of 
old houses local landmark commissions often have information on 
buildings and districts under their jurisdictions and local 
newspapers may have old stories about fires involving the 
properties or obituaries of former owners

the blue and mauve exterior is the icing on the cake for bob 
hover who spent ten years rescuing an 1888 house in troy mich 
from demolition 
he used three shades of blue and two of the mauve from a paint 
companys historic victorian color line colors such as these once 
might have been considered garish but these days bright colors on 
an old building are fashionable 
the trend for colorful houses started in san francisco in the 
1970s and now has moved all over the country according to 
elizabeth pomada and michael larsen whose 1978 book painted 
ladies documented its beginnings 
the color movement isnt funded or directed by anyone it has 
grown because people love the look of the painted houses says 
pomada paint which has saved many old structures by making them 
look better and increasing their value even has played a role in 
the revival of such towns as cape may nj port townsend wash 
and ferndale calif say these writers who recently published a 
new book how to create your own painted lady dutton 
this view is endorsed by historian roger moss whose specialty 
is american 19th century culture moss is coauthor of a howto 
book victorian exterior decoration how to paint your 19th 
century american house historically henry holt amp co 
the cheapest thing you can do to upgrade a single house a 
whole block or a town is to paint it paint is what gives historic 
districts continuity and many communities are adopting color 
guidelines says moss who has advised towns on appropriate 
colors 
in bridgeton nj one of his clients paint led to housing 
renewal since 1983 this south jersey town has been giving free 
paint and custom color schemes developed by moss to lowincome 
residents of deteriorating 19th century homes several hundred 
homes have been painted according to raymond maier director of 
community development 
property values are up and for sale signs are down says 
maier who sees the paint as a catalyst for housing rehabilitation 
and a new attitude of pride people see their old houses as 
charming antiques instead of white elephants and have gotten 
interested in making repairs to roofs and furnaces the town 
requires authentic colors from an extensive choice of hues 
the painted ladies arent really new historical research 
has disclosed that americans of earlier times often did paint their 
homes in bright colors today some people prefer to select these 
historically authentic colors while others please themselves 
as a historian moss says that the special historic colors 
offered by paint companies are not necessarily accurate most of 
them have deviated pretty far from historical documents 
but there are good matches in their regular lines says moss he 
has found acceptable current substitutes for 34 old paint colors by 
comparing the old and new paint charts of sherwinwilliams 
benjamin moore glidden and devoe there also may be many other 
paint lines with appropriate colors 
you dont have to pay for special paints or hire an expert to 
get an authentic paint scheme you just have to know a bit about 
historic colors and if you do minimum research you will find that 
out moss says 
hover who removed layers of paint during the renovation 
considered a chemical analysis to learn what the original house 
color had been but found it too expensive earlier coats of blue 
violet and bright yellow had all blended together by the time he 
began removing them by handsanding 
his interest in selecting a historically accurate color scheme 
is quite typical of homeowners today says new york paint dealer 
neil janovic consumers today crave authenticity even though you 
could duplicate the colors from the regular line the historic 
lines are popular because the label adds peace of mind according 
to janovic 
it would be impossible to exactly match the colors of the past 
because environmental regulations prohibit the use of some 
pigments moss points out a number of states are considering new 
regulations which janovic says could severely curtail the 
availability of oilbased paints 
hover chose oilbased paints for his home he applied three 
coats of a topgrade paint a white prime coat as a base a second 
prime coat in blue and a third coat of finish paint although the 
oilbased paint is harder to work with than waterbased paint he 
thought it would last longer this is disputed by some paint 
manufacturers 
he had satinfinish and semigloss formulations mixed 
halfandhalf to get the degree of shine he wanted he estimates 
cost at about 25 a gallon and that it took from 20 to 30 gallons 
to cover the house with three coats working evenings and weekends 
it has taken him two years to paint the exterior i am still 
painting he adds

the hottest homebuying market today is keyed to the moveup 
buyer the homeowner seeking larger more luxurious and 
comfortable housing according to a survey conducted by better 
homes and gardens real estate service 
finding a home that adequately suits a familys changing 
lifestyle is one of the main motivations behind the moveup rush 
says alen sabbag president of the real estate service 
this accelerating trend is making larger more expensive 
singlefamily homes and threebedroom city condos homes that fit 
the lifestyle and income levels of one out of every three american 
households counted as part of the baby boom generation the 
nations most hotlypursued market he says 
according to the survey 57 percent of home buyers in 1988 fit 
the category of moveup buyers 
a national association of home builders report says 66 percent 
of all home construction is geared to the moveup market 
these buyers are choosing neotraditionalism in their 
housing says joan mccloskey executive building editor of better 
homes and gardens magazine 
they want a traditional exterior including a return to the 
porch but a contemporary interior with special attention aimed at 
the entry she says 
they also seek more space and bigger rooms she says which 
can also mean more lighting within rooms and ceiling heights

regional history influences the popularity of home styles 
throughout the united states says a new yorkbased home building 
and remodeling magazine 
according to practical homeowner the architectural style of a 
house can affect its value by as much as 15 percent 
a survey of real estate industry professionals indicates that 
traditional classically styled homes are good investments because 
they have a higher resale value and are easier to sell the 
magazine reports 
many of those polled said homes with hard geometric lines made 
primarily with concrete glass and steel were trendy a few decades 
ago but seem dated and faddish to todays typical buyer 
the english tradition is strong in the eastern united states 
because that is the style that was prevalent when the region was 
settled the publication adds similarly southern california 
and florida were first colonized by the spanish so spanish style 
is strong there 
the survey showed that new englanders prefer the traditional 
english center hall colonial typically two stories and made of 
wood the estimated added value of that style was 1015 percent 
in the midatlantic and southern states the favorite style is 
the neoclassic brick colonial typical of williamsburg with an 
added value of 5 percent 
other prevalent regional styles with estimated added value 
florida and southern california spanish with white stucco 
walls and tiled roofs 05 percent 
midwest and parts of texas a traditional mix of tudor 
french victorian farmhouse and colonial 310 percent 
southwest new mexico arizona and nevada adobe 515 
percent 
plains and mountain states conventional splitlevel 
contemporary with wood siding 13 percent

you could make more work and storage space in your present home 
by thinking twice can the area serve more than one purpose and is 
there available vertical air space 
even a small kitchen usually can accommodate a multipurpose 
spot for household paperwork and meal planning according to better 
homes amp gardens remodeling ideas magazine 
and consider wallspace and doorspace in addition to floorspace 
advises judith miley spokeswoman for clairson international 
makers of closet and storage systems you may have more cubic 
footage available than you realize 
the key to working out a multipurpose work space is to figure 
out which tasks are done regularly and base the design on those 
needs 
if you cook and entertain frequently then you probably can use 
a desk for meal planning and shelves deep enough for cookbooks the 
same area can double as a family message study and computer 
center complete with wallmounted cabinets shelving bins 
wallphone stationery and books 
you might choose a flat display rack similar to those in stores 
if many of the cookbooks are in large formats a stacked desk and 
shelf combination for the personal computer might be the best 
choice if you manage household accounts on a pc keep in mind that 
reading and writing by hand require a desk height of about 30 
inches while a a computer or typewriter keyboard should be on a 
surface about 26 inches high 
also provide a stable power source for the computer which can 
lose its memory or scramble your work during power surges caused by 
use of other appliances or temporary electrical outages power 
strips or boxes with fused protection against electrical surges and 
spikes available in hardware and electronics stores can be 
mounted easily to existing outlets 
use overhead shelves to store small equipment and other items 
you need frequently but want out of the way a cork bulletin board 
mounted next to the wall phone will cut down desktop clutter 
miley suggests you analyze each room for inventive ways to make 
better use of the space you have 
your bathroom linen closet could be turned into a miniature 
laundry with a compact stackable washerdryer since its often 
right on plumbing mains then linens can be accommodated on 
wallrunning shelves in the bathroom or with tiered shelves in part 
of a nearby closet outside the room if you are replacing the tub 
consider putting the new one on a platform with storage drawers in 
the platform step 
while you can maximize cubic footage for storage as part of a 
renovation project there still are ways to reorganize your 
existing space without rebuilding miley says she suggests using 
stacking shelves doublehanging shelfandrod combinations 
vertical dividers walltowall shelving or even automated 
revolving retrieval systems which her company markets under the 
closet maid and keiji trademarks most of these pieces are based on 
coated metal wire with wood and laminates 
you also can find useable kitchen space by suspending cookware 
and lightweight plants from ceilings where there isnt traffic or 
hanging shallow coatedwire bins in existing shelving put tiered 
shelves in previously unused corners 
you can make space by mounting shoe shelves on closet walls or 
on the interior sides of the closet doors shallow shelves and 
coathooks also can be mounted on doors 
remember safety and convenience plan storage of heavy items 
between knee and shoulder height glideout cabinet organizers for 
better visibility and access mobile storage pieces for use as 
carts to transport appliances food or tableware to other rooms

insulation can do more for your house than just reduce 
temperature transfer it can make it quieter 
fiber glass can absorb airborne sound like television audio or 
voices or conductive sound that moves through the house structure 
from machines plumbing or footsteps according to frank glover of 
owenscorning fiberglas corporation 
the inner walls and ceilings in most homes do not muffle noise 
well says glover to block sound transmission lowdensity 
materials such as fiber glass insulation can be installed inside a 
wall or ceiling 
glover advises homeowners to insulate interior walls and ceiling 
during new home construction or during remodeling the insulation 
should be installed and held in place with resilient channels 
metal strips that break the path of vibration when finishing the 
wall drywall should be fastened to the joists using resilient 
channels caulk any walltofloor and walltoceiling joints that 
are not taped 
openings that have been bored into the walls for plumbing or 
heating pipes should be plugged to keep sound from traveling 
through stuff larger openings with unfaced fiber glass insulation 
and patch smaller cracks and openings with silicone caulking 
glover advises the homeowner not to clamp pipes tightly to 
framing but to line the clamps with spongy materials like neoprene 
washers where pipes run out through finished surfaces infill with 
flexible sealers 
duct systems for air conditioners or heating systems also should 
be insulated to decrease operating noise 
and finally thick wellpadded carpets or a sounddeadening 
board installed between floor and underlayment will absorb noise in 
the room and reduce its transmission to a room below

floors may take the hardest abuse of any part of your home but 
you can refinish them yourself armed with some basic knowledge 
about woods and stains 
here are some tips about floors for doityourselfers from 
fabulon products which makes wood finishes 
to remove stains crosssand the stained area then sand with 
the grain heavy stains may need bleach deep discoloration caused 
by water damage or pet urine may call for board replacement or 
coverage with a dark stain 
bleached areas may not blend perfectly but using a light wood 
stain over the floor may help 
if you need to match a repair but dont know what kind of 
finish is on your floor scrape off a sample and send it to a lab 
for testing if in any doubt you may want to remove all the old 
finish 
to find out if your floor had been prefinished with wax 
scrape near the edges for evidence of wax buildup or apply ammonia 
and let it stand if it turns white wax is present 
if a floor has been maintained with wax the only way to 
prepare it for refinishing is to remove all the old finish by 
sanding if you dont want to refinish the floor try blending worn 
spots with more wax 
you dont necessarily have to remove all the old finish to 
maintain the floor if the finish hasnt been worn down to the bare 
wood and is free of wax and grease buildup all you need to do is 
sand with 100grit or finer sandpaper vacuum thoroughly and 
recoat most floors can be recoated up to six times before complete 
removal is needed 
you usually can rent power equipment to carry out a 
refinishing project these will include a drum sander a disc edge 
sander and an industrial vacuum cleaner average cost is around 50 
per day sandpaper sheets cost about 225 discs 85 cents rental 
stores will usually allow you credit on unused sandpaper so be 
sure to ask for enough coarser grades last longer than finegrit 
papers which need to be changed regularly 
the average floor 10 feet by 12 feet or 150 square feet 
takes about five hours to sand and coat let the first coat of 
finish dry overnight before applying the second coat let the floor 
dry for 24 to 36 hours before replacing furniture 
pick finishes appropriate to use clear acrylics work well in 
bedrooms and living rooms dry quickly without strong odor and can 
be applied over existing coats new wood or a primersealer 
polyurethanes take longer to dry and do not blend or patch well 
but they produce a hard finish and can be used in bedrooms living 
rooms kitchens and baths 
you can sand a prefinished floor one or two times and a 
threequarterinch oak or pine floor about six times before 
replacement each sanding will remove about one thirtysecond of an 
inch of wood 
the company recommends keeping your floor in good condition with 
regular vacuuming and damp mopping with clear water when needed 
using water sparingly a cloth dampened with mineral spirits will 
remove heel marks to renew the luster damp mop with a mixture of 
white vinegar and water six ounces of vinegar to a gallon of 
water

windows are one of the main architectural elements in a house 
and affordable stock windows in many styles that once were only 
custommade can wake up its design according to house beautiful 
magazine 
window design and location have everything to do with the 
success or failure of a building says christopher williams a 
meredith nh architect in an article carried in a recent issue 
of the magazine 
because of the wide choice available you can take advantage of 
new window technology without compromising architectural integrity 
replacement options include style price energy efficiency and 
maintenance when remodeling window size and location also need to 
be taken into account 
most architects advocate respect for period and style but new 
york architect walter chatham warned against rigidity 
the character of the house should guide your choice of 
windows but if the house lacks character entirely you can 
compensate through the windows you choose he says 
there are fanlight windows eyebrows oriels bays all in 
standard sizes use special shapes only with careful attention to 
placement detail and period 
a view having something pleasing to look at and a good way to 
see it is not only an important amenity it can be a valuable 
improvement 
boston architect douglas lemle suggests exploring how you are 
continuously connected to the outdoors its not just a view but 
also the sequence of what your eyes are focusing on as you move 
through your house 
planning a view involves furniture arrangements what will you 
be able to see from where you sit or stand at what time of day 
thoughtful window expansion not only stretches your view but 
also increases the natural light in your home 
the effect of the light from skylights can be spectacular 
lemle says but warns they can create glare 
installing a small skylight in a corner rather than a large one 
in the center of a room will let the light bounce off corner walls 
suffusing it across the area 
design professionals suggest placing windows on two walls of a 
room with the glass area adding up to at least 10 percent of floor 
area 
the direction of light affects energy conservation westfacing 
windows tend to produce a lot of heat the general rule is to 
reduce the amount of glass on the side of the house thats most 
exposed to heat gain 
if your view is westward window shades exterior awnings roof 
overhangs and trellises can help reduce heat chatham says placing 
windows high up on a wall can light a big area with a small 
amount of glass 
glass is available with a lowemissivity lowe coating with 
argon gas injected between layers or with both 
industry sources say that lowe glazing has an r3 value while 
windows with both lowe coating and argon gas perform at r4 that 
means four times the energy efficiency of singlethickness glass 
hightech products are not the only answer williams says his 
new england architectural practice often requires him to provide 
natural summer cooling 
casements direct ventilation just as sails do to the point 
where breezes can actually be made to flow through a building he 
says 
before you buy compare the qualities of products from different 
window makers and ask for expert assistance 
specifications vary from manufacturer to manufacturer new 
york city architect laurence tamaccio told judith trotsky in house 
beautiful you cant ask too many questions

what do a medieval cathedral a storm door in rhode island a 
shower stall in arizona and a light fixture in missouri share in 
common 
the answer stained glass 
the ancient craft of making colored glass cutting it into 
pieces to make intricate designs then framing the pieces with 
heated lead began in europe in the middle ages 
today there are few practitioners of this medieval craft but a 
modern version of stained glass is available to homeowners through 
a patented overlay system that uses everyday or tempered glass 
already in place 
its bringing new light color attractive customdesign 
patterns and even a substantial boost in resale value to homeowners 
around the nation and in 21 other countries says william slippy 
jr executive vice president of stained glass overlay of irvine 
calif 
the process starts by positioning the desired design on paper 
on one side of a glass section then cementing flexible lead strips 
into place by hand on the other following the design lines 
colored coverings translucently thin but durable are razored 
to fit then cemented into place this material can be textured or 
smooth 
the new system slippy says has led to an international 
franchise network of artisans who can create and install a 
customized stained glass overlay in a few days rather than weeks 
one of the artisanentrepreneurs don mitchell of st charles 
mo points out that an inhome light fixture made by the original 
stained glass method would weigh about 80 pounds 
we can create the same decorative fixture with the same 
design and it weighs eight pounds mitchell says

wood one of the worlds oldest building materials is aging 
well 
processes to improve its wearing and weathering qualities and a 
new appreciation of its natural insulating qualities contribute to 
its continued popularity as a building and remodeling material 
the trade association for makers of wood windows and doors as 
well as suppliers of pressuretreated wood for outdoor use both 
report healthy and growing sales despite the fact that housing 
starts dropped in l988 
because of its honeycombshaped cell structure wood is a 
natural thermal insulator containing a high percentage of 
insulatingrich air within the wood fibers points out john w 
shoemaker of the national wood window and door association which 
reported a 20 percent rise in sales last year 
the associations research on wood doors showed that wood 
expands and contracts less than steel during temperature changes 
thus maintaining a tighter fit with weatherstripping 
woods aesthetic quality also contributes to its popularity 
shoemaker adds 
woods to be used outdoors such as in decks and patios are in 
higher demand because more americans spend leisure time outdoors 
according to a better homes and gardens consumer panel survey 50 
percent say they are doing more entertaining outdoors americans 
are snatching up new products which help to create more interesting 
and useful outdoor environments where they spend their time says 
john cashmore weyerhaeuser lifewood program manager among these 
are preturned millwork in a variety of styles that can be used in 
building decks and other structures decorative spindles railings 
lattice panels finials and posts have notches and grooves that 
make assembly easy 
the most durable woods proabably are those treated under 
pressure with chromated copper arsenate cca to resist fungus 
mildew and termites cca penetrates the wood creating a molecular 
bond that prevents leaching and chemical seepage some care is 
needed in handling pressuretreated wood which has come under 
environmental protection agency scrutiny for potential hazards due 
to the arsenic epa advises sawing the wood outdoors using a 
dustmask washing thoroughly before eating drinking or smoking 
washing workclothes separately and to dispose of scraps by burial 
or landfill trash collection instead of burning the agency 
recommends not using the wood for for kitchen livestock feeders or 
food storage projects 
treated wood needs some maintenance such as cleaning and 
preserving to protect against weathering 
a deck cleaner like cuprinols revive can be used to pretreat 
wood before staining or preserving or use a 5050 solution of 
household bleach and water then apply stains or preservatives 
dap which makes many of these recommends saturating wood surfaces 
for maximum protection 
if youre got damaged old wood you might try mr macs 
woodfix used wih fiber glass cloth this polymerbased substance 
can repair and rebuild splintered rotted chipped blistered and 
mildewed wood

outdoor lights can dramatize your house and yard letting you 
enjoy your garden or pool for longer periods during the day while 
increasing security 
you can set up a lighting design of your own by using one of the 
new lowvoltage lighting kits that contain all the essentials 
stake or mounted fixtures transformer cords and switches one 
maker of the kits toro has some advice about getting the most 
pleasing and professionallooking results 
first draw a scale plan of your yard on graph paper showing 
location of paths or walks gardens statuary and the house note 
any architectural details youd like to play up or utility areas 
you want to play down identify focal points and lines of sight you 
want to emphasize then note where you think fixtures will do the 
best highlighting 
using the graph as a guide set up the equipment and test it 
at night finetune the result by moving the fixtures until youre 
satisfied with the mood and effect 
lights can add depth to a shallow yard if you use brighter 
lights near the house and dimmer lights in the distance 
uplighting shining lights up into trees and bushes is best 
for creating emphasis and mood downlighting while not as 
dramatic serves doubleduty for functional lighting in access 
areas such as paths and drives moonlighting shining a light down 
from high in a tree can diffuse light over a large area 
in most cases cords need not be buried for safety though for 
appearance you may want to conceal them in a shallow trench or 
cover them with gravel or wood chips cords should be buried under 
the turf where you may be mowing grass 
the companys kits contain parts designed to snap together 
without tools and you can begin with a starter kit and add on 
later fixtures come in durable plastics or redwood with stakes to 
position them in the ground or mounts for trees and buildings the 
weatherproof lowvoltage equipment is safe economical and delivers 
both dim and bright lighting toro says optional features include 
timers or photoelectric sensors to turn the systems on 
automatically motion detectors wired and wireless remote 
controls and indoor security alarms 
basic kits cost about 50 toro estimates cost of an average 
installation at about 200

with the luxury of having your own pool comes the responsibility 
of making sure the water isnt contaminated 
signs of contamination are easy to spot but they may not be 
what you expect says randy redd a du pont chemical engineer 
most people think that if they can small chlorine the water is 
clean but a strong chlorine odor is the smell of chloramines the 
contaminated part of water chloramines are the chemical result of 
the reaction between chlorine and organic contaminants 
that heavy chlorine smell or water that irritates your eyes or 
is cloudy signals contamination 
common contaminants are suntan oil sweat rain leaves and 
other windblown debris that may find their way into the water 
redd whose company makes impact a monosulfate used in making 
oxygenbased speed shocks for treating water recommends 
maintaining your pool every two weeks repeat the maintenance 
routine any time there has been heavy use or heavy rain or when 
the warning signs are present oxygenbased shocking can be 
done quickly with pool water ready for swimming within 15 minutes 
the shocks should be used in conjunction with normal sanitizing and 
algae control 
in contrast he says with chlorination it may be eight to 10 
hours before the pool can be used it also needs elaborate precise 
calculation to administer since insufficient chlorine can make the 
water dirtier and that makes it such a chore that many pool owners 
only handle it a few times a year

the head of centrust savings bank blames political 
aspirations and powerhungry regulators for the widening probe into 
finances at the troubled thrift 
things like this happened in the early 1930s in germany 
said david paul who is challenging a state order seeking his 
ouster 
last week the treasury departments office of thrift 
supervision halted trading of centrust stock which had fallen to 
75 cents claiming the thrift misrepresented its financial picture 
in its latest filings the ban the first against a bank since 
1983 is due to be lifted tuesday 
the thrift office believes centrust would be insolvent if it 
accurately reported its holdings including more then 900 million 
in highrisk junk bonds 
centrust which reported a 119 million loss for the fiscal year 
ended sept 30 also is being investigated as part of a junk bond 
trading probe by the house banking subcommittee 
subcommittee members may subpeona paul to testify about his 
links to former drexel burnham lambert inc junk bond wizard 
michael milken and charles keating the key figure in the 25 
billion collapse of lincoln savings and loan of irvine calif the 
miami herald reported sunday 
the herald also cited unnamed sources saying federal and state 
banking regulators met last week with representatives of us 
attorney dexter lehtinen in miami spokesmen for the thrift office 
and the us attorney refused comment 
i dont think centrust will be here two years from now and i 
dont think david paul will be involved in the management of a 
regulated institution said state deputy comptroller larry fuchs 
paul acknowledged that centrust is under investigation by the 
securities and exchange commission and the internal revenue 
service but he said he does not believe the probe involves his 
personal finances 
paul 50 who took over the institution in 1983 collected more 
than 48 million in salary and benefits from january 1988 to 
september 1989 and has been criticized by state officials for 
lavish spending practices 
but paul claims centrust is the target of a crusade by federal 
regulators and state comptroller gerald lewis who is running for 
reelection this year 
what you have here is intergovernment agencies investigating 
initiated by the comptrollers office said paul whose initials 
dlp is the centrust stock symbol the government is very 
powerful has a lot of money and in general is scary 
among the aspects being scrutinized by regulators are centrusts 
30 million investment in paintings a company yacht and lavish 
expenses and salaries 
state officials say they have a sworn statement that centrust 
funds paid for pauls residential telephone bills garbage 
collection and about 150000 in other household items 
paul said the paintings were the biggest mistake of his 
life but he denied many of the other charges about corporate 
expenses 
i think youve got a government out of control said paul 
these people are just doing anything they want at any time and 
the press jumps on the bandwagon and takes their unverified 
allegations as truth

independent truckers connected to 42 hauling 
companies plan to picket the port of houston and railway terminals 
to protest low rates and rising diesel costs 
diesel fuel has gone up for me 25 cents a gallon in a month 
said wade richardson a houston trucker i cant turn around to 
these shippers and say i need 25 cents more per gallon theyd 
laugh in my face 
about 150 truckers with leases to the companies gathered 
saturday to organize the picketing which they hope will shut the 
port today richardson said 500 truckers are expected to park at 
the port and join the action 
trucks also will be parked and pickets set up at 16 other points 
in houston and galveston including the santa fe railway and 
southern pacific transportation co terminals he said sunday 
we expect to shut the port of houston down and the 
railroads said attice warren a houston trucker and organizer of 
the strike 
the terminals and port were chosen richardson and warren said 
because most of the truckers involved haul containers from trains 
and ships 
he said truckers and their companies are at the mercy of cheap 
hauling rates paid by steamship agencies 
diesel costs 121 a gallon in houston the american automobile 
association said it was as high as 244 a gallon in maine 
recently 
the truckers also said maintenance insurance and regulatory 
costs have diminished their earnings 
weve just gotten to the point where theres nothing left to 
take warren said 
the highways are arteries of the nation the truckers are the 
blood we deliver the nutrients and take away the waste we should 
make a livable wage he said 
rita bontz president of independent truckers and drivers 
association in baltimore md said her organization which has 
members in 30 states did not plan to take part in any picketing 
there are problems but there are other ways to address them 
she said 
were telling truckers that a shutdown is not the best way to 
deal with this said todd spencer spokesman for the 
10600member owneroperator independent drivers association in 
oak grove mo 
spencer said rumors of a wildcat strike have been circulating 
nationwide especially from the carolinas and texas for about 
three weeks 
what were trying to do is monitor and defuse the situation 
he said 
richardson is on the board of houston container haulers a group 
of several hundred drivers but said the group is not calling for 
the strike 
the group gathered attention in october with a convoy of 450 
trucks that drove the interstate loop around houston in a protest 
of low hauling rates

here are the projected outlays of the federal 
government broken down by major function of the government 
according to the spending plan sent to congress by president bush 
on monday 
the years shown are the governments fiscal years running from 
october of one calendar year through september of the next for 
example the 1991 fiscal year begins oct 1 1990 and runs through 
sept 30 1991 
offsetting receipts are funds received for several 
activities but not applied to functional categories that must be 
counted to get totals these are shown as negative numbers an 
example is the money the government earns as royalties for oil 
wells in federal waters offshore 
receipts are the overall amounts the government receives 
from all sources taxes fees royalties duties and so forth 
the numbers shown are in billions of dollars 
columns may not add to totals shown because of rounding 
the deficit results from the government spending more money than 
it takes in and is made up by borrowing 
the minus sign before the projected deficit for 1993 denotes a 
projected surplus

squirrel away up to 5000 a year and earn taxfree interest 
bush is counting on a healthy economy to help boost government 
revenue in 1991 by 9 percent while he would hold the overall 
increase in spending to 3 percent he also would gain 139 billion 
in a variety of minor new taxes and user fees charged to provide 
government services 
savings would come in the pentagon budget where the 
administration is proposing a sweeping reordering of the nations 
defense priorities to reflect the lessening of eastwest tensions 
the governments huge medicare health program also would be 
targeted for reductions along with smaller cuts in such programs 
as farm subsidies lowincome energy assistance and college student 
loans 
bush would reallocate the money saved to boost spending on such 
programs as environmental protection education space and the war 
on drugs 
bushs budget calls for spending 1233 trillion in 1991 while 
projecting revenues of 1170 trillion that would leave a budget 
deficit of 631 billion which if realized would be the smallest 
amount of red ink since 1979 bush estimated the current years 
deficit at 1238 billion 
the projected 1991 deficit would be just below the 64 billion 
target established by the grammrudman law which mandates a 
balanced budget by 1993 bush said he would hit that target 
proposing a surplus of 57 billion that year 
the specific details on the budget were revealed in interviews 
and in documents obtained by the associated press 
even before the budget was released critics were accusing the 
administration of adopting an overly rosy economic scenario which 
inflates the amount of taxes the government is likely to take in 
while not calling bushs budget dead on arrival the epithet 
hurled at most of reagans spending plans democrats in congress 
left no doubt that they intended to challenge bush on many of the 
proposals 
senate budget committee chairman james sasser dtenn said the 
bush plan would get a very chilly and negative reaction on the 
hill 
the most bruising fights were likely to revolve around bushs 
renewed push for a cut in the capital gains tax and over a rival 
democratic proposal advanced by sen daniel moynihan dny to 
provide a 62 billion cut in social security taxes this year and 
next 
moynihan claims that the surpluses accumulating in the social 
security trust fund are being used to mask the real budget deficit 
rather than being saved for the baby boomers retirement 
bushs budget proposed an alternative plan to begin using a 
portion of the social security surpluses to reduce the national 
debt 
democrats also were upset with bushs military budget which 
proposed spending 3033 billion which amounted to a 2 percent cut 
when compared to the costs of inflation 
critics were unhappy because bushs budget proposed to reduce 
troops and civilian defense department employees by 38000 while 
protecting such pet projects as the strategic defense initiative 
nuclear shield 
to meet the pareddown spending levels the defense department 
was proposing a sweeping list of military base closings also a 
bone of contention with congress 
outside of the pentagon the biggest proposed reduction came in 
an 85 billion cut in the projected growth of the medicare program 
for the elderly and handicapped the money would be saved by 
cutting payments to hospitals and doctors but congress balked at a 
similar proposal last year 
bush proposed other cuts for farm programs and in payments to 
retired federal workers 
the budget also includes 
500 million more for head start the preschool program for 
poor children putting total spending at 19 billion 
an increase of 11 billion for the war on drugs boosting 
total spending to 106 billion 
a hefty increase in spending for the national aeronautics and 
space administration with gains also coming to fund development of 
the giant atomsmasher known as the supercollider 
new spending of more than 2 billion to fund an america the 
beautiful program that would accelerate the cleanup of hazardous 
waste dumps and launch a massive tree planting program to combat 
the effects of global warming 
the administrations proposed family savings accounts would 
allow individuals to invest up to 2500 a year and families to 
invest up to 5000 annually in taxfree savings accounts as long 
as the money was not withdrawn for at least seven years 
the administration seeking to counter a plan advanced by sen 
lloyd bentsen dtexas also proposed easing current restrictions 
on individual retirement accounts to allow savings to be withdrawn 
without penalty before retirement if the money was used for a 
firsttime purchase of a home 
bushs budget document represented his first full budget 
outline last february he submitted a 193page list of amendments 
to reagans final budget

the number of working us oil and gas rigs 
continued to decline dropping by 27 this week to 937 baker hughes 
inc reported 
despite the decrease the rig count was higher than the 797 
total posted for the same week last year baker hughes said monday 
in the previous week the count tumbled dropping by 55 to 964 
experts blamed the decline on bad weather in some states and a 
general seasonal decline 
baker hughes rig count the widely watched industry index of 
drilling activity reflects the number of rotary rigs actively 
exploring for oil and gas as of last friday not the number of 
producing wells 
ike kerridge a baker hughes vice president and economist said 
the rig count generally declines during the first quarter the 
count he said probably will bottom out in march or april 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaker company that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the rig count since 1940 
in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 
per 42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in 
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes 
began compiling figures 
among major oil producing states louisiana lost 17 rigs and 
oklahoma was down 12 wyoming lost six michigan was down by four 
and pennsylvania lost two

the food and drug administration today banned 
some uses of the color additive red no 3 saying studies have 
shown that in very high doses it causes cancer in laboratory 
animals 
todays action prevents further use of this color additive in 
about onefifth of its uses in cosmetics such as lipsticks in 
externally applied drugs and as a pigment form called lakes in 
food drugs and cosmetics the fda said in a news release 
it said that because studies showed the risk from using red no 
3 is considered small consumers may continue using existing 
supplies of products that contain the color additive 
the fda also said it is in the process of extending the ban to 
cover those uses for which red no 3 still is approved 
some products use both the straight form of the dye as well as a 
pigment form called a lake it is the lakes or tints that are 
being banned so products that use both will have to stop using the 
lake form but can continue using the straight dye 
products for which use is banned include shampoos lipsticks 
powders skincare products baking mixes wax coatings for cheese 
chewing gum confections and frostings gelatins puddings 
fillings hard candy herbs spices seasonings processed fruits 
and juices drug tablet formulations and liquid drug preparations 
catherine j bailey consumer safety officer at fda said 
products for which some use is still approved include soft candy 
breakfast cereals hard candy juices meat products chewing gum 
maraschino cherries icings cake decorations cakes plant protein 
products canned puddings and sweet rolls 
all uses of red no 3 in cosmetics is being banned 
other red dyes are approved for use in foods drugs and 
cosmetics the fda said 
the fda has been studying red no 3 for 30 years under pressure 
from industry groups and members of congress the agency has been 
reluctant to impose a ban 
the actual risk posed by red no 3 is extremely small 
however federal law in this area is clear said dr louis 
sullivan secretary of the health and human services department 
there have been laboratory studies which showed that very high 
doses of red no 3 administered directly in the diet caused 
cancer in rats he said in these circumstances small as the 
risk is we have no choice under the law but to end the provisional 
listing of this product he said 
sullivan said the fdas action illustrates the rigidity of the 
law and said congress should consider updating the statutes to 
reflect advances in the methods of scientific assessment that were 
not available when the law was originally passed in 1960 
the risk of getting cancer from red no 3 is no larger than 1 in 
100000 over a lifetime of consumption the fda said in 
comparison the risk from natural disasters is about 70 in 100000 
and from disasters such as railroad accidents and air crashes the 
risk is about 6 in 100000 the agency said 
the red dye has been on a provisional list since 1960 when 
congress called for a ban on foods that cause cancer in laboratory 
animals at the time about 200 color additives were put on the 
provisional list allowing them to stay on the market for an 
additional two years pending further study 
over the years the fda has granted dozens of extensions to 
allow red no 3 to remain on the provisional list 
the fdas action terminating provisional uses of the dye 
removes the last of the full color additives from the provisional 
list although tints of certain permanently listed colors remain on 
the list

president bush today sent congress a 123 
trillion budget for next year that slows the growth in military 
spending in response to dramatic changes in the world and calls 
for no general tax increase as part of a plan to cut the federal 
deficit by half 
bush proposed hefty spending increases for the 1991 fiscal year 
in space exploration cleaning up the environment and the head 
start preschool program he also recommended cuts in medicare 
college student loans and farm subsidies among other domestic 
programs 
bushs budget the first one he has written from scratch was 
certain to provoke sharp debate in the democraticcontrolled 
congress 
with an eye toward future growth and expansion of the human 
frontier the budgets chief emphasis is on investment in the 
future bush said in a written message that introduced the 
1569page budget 
at the same time the budget maintains a strong national 
defense while reflecting the dramatic changes in the world 
political situation that are taking place and it fulfills 
responsibilities to protect the environment and preserve americas 
cultural heritage bush said 
his plan calls for 3033 billion for defense a cut of 2 
percent after inflation is taken into account and a reflection of 
the reduction in tension produced by political change in eastern 
europe 
bushs plan renews the presidents call for a tax cut for 
capital gains which critics say would benefit the wealthy and 
introduces a new family savings account aimed at middleclass 
taxpayers who could squirrel away up to 5000 a year and earn 
interest tax free 
the presidents outline proposed cutting the federal deficit to 
631 billion in the 1991 budget year and if the target is met it 
would be the lowest federal deficit in more than a decade the 
president estimated this years red ink at 1238 billion far 
above the grammrudman deficit reduction target of 100 billion 
this is a listentowhatisay and forgetwhatido budget it 
predicts huge fiscal problems ahead and then goes on to propose no 
change in course said sen james sasser dtenn chairman of 
the senate budget committee this document may put a very low 
ceiling on what we can expect to accomplish with the deficit this 
year 
the administrations plan promises to balance the budget by 
1993 as called for in the grammrudman law but to do that it 
relies heavily on forecasts for economic growth and interest rates 
that many economists believe are overly optimistic 
bush forecasts that the overall economy will grow by 26 percent 
this year when measured from the fourth quarter of 1989 an 
assumption that most private analysts believe is too optimistic by 
nearly 1 percentage point 
the budget document concedes that for every 1 percentage point 
shortfall in growth the budget deficit will be increased by 18 
billion 
while not calling bushs budget dead on arrival the epithet 
hurled at most of the reagan administrations spending plans 
democrats in congress left no doubt that they planned to challenge 
many domestic cuts while seeking to get even more savings out of 
the defense department 
house speaker thomas foley dwash said congress would demand 
a bigger cut in defense and house majority leader richard gephardt 
dmo challenged the proposed medicare cuts as too deep weve 
been cutting each and every year in this program 
proposed cuts in programs such as farm subsidies federal 
retirees benefits and benefits to help the poor pay their heating 
bills have been recommended before and created sharp debate in 
congress 
bushs defense budget proposed trimming military personnel by 
38000 accompanied by an effort to close military bases 
nationwide at the same time it protected expensive weapons 
programs such as the star wars nuclear shield which would receive 
a 1 billion spending increase 
the capital gains tax proposal was expected to generate another 
bruising congressional fight just as it did last year with the 
new twist of a rival proposal from sen daniel moynihan dny to 
provide a 62 billion cut in social security taxes this year and 
next 
moynihan charges that the social security surpluses are not 
being saved for the baby boomers retirement as intended but 
instead are being used to mask the true size of the deficit 
to counteract that argument the administration put in the 
budget a proposal to use a portion of the surpluses beginning in 
1993 to reduce the national debt 
the various cuts in domestic programs totalled 139 billion in 
savings with 55 billion of that coming from trims in doctor and 
hospitals payments in the giant medicare health care program 
other major program cuts included 18 billion in farm price 
supports and crop insurance and savings of 29 billion by limiting 
pension increases to federal civilian retirees and by restraining 
cost of living increases to civilian and military government 
workers aid to urban mass transit systems would be cut sharply and 
lowincome energy assistance would be trimmed by 340 million to 
less than 11 billion 
bush recommended eliminating the federal subsidy to amtrak 
which amounted to slightly more than 600 million for the current 
fiscal year 
the money saved from the cuts would be channeled to programs 
slated for increases 
one of the biggest gains would come in spending commitments for 
space exploration scheduled to jump 24 percent with extra money 
over the next several years for an orbiting space station and for a 
down payment on manned trips to the moon and mars 
other budget details 
a hefty increase in the war on drugs boosting total spending 
in 1991 to 97 billion commitments for future years would push 
the total to 106 billion 
500 million more for head start the preschool program for 
poor childen putting total spending at 19 billion 
new spending of more than 2 billion to fund an america the 
beautiful program that would accelerate the cleanup of hazardous 
waste dumps and launch a massive tree planting program to combat 
the effects of global warming 
a 16 percent increase in spending for aviation programs to 
expand airport capacity and upgrad the air controller system 
a 3 billion increase in foreign aid to 142 billion with 
much of the money targeted for assistance to eastern europe and 
antidrug efforts in central and south america 
bush devoted one section of the budget to ideas for advancing 
states as laboratories promising to reduce federal controls so 
state governors and legislators have greater latitude to try new 
methods of attacking problems 
bush called for no general tax increase in keeping with his 
1988 campaign pledge but he recommended 56 billion in user 
fees such as charges to drug companies to cover the cost of 
federal drug testing 
the administrations proposed family savings accounts would 
allow individuals to invest up to 2500 a year and families to 
invest up to 5000 annually in taxfree savings accounts as long

among the economys problems are several that 
should have been dealt with long ago but werent procrastination 
has made them grow 
oil is among the problems as it was back in the 1970s the cost 
of medical care is another and a whole basket of financial issues 
the low savings rate the budget and trade deficits and debt at 
every level make up more 
though it has been a growing problem for decades nobody seems 
to have the answer to rising medical costs 
insurers have cracked down on wasteful practices and hospitals 
are more efficiently run than before but health is a unique 
business advances in technology tend to lower costs in most 
industries not in medicine 
cars and other manufactured products have builtin obsolescence 
it does not pay to perfect them when human lives are involved 
there is no such restraint the attempt must be made 
nobody has the answer and year by year the cost of medical care 
rises faster than the rate of general inflation you do not even 
have to review the statistics to know that this was so last year 
and the year before and before that too 
emphasizing the problem a large employee benefits consultant 
a foster higgins amp co today released a survey of 1943 
employers it found that the cost of employer medical plans soared 
204 percent in 1989 
that increase brought the average cost of medical plans to 
2600 last year from 2160 in 1988 add in the cost of dental 
plans and health maintenance organizations it says and the 
average rose to 2748 from 2354 
answers to the problem have most often been sought in more 
efficient delivery of medical care but that having failed to 
contain costs the newer efforts may be made in curtailment of care 
in other words the problem may be as much ethical as medical or 
economic 
the oil problem was supposed to have been settled a decade ago 
or at least it seemed that way from the promises the united states 
would raise domestic production simultaneously with mainly 
selfimposed restraints by users 
it seemed to work solar power was developed domestic 
production rose homeowners insulated their houses the automotive 
industry learned to get more miles per gallon and utilities learned 
to burn fuel more efficiently 
the various efforts produced results with the rate of 
consumption falling behind the rate of economic expansion 
conservation was working and operators of the oil cartel were 
forced to lower prices 
never again americans seemed to say and they backed their 
words with statistical proof but as inflation fell and the economy 
rose and as a sense of security returned many of the promises 
were forgotten 
now says economist edward yardeni the new decade begins with 
americans as dependent on foreign oil as we were just before the 
oil crisis of 1979 yardeni an optimist who sees a lot more 
strength in the us economy than many of his colleagues 
nevertheless is worried that america is vulnerable to another oil 
shock he calls it is a serious threat to his optimism 
the numbers underscore his fears last year the decline in 
domestic oil production was the biggest for any year ever more 
than half a million barrels a day to just 76 million barrels a 
day lowest in 26 years 
meanwhile imports of crude oil and petroleum products have been 
soaring in 1985 those imports ran about 51 million barrels a 
day last year the comparable figure was 8 million barrels 
unlike the health care situation where a true dilemma exists 
the answers to the oil challenge are known the only thing lacking 
is the sense of urgency that would implement them and that could 
come this year

the stock market closed lower in volatile 
trading today driven partly by interestrate worries and concerns 
about financing of leveraged buyouts 
the market opened higher then fluctuated wildly throughout the 
session 
wall street analysts said disarray in the junk bond market 
pressured takeoverrelated stocks and helped drive the market 
lower particularly transportation issues 
although some traders said the market was in for a technical 
rebound after the recent selloff there was little to provide 
momentum the market has lost about 8 percent since the start of 
the year after hitting a record high of 281015 on jan 1 the 
dow jones industrial average has dropped 250 points as of last 
friday when it closed at 255923 
analysts said investors remained concerned about the level of 
interest rates and their attractiveness to foreign investors 
the problem is concern about foreign investors not 
participating in our markets said larry wachtel vice president 
with prudentialbache securities inc at what interest rate would 
it take to get them to participate 
they said players were reluctant to make commitments ahead of 
next weeks treasury refunding which could determine the level at 
which foreign investors are willing to buy us bonds 
the market is oversold right now its looking for a technical 
rebound but with interest rates expected to remain unstable its 
difficult to sustain anything on the upside said richard 
ciardullo head trader for raymond james amp associates in st 
petersburg fla 
higher interest rates would be a negative for the stock market 
because it would make government securities more competitive

united auto workers union president owen bieber 
held out hope monday that fridays scheduled closing of chryslers 
corps jefferson avenue assembly plant in detroit could be put off 
bieber said the plants closing which will put about 1700 
people out of work will be among the issues he talks about tuesday 
with chrysler chairman lee iacocca and other company executives 
im always going to take advantage of one last day to make one 
more pitch to see if theres anything that can be done bieber 
said 
his chances of success are practically nonexistent the uaw 
earlier proposed that chrysler continue limited production of the 
dodge omni and plymouth horizon subcompacts at the plant and sell 
them to targeted groups of consumers chrysler rejected that plan 
chrysler and general motors corp have announced plant closings 
or production reductions that will result in the indefinite layoffs 
of more than 13000 auto workers by the end of march ford motor 
co has been able to avoid indefinite layoffs by trimming overtime 
and rotating temporary layoffs 
chrysler announced in november that its jefferson avenue 
assembly plant which has been making cars since 1907 and chrysler 
products since 1924 will be shut down feb 2 about two years 
earlier than planned 
the plant will be replaced in 1992 by the jefferson north plant 
now under construction next to the existing factory on detroits 
east side the new plant will make sportutility vehicles beginning 
for the 1993 model year 
chrysler invoked language in its contract with the uaw allowing 
it to close a plant when sales slip as has happened with the omni 
and horizon cars but the uaw is contesting the closing saying 
chrysler did too little to keep the cars introduced in the 1978 
model year alive 
bieber said he and iacocca have other topics to discuss 
we want to talk to them about the whole question of employment 
and job security whats going to happen to the workers not only at 
jefferson but at the others and the industry as a whole bieber 
said at a news conference before speaking to the economic club of 
detroit 
bieber tried to sidestep a question about bargaining priorities 
when the union opens talks with each of the big three automakers in 
july the uaw contracts with the automakers expire at midnight 
sept 14 
the leader of the 1millionmember union said bargaining 
priorities will be set at a special uaw bargaining convention 
beginning may 21 in kansas city mo 
however he said obviously job security has got to be an 
issue that i feel very comfortable the delegates are going to say 
is of primary importance so job security has got to be no 1 
bieber also reiterated the unions support for a national 
healthcare program for years automakers have complained about 
soaring worker healthcare costs and some automakers have 
estimated that health insurance programs add hundreds of dollars to 
the price of every new car

the strength in the crude oil trading pits partly reflected 
speculation about future refiner demand said andrew lebow a 
broker at edampf man international futures inc 
some of the buying was due to internal market dynamics such as 
short covering he said noting that it was difficult to pinpoint 
specific reasons why energy prices were bid higher short covering 
involves buying back a previously sold commodity

soybean futures prices rebounded sharply monday from 
lifeofcontract lows in a move that could mark a turnaround in the 
market after a sixweek slide 
most grain futures also advanced on the chicago board of trade 
on other commodity markets oil futures rose strongly pork bellies 
posted limit losses while livestock futures were mixed and 
precious metals declined 
soybean futures settled 5 cents to 8 cents higher in chicago 
with the contract for delivery in march up 5 cents at 563 a 
bushel 
wheat futures ended 2 cents lower to 1 cents higher with march 
at 378 a bushel corn was cent to 1 cents higher with march 
at 239 a bushel oats were 1 cent higher across the board with 
march at 138 a bushel 
during the session march soybeans traded as low as 553 a 
bushel eclipsing the contracts previous low of 557 but 
finished above the previous sessions high of 561 
technical analysts call such a performance a key reversal 
it often signals the end of a longterm trend 
if youre going to look for places to buy the market i think 
this is it at least for a little while said pat oconnell 
grains analyst with the futures brokerage refco inc in chicago 
wheat and corn futures also closed above their lows for the day 
but analysts said those reversals were less significant than the 
soybean markets performance 
soybeans had opened mixed with selling pressure stemming from 
reports of beneficial rain over the weekend in the soybean fields 
of argentina the market made its lows before noon cst then headed 
higher along with the wheat market which was rallying strongly on 
its own technical signals 
wheats rally stalled but the soybeans kept climbing into the 
close 
when the key reversal was established the market just fed on 
itself said anne frick senior oilseed analyst with 
prudentialbache securities inc in new york 
thats what gave us that extra 2 cents or so that little push 
up to the final high for the day she said 
wheat and soybean futures prices have been slipping since 
middecember due to a lack of export demand and improved growing 
conditions for winter wheat and the south american soybean crop 
soybean and corn traders will soon begin to focus on crop 
weather in the corn belt where planting begins in about three 
months a 90day forecast issued monday by the national weather 
service predicted drierthannormal weather for western corn belt 
states through the end of april which could be a supportive signal 
for prices 
petroluem futures rose strongly paced by the february gasoline 
and heatingoil contracts which cease trading on wednesday 
volatile price swings often precede contract expirations as traders 
scurry to escape or secure delivery commitments 
crude oil futures rose on the new york mercantile exchange in 
technically inspired buying in the absence of significant 
supplyanddemand developments 
west texas intermediate crude oil finished 26 cents to 34 cents 
higher with march at 2280 a barrel heating oil was 67 cent to 
151 cents higher with february at 6111 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 36 cent to 85 cent higher with february at 6282 
cents a gallon 
most frozen porkbelly futures fell the permitted daily limit of 
2 cents a pound on the chicago mercantile exchange marking the 
second straight day of limit losses 
analysts said the collapse reflected a combination of technical 
sell signals weak cash markets slack demand for fresh bellies by 
bacon slicers and high slaughter rates last week 
livestock futures were mostly lower 
live cattle settled 30 cent lower to 05 cent higher with 
february at 7930 cents a pound feeder cattle were 03 cent to 17 
cent lower with march at 8327 cents a pound live hogs were 17

joe montana seemed like just the tonic wall 
street needed to cure its january ills 
but not even a lopsided victory by the san francisco 49ers in 
sundays super bowl could inspire stock traders monday who sent 
the dow jones industrial average down another 585 points to 
255338 
the average of 30 bluechip stocks is off more than 250 points 
since hitting a record high of 281015 on jan 2 
according to market lore a super bowl victory by a team from 
the original national football league before its merger with the 
american football league has usually been followed by an up year 
for stock prices 
now granted theres still time for the market to rally over 
the course of 1990 but if mondays performance is any indication 
stock traders arent in the mood for fun and games 
there might have been 40 or 50 people buying on the super bowl 
outcome but the big money i can assure you wasnt said yale 
hirsch a stock adviser in old tappan nj and publisher of the 
stock traders almanac 
in his annual almanac hirsch says the direction stock prices 
take in january has foreshadowed the full years outcome correctly 
all but three times since 1950 this january he said will be no 
exception as he forecasts a bearish economy in 1990 super bowl 
victory or not 
its a marvelous phenomenon thats very entertaining but ill 
be damned if the outcome of a football game can predict the outlook 
for the economy hirsch said 
yet a glimmer of hope ran through a few peoples minds after 
the opening bell monday when prices staged a brief if uninspired 
rally 
people were even saying that the early rally might be 
attributed to the super bowl win by the 49ers said brad weeks 
head of equity trading for donaldson lufkin amp jenrette who 
dismissed such a notion 
the scenario goes that if an nfc team wins by 20 points or 
more then the market has gone up that year 95 percent of the 
time said richard ciardullo head trader for raymond james amp 
associates in st petersburg fla 
thats why i rooted for the 49ers

many as 24 digits

the government banned some uses of the color 
additive red no 3 on monday as a result red may not be as 
red in lipstick cake frostings cough drops and some processed 
fruits and juices 
the food and drug administration announcement said some uses of 
the dye are being halted because red no 3 in high doses has been 
shown to cause cancer in rats 
the cancer risk is considered so small that the fda said that 
existing products that contain the color may be used the ban on 
red no 3 will apply only to new manufacturing the fda said 
the fda action prevents the use of the red dye in products where 
the color is mixed chemically with another additive 
direct addition of the dye to a product will continue but the 
fda also announced its intention to halt this use eventually 
under the new rules fda spokesman emil corwin said red no 3 
can no longer be used in any cosmetic product including lipsticks 
powders blushes shampoos skin care lotions or bath oils 
it also is excluded from use in cake frostings cough drops 
herbs and spices flavorings some processed fruits and juices 
chewing gum cake mixes and dietary foods even the wax on cheeses 
can no longer contain the red dye said corwin 
red no 3 is one of seven primary colors approved for food drug 
and cosmetic use but it holds a very important position because it 
is the closest to primary red says john hallagan of the 
certified color manufacturers association 
there will be a number of products that wont be red any 
more said hallagan 
the six other colors are red no 40 blue nos 1 and 2 green 
no 3 and yellow nos 5 and 6 
because it was closest to the primary color of red no 3 is 
ideal for blending said hallagan mixing no 3 with other 
primary colors could make a whole variety of shades based on red 
ranging from orange to maroon 
without no 3 he said the pallet of colors will be reduced 
significantly the variability will be reduced 
red no 40 he said is a different shade of red and is not as 
stable 
hallagan said that about 300000 pounds of red no 3 is 
manufactured annually in the united states 
irene malbin of the cosmetic toiletry and fragrance association 
said that a 1989 survey of cosmetic manufacturers showed that red 
no 3 was not used in very many cosmetic products because of 
uncertainty over its status 
as a result dropping red no 3 from cosmetic use will not have 
a serious effect on the colors available to customers said ms 
malbin 
but association president ed kavanaugh attacked the fda action 
as being arbitrary and capricious because the agency permitted 
red no 3 to continue to be used in food and other ingested 
products 
under the fda order red no 3 still can be applied directly to 
some products until further agency action is taken 
that means it still can be applied directly to meat pet food 
nut products fruit and fruit juices candy and confections 
breakfast cereals and ingested drugs 
corwin said the cherries in fruit cocktail for example can 
continue to be tinted red by the color additive 
in announcing the fda action dr louis sullivan secretary of 
the department of health and human services said the actual 
risk posed by red no 3 is extremely small however federal law in 
this area is clear there have been laboratory studies which showed 
that very high doses of red no 3 administered directly in the 
diet caused cancer in rats 
sullivan said that congress should consider updating the 
statutes to reflect advances in the methods of scientific 
assessment that were not available when the law was originally 
passed in 1960 
an fda statement said the risk of getting cancer from red no 3 
is no larger than 1 in 100000 over a lifetime of consumption this 
compares to a natural disaster risk of about 70 in 100000 and a 
risk from death in railroad or air crashes of about 6 in 100000 
the agency said

compaq computer corp will delay shipments of its 
new deskpro 48625 personal computer because of a faulty intel 
corp chip officials said monday it is the second problem found 
in the advanced microprocessor 
about a week ago on monday we were contacted by intel just 
saying that there was an errata discovered in the 486 chip said 
nora rice media relations administrator for the houstonbased 
computer manufacturer 
she said intel said it was working to find a solution to the 
problem but the trouble will delay introduction of the new machine 
we were targeting shipping the computer feb 1 ms rice 
said but with this new errata it will delay the ship date 
its important to understand whats causing the problem 
before you put in a fix or a workaround that configures the 
computer differently she said 
compaq discovered another problem with the advanced chip last 
fall before intel had begun shipping the microprocessor

a top apple computer inc executive 
resigned monday in what analysts called part of the companys drive 
to resolve problems in switching to a new generation of products 
cupertinobased apple the worlds no 2 personal computer 
maker has faced declining profits for nearly a year mostly due to 
poor us sales 
company officials announced the resignation of allan z loren as 
president of apple usa the companys foundering domestic sales and 
marketing unit loren 51 a former insurance executive once was 
considered a candidate to head the company 
apple has been in a hunkereddown mode since before christmas 
and it is trying to put itself back onto the road and this is a 
message it is making a major move in that direction said richard 
shaffer publisher of new yorkbased technologic computer letter 
michael h spindler 47 president of apple europe was named 
chief operating officer by john sculley chief executive and 
company president 
the new position is designed to help the company improve 
coordination of business operations and streamline daytoday 
activities apple said in a statement 
the companys latest financial results apparently sealed lorens 
fate 
during its latest quarter apple suffered an 11 percent decline 
in profits from a year earlier it was the third straight quarter 
apple experienced a decline in revenue and profits with most of 
the problems centered on the us sales and marketing division the 
companys largest 
apple which had revenues of 53 billion in 1989 said two 
weeks ago it would reduce employment by 5500 mostly through 
attrition and reassignment and would not rule out the possibility 
of layoffs 
it also froze salaries for six months eliminated cars for 
usbased executives and cut back its profitsharing plan 
apple faces a critical year in 1990 from major competitors who 
will be introducing their own graphic interface products which are 
software programs that use symbols to allow the user to tell 
computers what to do 
apples macintosh has been the leading computer to use such a 
system but there have been delays in releasing its newest 
macintosh machines and criticisms they are too expensive 
benny lorenzo an analyst at volpe convington amp welty in san 
francisco said aple has worried some investors by the level of its 
research and development expenses 
he said compaq computer corp spent 53 percent of its revenue 
on research and development last year compared to apples 8 
percent yet came out with more new computers 
although the personal computer industry in general has been hurt 
by sagging sales the past six months apple also was beset by 
significantly slower us sales of some of its leading product 
lines particularly lowend macintosh models and the apple ii 
personal computers 
many software distributors have been angry over the 
comparatively low level of promotion by apple last christmas for 
its apple ii developed 13 years ago many dealers and owners of 
the machine fear the company is preparing to abandon it in favor of 
the macintosh 
apple also has been hurt by declining sales of peripheral 
equipment because of increased competition and lower minimum 
purchase requirements for major resellers which encouraged the 
companies to order lower volumes lorenzo said 
whats happened is that theyve neglected the lowend of the 
market and concentrated on maintaining or increasing their share of 
the business part of the market said eugene glazer an analyst 
with dean witter reynolds inc of new york 
sales figures by storeboard inc a dallas market researcher 
show that unit sales of apple computers through us dealers 
decreased last year while revenue increased indicating at least 
in part a shift toward more expensive machines 
many of apples longtime customers want the company to put more 
effort into software for its less costly machines and to introduce 
better versions of those products without drastically increasing 
price

a delaware court has ruled that the 
board of resorts international inc then headed by donald trump 
acted in good faith when it approved a 36ashare offer by 
entertainer merv griffin 
trump hailed the ruling as a great victory and said it would 
forestall any attempt by resorts bondholders to sue him but an 
attorney for some bondholders disputed that contention 
in a decision reached friday but announced monday the delaware 
supreme court court upheld a lower courts ruling that it was 
doubtful any objecting shareholders could prove the board of 
directors committee acted with gross negligence or bad faith in 
approving griffins bid in june 1988 
the court also dismissed the contention of shareholders who said 
they did not benefit from the deal between griffin and trump the 
court said they received 36 a share from griffin when trump had 
offered only 22 a share 
resorts is incorporated in delaware 
trump had been resorts chairman and controlling stockholder 
before griffin bought the casino company taking on more than 900 
million in debt and issuing bonds to finance that debt 
trump was paid 637 million to break his management contract 
with resorts he also received the unfinished taj mahal casino for 
250 million half the 500 million resorts had sunk into 
construction 
in a telephone interview from new york trump called the 
decision a great victory and said it would end speculation 
about disgruntled bondholders suing trump for alleged fradulent 
conveyances 
were really very happy about it trump said it puts to 
rest any loose ends 
as part of a bankruptcy reorganization plan filed late last year 
in us bankruptcy court in camden by resorts international 
griffin set aside a 5 million kitty for possible legal action 
against trump 
attorneys for some bondholder groups had said they might sue 
trump for fraudulent conveyance 
resorts attorney tom gallagher said the decision would not have 
any impact on the reorganization plan 
the ruling is as expected gallagher said theres nothing 
new in it 
marc s kirschner an attorney for some resorts bondholders 
discounted the importance of the ruling 
i think its irrelevant he said it has to do with 
shareholder rights and remedies and has zero to do with creditor 
rights and remedies 
most analysts say griffin paid too much for resorts and burdened 
his purchase with too much debt estimated at about 912 million 
griffins bankruptcy plan which still must win approval from 
bondholders and state gaming regulators would have him exchange 78 
percent of his equity in the company for about twothirds of the 
outstanding debt 
the win or gross profits for resorts dropped last year to 
2274 million from the 2429 million posted in 1988 according to 
the state casino control commission
