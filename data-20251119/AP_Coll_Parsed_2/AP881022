else works with you boulder county judge thomas reed told john 
ball 31 
reed issued the order thursday at the request of public defender 
cary lacklen a defense attorney who believes acupuncture can play 
a valuable role in fighting substance abuse 
reed also ordered ball to use anabuse a drug that reacts 
violently with alcohol in a persons body to ensure that he does 
no more drinking 
by ordering acupuncture im not advocating it as a cure 
reed said later it cant hurt right 
prosecutors thursday charged ball with driving under the 
influence reckless driving two counts of hitandrun and driving 
without a valid license he is accused of running into a line of 
parked cars in boulder on oct 14 and driving off later slamming

for most political candidates it usually 
goes without saying that they think they could do a better job than 
their opponents 
not so in a state senate race 
steven debish 20 of shelton says he wouldnt mind voting for 
republican incumbent george gunther on nov 8 
debish is the democrat challenging gunther 
gunther would probably do a better job be more effective in 
the next two years because of his long standing in the senate 
debish said earlier this week most of the things i see in the 
newspaper that he stands for i agree with 
debish a sophomore at southern connecticut state university in 
nearby new haven gives himself a very slim chance of defeating the 
11term incumbent 
i just dont want to upset anybody debish said hes 
doing his job 
many challengers demand facetoface confrontations in debates 
but a few weeks ago debish declined to meet gunther in a debate 
we decided he has so much experience he would probably just 
kill me debish said hes just an old pro i wish i had his 
experience in public speaking and debating 
debishs entry into the contest wasnt exactly a direct result 
of a mandate or groundswell of support by local party leaders 
well they needed a person to go up against him and i guess 
they couldnt find anyone almost anyone who goes up against him 
would probably lose he said 
debish said he wanted to get some experience running for office 
and has his sights set on something other than the legislature i 
want to be mayor of shelton someday he said 
despite debishs deference to the incumbent gunther cant quite 
remember his challengers name 
what is it devlin dempsey gunther asked recently

such amenities as valet parking in upgrading eastern airlines 
shuttle service and plans to spend tremendous amounts of money

shuttle from parent texas air corp for 365 million in cash if it 
survives government scrutiny and a legal challenge by some of 
easterns unions the sale is expected to be completed by dec 15

and is used mostly by business travelers will be renamed the trump 
shuttle the bluesilver eastern aircraft will be redecorated and 
emblazoned with red black and gold stripes and will carry trumps 
name on their tails 
i want to run an absolutely quality operation trump said 
friday in a telephone interview the real estate magnate said he is 
ready to spend tremendous amounts of money on each individual 
airplane to accomplish his goal 
the interiors of the 17 boeing 727s will be completely redone 
using highquality leather carpeting and other materials trump 
said he pledged to also stress safety by having each plane 
thoroughly checked and xrayed using procedures trump claimed 
would be more stringent than miamibased eastern currently employs 
the shuttles airport terminals in new york boston and 
washington also will be refurbished trump said he said he is 
thinking seriously about introducing valet parking at the three 
airports for shuttle customers a service that would likely be an

democrat michael dukakis went on the attack heading into a 
weekend of campaigning from the deep south to new england while 
republican george bush was staying home today as the race for the 
white house approached its final two weeks 
the democratic presidential nominee lagging behind bush in the 
polls was taking his case to television both in a series of new 
fiery commercials and in news interviews as he sought to raise his 
stock among the voters 
in his television commercials unveiled friday dukakis calls 
bushs attacks on his record full of lies and he knows it 
however the bush campaign has responded that the ads are 
truthful 
dukakis who has been criticized for lacking passion appears 
angry in an ad titled counterpunch 
im fed up with it he says as he clicks off a television 
set showing a negative commercial for bush 
the bush commercial showing dukakis riding in a tank attacks 
the massachusetts governor on defense issues but dukakis says in 
his ad that both candidates want a strong defense 
so this isnt about defense issues its about dragging the 
truth into the gutter and im not going to let them do it 
dukakis says 
bush meanwhile called for an international agreement allowing 
onsite inspections on demand to enforce a ban on chemical weapons 
the eventual combination of chemical weapons and ballistic 
missiles could put new destructive power in the hands of 
governments with terrorist records bush told an audience of 
about 1200 at the university of toledo in ohio 
however bush did not mention that as vice president he cast 
tiebreaking votes in the senate in 1983 and 1986 in favor of us 
chemical weapon arsenals 
those votes disturbed bushs mother dorothy who criticized him 
after the second vote and then received a call from president 
reagan explaining why her son voted as he did 
bush today was meeting at his home in washington with armando 
valladares who was freed six years ago after serving 22 years in a 
cuban prison valladares who wrote about his ordeal in the book 
against all hope has been cited by the vice president as one 
of his heroes 
bush also planned to attend an italianamerican dinner tonight 
in washington 
dukakis too was to attend that dinner but his appearance was 
scheduled for later in the evening 
the democrat was starting his day with a joint appearance with 
vice presidential running mate lloyd bentsen before a group of 
pipefitters in beaumont texas before heading to a barbecue in 
georgia and then a television interview in atlanta later he was 
flying to washington and then to boston 
dukakis who was taping an interview today with cnn has made 
himself available for network television interviews over the last 
couple of days as he seeks to seize the offensive in the remaining 
days of the presidential campaign 
but republican vice presidential candidate dan quayle said the 
democrats fall in the polls is so steep there can be no return 
we have a strategy to win tennessee quayle said 
actually i think the man from massachusetts they might end 
up on election night maybe having a onestate strategy or maybe 
theyll just have a district of columbia strategy

justice sandra day oconnor the first woman 
on the supreme court is recovering from surgery for breast cancer 
and expects to return to work in 10 days 
oconnor 58 underwent surgery friday at georgetown university 
hospital but few details on the procedure or followup treatment 
were provided 
i underwent surgery for breast cancer it was found to exist 
in a very early form and stage oconnor said in a statement 
released by supreme court spokeswoman toni house the prognosis 
is for total recovery i do not anticipate missing any oral 
arguments oconnor said 
the court is on a twoweek recess and returns to hear arguments 
oct 31 the justices also will meet in private conference oct 28 
but it was not known whether oconnor will attend 
dr robert s siegel assistant professor of medicine and 
director of a cancer treatment unit at george washington university 
hospital said oconnors plan for a quick return to the bench 
would be a remarkably fast recovery and may be good news for 
her prognosis 
he said the speed also may indicate the cancer was caught at a 
very early time and there is no indication it has spread to other 
organs in the body siegel is not involved in oconnors case 
it was not disclosed whether oconnors surgery was for removal 
of a lump or the entire breast there also were no details on 
whether the justice will receive any form of continuing treatment 
and when the cancer was discovered 
siegel said that typically when breast cancer is detected at a 
very early stage the patient can choose to have either a 
lumpectomy in which only the tumor is removed from the breast or 
a modified radical mastectomy in which the entire breast is 
removed 
either procedure usually involves removal of the lymph glands 
under the arm 
for a lumpectomy patients generally are released from the 
hospital in three to four days siegel said but return in two 
weeks to start radiation therapy 
the radiation usually is given once a day four to five days a 
week for four to six weeks 
for most patients this is a difficult period because the 
radiation causes fatigue 
it would be difficult to maintain a full schedule while 
receiving radiation said siegel but he noted that some patients 
handle it much more easily than others 
patients receiving a modified radical mastectomy do not require 
radiation therapy and usually return to work within two to three 
weeks 
oconnors operation came just a year after first lady nancy 
reagan underwent surgery to remove her left breast after laboratory 
tests revealed a quarterinch cancerous lesion 
mrs reagan then 66 recovered quickly from the oct 17 1987 
surgery a modified radical mastectomy 
oconnors health as far as is publicly known has been good 
she underwent an appendectomy in march and was soon back at work 
supreme court justices generally jealously guard the details of 
their health 
in 1986 the associated press inquired about a tremor a 
nodding motion of oconnors head that has been apparent to court 
watchers for years at times the justice will rest her chin on her 
hands during the courts public oral argument sessions 
oconnor sent back this reply through the courts public 
information office i was unaware of such a tendency as for 
resting her chin on her hands she said it is an old and perhaps 
unfortunate habit 
oconnors appointment to be a justice by president reagan in 
1981 ended 191 years of male exclusivity on the high court 
a political and judicial conservative she has been a champion 
of states rights and enhanced police power 
but while she generally sides with the conservative wing of the 
court anchored by chief justice william h rehnquist she has cast 
important moderate votes in such areas as sex discrimination and 
affirmative action 
she was a virtual unknown on the national scene when reagan 
picked her to replace potter stewart who had retired 
oconnor served as an arizona state judge and before that was a 
member of that states legislature

beginning in december most private employers 
will be barred by law from using polygraphs and other types of lie 
detectors to screen job applicants or test the current employees 
except in rare circumstances 
under new regulations issued friday by the labor department 
employers can be fined up to 10000 for requiring a job seeker or 
employee already on their payrolls to submit to a polygraph exam 
for voice stress analysis 
the regulations which take effect dec 27 implement 
legislation passed by congress and signed by president reagan last 
june outlawing about 85 percent of the current use of lie detector 
tests 
the congressional office of technology assessment had estimated 
that 2 million polygraph examinations were conducted last year 90 
percent of them by private employers 
some 72 million employers nationwide will be required to put up 
posters in december summarizing the prohibitions and exemptions and 
outlining the rights of any worker asked to take a lie detector 
test 
fred alvarez assistant labor secretary for employment 
standards said the posters will be mailed out in the next three or 
four weeks 
in addition to the fines anyone required to take the test in 
violation of the new law can sue employers in federal and state 
courts for relief such as employment reinstatement promotion and 
any payment of lost wages and benefits 
exempted from protection under the ban are employees of federal 
state and local governments or of federal contractors engaged in 
national security intelligence or top secret activities 
also exempted from the ban are prospective employees of armored 
car security alarm and security guard firms hired to protect 
operations affecting health and safety national security or money 
pharmaceutical concerns or companies manufacturing distributing 
or dispensing controlled substances also can require job applicants 
to submit to a lie detector test but only for those people who 
would have direct access to the drugs 
polygraphs still can be used by employers to investigate 
specific incidents of theft embezzlement or sabotage but not a 
persistent problem such as recurring inventory shortages 
but any workers asked to submit to a polygraph exam under those 
conditions must be given at least 48 hours advance notice and a 
statement in advance telling them of their rights including the 
right to refuse the test or to terminate it at any time 
the pretest statement also must explain the specific incident 
or activity being investigated and the basis for the employers 
suspicion that the person asked to take the exam was involved in it 
results of a polygraph test or refusal to submit to such an exam 
cannot be used alone as a basis for taking any action against an 
employee the regulations also forbid disclosure of the test 
results to anyone other than the employee without the employees 
consent or a court order

a national institutes of health advisory 
committee says it is acceptable to use the tissue from 
intentionally aborted fetuses in medical research 
however the panels 133 vote making that fundamental finding 
the core question it was asked to decide carefully avoided taking 
a position on the morality of abortion itself or for that matter 
the morality of using the remains of planned abortions for research 
it is of moral relevance that human fetal tissue for research 
has been obtained from induced abortions said the draft document 
completed friday however in light of the fact that abortion is 
legal and that the research in question is intended to achieve 
significant medical goals the panel concludes that the use of such 
tissue is acceptable public policy 
it went on to say that the committee position must not obscure 
the profound moral dimensions of the issue of abortion nor the 
principled positions that divide scholars scientists and the 
public at large it is not the charge of this panel to attempt to 
settle the issue of abortion or to weigh the worthiness of 
competing principled perspectives on abortion itself 
researchers are hopeful that transplanting fetal brain cells 
into the brains of people with diabetes and parkinsons disease 
could provide an effective treatment perhaps in three to five 
years and that more study could lead to similar treatments for a 
number of other serious diseases for which there now is no cure 
the new procedure has been used experimentally on a handful of 
patients in other countries with promising results the advisory 
committee was formed to examine moral ethical legal and 
scientific issues after nih scientists sought permission to 
transplant fetal brain cells into some parkinsons sufferers 
the committees agreement on a lengthy draft document friday 
will not become final before nov 30 the date for submission of 
mail ballots on whether to adopt the exact language that will be 
written by nih employees working to polish the principles adopted 
by the panel over five days of discussion going back to last month 
in the draft version approved friday the panel laid out a 
number of recommended safeguards once research proceeds 
the decision to terminate a pregnancy and the procedures of 
abortion should be kept independent from the retrieval and use of 
fetal tissue 
proper and informed consent should be obtained from the 
pregnant woman 
payments and other forms of remuneration and compensation 
associated with the procurement of fetal tissue should be 
prohibited except payment for reasonable expenses occasioned by 
the actual retrieval storage preparation and transportation of 
the tissues 
potential recipients of such tissues as well as any and all 
other participants including researchers hospital personnel and 
other serviceproviders should be properly informed as to the 
source of the tissues in question 
the panel also concluded that donations of fetal tissue to a 
family member or acquaintance for medical purposes should be banned 
to discourage women from becoming pregnant with the intention of 
having an abortion and donating the tissue to a sick relative or 
close friend

screening tests for the aids virus are more 
accurate than two years ago but medical practitioners should have 
at least two tests performed before informing an infected patient 
that he has the disease according to a study by experts 
thomas a obrien a du pont co expert on aids testing said 
some medical workers are still telling patients that they have the 
disease after only a single test 
the current tests are very very good but they are not 100 
percent obrien said friday he noted that only 10 percent of 
patients testing positive in an initial screening test for aids 
actually have the disease 
obrien presented a report compiled by testing experts after 
three days of discussion at the national bureau of standards the 
report recommends that aids testing should not be considered 
definitive until both screening and confirmatory tests are 
completed and in some cases even further testing is needed 
he said the testing sequence should start with a screening test 
called elisa for enzymelinked immunosorbent assay for those 
with a positive elisa test he added there should then be a 
confirmation test called a western blot 
both laboratory tests are based on the presence in the patients 
bloodstream of antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus or 
hiv which causes aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
if you test 10000 people for hiv the current tests would 
give an elisa positive on 02 percent or 20 said obrien 
out of the 10000 the western blot confirming test would be 
needed only on those 20 samples 
obrien said that only about 10 percent of people testing 
positive by the elisa test are actually infected with aids as a 
result he said you dont tell someone that they are hiv 
positive on elisa alone 
some samples obrien said cannot be confirmed as positive or 
negative even with both elisa and western blot he said the expert 
panel recommended that this indeterminate group undergo 
additional and different tests before a final report is made to the 
patient 
aids is a contagious disease that attacks the bodys immune 
system and makes it incapable of defending against infection the 
disease is not now curable and no one has been known to recover 
from it as of monday there have been 75768 aids cases reported 
in the united states and 42653 have died 
aids testing was one of four subjects addressed in a unique 
gathering of medical testing experts at the national bureau of 
standards the group included testing specialists from government 
agencies industry and hospitals officials said the purpose of the 
threeday meeting was to draw up recommendations for assuring that 
the nations laboratories are providing accurate testing 
the group issued recommended ways to improve testing for aids 
for drug abuse for cholesterol and for the pap smear cancer 
screening test 
among the recommendations were 
though testing for cholesterol was found generally to be 
accurate in hospital laboratories the group recommended that 
cholesterol measurements made in a physicians office laboratory 
should be studied since these labs often are not part of a routine 
quality control program 
a common system of measuring the presence and concentration of 
drugs in urine tests should be established nationally the experts 
said that there now exists a common reference material a sample 
containing pure drugs at known concentrations for marijuana but 
not for other controlled drugs such as cocaine pcp or 
amphetamines the report said that such a common reference material 
would increase the accuracy of drug testing 
the panel also said that the analysis of urine specimens can 
identify an exposure to drugs but it does not measure the level of 
impairment the experts recommended that research be conducted to 
determine how such impairment can be measured accurately 
the experts said that falsenegative findings in pap smears a 
test for the presence of cervical cancer are running as high as 4 
percent to 8 percent but that these errors often are a result of 
poor technique in collecting specimens the panel recommended that 
the pap specimen collection technique be standardized and that 
women patients receive better instructions in how to prepare for 
this test 
dr beverly b kraemer a laboratory director at st johns 
mercy medical center in st louis mo said though there are 
inaccuracies in pap smear tests the procedure is still a womans 
best friend in the war against cancer and one of the most 
successful lifesaving laboratory procedures now commonly used

124yearold gallaudet university the nations only university for 
the hearing impaired challenged the students in his inaugural 
address to try and do everything under the sun

repeated false statements by the head of the 
tennessee valley authoritys nuclear program constitute a violation 
of federal regulations by the tva the nuclear regulatory 
commission charges 
however the commission said it has decided not to take action 
on the original statements by steven a white a former head of the 
navys nuclear submarine program as a matter of prosecutorial 
discretion 
the nrc also decided according to a letter sent friday to tva 
chairman marvin runyon not to assess a fine because a civil 
penalty for this matter is not necessary to further focus the 
attention of either tva or the industry on the importance of 
complete candor in dealing with the commission the letter said 
the tva board of directors in a statement read by spokeswoman 
becky akers defended white while praising the nrcs decision not 
to assess a fine 
we continue to believe that admiral white did not intend to 
mislead the nrc on this or any other matter the statement said 
we are pleased that the nuclear regulatory commission did not 
fine tva upon completion of this investigation according to the 
statement however we are disappointed that tva received a 
notice of a violation on statements relating to appendix b the 
tva board is fully committed to operating a safe and reliable 
nuclear power program 
the nrcs letter said the tva has 30 days to admit or deny the 
allegations and to show what corrections it has undertaken if the 
charge is admitted 
the case concerns a march 1986 letter white wrote to the 
commission white had been hired a few months earlier to shape up 
tvas nearly collapsed nuclear effort that had seen the closure of 
five reactors 
white wrote the nrc that there had been no pervasive breakdown 
of the quality assurance program at the watts bar plant under 
construction near spring city tenn 
he repeated that assurance in a followup letter and in 
statements to nrc investigators adding that he had received a 
review of the program by outside experts 
in fact according to previous commission testimony to congress 
and according to fridays letter white had not even spoken with 
seven of the nine people he identified as constituting the outside 
review group and the two people he did speak with had not reviewed 
tvas quality assurance efforts but had only given opinions of the 
work of an earlier inhouse group 
no one identified by mr white as being a member of the second 
group understood there to be such a group the letter said 
in april ben b hayes director of the nrcs office of 
investigations testified before a congressional panel that white 
was playing word games hayes told the investigations subcommittee 
of the house energy and commerce committee that white apparently 
was intending pervasive to mean 100 percent while 
technically true tvas quality assurance had serious and 
widespread problems he said 
at the nrc staff an internal group headed by james taylor 
assistant executive director for operations concluded that whites 
statements were not deliberately false the matter was referred to 
the justice department which has refused to comment on the status 
of the case 
white has denied any wrongdoing and has been supported by the 
tva board he is retiring in january 
the letter signed by taylor now deputy executive director for 
regional operations said the violation was being assessed even 
though white is leaving because tva management as a whole is 
responsible for the quality of communications with the nrc 
both the individuals involved and the organization must share 
responsibility for the actions giving rise to these violations but 
the fundamental premise of our regulatory system makes tva as the 
licensee ultimately responsible the letter said 
the nrc must be confident that it can rely on the information 
furnished by a licensee the letter said anything less 
than accurate and complete statements to the commission cannot and 
will not be tolerated

the democratic slide in the polls is so 
steep that michael dukakis could be left with a one state 
strategy on election day republican vice presidential nominee 
dan quayle said 
and as he stumped through the south on friday quayle worked to 
steal a line his democratic counterpart used to devastating effect 
in the vice presidential debate 
dukakis he declared is no harry truman and wont be making 
a comeback 
a confidentsounding quayle said theres a sharp contrast 
between republican and democratic election strategies 
quayle told college students in tennessee that the gop has a 
50state strategy and made light of reports that dukakis is 
narrowing his focus to about 18 states with enough electoral votes 
for a win 
we have a strategy to win tennessee quayle said 
actually i think the man from massachusetts they might end 
up on election night maybe having a onestate strategy or maybe 
theyll just have a district of columbia strategy 
the quip that dukakis is no harry truman comes straight from 
democrat lloyd bentsen who scored the premier moment of the vice 
presidential debate when he told quayle youre no jack kennedy 
quayle described a conversation between tennessee sen albert 
gore jr and his father a former senator 
i guess he gore jr called home and talked to his dad when 
his father told him that this reminded him of the truman campaign 
in 1948 quayle said let me tell you something i dont know 
michael dukakis i never served with michael dukakis michael 
dukakis is not a good friend of mine 
but i know this michael dukakis is no harry truman said 
quayle 
bentsen used precisely that cadence in setting up quayle for his 
debate zinger and aides said fridays speech was the first time 
quayle had referred to the putdown in a campaign appearance 
republican presidential nominee george bush had also set the 
stage when he used a similar line in a selfdeprecating fashion 
during a dinner in new york on thursday night 
quayle insisted the comparison was apt because many were 
trying to compare the dukakis campaign to the truman campaign 
truman was perceived to be trailing throughout the 1948 
campaign but ended up defeating republican thomas dewey 
most polls show the gop ticket this year with a persistent lead 
and quayle insisted there will be no comeback this time around 
during his southern swing quayle spoke to the college students 
in tennessee at a noisy rally where critics and backers competed 
for attention repeatedly interrupting the candidate 
theyve always been negative and they always will be quayle 
said they are the party of failure we are the party of success 
they can go ahead and yell he said were going to talk 
about issues and ideas 
throughout his southern swing quayle took a tough stance 
against a tax increase and in favor of defense as he courted 
conservative voters in a region where most polls suggest bush is 
strong 
at a flagwaving riverside rally in georgia quayle made a frank 
appeal for backing from conservative southern democrats 
dukakis he argued is not in the southern democratic 
tradition of national defense disenchanted democrats are fed up 
with liberalism 
he got some cheering news from the crowd including one sign 
which read thank god quayle is no jfk

vice president george bush is taking a weekend 
breather from the campaign trail after warning ohio supporters 
against complacency and boasting that running mate dan quayle has 
been tested by steel 
bush was keeping a light schedule today meting with armando 
valladares author of against all hope a harrowing account of 
his years as a political prisoner in a cuban prison bush mentioned 
the book in his last debate with michael dukakis 
bush tonight was attending an italianamerican banquet in 
washington where dukakis also was putting in a separate appearance 
after taking sunday off bush heads back on the road monday for 
a swing through new england with stops in waterford conn 
portland maine and burlington vt 
on tuesday he launches a drivetothewire crosscountry trip 
for the final two weeks of the campaign starting with a return to 
ohio for the sixth time since the gop convention 
in a high school gym in lancaster ohio and earlier in a hockey 
arena in troy ohio bush laid the rhetorical wood to his 
opponents policies and lauded his running mate 
bush said the indiana senator has been tempered by steel hes 
been taking a pounding out there steel gets tough when its under 
fire 
ohio with 23 electoral votes is a critical state said 
bush 
the election still hangs in the balance and i am running 
even though things feel pretty good just as though i were 10 
points back he told 2000 people at lancaster high school where 
he was surrounded by cheerleaders in a gym festooned with balloons 
and a huge handlettered good night mike banner 
he doesnt like the lword anymore because hes trying to move 
to the middle and were not going to let him said bush 
although the buckeye state went twice for ronald reagan and bush 
is ahead in polls in ohio bush press secretary sheila tate said 
its not locked up by any means 
tate was questioned about fridays indictment of former 
philippines dictator ferdinand marcos as dukakis has criticized 
bush for praising marcos commitment to democracy during a 1981 
visit to manila 
his view is that the judicial process should go forward 
tate said 
in troy bush recited his full antidukakis litany attacking 
the massachusetts governor for vetoing a mandatory pledge of 
allegiance law ridiculing his prison furlough program and taking a 
doubleedged swipe at the democrats economic and environmental 
record 
there just isnt any massachusetts miracle the last miracle 
in massachusetts was when they found a fish alive in boston 
harbor bush quipped 
at the university of toledo bush decried the terrible 
scourge of chemical warfare and called friday for sanctions 
against nations that resort to germ warfare onsite inspection of 
suspicious plants and an overture to the soviet union and china to 
help stop the spread of ballistic missiles 
bush has long said one of his goals as president would be to 
banish all chemical weapons from the earth an issue given new 
urgency by the use of nerve gas in the iraniraq war he spoke of 
his horror at seeing photographs of a kurdish mother trying to 
protect her child waving her arms against the invisible winds of 
death after an iraqi attack 
the dukakis campaign has challenged bushs credibility on this 
issue citing three tiebreaking votes the vice president cast in 
the us senate in 1983 and 1986 to fund us production of new 
chemical weapons 
dennis ross a bush policy aide said the old us stockpiles 
were deteriorating and the new binary weapons were safer 
bushs octogenarian mother dorothy criticized her son after 
the second chemical weapons vote in 1983 and got a phone call 
from reagan explaining why her george voted that way

indicted former philippine president ferdinand 
e marcos received no promises from us officials to persuade him 
to leave his country without bloodshed during a popular 
militarybased revolt in 1986 officials say 
more than 2 years after he fled the philippines marcos his 
wife imelda and six others were indicted friday on racketeering 
charges involving a vast fortune the marcoses allegedly stole from 
the philippines 
action by the white house a federal appeals court and the 
philippine government opened the final doors to that indictment 
which came in a new york investigation that began shortly after 
marcos was airlifted to hawaii in february 1986 
robert g rich a former us embassy official in manila who was 
state department liaison with marcos during his first three months 
of hawaiian exile said friday that no high official including 
president reagan made any promises to marcos 
we offered refuge because the prospect of violence threatened 
him and his family and to avoid a very bloody confrontation in the 
philippines rich said in a telephone interview from belize 
where he is now the us ambassador there is no indication that 
anyone at high levels offered anything inappropriate 
marcos claims in a lawsuit filed in honoluu that he was deceived 
into leaving his country against his will 
the case against marcos has involved discussions with 
philippines officials and months of dealings among the white house 
justice department and state department both state and justice 
department sources confirmed that there were disagreements over how 
to handle the case with justice wanting to indict prior to plea 
bargaining with marcos and state urging a preindictment attempt to 
bargain 
a plea bargain which marcos rejected was described by one 
official as an attempt to get marcos to return his vast wealth to 
the philippines which is the main objective of the case the 
government of president corazon aquino alleges that marcos and his 
associates took out of the country 5 billion to 10 billion much 
of it stashed in swiss banks 
the way was cleared for the indictment after a white house 
announcement thursday that reagan would not prevent the law from 
taking its course white house spokesman marlin fitzwater later 
said reagan was saddened by the court action because marcos was a 
friend 
reagan had invited marcos to the united states and 
administration officials were concerned about the impact the 
indictment would have on us credibility in dealing with foreign 
rulers in the future 
fitzwater said after the indictment we didnt make any 
promises we couldnt keep any foreign leader can take our word on 
anything 
another administration official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said marcos apparently came to the united states because 
it was where he felt safest and most comfortable if he went to 
another place he might end up ripped off by another authoritarian 
ruler 
but rich said he believes that marcos in 1986 probably planned 
to stay in the united states only for a few months miscalculating 
the viability of the aquino government and the lack of interest 
other countries had in taking him 
he and his wife are restricted to the island of oahu because of 
his attempt last year to return to the philippines us officials 
say they are honoring a philippine government request that he not 
be allowed to return 
on wednesday the us court of appeals in new york upheld a 
civil contempt finding against marcos and his wife for failing to 
turn over evidence to the grand jury that handed up the 
indictments that decision also rejected marcos pleas for immunity 
last week the philippine government issued a formal waiver of 
any immunity marcos might be allowed from prosecution as a former 
head of state

a bill reforming the way the federal emergency 
management agency distributes aid after natural disasters has been 
approved by congress and sent to president reagan for his signature 
the disaster relief and emergency assistance amendments of 1988 
had their roots in the governments response to tornadoes that 
raced through pennsylvania ohio and new york before hitting canada 
on may 31 1985 killing 90 people 
rep thomas ridge rpa authored the bill after complaining 
that the help offered by fema in 1985 failed to meet the needs of 
residents and municipalities facing major repairs 
at a hearing on the bill last year rep leon panetta dcalif 
said reform was necessary because fema has gained the notoriety 
of being very cumbersome and tortuous for the citizens of this 
nation to understand 
the bill died in the 99th congress was introduced again last 
year and the house finally passed it in the spring 
the senate passed a companion bill by voice vote friday since 
the measure was slightly different from the version the house had 
passed earlier it was sent back to the house which approved it 
friday night 
the legislation was sent to reagan who was expected to sign it 
among other reforms the bill would bar fema from paying less 
than a 75 percent share of aid to local governments qualifying for 
public repair projects following a disaster it would add 
guidelines to speed the distribution of postdisaster aid and would 
permit federal funds to be used for the first time for local 
projects designed to lessen the effect of disasters before they 
strike 
the measure also would make temporary housing assistance through 
fema available for up to 18 months six months longer than under 
the current system 
originally the measure was opposed by the reagan 
administration which said its initial price tag 15 to 20 
million per year above what fema pays now was too high 
but the bills cost was trimmed down to zero by eliminating some 
administrative expenses and by asking state and local governments 
to share some of the cost of aid in a federally declared emergency 
among other changes

here are some comments from the presidential 
campaign trail friday 
 
michael dukakis slamming the bush camp for emphasizing the fact 
that convicted murder willie horton escaped while on furlough and 
terrorized a maryland couple to play politics with that kind of 
human tragedy i think is one of the most cynical things you can 
do 
 
sen sam nunn dga speculating on what he would do if he were 
in dukakis shoes i wouldnt have been a punching bag on some of 
these issues there are some very unfair allegations going on and 
what ive been amazed at is how the bush campaign has been able to 
get away with it and to be fairly successful at it so far dukakis 
has really got to take off the gloves hes got to defend himself 
 
george bush advocating an international ban on chemical weapons 
but failing to mention his tiebreaking votes in 1983 and 1986 in 
favor of us chemical weapons arsenals the eventual combination 
of chemical weapons and ballistic missiles could put new 
destructive power in the hands of governments with terrorist 
records 
 
dan quayle saying the democrats will not stage a harry 
trumanstyle comeback this year copying a line used against him in 
the vice presidential debate i dont know michael dukakis i 
never served with michael dukakis michael dukakis is not a good 
friend of mine but i know this michael dukakis is no harry 
truman 
 
ronald reagan praising bush for keeping a cool head in times of 
crisis i have given him some of the most sensitive and 
difficult tasks that weve had and hes never let me or the 
country down 
 
lloyd bentsen seeking to assuage texans fears that dukakis is 
soft on defense i wouldnt be running on a ticket with a 
candidate who would weaken americas defense

the soviet union has offered to start moving 
an icebreaking ship today toward the stranded whales in alaska if 
current rescue efforts dont succeed according to a teleprinter 
message sent from soviet officials to greenpeace 
we are taking efforts on assisting in whales rescue 
operations said the message sent friday by the soviet state 
committee on hydrometeorology 
the ship the admiral makarov was 300 miles north of point 
barrow and would be able to move toward the whales today after 
finishing work on establishing a research station on the ice and 
rescuing an icetrapped soviet ship the arseniev the message said 
the offer was made in the event the three gray whales still are 
trapped by the gathering ice next wednesday when the soviets 
anticipated the icebreaking ship could arrive at the scene 
campbell plowder of greenpeace said that as a shot in the dark 
he asked on monday through scientific contacts in the soviet 
union if any soviet icebreaker was in a position to help the 
whales the answer was fridays cable 
the soviet message which requests greenpeaces help in 
obtaining us government permission to sail in us territorial 
waters expresses some doubts about the success of the mission 
we do not have complete assurance in this venture because of 
shallow waters for icebreaker in the area of rescue the message 
said in addition the soviets said the ice ridge is about 120 
miles from that area and we are in doubts that whales would be 
able to pass through the channel made by icebreaker 
plowder said he has asked the state department for immediate 
clearance for the ship to enter us waters and was told the 
department would assess the technical aspects first 
the state department meanwhile said it has asked soviet 
authorities what assets they may have available to help free the 
whales 
the soviets responded with information on where they have ice 
breakers and how long it would take them to arrive at the scene 
said a state department official who asked not to be identified 
according to the official us authorities are evaluating the 
soviet information and are comparing it with other options for 
rescuing the whales

michael dukakis is on the air with four 
new hardhitting commercials and tonight is delivering a 
fiveminute televised appeal for support 
the massachusetts governor got a rousing reception friday night 
from several thousand people who filled the gymnasium on the campus 
of the university of new orleans 
at the rate were going were going to be importing 50 
percent of our oil by 1990 he said 
even before were inaugurated lloyd bentsen and i are going 
to call a bipartisan energy summit for this country and that 
summit will be chaired by the vice presidentelect of the united 
states 
the commercials and television speech are the latest effort by 
the democratic presidential candidate to pick up momentum in his 
race against republican george bush 
the central point of the new ads is the bush campaign and 
their advertising are not to be believed said campaign press 
secretary dayton duncan 
the new dukakis ads started running friday in key states 
television was the latest weapon in the dukakis effort to 
overtake bush and emerge as an upset winner on election day a 
little more than two weeks away 
his fiveminute speech will air at 1055 pm edt on abc aides 
said the democratic candidate also would appear tuesday night on 
the abc show nightline 
dukakis campaigned friday in new york pennsylvania and 
louisiana before flying to texas for the night 
at bethel african methodist episcopal church in harlem dukakis 
renewed his pledge to wage a war on drugs and said our 
determination to win this war should know no bounds 
his next stop was mckeesport pa where he told a crowd that 
waited in the rain dont let anyone tell you the steel industry 
is dead in this country it isnt its not going to be and we are 
going to help bring it back 
actor albert brooks who starred in the movie broadcast 
news was on the platform with dukakis and told the crowd im 
a liberal and im a great guy then turning to dukakis he said 
this guys a liberal hes a great guy 
two of the new dukakis television ads were responses to bush 
attacks on the massachusetts prison furlough program and on 
dukakis positions on defense issues 
bush wont talk about the thousands of drug kingpins 
furloughed from federal prisons while he led the war on drugs 
says one dukakis ad the real story about furloughs is that 
george bush has taken a furlough from the truth 
the bush campaign is running a television ad that shows dukakis 
riding in a tank and describes him as opposed to a range of major 
weapons systems 
the dukakis response shows the democratic nominee watching the 
opening moment of that ad and then turning it off 
im fed up with it says dukakis havent seen anything 
like it in 25 years of public life george bushs negative tv ads 
the other two ads attack bush for failing to stop the flow of 
drugs into the country and for planning to cut the capital gains 
tax what dukakis describes as tax breaks to the rich

elalamein egypt ap this dusty coastal village of bedouin 
houses car repair shops a rest house and two gas stations has 
little to offer for the living except memories of the dead 
on sunday 2000 people are expected here to mourn those who 
fell in world war ii in the battle of elalamein 
since 1978 the service of remembrance for the more than 70000 
casualties of the battle has been held on the sunday nearest to 
oct 23 that was the night 46 years ago when english gen bernard 
law montgomery launched a devastating attack on the elite axis 
divisions of the desert fox german field marshal erwin rommel 
the decisive battle began at 940 pm when montgomerys guns 
opened fire under a full moon after a day of blistering heat 
rain had turned the desert to mud by the time the battle was won 
early nov 4 ending rommels relentless march across north africa 
toward suez it cleared the way for the allies to open a second 
front in europe 
this years main ceremony will be held beneath the pink and 
green foliage of the commonwealth cemetery an english garden 
setting against a desert backdrop 
among those who will take part is britains defense secretary 
george younger who arrived with a delegation of 41 including 
about a dozen war widows and 17 veterans 
the cemetery with its rows of marked and unmarked graves is an 
emotional reminder of the battle wedged in the 30 miles of 
wasteland between the quicksandfilled qattarra depression to the 
south and the mediterranean sea to the north 
the largest war cemetery in north africa it contains the graves 
of commonwealth soldiers who died at elalamein as well as some who 
fell earlier in the sahara 
english architect sir hubert worthington came to elalamein in 
the summer of 1943 just months after rommel was repelled to 
design a garden cemetery in the harsh surroundings 
he determined that walls were necessary to keep out drifting 
sand and cloisters with hearty plants to make visits pleasant even 
in the hottest months 
of the 7352 graves 815 bear unknown remains 
jew and arab lie side by side english soldiers and canadians 
are buried beside australians indians east africans west 
africans sudanese belgians frenchmen greeks poles troopers 
from the old high commission territories and unknown allied dead 
from other north african campaigns 
on the walls in front of the cemetery are listed names of 11495 
others lost in all desert campaigns 
east of the commonwealth cemetery is a separate smaller memorial 
to greek combatants and monuments to axis losses are to the west 
italys mausoleum dazzling white against the azure sea holds 
the remains of 3241 soldiers 
a short distance away the dark round fortresslike german 
memorial dominates a sandy hill beside the shore its walls shelter 
4280 remains 
in its center courtyard a tablet reads the price of pride is 
high and paid by the young 
there has been occasional talk of halting the annual 
commemoration but wing cmdr anthony edmunds who heads this 
years program said that is not being seriously considered 
for the younger generations world war ii is becoming part of 
a deep dark past but for others this time of year recalls 
elalamein he said egypt still has large italian and greek 
communities who gather for the ceremony 
edmunds remembers studying about elalamein in detail as a child 
because it was such a turning point for the allies we were doing 
ok in europe awful in the far east and hadnt done well in africa 
after elalamein all that changed 
the saharas constantly shifting sands have made it impossible 
to know the exact numbers of elalameins dead 
untold thousands of men are hidden from time to time the 
featureless landscape too dry even for shrubs releases a stilled 
skeleton or exposes a mine 
estimates of casualties dead wounded captured and missing 
total 72500 the axis suffered 59000 and the commonwealth 
sustained 13500 
elalamein tells the story of its 12 days in world history in a 
small museum 
the visitor passes large nazi and commonwealth flags on the way 
to display cases of weaponry uniforms battle plans and related 
documents 
departmentstore dummies are decked out as the meticulous and 
calculating montgomery and lean rommel 
outside is a row of tanks gathering dust including the 
italians m13 that montgomerys tankmen called the 
selfpropelled coffin

shiite moslem kidnappers on friday 
threatened to harm two american hostages to retaliate for israeli 
air attacks on palestinian and proiranian guerrilla bases in 
lebanon 
committing this stupidity and this attack shall not pass 
without a punishment said a typewritten statement in arabic 
signed by islamic jihad the proiranian faction holding american 
journalist terry a anderson and educator thomas sutherland 
the typewritten arabic statement was delivered to the 
independent beirut newspaper annahar hours after the attack an 
authenticating color picture of anderson was delivered to the 
reuters news agency with a copy of the statement but it was the 
same photograph the group released of anderson in april 
the statement praised the shiite moslem suicide car bomber who 
killed seven israeli soldiers and wounded eight soldiers and two 
lebanese women in israels selfdeclared security zone in south 
lebanon on wednesday that attack prompted israels retaliatory air 
strike which killed 15 people and wounded 35 in south lebanon on 
friday 
the instant photo showed anderson 40 chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press wearing a commodore hotel 
tshirt and a bushy beard and mustache he looked straight into the 
camera without his glasses 
it was the 11th picture released of lebanons longestheld 
foreign captive abducted in moslem west beirut march 16 1985 
it was the same photograph released of anderson on april 10 
when islamic jihad threatened to harm the hostages if a kuwaiti 
jetliner hijacked to larnaca cyprus was stormed to free the 
passengers 
the 29line statement began with several verses from the koran 
islams holy book and deplored israels air attack as a 
challenge to the will of our oppressed people 
it accused the us administration of giving israel advance 
approval to attack palestinian and hezbollah guerrillas in lebanon 
the proiranian hezbollah or party of god had claimed 
responsibility for the suicide bombing 
the criminal america must realize it will not get away with 
what it has done especially in connection with the hostages we 
hold so that will be a lesson to whoever strikes at the dignity 
and glory of our people and mujahedeen holy fighters it said 
sheik fadlallah considered to be hezbollahs spiritual leader 
said he would do his best to protect the hostages 
we continue to respect our previous commitments to defend 
human rights in order to see these hostages free and safe as soon 
as possible he said we will do our utmost to see that nothing 
happens to any of them 
he spoke in beirut with ray barnett a canadian representative 
of ambassadors of aid a group that helps orphans in third world 
countries 
in cadiz ky andersons sister peggy say issued a statement 
asking his captors to recognize that terry anderson is totally 
innocent and has never been involved in the continuing middle east 
strife except as a captive for 3 years 
it is totally unjust to hold him responsible for the military 
actions of another country mrs say said 
fridays statement was the first since aug 18 when the group 
said none of its hostages would be released soon 
sutherland 56 of fort collins colo was acting dean of 
agriculture at the american university of beirut when he was 
abducted june 9 1985 
anderson and sutherland are among nine americans believed held 
by proiranian extremist factions linked to hezbollah others held 
are three britons an irishman and an italian 
in washington state department spokesman charles redman called 
for an end to violence between israel and lebanon and urged the 
kidnappers to free their hostages 
asked about the islamic jihad warning he said these are 
innocent victims they are being held through no fault of their 
own and the appeal to the hostageholders has to be always 
release these innocent people 
in a separate development friday the weekly beirut magazine 
ashshiraa said the united states and iran were working out a new 
deal to free the american hostages before the us presidential 
election on nov 8 
ashshiraa said the deal would ensure the victory of vice 
president george bush in exchange for a commitment from the 
republican candidate to rearm iran 
there was no way to verify the report the united states has 
stressed that it has no contacts with iran 
ashshiraa which has access to iranian hardliners gained 
international fame in nov 1986 when it broke the story of the us 
secret arms sales to iran but most of its subsequent reports about 
the hostages have been inaccurate 
other reports have said both bush and democratic candidate 
michael dukakis sent envoys to work out a deal with the iranians on 
the hostages both candidates denied the reports

merry widow corset effects gave definition to karl 
lagerfelds summer readytowear collection but even with these 
ribbed waistlines his show was full of softness a new note on the 
fashion scene 
the new easy clothes were appealing but lacked the firm 
dynamics that the fashion world has come to expect of lagerfeld 
most of the clothes shown friday were nice without being 
sensational 
a lot of pants very straight and not too wide looked excellent 
in offwhite topped by deep rose or dusty green blazers 
seen on soft green jersey dresses the merry widow touch of 
ribbed seams was a detail that never cinched the waist in 
another option was pinstriped trouser suits and high hats gave 
them trouser suits a raffish 19th century charm 
a few short skirts cropped up notably in some white knit 
tennis style dresses with red or green stripes at hem and 
turtle neck but they were just a few inches above the knee 
lagerfeld announced long ago that longer skirts were coming in 
and he sees that they do showing most skirts way below knee level 
with a few pastels and plenty of black and white in linens 
knits and cottons the effect was nearly subdued for those who 
love knits and dont want the ribbed corset effect a lot of easy 
pleated midcalf skirts were belted near the hip with wide and 
handsome belts with gobby metal decor 
lagerfeld played around with jackets making some hems in tulip 
shapes belting others cutting out some fitted numbers with 
rounded decolletes 
coat dresses at lagerfeld were long and full almost ending up 
looking like housecoats in a wallpaper flower print the navy wool 
crepe fullskirted coat dress was topped by a big organdy bow 
also added to a simple but easilycut trouser suit 
lagerfeld also came up with an excellent suite of tiered and 
pleated ivory crepe de chine numbers with fullish leg o mutton 
sleeves and wide brown belts 
the evening wear was sparse but did feature some fitted and 
fullskirted dresses some with chiffon halter necklines and 
skirts others with long fitted torsoes in black lace and white 
pique 
easytowear was also the idea at popy moreni an italianborn 
designer who has been showing in paris for several years now 
her clothes were often based on gray in full shiny wool trench 
coats in wool and silk trouser suits and dresses with full skirts 
the overall effect was always girlish 
to contrast with all the grey lilac and yellow also came out in 
wide knit culotte suits or paired with charcoal in draped tops 
with details like jabots on pinstriped shirtjackets or full 
skirts under fitted torsoes the clothes were feminine and young 
for the sporty set moreni also showed a line of striped wide 
bermudas and shorts 
the dressy touch here was also disarmingly girlish in a series 
of longskirted ivory silks and a big line of white cottons with 
ruffles and tiers that looked like simplified versions of 18th 
century frilliness 
for garden parties or dressy barbecues the pretty flowered 
chiffon dresses or multicolored rainbow numbers had unsophisticated 
charm 
like all of paris bernard perris showed plenty of pants from 
buttoned tight toreador style to the widest pyjamas his lines 
were always soft but jackets for long skirts and trousers were cut 
with big wing lapels and swallowtails the color scheme was 
subdued with soft pearl gray and pastels in light wools cotton 
and silks 
even the boleros were waistnipped and while the emphasis was 
on dressier clothes perris also brought out wide street shorts 
with cuffs and spencer jackets

to critics the british government has forsaken 
democracy with its decision to end the right of suspects to remain 
silent under police interrogation in northern ireland 
but supporters including distinguished judges hailed the 
announcement thursday by prime minister margaret thatchers 
government as a sensible long overdue move that will mean fewer 
terrorists go free 
either way mrs thatchers government is prepared to dump the 
british equivalent of the us constitutions fifth amendment the 
fifth amendment holds that no person shall be compelled in any 
criminal case to be a witness against himself without due 
process of law 
new laws expected to be passed for northern ireland by january 
and for england and wales by 1990 will allow a judge or jury to 
deduce if they wish that a suspects refusal to answer police 
questions after arrest is an indication of guilt 
at present courts are not allowed to take into consideration a 
suspects silence under laws dating from the 17th century and 
designed to protect illiterate suspects from unfairly or wrongly 
incriminating themselves 
but government officials note times have changed 
in northern ireland where the law is aimed mainly at the irish 
republican army police find guerrilla suspects welltrained in how 
to sit it out staring at a wall through days of interrogation 
sitting with their heads between their legs to avoid eye contact 
with interrogators or lying under a table 
elsewhere in the united kingdom mrs thatchers officials 
argue regular criminals particularly sophisticated racketeers and 
drug dealers are similarly expert 
is it really in the interests of justice that experienced 
criminals should be able to refuse to answer all police questions 
secure in the knowledge that a jury will never hear of it said 
home secretary douglas hurd 
in northern ireland republican news the newspaper of the 
outlawed iras legal political front sinn fein advises arrested 
guerrillas interrogation whatever you say say nothing you 
must make up your mind not to speak until you return home 
what i have to deal with is a sustained and deliberate attack 
on the whole system of justice said northern ireland secretary 
tom king he is britains top official in the province torn by 
roman catholicprotestant strife 
main targets are suspects who say nothing to police and then 
come up with elaborate defenses including detailed alibis weeks 
or months later in court 
however critics say no abuse of the right to silence can 
warrant attacking the fundamentals of a free society 
as recently as 1981 a governmentappointed inquiry into 
criminal procedures concluded the right to silence should be 
preserved 
since 1973 northern ireland has had nojury onejudge courts 
because of the difficulty of getting frightened juries to convict 
or witnesses to testify at ira trials 
both sides point to the fact that in northern ireland less than 
onefourth of people arrested under antiterrorism laws are charged 
police say this reflects the ability of the guilty to stay 
silent critics say it shows police make massive and unjustified 
arrests under antiterrorist laws and the end of the right to 
silence hands police more power to abuse 
also last week the government banned broadcast interviews with 
the members of the ira and 10 other militant groups in northern 
ireland 
to many the measures smack of victory for the ira the thatcher 
government abandoning democratic principles throughout britain as 
it battles the iras campaign to end british rule in northern 
ireland 
to abolish the right to silence is to place a terrible risk 
against those who are verbally inadequate those who are afraid 
who are simply cautious said labor deputy leader roy hattersley 
lord denning who retired in 1982 as britains most senior 
judge retorted the right to silence helps the guilty it is 
only the guilty person who says i am not going to say anything

california gray whales such as the three 
trapped by arctic ice off alaskas northern coast have one of the 
longest migration routes of all mammals and are among the last of 
their species 
the trapped whales didnt leave in time on the annual migration 
from the arctic ocean to the warm water off baja california a 
journey of 6000 to 8000 miles 
california gray whales must leave the arctic before winter 
because they are not adapted for icy conditions and have relatively 
thin blubber for insulation said mark palmer executive director 
of the whale center in oakland 
he said the whales also cannot break through ice and cannot dive 
underneath ice for any great distance 
the whales can only spend an average of three to six minutes 
underwater at a time during their migration he said 
there used to be three distinct populations of gray whales 
including the california group another group in the north atlantic 
and one on the asian coast said steve bailey a marine biologist 
with the california academy of sciences in san francisco 
however the north atlantic group became extinct hundreds of 
years ago and the asian group is almost extinct said bailey the 
california gray whales number about 20000 
the california gray whale averages about 35 feet in length and 
weighs about 30 tons marine biologists said 
the gray whales which may actually be black or dark gray feed 
on small animals that live on the ocean floor

house action on sanctions to punish iraq for 
its alleged use of poison gas against the kurdish minority was 
blocked early saturday and the senate foreign relations chairman 
blamed manuevering by house members beholden to special 
interests 
committee chairman claiborne pell dri told the senate it 
was almost a tragedy to allow a handful of house members to 
bottle up the sanctions bill in the last hours of the 100th 
congress 
the will of the majority the will of the congress has been 
repudiated he said 
the senate had initially passed a strong set of sanctions 
against iraq in the wake of reports that the iraqi army had 
subjected kurdish villages to gas attacks it later went along with 
a watereddown compromise version originating in the house 
but that compromise died when it was stripped from a pending tax 
bill 
unfortunately special interests got into the act pell told 
the senate 
he said opposition to sanctions against iraq had developed in 
the american agriculture oil and chemical industries 
the net effect has been to kill the iraq sanctions for this 
congress said pell who vowed to revisit the issue early in the 
101st congress next year 
he said that for now he is concerned that iraq will get the 
wrong message and that the kurds may be placed in further peril

doug winton an adjunct professor at 
rochester institute of technologys college of continuing 
education teaches basic physics to adult parttime students who 
couldnt care less about the subject 
theyre mostly business majors this is their required science 
credit so i try to add a little pizazz he said 
the pizzaz works total strangers have turned up in class just 
to gawk at the magic tricks winton employs to make physics exciting 
his first trick is a variation of the old 
whiskthetableclothoffasettable trick he stacks up four 
glasses of water a cookie sheet four cardboard tubes and four 
jumbo eggs 
the secret is jumbo eggs theyre heavier so they have more 
inertia winton says 
when the cookie sheet is knocked away the eggs drop into the 
glasses because as wintons students know bodies at rest want to 
stay at rest and bodies in motion want to stay in motion 
he demonstrates the importance of velocity by driving a large 
nail into a piece of plywood with his hand wrapped in a towel his 
grand finale is lying on a bed of nails and having a trained 
volunteer smash cinder blocks with a sledgehammer first on his 
abdomen then on his forehead 
the laws of physics offer protection but no guarantees raw 
knuckles a bruised hand a scraped scalp and a mild concussion 
sometimes are part of the act 
ive had students who couldnt bear to look winton said

visit the united states but is urging moscow to give the same 
permission to all soviets wishing to travel abroad

we would welcome a change in policy by the soviet authorities 
in regard to all others who wish to travel abroad

a helicopter went to the rescue of three 
trapped whales friday bashing through footthick arctic ice with a 
fiveton concrete bullet after frustrated workers began hacking 
an escape route with chain saws 
the whales followed the escape route all the way to the 24th 
breathing hole cut by the workers by friday night bringing them a 
half mile closer to open water now four miles away said national 
guard col tom carroll 
the skycrane heavylift helicopter loaned by the alaska army 
national guard arrived earlier friday from prudhoe bay with a 
steeltipped concrete cylinder a remnant from construction of the 
transalaska oil pipeline 
it finally began punching holes through the ice about 4 pm 8 
pm edt but stopped after about an hour and a half as darkness 
fell 
the helicopter is also creating a series of breathing holes that 
rescuers hope the whales will follow to open water some four miles 
away 
they hover the helicopter 20 feet over the ice and drop the 
bullet palmer said it drops through the ice on the second 
or third try then they pull it back out 
some of the ice comes with it they try to pull out as much as 
possible the holes and ive heard they punched through three or 
four averaging 15 to 20 minutes per hole are about 20 by 30 feet 
theyre approximately 100 feet apart he said 
palmer said the helicopter started its icebashing near a lead 
about four miles from the whales 
were trying not to scare the whales until the last possible 
moment he said at last count they figured it would take 24 
to 26 hours if they work continuously but they have to stop for 
darkness 
the young california gray whales were imprisoned in shallow 
water about 100 yards from shore by thickening shifting ice about 
two weeks ago they have been breathing through small holes in the 
ice about 13 miles northwest of this tiny village on alaskas 
desolate northern coast 
more than a dozen volunteers decided friday not to wait for the 
helicopter and began carving long narrow holes in the ice 
themselves 
were just getting tired of waiting for things to show up 
said north slope borough biologist geoff carroll were getting 
away from the heavy equipment approach 
mark fraker a whale biologist with standard alaska production 
co said rescuers finally were making some progress up until 
now weve just been keeping them alive by keeping their breathing 
holes open 
easterly wind opened leads or open water through the ice to 
within four miles of the whales friday giving an added urgency to 
the effort to free the animals before a shift in the wind could 
pinch off the escape routes 
biologists already were using tarps and aerators to get the 
trapped animals away from their breathing holes and condition them 
to the notion of moving from one hole in the ice to another 
hope faded friday that a hoverbarge could be used to break 
ice to rescue the giant mammals 
originally the national guard planned to use another skycrane 
to tow a 185ton icebreaking barge floating on a cushion of air 
generated by huge onboard fans from prudhoe bay to barrow a 
distance of 230 miles but that bogged down in coastal mud shallow 
water thin ice and sandbars 
two days of pulling had netted six miles helicopter crews set 
out friday to try one last time to pull the barge 
the environmental group greenpeace on friday said the soviet 
union has offered to break a path to the stranded whales with an 
icebreaking ship next week if current rescue efforts dont succeed 
the ship is 300 miles north of point barrow 
biologists had been getting impatient with the barge effort and 
pushed for the alternate plan using the giant concrete punch 
a second concrete cylinder was to be hauled to barrow later if 
there was no further progress with the barge 
with luck the animals will follow a series of punchedout holes 
to open water if broken ice can be removed from the new holes 
the theory is to cut other holes very close but not 
touching said ted meyers national marine fisheries service 
habitat conservation chief for alaska you cut a new hole close 
enough so the whales can see it sense it and go for it once they 
have done that and are using the new hole then you start another 
process of discouraging use of the older hole 
there are different ways one would be to cover the hole and 
then even the sounds of chainsaws cutting new holes could get the 
animals to associate that with new holes once youve got them 
moving and this has not been decided in this case then you could 
move the holes farther apart 
carroll said the whales at least once have been coaxed to a new 
hole 
skycrane pilot chief warrant officer gary quarles experimented 
with one of the concrete cylinders earlier this week he said the 
helicopter would suspend the cylinder about five feet above the ice 
and quickly descend to drop it through 
it has to be very controlled or it would be very dangerous 
he said 
what were going to attempt to do initially is make fairly 
large holes close together in the hope the whales will go from hole 
to hole he said we plan on putting holes maybe 20 feet apart 
my plan is to start fairly far away from them and let them get used 
to the sound rather than starting close and scaring them well do 
it gradually

caterpillar inc and the united auto 
workers announced a tentative agreement friday on a new labor 
contract for 17500 workers in five states 
bargainers had been working against an 11 pm friday strike 
deadline on an agreement for union workers at caterpillar plants in 
the illinois cities of decatur peoria and aurora the only union 
locals that had not previously reached a tenatative settlement 
details of the agreements were not immediately released 
earlier friday uaw local 2096 of pontiac ill with 648 
members announced it had reached a tentative agreement 
pontiac was the fourth uaw local to reach a tentative agreement 
with the peoria illbased caterpillar the worlds largest maker 
of earthmoving equipment contract talks started aug 4 
union officials had said those locals without a tentative 
agreement by the 11 pm deadline would be authorized to call a 
strike 
minutes before the strike deadline the aurora local reached a 
tentative agreement said uaw negotiator elliott anderson the 
peoria local followed suit about an hour later 
union sources earlier said a special job classifications was the 
main snag in talks with the illinois uaw locals in decatur peoria 
and aurora 
those three locals represent 14400 of catepillars 17500 uaw 
workers 
after months of bargaining and two contract extensions both 
sides announced thursday that a tentative agreement had been 
reached on nearly every key issues including pay raises and 
improved health and pension benefits 
the locals had objected to the creation of a special job 
classifications for highly technical jobs because they said it 
threatened the unions traditional seniority system 
workers trained to fill these hightech positions could not be 
bumped from their jobs by untrained workers with more seniority who 
faced layoff 
company officials maintained however that management could not 
afford to invest in new automated machinery and specialized job 
training unless it could depend on having those workers remain on 
the job 
uaw locals in denver york pa and memphis tenn earlier 
reached tentative agreements and the davenport iowa plant is

portauprince haiti ap lt gen prosper avril making a 
longawaited address to this troubled nation promised that his 
military government would lay the foundation for democratic reforms 
but offered no new policies 
army officials meanwhile acknowledged for the first time 
friday that a military coup against avrils fledgling regime had 
been thwarted 
avrils speech broadcast to the nation on state television and 
radio was the subject of widespread anticipation because it was 
the first by the new leader since he assumed power in a military 
coup one month ago 
but the speech lasted only 10 minutes and offered no new policy 
objectives 
avril emphasized that local elections should be held before the 
country could consider electing a new president 
he said friday that he would propose that an independent 
electoral council be established in the next few days to prepare 
for county municipal and legislative elections to open the way 
for presidential elections in a serene atmosphere 
avril listed his governments objectives as creating jobs 
fighting corruption promoting investment and bringing an end to 
violence 
the national interest demands that an end be put to the 
violence and agitation which threaten national stability he said 
observers said they saw nothing new in avrils remarks 
the new leader who replaced ousted leader lt gen henri namphy 
in the sept 17 coup engineered by rankandfile soldiers did not 
mention a reported coup attempt against his government during the 
weekend that led to the arrest of 12 soldiers 
however defense and interior minister col carl dorsindil 
acknowledge the coup attempt friday evening 
an attempted coup d etat led by sgt patrick beauchard in 
collaboration with former lt col samuel jeremie was foiled the 
communique read the attempt was unmasked in time and certain of 
their accomplices were arrested 
earlier friday about 2000 demonstrators marched from the 
charred ruins of a slum church to protest a church order to expel 
an activist priest and called on the government to implement army 
reforms 
the protesters now in their second week of demonstrations have 
been angered by the decision of the roman catholic churchs 
salesian order to force the rev jean bertrand aristide haitis 
most popular priest to leave the country 
the demonstrators waved banners hailing aristide as a 
prophet and asked avril to implement promised reforms 
including bringing to justice any remaining tonton macoutes the 
hated secret police that served the duvalier regime for 29 years

soviet dissident andrei d sakharov says the 
governments approval of his first foreign trip with visits to as 
many as six us cities next month is a result of president 
mikhail s gorbachevs recent reforms 
the 67yearold physicist who spent eight years in exile in his 
own country for human rights campaigning told a friday news 
conference that authorities agreed in principle to the trip but 
have not yet issued travel documents 
i consider that the positive response making my trip possible 
stems from the very big changes in our country during the last few 
years said sakharov who won the 1975 nobel peace prize for his 
human rights activities 
the lifting of the travel ban against sakharov father of the 
soviet dissident movement marked another reversal in kremlin 
policy by gorbachev who has liberalized soviet society on many 
fronts 
sakharov said he plans to attend a meeting in washington of a 
philanthropic group called the international foundation for the 
survival and development of humanity 
sakharov is to attend the foundations board meeting in 
washington nov 1516 and meetings in los angeles san francisco 
boston new york and possibly chicago said group member edward b 
hodgman 
the foundation was set up in january to help solve 
environmental human rights disarmament and economic development 
problems 
the us state department welcomed the soviet decision but urged 
moscow to give the same permission to all soviets wishing to travel 
abroad 
soviet use of alleged knowledge of state secrets to deny many 
other soviet citizens the right to travel abroad is deplorable and 
inconsistent with soviet commitments under the helsinki accords 
said spokesman charles redman 
sakharovs trip could set an uncomfortable precedent hundreds 
of citizens have been denied permission to travel abroad on grounds 
they know state secrets 
he had been denied permission to travel on grounds he had access 
to sensitive information while working on the soviet hydrogen bomb 
in the 1950s 
sakharov has spoken out repeatedly for free emigration and 
protested the soviet intervention in afghanistan in 1979 
he was exiled to the closed city of gorky in 1980 and released 
under gorbachevs administration in december 1986 
in another sign of his return to good graces of soviet 
officials sakharov was elected one of 47 members to the ruling 
presidium of the prestigious academy during the nowdisgraced rule 
of president leonid brezhnev some academy members tried to expell 
sakharov 
sakharov said the academy voted 15282 to elect him to the 
presidium its leading body tass said sakharov now is conducting 
research in cosmology the study of the universes origin 
the physicist said his wife yelena bonner would not travel 
with him but will travel later to the united states alone for 
medical treatment

congress today completed action on a bill 
cutting taxes by 41 billion and increasing the clout of 
individuals involved in disputes with the internal revenue service 
with only a halfdozen members on the floor the senate approved 
the bill by voice vote and sent it to president reagan who 
backers predict will sign it the house had endorsed the 
compromise a few hours earlier on a 3951 vote 
there are thousands and thousands and thousands of people who 
are going to be beneficiaries and theyll thank us for doing our 
job said senate republican leader bob dole of kansas 
those thousands include farmers who will be relieved of paying 
the federal tax on diesel fuel used for offroad purposes and will 
no longer have to fret with the paperwork caused by the heifer 
tax on livestock other winners include owners of mutual funds 
freelance writers workers who receive tuition payments from their 
employers and families saving for a childs college education 
but taxes on other groups will have to go up by 41 billion 
over three years to pay for the 41 billion of selected tax cuts 
the losers include pipe smokers who for the first time will 
have to pay a tax of 45 cents on a pound of their favorite smoking 
mix anyone accustomed to writing off part of their basic home 
phone charge investors in singlepremium life insurance policies 
and some corporations especially those owned by native alaskans 
alaska corporations would lose a special benefit that has 
allowed them to sell operating losses to profitable companies 
lawmakers say the provision has been abused 
negotiators who drafted the final legislation accepted most of 
the taxpayers bill of rights written chiefly by sen david 
pryor dark which is aimed at tipping the scales slightly more 
toward taxpayers when they face audit or collection actions by the 
irs 
these provisions were approved in response to a growing concern 
among many lawmakers about isolated reports of taxpayers being 
harassed and intimidated by some irs employees 
in the future the irs would have to fully inform taxpayers of 
their rights and recourses before any audit or collection steps are 
taken the agency would have to give a 30day notice compared with 
10 days in current law before seizing property to pay back taxes 
and it would be barred from promoting employees on the basis of how 
much money they collect 
the legislation more than two years in the making was designed 
originally to clear up typographical errors and ambiguous wording 
in the big tax overhaul enacted in 1986 it grew in size as the 
taxwriting committees tacked on amendments extending some expiring 
provisions and granting tax benefits for selected groups 
a major nontax provision seizes 540 acres of land adjacent to 
the manassas battlefield in northern virginia to block construction 
of a shopping mall on the site the reagan administration opposes 
this provision although there has been no indication whether it 
would prompt a veto 
negotiators meeting behind closed doors dropped another 
unrelated provision which would have imposed economic sanctions 
against iraq to protest that nations use of poison gas against 
some of its kurdish citizens 
major provisions would 
exempt from tax interest earned on us savings bonds that are 
redeemed to pay for college starting jan 1 1990 
extend expiring tax benefits to help lowerincome families buy 
their first home reward businesses for increased spending for 
research and experimentation and boost incentives for investment 
in lowincome rental housing 
renew an expired provision that allows workers to exclude from 
income tuition payments made by their employers most graduate 
study would not qualify 
extend an exclusion for the value of employerfinanced 
legalservice benefits 
prohibit a business deduction for the basic monthly cost of a 
home telephone 
allow freelance writers artists and photographers to deduct 
certain expenses before a project starts producing income 
permit owners of mutual funds to deduct certain operating 
expenses of the fund without having to meet a requirement that only 
miscellaneous expenses exceeding 2 percent of income be deducted 
the single house vote against the bill was cast by rep henry b 
gonzalez dtexas

congress today sent president reagan a 
farreaching antidrug bill that one senate leader calls bad news 
for drug dealers and their customers 
final passage was delayed until the early morning hours as 
conservatives privately demanded antiobscenity language that was 
considered unconstitutional by many liberals and moderates 
but after negotiators compromised with language to create a new 
obscenity trafficking offense the house approved the bill 34611 
and the senate followed suit by voice vote the house vote came at 
120 am edt and the senate acted at 315 am edt 
the bill contains stiff penalties for drug traffickers and 
users and comes just in time for incumbents to trumpet its passage 
in their reelection campaigns 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan said the bill is bad 
news for drug dealers and their customers and promised that 
congress would pass even tougher medicine next year 
this is a very strong bill said senate majority leader 
robert byrd dwva the message is simple dont do drugs the 
country will not tolerate it 
the bill would fight illegal drugs through law enforcement 
stiffer penalties treatment rehabilitation education and aid for 
authorities in drugproducing countries 
the compromise legislation a product of marathon senatehouse 
negotiations this week would send a strong message that even 
recreational drug use is unacceptable 
the bill would make it possible for those possessing small 
quantities of drugs intended for personal use to be hit with up to 
10000 in civil fines with the right of court review beginning 
next september those convicted of drug offenses including 
possession could face loss of student loans and other federal 
benefits for even a possession conviction 
drug kingpins and others who kill or order killings while 
committing drugrelated felonies could themselves be executed under 
a revitalized federal death penalty serious drug offenses would 
carry stiffer minimum prison terms 
language to strengthen the federal obscenity law was included in 
the compromise by congressional leaders seeking to avoid a 
threatened conservative revolt at all costs leaders have insisted 
the bill be acceptable to republicans and democrats liberals and 
conservatives 
negotiators were unable to resolve disputes and thus left out 
of the final bill proposals for random drug testing for 
transportation workers and those with safetyrelated jobs at 
nuclear facilities 
the legislation provides about 500 million in new spending 
which would barely cover a third of the firstyear cost of an 
estimated 14 billion 
the ineligibility for benefits could affect public housing 
grants contracts loans mortgage guarantees and some forms of 
veterans aid but not social security medicare welfare benefits 
veterans disability and other safetynet programs judges would 
have discretion in imposing the penalties after a conviction 
the president would submit a report to congress on the program 
next may allowing lawmakers to reconsider the proposal before the 
scheduled september 1989 start of the punishment 
the capital punishment provision provides that if someone is 
killed during a federal drug felony the death penalty could apply 
if the killer was engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise was 
trafficking in major amounts of cocaine heroin or other drugs 
intentionally gave an order that resulted in a killing or killed a 
police officer 
to coordinate the nations antidrug policy a drug czar 
would be added to the presidents cabinet the official would 
develop plans for every phase of the drug war share with relevant 
cabinet members the authority to transfer personnel and have the 
right to object when he believes drug funding is inadequate or 
misdirected 
the obscenity trafficking section would allow the government to 
prosecute those engaged in the business of obscenity who derive 
income from their dealings in obscene materials 
the traffickers could be forced to forfeit the obscene material 
and their profits other property belonging to them could be seized 
at a judges discretion

former philippine president ferdinand marcos 
amassed 103 million through embezzlement theft bribes and 
kickbacks funneled it through secret bank accounts and used it to 
buy valuable real estate says the grand jury that indicted him 
marcos 71 and his 59yearold wife imelda also defrauded 
three us lending institutions of 165 million in order to buy and 
finance the properties according to the racketeering indictment 
returned friday 
this is a plan hatched and begun in the philippines to move 
massive amounts of money illegally into the united states said 
us attorney rudolph giuliani then the marcoses came to the 
united states and continued their illegal activities 
saudi arabian financier adnan khashoggi a central figure in the 
secret sale of arms to iran by the reagan administration also was 
indicted 
a washingtonbased lawyer for the marcoses richard hibey told 
a honolulu news conference that the couple would plead innocent 
when arraigned in manhattan on oct 31 
the charges are false hibey said 
philippine president corazon aquino who rode to power on a 
civilianmilitary revolt that forced marcos to flee the country in 
1986 welcomed the indictment today and said it would deter other 
dictators from plundering their countries 
i hope that this and other similar efforts undertaken in other 
countries to investigate the crimes of the marcoses will lead to 
the early recovery of the stolen assets that rightfully belong to 
the filipino people she said in a statement 
hibey charged that marcos had been given until thursday to 
accept or reject a dropdead deal which would have required 
him and his wife to plead guilty to felony racketeering charges and 
testify against others including family members with no 
assurances they would avoid jail 
giuliani refused to comment on any plea bargain negotiations 
hibey suggested that the united states promised to indict marcos 
during negotiations on extending agreements covering us military 
bases in the philippines under an agreement announced earlier this 
week the united states will pay much less for the bases than the 
philippine government first demanded 
he expressed concern that marcos may not be physically able to 
withstand the rigors of a criminal trial of this scope and 
magnitude 
marcos did not attend the news conference in the 2 years he 
has lived in hawaii he has been treated for a variety of 
illnesses including chest pains 
another marcos lawyer john j tigue said the marcoses were 
deeply disappointed that president reagan did not prevent the 
indictment 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said reagan was saddened 
by the indictment because marcos is an old friend and a friend of 
the country 
but its clear that the justice department has a very strong 
case fitzwater added 
the indictment alleges that the marcoses illegally amassed 103 
million through theft embezzlement bribes and kickbacks between 
september 1972 when marcos declared martial law and his departure 
in 1986 
they allegedly funneled the money illegally through secret bank 
accounts in switzerland hong kong and the united states then used 
it to buy four commercial buildings at choice manhattan locations 
charged with racketeering with the marcoses were khashoggi 
bienvenido tantoco sr former philippine ambassador to the 
vatican his wife gliceria once the president of a filipino 
department store the los angelesbased california overseas bank 
and its chairman roberto s benedicto and the banks former 
president rodolfo t aranbulo 
the marcoses the tantocos and khashoggi plotted to conceal the 
true ownership of the four manhattan buildings through false 
documents the indictment said 
robert j morvillo khashoggis attorney said khashoggi 
vehemently denies that he knowingly violated any us law in 
connection with any dealings he had with mr and mrs marcos 
the sixcount indictment also accused the marcoses of scheming 
to buy 59 million in art objects and of transporting money and 
certain works of art they knew to be stolen 
the indictment also charged that the marcoses and tantocos 
defrauded citibank security pacific national bank and the security 
pacific mortgage corp of more than 165 million to buy one 
building and refinance others 
each racketeering charge carries a maximum penalty of 20 years 
in prison and 250000 in fines 
three others were indicted on lesser charges 
giuliani said a minimum of 250 million in property would be 
subject to forfeiture upon conviction 
for the marcoses that includes the four new york buildings 
their home in honolulu and some 28 foreign bank accounts 
the government also is seeking forfeiture of khashoggis posh 
manhattan condominium as well two bank accounts and other 
properties 
the philippine government has filed 39 civil suits against 
marcos seeking 967 billion in damages it hasnt filed any 
criminal charges for fear that marcos would insist on returning to 
the philippines to face them

doctors have stopped using antibiotics to treat the 87yearold 
monarchs infected bile duct said kenji maeda the imperial 
household agency spokesman 
maeda said only that physicians believed it was necessary to

effects from prolonged use of strong drugs 
hirohito received another transfusion of 04 of a pint friday

the 100th congress ending a productive 
twoyear run with an early morning flurry of legislative action 
sent president reagan a compromise bill providing new weapons to 
fight the war on drugs 
congress also approved tax adjustment legislation with a 
threeyear price tag of 41 billion 
it upped the ante for wall street inside traders passing 
legislation to increase fines and prison terms for individual 
offenders and to penalize investment firms that permit the practice 
but efforts to impose economic sanctions against iraq for poison 
gas attacks against kurdish villagers were blocked in the house 
chairman claiborne pell dri of the senate foreign relations 
committee said the sanctions bill was bottled up by house members 
beholden to special interests including the us oil and 
agricultural industries he vowed to try again on sanctions 
legislation early next year 
a struggle to reconcile differences between the house and senate 
versions of the antidrug bill caused congress to abandon plans to 
adjourn for the year in early october 
many senators including virtually all of those up for 
reelection on nov 8 had left town and a handful of senators 
remained to guide the senate through the final hours of the 100th 
congress all bills were adopted by voice votes 
in the house the antidrug bill was adopted 346 to 11 the tax 
adjustment bill passed 3581 
the senate finally adjourned at 316 am about 20 minutes 
after the house closed down 
the 100th congress came in like a lion and it is about to go 
out like a lion said majority leader robert c byrd dwva 
moments before the final gavel cracked 
hours before adjournment house and senate leaders called 
president reagan to announce the end was near 
the 100th congress is coming to a starspangled close the 
president was told by byrd who wore a starspangled tie for the 
occasion 
byrd and senate republican leader bob dole of kansas told 
reporters they believe the 100th congress has compiled the most 
productive record of any congress in 20 years 
the drug package would fight illegal drugs through law 
enforcement stiffer penalties treatment rehabilitation 
education and aid for authorities in drugproducing countries 
it would make it possible for those possessing small amounts of 
drugs for recreational use to be hit with up to 10000 in 
civil fines and beginning next september to face loss of student 
loans and other federal benefits for even a possession conviction 
murders committed or ordered during drugrelated felonies could 
result in imposition of the death penalty serious drug offenses 
would carry stiffer minimum prison terms 
the original purpose of the tax bill was to correct errors in 
the 1986 tax overhaul but in its final form the bill does more 
than that 
the agreement carries a 41 billion price tag over three years 
and a bill of rights for taxpayers 
more than two years in the making the legislation now includes 
tax relief for farmers freelance writers owners of mutual funds 
recipients of employerfinanced tuition and a variety of other 
interests it also includes selected tax increases to pay for those 
benefits 
pressure to pass the tax bill came mainly from farmers who 
would benefit by no longer being required to pay the federal diesel 
tax and by being allowed to deduct some expenses of producing 
livestock before the animals generate income 
pressure also came from accountants and other tax professionals 
who were seeking corrections for hundreds of errors and ambiguities 
in the big tax overhaul enacted in 1986 
the end of the 100th congress marked the retirement of six 
senators including president pro tempore john stennis of 
mississippi who has been a member of the chamber for 40 of his 87 
years also retiring are sens william proxmire dwis a 30year 
senate veteran robert stafford rvt dan evans rwash lawton 
chiles dfla and paul trible rva 
other legislation sent to president reagan on friday included 
compromise legislation that would further restrict lobbying by 
former executive branch officials and apply lobbying restraints to 
former members of congress for the first time the legislation 
would bar departing members of congress from lobbying their former 
colleagues in either chamber for one year 
a 15 billion authorization for corps of engineers flood 
control and navigation projects in 12 states 
three houseapproved bills aimed at focusing the governments 
longrange aviation research boosting the commercial satellite 
industry and bringing order to federal superconductivity efforts 
the aviation proposal directs the federal aviation administration 
to step up its research on aircraft safety including fire 
prevention and the problems faced by aging planes 
a congressional gold medal was authorized to be minted in honor 
of famed artist andrew wyeth 
assorted measures passed by both chambers proclaimed national 
jukebox week uncle sam day national lighthouse day national 
skiing day national earthquake awareness week and national 
asparagus week

twenty students hurled firebombs at a 
uso building after a brawl between koreans and us soldiers 
police and news reports said today 
no injuries were reported in the attack friday night on the 
united services organization a recreational body for american 
soldiers based overseas 
there also were no damages us military authorities said even 
though one firebomb cleared a fence but missed the building guards 
immediately put out the blaze without incident the authorities 
said 
seoul newspapers said the attack involved 20 sloganchanting 
students who hurled about 10 firebombs at the american facility and 
scattered leaflets demanding the us government apologize for 
assaults by american soldiers on koreans 
one american soldier and three koreans were injured last sunday 
in a fight involving about 40 us soldiers and 200 koreans in 
itaewon a shopping district close to the us military 
headquarters in southern seoul 
radicals recently stepped up an antius campaign in the 
aftermath of the olympics games when the actions and manners of 
some american athletes and the allegedly biased coverage of korea 
by the us media during the sept 17oct 2 games upset many 
koreans 
dissidents demand the withdrawal of about 42000 us troops 
stationed in south korea under a mutual defense pact contending 
the united states hampers unification of the korean peninsula 
the peninsula was divided into the communist north and the 
capitalist south in 1945 at the end of world war ii 
in another development the us embassy has asked american 
officials and athletes taking part in the international paralympics 
games in seoul to refrain from going to itaewon at night us 
officials said 
signs were posted in living quarters of american athletes but 
the embassy gave no explanation they said 
bob pearson a spokesman for the us team said the embassy has 
asked his team not to wear clothes or uniforms identifying 
nationality during the visit to itaewon

the scholars who gathered this week 
in san juan wanted to explain the appeal of african cults so they 
built shrines of drums wooden skulls and hot peppers as public 
offerings 
african religions are not about evil spilling blood or 
worshiping devils said puerto rican anthropologist ricardo 
alegria founder of the center for advanced studies for the 
caribbean 
if african cults exist today its because they are growing 
and if there are followers its because cults arent evil 
alegria said 
alegria was among anthropologists and sociologists from the 
united states haiti venezuela cuba the dominican republic and 
brazil who participated in a weeklong symposium at the university 
of san juan on african religions in the caribbean and latin america 
organizers said the conference which closed friday was the 
first of its kind it focused on the religions that branched out in 
the caribbean after black slaves were brought to the new world by 
european colonists nearly 500 years ago 
we hope to bring a better scientific understanding of these 
religions why they survive and what role they play in society 
said mercedes sandoval a social science professor at floridas 
miamidade community college 
its believed up to 200 million people follow some type of 
africanrooted religion in the caribbean and latin america but 
experts say the numbers could be higher because belonging to a cult 
is not necessarily information people volunteer 
influenced by spanish british french and dutch religions 
slaves slowly incorporated religious elements of their colonial 
masters into their own beliefs 
for example caribbean islands colonized by the french and 
spanish adapted elements of roman catholicism using effigies of 
saints in their own ceremonies initially slaves used statues of 
saints as props to hide their own relics from the europeans 
but the two sides fused and today syncretism the combination 
of different beliefs dominates many african religions its common 
in some places to see a statue of st george atop his white horse 
standing next to a horned exu evil spirit 
in english colonized islands african religions took a more 
evangelical protestant tone with less emphasis on religous 
effigies 
among the religions and cults discussed were abakua santeria 
shango palomonte voodoo and mayombe 
voodoo it was explained is not about the hollywood stereotypes 
of zombies and sticking pins in lookalike dolls widely practiced 
in haiti where roman catholicism is the official religion voodoo 
is a blend of catholicism and indian mysticism with an emphasis on 
ancestor worship and harmony with nature 
animal sacrifices play a part in many ceremonies such as 
brazils candombe and umbanda religions in which goats and 
chickens are killed by a babaorisha a father of a saint and 
offered to holy spirits so they will grant earthlings good fortune 
the symposium featured an exhibit of nine altars and shrines 
displaying the paraphernalia of african rites 
the nigerian altar had a curtain of dry palm leaves protecting 
holy rocks and bata drums that call spirits or serve as background 
music to celebrate a saints birthday 
many shrines had cauldrons stuffed with feathers wooden skulls 
spicy sauces fruits and herbs 
cubas exhibit showed the influence of the yoruba people of 
nigeria who hid their dieties underneath bright satin and beaded 
mantelpieces

one of three trapped whales disappeared 
under the ice and was presumed dead today a biologist said only 
hours after rescuers scored their greatest success in moving the 
animals closer to open water 
the whale named bone was last seen late friday afternoon said 
geoff carroll a north slope borough biologist helping lead the 
effort to rescue the three california gray whales 
by midnight carroll and others on the ice near this small town 
on the arctic ocean had given up hope that bone might rejoin the 
others bone crossbeak and bonnet have stuck together since 
becoming trapped in unseasonably heavy ice more than two weeks ago 
during their annual migration southward 
the missing whale got its name because skin on its snout had 
been rubbed down to the bone by the rough ice surrounding a 
breathing hole that kept the mammals alive that condition may have 
led to bones death said biologist craig george 
once they get a bone infection they go pretty quick george 
said 
eskimos led the whales almost a half mile closer to open water 
earlier friday by carving a string of 24 breathing holes in the ice 
away from the main hole the animals had been using 
meanwhile a helicopterdropped concrete bullet bashed a 
trail from the direction of the open water 
about two dozen eskimo volunteers many of them bowhead whale 
hunters worked about eight hours to cut the 10by30foot holes 
with chain saws 
the whales have moved all the way to the 24th hole said 
col tom carroll commander of the alaska army national guards 
portion of the rescue effort im not sure how they did it but 
leave it up to eskimo ingenuity 
deicers which keep the holes open by agitating the water 
freed the eskimos to work on new holes until two minnesota men 
brought the devices earlier this week rescuers had spent all their 
time keeping the original breathing holes from freezing up 
another dozen deicing devices and a dozen more chain saws were 
on the way to barrow 
a huge ch54 skycrane helicopter loaned by the guard began 
working toward the whales from about four miles away so as not to 
scare the mammals it used a 5ton steeltipped concrete block 
suspended from its belly to punch four 15to20foot holes in the 
ice at 75yard intervals 
they hover the helicopter 20 feet over the ice and drop the 
bullet said spec 4 wade palmer a guard spokesman it drops 
through the ice on the second or third try then they pull it back 
out 
a second skycrane abandoned the repeatedly frustrated effort to 
tow a 185ton icebreaking hoverbarge 230 miles from prudhoe 
bay and was to fly to barrow today to help bash more holes in the 
ice said tom carroll 
the first helicopter began working just inside a troublesome ice 
ridge that blocks the path to freedom and lies about a quartermile 
from an area of open water leading to the sea 
the ridge formed when drifting pack ice collided with ice 
anchored on the ocean bottom is too thick to be punctured by the 
helicopters and demolition experts were on their way to assess the 
situation said geoff carroll 
we looked for an alternate route bypassing the ridge and 
didnt find it carroll said if theres no way through it it 
will have to be tackled early while the whales still are some ways 
from it 
ron morris of the national marine fisheries service has 
expressed reluctance to use explosives for fear they might harm 
other marine mammals 
the soviet union offered friday to send an icebreaking vessel 
now 300 miles miles from point barrow to help carve a path for the 
trapped whales but carroll said water in the area may be too 
shallow for the vessel 
easterly wind opened leads or open water through the ice to 
within four miles of the whales friday giving added urgency to the 
effort to free them before a shift in the wind could pinch off the 
escape routes 
the whales still would face a 200mile trek through the leads to 
reach open sea and weather forecasts indicate the favorable wind 
may end this weekend 
the whales also have eskimo names kanik snowflake for bone 
putu icehole for crossbeak and siku ice for bonnet

the fitness movement has bypassed four out of 
five american adults especially those who are older have low 
incomes and are less educated a new survey says 
only one in five us adults gets significant exercise at least 
twice a week and 45 percent dont participate in any fitness 
activity according to the survey of 12500 people commissioned by 
the national sporting goods association 
lowest rates of participation are among people over 55 years 
old those with incomes under 15000 and those lacking college 
educations according to the survey 
you would have had to be living under the proverbial rock to 
miss hearing about the need for frequent participation in a fitness 
activity said thomas b doyle research director for the 
sporting goods group 
the scientific evidence linking physical activity to health is 
growing according to dr j michael mcginnis director of the 
federal office of disease prevention and health promotion in 
washington 
we know that regular exercise can reduce the risk of heart 
disease and help maintain a healthy weight he said in a 
statement and it can also make people feel better 
the survey defined significant exercise as any of seven 
activities aerobic exercising cycling calisthenics exercising 
with equipment exercise walking runningjogging and swimming it 
didnt say how long each activity must be performed 
the surveys findings parallel those of previous studies by the 
national centers for disease control and other groups 
inactivity threatens the health of a far greater proportion of 
americans than any of the muchpublicized evils of smoking high 
blood pressure or high blood cholesterol one researcher said 
yet a sedentary lifestyle can double the risk of a fatal heart 
attack or stroke said the researcher harold kohl an 
epidemiologist with the institute of aerobics research in dallas 
its almost the same risk as for smoking high blood 
pressure high cholesterol he said in a telephone interview 
friday 
an overwhelming majority of the population is not exercising 
currently at the levels we believe most optimal for health he 
said 
kohl said he believes people are discouraged by the belief that 
they must exercise at optimal levels 20 minutes a day three 
times a week at 65 percent of the hearts maximum capacity to pump 
blood 
but latest findings indicate that the highest risks of death 
from fatal heart attacks or strokes occur only in the most inactive 
people and substantial benefits result from activities such as 
brisk walks and gardening 
people think youve got to go out and do marathons 
triathlons 10 ks 10kilometer races kohl said what we 
need to say is turn off the tv do some gardening take a walk 
after dinner 
the survey was conducted by the independent polling organization 
npd research in port washington ny and had a margin of error 
of plus or minus 5 percentage points doyle said 
it was released in conjunction with the international sporting 
goods association trade show running through today in chicago

this community above the arctic circle 
the northernmost in the united states hardly qualifies as a 
popular fall destination with its belowzero weather fog and the 
occasional polar bear roaming the streets 
but the drama of efforts to free three icetrapped whales has 
turned the eskimo village into a boom town 
it feels like this is grand central station said fran tate 
owner of pepes north of the border restaurant where business in 
the past week has been up 20 percent 
hordes of journalists from australia to new york have come to 
report on the plight of the california gray whales imprisoned 
under arctic ocean ice about 13 miles northeast of here for more 
than two weeks one of the whales disappeared under the ice friday 
and was presumed dead 
residents of this whaling village of about 2200 people are more 
accustomed to visits from polar bears that occasionally wander in 
off the ice pack but they are taking the attention and the demands 
of the media in stride 
weve become something of a nerve center said ron hewitt 
manager of the top of the world hotel 
the 40room hotel has been fully booked since oct 16 and its 
switchboard has been lit up constantly with calls from people 
seeking rooms and information about the whales 
another 16room hotel and all 60 rooms at the former naval 
arctic research laboratory also were filled hewitt said 
right now were taking the names of people in town who have 
space and were referring callers to them hewitt said its 
all part of the communitys response but were glad to do it 
the impact has spread far beyond the hotels 
a special bank of phones was installed in the north slope 
borough assemblys chambers thursday to improve communications 
said marie adams of the boroughs information liaison office 
phone lines in the boroughs searchandrescue operations center 
had gotten so clogged the rescue squad couldnt have received 
emergency calls had there been any adams said 
and there isnt a rental vehicle left in town enterprising 
natives are hitching sleds to their snowmobiles to haul reporters 
photographers and tv crews across the ice to view the whales 
some reporters went to the operations center to hitch rides to 
the ice pack on borough and military helicopters involved in the 
rescue effort but the center was declared offlimits 
illequipped visitors unfamiliar with the harsh arctic 
conditions have created a run on insulated boots stocking caps 
mittens and other coldweather gear 
journalists also like to eat well 
theyre bigger spenders because theyre on expense accounts 
said tate who bills her establishment as the farthest north 
mexican restaurant 
asked if she thought the media response was out of proportion to 
the situation tate said well maybe just a little bit but 
whats wrong with caring 
tate said the coverage will show the compassion the eskimos feel 
for whales despite their hunting heritage the eskimos hunt bowhead 
whales not california grays

the story of three trapped whales and efforts to save them from 
an icy death has generated sympathy across the nation and around 
the world 
the struggle against time and thickening arctic ice has gripped 
us schoolchildren made frontpage news in italy and france and 
gained extensive coverage by soviet television news 
its the kitten in the tree syndrome if a kitten gets caught 
everybody gathers around to rescue it said patricia warhol 
director of the american cetacean society in san pedro calif 
we cant do much about japanese whale hunters ocean pollution 
and gill nets but here are three whales that maybe we can save 
ms warhol said in a telephone interview 
a combination of early ice and shifting winds trapped the three 
california gray whales more than two weeks ago near the

persecuted 
their plight is a teaching tool in classes such as cathy

little children love anything big ms garrett said 
theyre very concerned about how the whales got trapped and why 
they need to come up to breathe theyre aware these animals have a 
right to live theyre fascinated by them 
they want them to survive they dont want them to be hurt 
the drama has produced a wave of support from wellwishers 
including a telephone pep talk from president reagan to chilled

defense secretary frank carlucci says 
americans must get over their fear of selling arms to arab 
countries or risk losing ground to other countries with the 
weapons and the will to step in 
great britain france china the soviet union and others are 
moving into the highly desirable positions of confidence and 
influence which america has traditionally enjoyed with friends such 
as jordan and saudi arabia carlucci said i see tens of 
billions of dollars worth of jobs going abroad instead of 
sustaining our key defense industries and bolstering the us 
economy 
carlucci speaking friday at an americanarab relations seminar 
at marshall university said the threat to israel would be greater 
if arab countries look to other nations to supply arms 
the notion that us defense cooperation with moderate arab 
states poses a danger to israel is illfounded and untrue 
carlucci said israel must regard nonamerican arms in the hands 
of its neighbors as a higher risk 
congress has rejected major arms sales to saudi arabia and 
carlucci warned lawmakers that the denial poses a greater threat 
militarily in the mideast and economically in the united states 
fouad alfarsy saudi arabias deputy minister of information 
said earlier in the seminar that his country like other moderate 
neighbors of israel should not be treated as the enemy due to its 
longstanding relationship with the united states 
in the last 15 years in the development of saudi arabia we 
have looked to the us of america for leadership guidance and 
manpower alfarsy said 
the international president of bnai brith a jewish civic and 
fraternal organization said the group was dismayed to hear that 
carlucci defined united states arms sales policy in terms of 
dollars and cents 
if the united states wanted primarily to earn monetary profit 
on weapons sales this country could sell arms to all sorts of 
dictatorial and totalitarian regimes around the world said 
seymour reich 
however the cornerstone of the us arms sales policy has 
always been to examine first and foremost the strategic and moral 
implications of military sales reich said 
in the case of arms sales to the middle east the us has 
always chosen the wise course of supporting its most reliable ally 
in the region israel reich said this has meant and rightly 
so denying sophisticated weapons to those nations who in 
defiance of us foreign policy which seeks advancement of the 
peace process continue to declare themselves to be in a state of 
war with americas steadfast partner in strategic cooperation 
israel 
carlucci and alfarsy agreed on the need for israel and the 
palestine liberation organization to meet facetoface to negotiate 
peace in the mideast but had differing conditions for how to get 
them talking 
carlucci said the plo first needs to renounce terrorism and 
agree that israel has a right to exist 
palestinian participation is required at every stage of 
negotiations concerning the west bank and gaza since the outcome 
will affect their interests and will bear directly on their future 
as a people carlucci said without their active participation 
no agreement can be expected to endure alfarsy said the united 
states should not set itself up as an honest broker then take 
israels side on every question 
there can be no chance for peace if one side will not talk to 
the other to them progress is the lack of progress alfarsy 
said of the israelis israel is stubborn because it knows the 
us of america will support her no matter what position she 
takes

e robert wallach who has been indicted in the 
wedtech scandal says reporters were corrupted by ambitious 
prosecutors who leaked information to them 
by the time i was indicted i was already convicted said 
wallach who is accused of taking payoffs from wedtech officials in 
exchange for influencing the awarding of government contracts 
i am an innocent man caught in this system wallach told the 
associated press managing editors convention friday and you 
every one of you no matter how wellintentioned played a part in 
it 
wallach a san francisco lawyer who goes to trial jan 3 in new 
york on federal racketeering and conspiracy charges also accused 
reporters of slanting their articles by overlooking his record as a 
respected litigator 
also speaking at the convention were former democratic vice 
presidential candidate geraldine ferraro and wendell phillippi 
retired managing editor of the indianapolis news 
ferraro told the newspaper editors they crossed the line between 
the publics right to know and an invasion of privacy in covering 
her bid for the vice presidency in 1984 
when reporters were finished interviewing everyone they could 
find including a janitor in a school where she once taught they 
found nothing newsworthy she said i was what i said i was 
so they had to go after my family she said referring to her 
husbands business dealings 
phillippi was the one who made a telephone call on behalf of 
republican vice presidential candidate dan quayle when quayle 
wanted to join the national guard years ago phillippi assailed his 
peers friday for letting what he called an editors mistake stick 
im here as a defendant after being tried in the kangaroo 
court in which some of you participated the former apme 
president said 
he said he was belittled maligned misquoted and harrassed 
after the ap picked up a story from the indianapolis news that 
suggested phillippi made many calls on quayles behalf 
i made one call to one person phillippi said 
the ap corrected the story but phillippi said he was hounded 
for weeks by newspaper reporters from around the country who 
continued to base their reports on the erroneous information 
how much are editors responsible for the pushiness of their 
reporters he said 
ours is an honorable profession phillippi said please 
lets keep it that way

a threeyear probe that led to the 
indictments of a retired air force colonel and a defense contractor 
is likely to produce more charges a federal prosecutor said 
unisys corp and its predecessor sperry corp are each accused 
of falsely billing the government for more than 500000 for work 
that was never performed as part of a 526 million contract to 
modernize the air forces computer network us attorney jim 
wilson said friday 
retired air force col robert l hedges 51 of montgomery is 
accused of negotiating a consulting job with sperry while he was 
overseeing the contract wilson said 
wilson said more indictments are expected from the 
investigation hedges was indicted wednesday and the companies on 
tuesday 
hedges washingtonbased attorney robert s bennett said his 
client was innocent and would defend himself vigorously 
his decisions regarding his postretirement activities were 
done in full accordance with the law and with the knowledge and 
understanding of the air force bennett said 
j peter hynes a spokesman at unisys office in blue bell pa 
said neither hedges nor sperry did anything wrong 
unisys is the product of the 1986 merger of sperry and burroughs 
corp wilson said that is why both companies were named in the 
indictment 
a statement released by unisys said the company was 
disappointed that after more than three years of cooperation with 
the government an indictment would be brought relating to the 
alleged falseness of one invoice of a predecessor company 
al agricola an assistant us attorney handling the case said 
investigators had not determined whether sperry might have received 
favorable treatment in exchange for a consulting job hedges took 
after he left the service in august 1984 
under the statute it didnt have to just the conflict being 
there is required said agricola 
in june 1984 hedges signed a 75000 consulting contract with 
sperry while on leave from the air force wilson said 
hynes confirmed that hedges did work for sperry after leaving 
the air force he said hedges is still under contract with unisys 
sperry was awarded the eightyear contract in january 1983 
wilson said hedges oversaw the program from gunter air force base 
in montgomery 
prosecutors said unisys remains eligible for defense contracts 
although col clarence benham of the air forces investigations 
division said the pentagon could decide otherwise 
if convicted sperry and unisys each could face 50000 fines 
plus restitution to the air force hedges could be fined 10000 if 
convicted

egypts president hosni mubarak accompanied 
plo chairman yasser arafat to jordan today on arafats first visit 
to the kingdom since king hussein severed links last july with the 
israelioccupied west bank 
hussein greeted the leaders at the red sea port of aqaba 175 
miles south of the capital amman state jordan radio reported 
palestine liberation organization officials in tunis reached by 
telephone from cyprus said arafat and hussein are trying to agree 
on a formula for a confederation between jordan and a future 
independent palestinian state 
the palestine national council a sort of parliamentinexile 
is due to meet in algeria on nov 1214 to declare palestinian 
independence in the west bank and gaza strip which have been 
wracked by a palestinian uprising against israeli rule since dec 8 
mubarak believes that it the council will be successful only 
if it also states clearly what relations the palestinian state will 
have with egypt israel and jordan one plo official said 
the radio said among those gathered for todays talks were prime 
minister zaid rifai and foreign minister taher masri of jordan 
egyptian foreign minister esmat abdelmeguid and three of arafats 
senior aides hani alhassan mahmoud abbas and mohammed milhem 
mubarak said in an interview published thursday in the egyptian 
daily alahram that the next few days would witness a 
consolidation of the arab side in possible peace talks with 
israel 
it is now for israel to make up its mind and declare that it 
opts for peace and is ready to accept the obligations peace 
entails he said 
the tripartite summit comes a little more than a week before a 
crucial israeli election pitting the labor party which favors 
negotiating a partial withdrawal from the occupied territories 
against the likud bloc which opposes territorial compromise 
hussein said thursday in an interview with the us network 
abctv that a likud victory would be an absolute disaster and 
said the peace proposals of labor leader shimon peres were a step 
forward 
arafat has not visited jordan since the outbreak of proplo 
rioting in the west bank and gaza strip which once again propelled 
the plo to the center of the middle east stage 
in july hussein formally renounced his claims to the west bank 
which jordan ruled until israeli occupation in 1967 the move 
challenged the plo to set up a palestinian state in the occupied 
lands 
hussein said he took the move in compliance with plo wishes plo 
officials generally welcomed the move but expressed irritation they 
were not consulted in advance and some indicated suspicion hussein 
was trying to pressure the organization 
its no secret that theres distrust between the king and the 
chairman arafat said a plo official from tunis but both 
trust mubarak he can be a good guarantor 
plo officials say the palestinian national council is likely to 
declare independence for the occupied territories that include 
gaza which was ruled by egypt before its occupation in 1967 it 
may also establish a provisional government that could take part in 
peace talks 
plo officials say the council may formally but implicitly 
endorse israels right to exist by accepting the 1947 united 
nations partition resolution that split palestine into arab and 
jewish states 
at least 301 palestinians and six israelis have died in the 
10month uprising in the occupied territories

us rep pat swindall cannot tell a jury that 
charges against him were politically motivated without a hearing 
that could delay his perjury trial until after the nov 8 election 
a judge ruled 
swindall accused us attorney robert barr of scheming against 
him for political gain on friday he also charged that the 
government deliberately timed his 10count indictment shortly 
before the election 
they wanted to make darn good and well sure that they got 
the indictment before nov 8 1988 swindall said of prosecutors 
but us district judge robert vining who began screening 
potential jurors friday ruled that swindall may not raise his 
allegations to the jury without a hearing that could delay his 
trial until after the election 
barring such a delay jury selection could be completed and 
opening arguments in the trial could begin monday 
swindall told vining he would pursue the hearing process if it 
doesnt unnecessarily delay the trial but lead prosecutor craig 
gillen immediately served notice he would seek time to prepare a 
written response to any such move 
barr also said he plans to be on the west coast next week for 
legal conferences 
vining said swindall would be free to raise the issue monday 
morning outside the courtroom swindall declined to comment on his 
plans 
swindall a twoterm republican representing the 4th 
congressional district of suburban atlanta faces democrat ben 
jones in the election 
as he unsuccessfully sought to subpoena barr to testify at the 
trial swindall contended it is no accident that he was indicted 
shortly before the election 
he accused barr who like swindall is a republican of 
contacting officials in vice president george bushs presidential 
campaign to assess the political impact of his investigation 
one of those officials jay morgan deputy director of bushs 
southern campaign confirmed he talked with barr on the day 
swindall was indicted but denied ever having discussed the swindall 
case with barr 
barr declined comment citing the pending trial 
later swindall said he would subpoena reporters for the atlanta 
journalconstitution and wsbtv two news organizations which this 
summer obtained transcripts or videotapes of secretly recorded 
meetings between swindall and an undercover investigator 
swindall would not disclose what he wants to ask the reporters 
on the witness stand and questioned whether they can legally be 
compelled to reveal the source of their stories about the recorded 
conversations 
meanwhile charles lechasney described by prosecutors as the 
middleman in the loan negotiations which led to the charges against 
swindall pleaded guilty to five violations of federal currency 
laws 
lechasney admitted to charges which do not mention swindall but 
involve the moneylaundering sting investigation that 
eventually included a proposed 850000 home mortgage loan for the 
congressman 
paul kish lechasneys lawyer said he did not know if his 
client would be called as a prosecution witness against swindall 
lechasney was a participant in meetings with swindall and an 
undercover agent posing as a financier the government contends 
that the agent told swindall his proposed loan from lechasney would 
be backed by illegal drug proceeds and that swindall perjured 
himself by denying that to a grand jury 
swindall has said lechasney misled him and that he did not 
intentionally deceive the grand jury 
lechasney could be sentenced to 30 years in prison and fined 
15 million but under a plea agreement federal prosecutors 
agreed to recommend lesser sentences if he testifies truthfully in 
all related cases five related charges will be dropped under the 
plea bargain 
lechasney also agreed to repay 17500 in government funds which 
he had converted to his own use

no courtroom reunions were planned to 
mark the anniversary of one of the nations longest trials but 
jurors in the case which involved less than a teaspoon of dioxin 
look back a year ago today and sigh with relief 
i dont think ill ever forget when it started and when it 
ended especially when it ended said garry cumer of east st 
louis a 39yearold telephone technician who served as jury 
foreman in the case known as kemner vs monsanto 
the guys at work tease me he said they call me the 
lawyer 
after nearly four years of testimony and 38 days of 
deliberation the jury decided on oct 22 1987 that the st 
louisbased monsanto co owed more than 16 million to 65 people in 
sturgeon mo because of a chemical spill in 1979 during a train 
derailment 
barbara mccann who was dismissed from the jury just 45 minutes 
before it got the case said she remains bitter 
mrs mccann 50 was dismissed by st clair county judge richard 
goldenhersh for a conflict of interest after being part of the jury 
for more than three years 
i hold a grudge said the mother of five who works as a 
sales clerk and i still get tearyeyed when i think about it 
and i will for years 
the panel awarded the plaintiffs 162 million as punitive 
damages but gave 63 of them only 1 for compensatory damages it 
awarded two plaintiffs 14500 each to compensate for property 
damage 
the missouri residents said they were hurt when the train 
derailed in sturgeon and a 19000gallon load of wood preservative 
containing less than a teaspoon of dioxin spilled along the tracks 
monsanto contended the amount of dioxin was too small to cause 
the fatigue headaches joint pains high blood pressure nausea 
and other ills claimed by the plaintiffs 
dioxin an unwanted byproduct created during the manufacture of 
some herbicides and pesticides is known to cause brain heart and 
genetic damage in laboratory animals the health risk to humans 
remains subject to debate 
the case which generated 113000 pages of court records alone 
is on appeal said monsanto attorney david snively attorneys on 
both sides agreed it would take another year possibly two before 
the case is settled 
if i had to do it again id try to get out of it mrs 
mccann said i dont think anything should go that long 
jerome seigfried of mexico mo who represented the plaintiffs 
with attorney rex carr of belleville called his participation a 
very interesting experience 
he said he had no regrets about taking the case tried in 
illinois because monsanto manufactured the wood preservative at its 
sauget plant it was part of the job he said its what i 
do 
but like the jurors snively breathed a sign of relief that the 
trial phase was over 
the length of the trial was physically tough on everybody 
the stress the fatigue snively said after its over 
everybody tends to gain a little bit of weight 
its just good to see your kids and family on a regular 
basis he said

welcomed the indictment of ferdinand marcos on us racketeering 
charges saying it would hasten recovery of the billions of dollars 
plundered during his 20year rule 
mrs aquino in a statement said she hopes the prosecution in 
new york of her predecessor will serve as a deterrent to other 
dictators who steal from their countries and then seek asylum 
abroad 
this indictment is certainly welcome news in the philippines 
and i commend this evident commitment to the rule of law abroad 
mrs aquino said 
marcos has been living in honolulu since he fled the country 
during the february 1986 civilianmilitary revolt that swept mrs 
aquino to power president reagan invited marcos to take up 
residence in the united states 
marcos claims in a lawsuit filed in honolulu that he was 
deceived into leaving the country against his will 
marcos and his wife imelda are restricted to the island of 
oahu because of his reported attempt last year to return to the 
philippines us officials are honoring a philippine government 
request that he not be allowed to return 
on friday the us government indicted former president marcos 
his wife and eight associates on charges of racketeering they 
could face 20year prison sentences if found guilty 
marcos was the highestranking former foreign official indicted 
in the united states 
the charges alleged that between september 1972 when marcos 
declared martial law in the philippines and 1986 the marcoses 
amassed 103 million through embezzlement theft bribes and 
kickbacks 
according to the indictment the marcoses illegally funneled the 
money through secret bank accounts in switzerland hong kong and 
the united states and then used the money to buy valuable new york 
properties 
i hope that this and other similar efforts undertaken in other 
countries to investigate the crimes of the marcoses will lead to 
the early recovery of the stolen assets that rightfully belong to 
the filipino people mrs aquino said 
mrs aquinos government has accused the marcoses of stealing up 
to 10 billion in public and private assets during marcos rule 
mrs aquino formed the fivemember presidential commission on good 
government to try to recover the wealth and bring the marcoses to 
trial 
the commissions former chairman ramon diaz said the us 
trial will save the philippines time in efforts to recover assets 
a lot of evidence that we would have to present before the us 
courts to recover us property will already have been 
presented he said 
in bern swiss authorities have ordered records on some swiss 
financial transactions made by marcos saying those records can be 
turned over to the united states 
the aquino government alleges that marcos and his associates 
stashed much of their funds in swiss banks swiss authorities put 
that figure at at least 1 billion 
but beat von rechenberg marcos swiss lawyer said he would 
most probably file an appeal with the federal tribunal 
switzerlands supreme court

iraq announced today it will release 25 
iranian prisoners of war in accordance with a un ceasefire 
resolution the official iraqi news agency said 
the agency monitored in nicosia quoted an unidentified 
spokesman of the iraqi foreign ministry as saying the unilateral 
decision was relayed to the international committee of the red 
cross 
the spokesman was quoted as saying the red cross was asked to 
disptach a delegation to iraq to take the neccessary measures to 
repatriate the pows 
on thursday iran rejected an iraqi plan for repatriating 
prisoners of war from the eightyear persian gulf conflict and said 
iraq must accept the un plan for ending the war before prisoner 
exchanges could start 
the iraqi spokesman was quoted as saying with the latest batch 
the total number of sick and aging iranian prisoners released by 
iraq for purely humanitarian reasons with no political 
conditions attached reached 645 
he called on iran to reciprocate adding iran would be held 
fully responsible for any delay in ending the sufferings of the 
pows and their families the news agency reported 
he said iran has all along dealt with the pows issue as a 
political one in order to exploit it for the puposes of irans 
expansionist policies 
according to the red cross iran has 50182 prisoners and iraq 
has 19284 prisoners but un officials and diplomats in iran and 
iraq believe iran holds 60000 to 70000 pows and iraq 30000 to 
50000 
un resolution 598 calls for an immediate ceasefire 
withdrawal of troops to internationally recognized boundaries and 
the exchange of prisoners 
iraq this week proposed to the international red cross and un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar that repatriation of 
prisoners should begin on humanitarian grounds if iran reciprocates 
but iraq also made it clear its offer was unrelated to peace 
negotiations which stalled five days after a ceasefire was 
declared on aug 20 
the peace talks have deadlocked over iraqs insistence that the 
disputed shattalarab waterway which forms its southern border 
with iran should be cleared of silt and ships sunk early in the 
war 
iran has rejected the dredging demand saying it is a secondary 
issue that can be settled later in the negotiations

israeli warplanes flew over the ancient 
city of baalbek in east lebanon police said today fueling fears 
of an imminent attack on the main stronghold of proiranian 
extremists 
the rare nighttime overflights came hours after israeli 
fighterbombers attacked other palestinian and proiranian 
guerrilla bases to avenge the killing wednesday of seven israeli 
soldiers in a suicide car bombing 
shiite moslem kidnappers holding at least two american hostages 
charged friday that the united states gave advance approval to 
israel to strike at the guerrilla strongholds and the kidnappers 
threatened to harm the hostages 
nabih berri a shiite moslem leader said today that the 
kidnappers of the hostages committed an unforgivable crime by 
threatening to harm them 
berri who heads the mainstream shiite amal militia spoke in an 
interview with the associated press berris syrianbacked militia 
has been locked in a fierce struggle with proiranian 
fundamentalists for mastery of the shiite community and 
therefore has no influence on the kidnappers 
police in lebanon said today that the death toll from the 
israeli air raids climbed to 16 when a wounded person died 
thirtyfour were hurt in the attack 
police said sonic booms jolted the population of baalbek out of 
their beds late friday night and early this morning when the 
israeli jets crashed the sound barrier in several lowaltitude runs 
over baalbek 
theyve seldom done such a thing since the 1982 invasion 
said a police spokesman people are afraid their city will be the 
next target for israels retaliation to the suicide bombing 
baalbek is controlled by the iranianbacked fundamentalist group 
that is believed to be the umbrella for kidnappers of the 14 
foreigners in lebanon 
an estimated 3000 iranian revolutionary guards are based at the 
sheik abdullah barracks on a hilltop overlooking the city that 
harbors ancient roman ruins 
hezbollah said victims of israels retaliatory raid were to be 
buried today in a mass funeral in the bekaa valley town of mashgara 
the air raids hit positions near mashgara and the port city of 
sidon israeli officials often charge that hezbollah and the plo 
cooperate in guerrilla warfare against israeli troops and allied 
militiamen in south lebanon 
israel pulled most of its army from south lebanon in june 1985 
after a threeyear occupation and carved out the sixto10mile 
security zone to prevent guerrilla infiltration into its northern 
settlements 
israel had vowed to retaliate for wednesdays bombing the 
deadliest attack against israelis in south lebanon in 2 years 
committing this stupidity and this attack shall not pass 
without a punishment said a typewritten statement in arabic 
signed friday by islamic jihad the proiranian faction holding 
american journalist terry anderson and educator thomas sutherland 
the statement delivered to the independent beirut newspaper 
annahar hours after the attack praised the shiite moslem suicide 
car bomber 
anderson 40 chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press was abducted in moslem west beirut on march 16 1985 
sutherland 56 of fort collins colo was acting dean of 
agriculture at the american university of beirut when he was 
abducted on june 9 1985 
anderson and sutherland are among nine americans believed held 
by proiranian extremist factions linked to hezbollah 
the statement accused the us administration of giving israel 
advance approval to attack palestinian and hezbollah guerrillas in 
lebanon the proiranian hezbollah or party of god claimed 
responsibility for the suicide bombing 
sheik fadlallah considered to be hezbollahs spiritual leader 
said he would do his best to protect the hostages 
we continue to respect our previous commitments to defend 
human rights in order to see these hostages free and safe as soon 
as possible he said 
in cadiz ky andersons sister peggy say asked his captors 
to recognize that terry anderson is totally innocent and has 
never been involved in the continuing middle east strife except as 
a captive for 3 years 
fridays statement was the first since aug 18 when the group 
said none of its hostages would be released soon

kidley street seems too quiet to 
be a battleground 
but republican george bush and democrat michael dukakis are 
skirmishing there and throughout macomb county and throughout the 
nation for the votes of socalled reagan democrats 
the countys predominantly white middleclass voters bolted to 
ronald reagan in 1980 and 1984 while they supported democratic 
candidates on most of the ballot as did many democrats elsewhere 
in the country 
macomb is an absolute 100 percent predictor of how michigans 
going to vote said jay neel whom the democratic national 
committee sent here in august to run a storefront dukakis campaign 
office in st clair shores and without michigan were not going 
to win 
terry gilsenan of warren a republican district chairman 
agrees if you dont carry macomb county you dont carry the 
state he said 
bordering predominantly black detroit on the north and mainly 
white affluent oakland county on the east macomb and its 700000 
residents are what neel calls a microcosm of the country 
auto industry factories and rows of bungalow houses crowd eight 
mile road the countys southern border farther north are large 
homes apartment buildings condominiums and newer factories and 
beyond them are mobile home parks and new subdivisions a dwindling 
number of farms and small towns are found in macombs northernmost 
reaches 
on kidley street the middleclass dualincome zaleski and 
tremaine families are linked by their sons jason zaleski and john 
tremaine who are pals at adlai stevenson high school but their 
parents divergent political leanings reflect the challenge facing 
bush and dukakis 
i dont think my luck has increased through the republican 
administrations said stanley zaleski a carpenter who voted for 
democrats jimmy carter in 1980 and walter mondale in 1984 
i dont think ive made many great strides he said ive 
got to run like hell just to keep up with things 
zaleski plans to cast an unenthusiastic vote for dukakis hes 
the lesser of two evils the democrats at least do try to help the 
working man he explains 
theresa tremaine a computer programmer describes herself as a 
lukewarm democrat who voted for carter in 1980 but switched to 
reagan in 1984 and plans to vote this time for bush 
if mrs tremaine is a reagan democrat the phenomenon she 
represents goes back further than reagan the last democratic 
presidential candidate to carry macomb county was hubert humphrey 
in 1968 richard nixon won the county and state by comfortable 
margins in 1972 and gerald ford did the same in 1976 
dukakis isnt writing off macomb county partly because 
otherwise its a staunch democratic stronghold two of its three 
house members 11 of its 12 state legislators and 24 of its 25 
county commissioners are democrats 
they were conservative democrats long before reagan came 
along said kirby holmes a former gop state legislator from 
utica they just didnt like the presidential candidates that the 
national party put forth 
antitax sentiment is strong in macomb in the early 1980s 
voters recalled a state legislator who voted to raise michigans 
income tax 
abortion is a touchy issue among its roman catholics as are 
ussoviet relationships among its eastern european ethnic groups 
and crime among auto workers who led the white flight from detroit 
to the suburbs after the citys 1967 race riots 
dukakis task is to persuade macombs reagan democrats that he 
is less liberal than past democratic presidential nominees george 
mcgovern carter and mondale and that the gains reagan boasts have 
been illusory for them 
the unemployment rate in macomb county is running about 68 
percent somewhat higher than the national rate of 56 percent in 
august 
recent local polls indicate that only one in five macomb 
democrats who voted for reagan in 1984 might vote for bush in 
november 
dukakis made a highly publicized visit sept 13 to a general 
dynamics corp factory in sterling heights where he rode in an m1 
tank to underscore a speech stressing his commitment to a strong 
us military 
bush campaigned here in august and september and reagan 
campaigned for his vice president earlier this month in sterling 
heights not far from the tank facility 
both bush and dukakis have played to macombs conservative 
democrats by portraying themselves as defenders of family values 
and tough on crime drugs and communism 
its a patriotic area gilsenan said people were flying 
the flag before it became popular again 
the first wave of newcomers to macomb county after world war ii 
were mainly catholics from detroit who brought along their 
democratic loyalties that were nurtured by president roosevelt and 
the trade unions 
the people who moved up into macomb county in the 50s and 60s 
came of age in the 30s and 40s and saved up enough to buy a home in 
the suburbs said state sen doug carl of utica the countys 
only republican in the state legislature but that was a 
different generation 
those older democrats have retired to cottages up north to 
mobile homes in florida or died off said carl who is running 
against liberal rep david bonior dmich this year those 
people are being supplanted by younger people concerned theyll 
be able to pursue the same middleclass lifestyle as their 
parents 
neel said dukakis centrist message could finally end local 
democrats eightyear infatuation with reagan 
in 1980 he said reagan hit it at the right time at the right 
place if hed run against a john f kennedy a lyndon johnson a 
hubert humphrey he would have got his clock cleaned

candidate was that the uphill race could still be won but dukakis 
needed above all to come out and be hardhitting and forceful 
now durbin and other democrats with the same message have 
gotten their wish 
over the next few days dukakis refined his new populist 
campaign rhetoric to its essentials waved gop brochures in the 
autumn air with a denunciation that they were political garbage 
and charged in a new television commercial that bushs own ads were 
full of lies and he knows it 
in a television message saturday night dukakis was accusing 
bush of a campaign of fear and of smear and he was vowing to 
fight my heart out for the things i believe in 
the polls say george bush is on the verge of sweeping into the 
white house in next months election but like trailing candidates 
everywhere dukakis is making a final determined effort to salvage 
his candidacy 
this is 18 months and 450000 miles hes not giving up now 
said nick metropoulos the man who travels everywhere with the 
governor 
yet even as dukakis readied his charge the gop vice 
presidential candidate was scoffing at the man from massachusetts 
michael dukakis is no harry truman said dan quayle referring 
to the political patron saint of the underdog 
the sharpened rhetoric and new commercials were not the only 
evidence of dukakis last campaign stand he also stepped up the 
pace of campaigning at the same time bush was cutting back on his 
and dukakis seemed to accepting every tv interview offer that came 
his way 
yet from durbins vantage point in rural illinois to other party 
officials around the country democrats say dukakis needs 
excitement as much as issues thus michigan gov jim blanchard 
twice last week leapt to his feet during rallies and pumped his 
fists in the air like a cheerleader trying to ignite the crowd and 
the candidate 
democrats do not minimize the difficulties 
bushs lead in the national public opinion polls ranges from 
seven points to 17 although dukakis own polls show it below 10 
bush appears to have an overwhelming advantage in the electoral 
college as well with a seemingly solid foundation of southern and 
rocky mountain states 
dukakis operatives have had wellpublicized squabbles with 
democratic regulars from coast to coast dukakis performance in 
the second presidential debate on oct 13 left some of his aides 
demoralized 
adviser donna brazile resigned last week after making personal 
remarks about bush that brought an apology from dukakis 
and for weeks durbin told reporters dukakis had his 
character assailed and in some quarters destroyed by the bush 
negative advertising said georgia sen sam nunn i wouldnt 
have been a punching bag on some of those issues 
but dukakis aides also have insisted for weeks that if they 
could break through bushs persuasive campaign attacks the voters 
would swing behind their man on the strength of his promise to 
stand up for jobs tougher trade competition health care and 
education 
george bush doesnt want this campaign to be about his record 
and thats why hes put up a campaign of labels and fog and 
deceptions said dukakis aide leslie dach 
the new dukakis commercials are designed to counter 
advertisements the vice president has used 
one bush ad shows a revolving door with prisoners moving 
through and talks of the former massachusetts furlough program and 
a prisoner who failed to return from a weekend pass and later 
brutalized a man and his wife 
dukakis tv reply says that bush wont talk about all the 
thousands of drug kingpins furloughed from federal prisons while he 
led the war on drugs including one who raped and murdered a 
pregnant woman of two george bush has taken a furlough from the 
truth the ad says 
the second one is meant to counter a bush ad that shows dukakis 
in a tank and contends the governor opposes several weapons the 
dukakis counterad shows dukakis watching the bush commercial then 
clicking the television off and saying he favors the weapons 
im fed up with it havent seen anything like it in 25 years 
of public life george bushs negative tv ads distorting my 
record full of lies and he knows it he says 
that commercial is similar to a script durbin handed a dukakis 
aide last week although the congressman disclaims any credit for 
dukakis aggressive new style 
one dukakis aide said the governor began fighting back a few 
weeks ago after republicans started using campaigning by cliff 
barnes who along with his fiance was attacked by willie horton 
the now nationally known escapee from a massachusetts furlough 
program 
the ads were the most dramatic element of dukakis stretch drive 
this week but not the only one 
he spent one day condemning republican campaign brochures 
including one that said dukakis had the support of murderers 
rapists and drug dealers 
the next day dukakis compared bushs campaign to watergate and 
said truth was the first casualty in both 
all the while he honed his rhetoric 
george bush wants to help the people who already have it made 
i want to make every american a full shareholder in the american 
dream he said 
a few hours later the line was refined george bush wants to 
help the people who already have it made i want to help every 
american family make it 
a few days later criticizing bushs tax cut as favoring the 
wealthy he said simply hes on their side im on yours

a new allegation of alcohol abuse at a nuclear 
power plant illustrates the need for strict federal regulations to 
detect substance abuse at atomic reactors says the chairman of a 
house investigations subcommittee 
it is the nuclear regulatory commissions responsibility to 
protect against drug and alcohol abuse said rep sam gejdenson 
dconn chairman of the house interior and insular affairs 
subcommittee on investigations and oversight it is not enough 
for the nrc to leave it to the industry to regulate itself 
gejdenson who has held a series of hearings on the question of 
substance abuse at nuclear plants wants the nrc to issue stiff 
regulations on drug and alcohol abuse instead of leaving 
regulations up to individual utilities 
the commission proposed a new rule last month that would require 
reactor owners to conduct random drug tests test employees for 
drugs based on cause report drug use to the nrc and mandate 
personnel sanctions but the rule would leave alcohol detection and 
enforcement up to the prudent judgment of each utility 
commission officials say no final decision has been made on the 
proposed regulation 
in latest allegation of substance abuse at an atomic reactor 
gejdenson provided the associated press with an nrc document 
outlining an accusation made by an employee at the clinton power 
station in clinton ill against a senior plant manager 
the employee according to the report told a superior that the 
manager had alcohol on his breath and stumbled as he passed through 
a radiationdetecting device on the night of oct 10 
but officials at illinois power co operator of the reactor 
said the company hired a private investigator the next day who 
concluded several days later that there was no evidence of alcohol 
abuse 
stephen perry assistant vice president at the plant defended 
the utilitys internal substance abuse program 
in a telephone interview friday perry said the employee who 
was charged with checking for fires at the reactor reported his 
accusation to a superior the shift supervisor talked to the senior 
manager at length and decided there was no evidence of alcohol 
perry said under the companys internal regulations the manager 
could have been ordered to take a blood test if the supervisor 
found cause he said such blood tests have been ordered in the past 
the subsequent investigation turned up no evidence to 
corroborate the alcohol charge he said 
but gejdenson who wrote a letter to nrc chairman lando w zech 
jr last week urging a strict rule on both alcohol and drugs and a 
top gejdenson aide said it is wrong to rely on selfpolicing and 
criticized the nrc for not conducting its own investigation 
at the very least you want the nrc to do is find out what 
happened said subcommittee investigator john scheibel the nrc 
cant take the trouble to send somebody out there 
the nrc is in a position of public trust and at the very 
least the public can expect the nrc to act cautiously and not just 
accept the word of the person who said no there was no 
problem he said 
commission spokesman frank ingram said the nrc was looking 
into the allegation but said he did not know to what extent 
scheibel said he was told by nrc officials the agency is not 
conducting a separate investigation 
scheibel noted that the senior manager in question was a higher 
ranking official at the company than the shift supervisor who would 
have had to order the blood test he said that could be an 
inhibiting factor 
but plant officials said a thorough and independent 
investigation was conducted and that no other employees 
corroborated the alcohol allegation 
the clinton report comes on the heels of a subcommittee hearing 
earlier this month that focused on an allegation of alcohol abuse 
against a plant manager at the davisbesse reactor near toledo

residents of reykjavik are getting one 
last chance to stop the capital from going to the dogs 
this week they vote on an experimental program relaxing a ban 
on dogs in the city of 88000 the weeklong referendum begins 
monday and asks voters to say whether the 4yearold program has 
been a success 
city hall banished dogs in 1924 following an outbreak of 
dogrelated disease for 60 years it resisted attempts to overturn 
the ban despite ridicule from abroad and lurid stories about mass 
slaughter of illicit dogs 
in 1978 dog owners went to the supreme court in an unsuccessful 
bid to have the ban declared unconstitutional the issue made 
headlines again when albert gudmundsson then the finance minister 
threatened to emigrate unless he could keep his dog in reykjavik 
compromise finally came in 1984 when city hall while keeping 
the ban on the books set up some exemptions and promised a 
referendum after four years on how reykavik and mans best friend 
were getting along 
we are of the opinion that the vote is not necessary because 
of the good experience weve had in allowing conditional 
dogownership mayor david oddsson who owns a german shepherd 
named tanni fang recently told morgunbladid icelands main 
newspaper 
but nevertheless the promised ballot box is being set up in the 
city sports hall and citizens will vote yes or no on the question 
do you think that the experimental dog rules have been 
successful 
oddsson said the vote is not binding but if there is an 
overwhelming majority either way then we must take notice of 
that 
with opinion polls showing 21 support for the exemptions dog 
owners are confident 
but one city official magnus oskarsson said voters are so 
apathetic on the issue they may ignore the referendum and give 
antidog forces a victory by default 
strict rules apply to reykjaviks 850 registered dog owners 
annual licenses cost 120 dogs must undergo an annual medical 
checkup and owners must have insurance 
the city center is permanently out of bounds and dogs must stay 
out of public parks between 8 am and 9 pm they cannot enter 
public buildings restaurants childrens playgrounds barbershops 
prisons cemeteries morgues and buses leashes are always required 
according to city veterinarian oddur runar hjartarson the ban 
was imposed after dogs began transferring a dangerous sheep disease 
to human beings 
hyatid disease which once infected an estimated 20 percent of 
icelands population is caused by a worm that can cause blindness 
in people and even death hjartarson said dogs picked up the 
disease from eating the intestines of slaughtered sheep 
the disease has since been eradicated and illegal dog ownership 
has become rampant along with the lurid stories 
there were all these stories in the foreign press about dogs 
being caught and killed it never happened i recall perhaps one 
example of a dog being impounded oskarsson said 
gudrun gudjohnsen president of the dogbreeding association 
warns a new ban would be a big step backward and not likely to 
be enforced 
during the 60 years of the old ban there were hundreds of 
dogs in the capital people ought to realize that it is far 
better to have an effective monitoring and control system than 
going back to a system of no control she said

the difficulty of reaching a shortterm 
agreement under which the united states keeps its military bases in 
the philippines raises what was once an unthinkable notion an 
eventual american pullout from subic bay navy base and clark air 
base 
the agreement signed last week after six months of 
sometimesbitter negotiations covers only the use of the bases 
until 1991 providing for 962 million in economic and military aid 
for the philippines over the next two years it is a sharp 
increase but many filipino politicians say its far from enough 
if the americans are to remain beyond sept 30 1991 the 
negotiators probably will face difficulties which were only hinted 
at in this years talks according to analysts 
fred brown a southeast asia scholar said until the talks 
brought to the fore the spectre of a us pullout from the 
philippines it was sort of an unthinkable unmentionable 
issue as the talks were going on both secretary of state george 
shultz and defense secretary frank carlucci said the united states 
could move its bases if the philippines demanded too much 
brown who is with the carnegie endowment for international 
peace an independently funded think tank predicted that if 
nationalist forces continue to shape the debate in the philippines 
over the bases negotiators for both sides will consider a phaseout 
of the us presence in the philippines 
the debate in the philippines also will be affected by how well 
the current agreement is implemented 
the funds promised in the agreement while falling short of the 
annual 12 billion sought by the philippines are still 
substantially higher than the us aid appropriated by congress in 
previous years for use of the bases and in light of the us 
budget crunch the difference is significant 
sen bob dole leader of the republican minority in the senate 
raised a warning flag just how that money is going to be found 
in a foreign operations budget already carved to the bone to meet 
other base rights and peacekeeping commitments is not readily 
apparent to this senator 
but an influential legislative aide who spoke only on condition 
of anonymity said that there is enough bipartisan support for the 
philippines so that there are ways the money could be found he 
conceded this would mean shortchanging other aid recipients or 
wrangling with the defense department for some of its money it 
wont be easy he said 
another struggle is expected over a us contribution to a 5 
billion multinational aid program to help ease the philippines 28 
billion debt although the package is unrelated resolution of the 
base pact was expected to boost support in congress for the 
international initiative 
the united states is spearheading the effort although japan 
will foot most of the bill 
the international aid package if it is approved and funded 
will grant legitimacy to the usphilippine bases agreement in 
the eyes of the filipino public and leadership said john bresnan 
a senior research associate at the school of east asia of columbia 
university 
so far president corazon aquino is facing a hard time selling 
the new agreement to intellectuals and manilas urban middle class 
who accuse her government of selling out their countrys 
sovereignty 
but some analysts said that if mrs aquino wants the americans 
to stay she must bring the debate before the broad public and take 
a position herself 
she has to take a stand and begin to shape opinion said 
bresnan 
retired gen brent scowcroft former national security adviser 
who headed a study of the bases issue for the council on foreign 
relations in new york said what we have to hope for is that the 
filipino people weigh in on this because there is overwhelming 
support among them for the bases 
the filipinos who oppose the continued us presence feel that 
as long as were there they cant cut the umbilical cord with the 
united states said scowcroft and nothing we can do will 
change that

in dealing a blow to an ambitious 
serbian politician yugoslavias communist leaders have shown how 
difficult it is to quell ethnic turmoil or introduce democracy in 
this oneparty state 
with millions watching on television the communist elite last 
week ended 38 hours of bitter debate with a dramatic rebuff to 
serbian communist party leader slobodan milosevic 
a close ally of milosevic dusan ckrebic was the only member of 
the ruling politburo not to win a secret vote of confidence 
wednesday from the partys policysetting central committee 
ckrebic an oldtime communist in his 60s immediately offered 
his resignation but milosevic angrily intervened to stop 
consideration of the offer and ckrebic remains on the politburo 
for now 
another ckrebic ally charged that an unprincipled coalition 
tried to bring ckrebic down to hurt milosevic 
the meeting which did little to tackle the growing economic 
crisis gave yugoslavs a revealing look at their squabbling 
leadership 
serbs who have rallied round milosevics campaign for greater 
serbian control over the provinces of kosovo and vojvodina were 
furious that only a serb ckrebic fell victim to the 
unprecedented vote of confidence for politburo members 
did you see what they did to us fumed a belgrade television 
journalist 
the next day 20000 serbs in kosovo protested the outcome 
chanting we will not give up ckrebic they literally turned 
their backs on two politburo members who came to address complaints 
that the central committee session did nothing to meet their 
demands 
the 200000 kosovo serbs and montenegrins a minority in what 
was once a serbian heartland want to end alleged harassment by the 
ethnic albanian majority they also want to oust some ethnic 
albanian communist leaders 
the call for action extends far beyond kosovo with inflation at 
217 percent and living standards halved since 1980 most of 
yugoslavias 23 million people are fed up with leaders they 
perceive as ineffectual and corrupt 
the central committees response to the widespread demand for 
new leaders was the vote of confidence and the prospect that a 
third of the committees 165 members would be replaced in the next 
six weeks 
that would constitute the single biggest sweep of top party 
ranks since stalinists were purged after yugoslavias break with 
moscow in 1948 
but it fell short of widespread expectations of an immediate 
shakeup and the choice of who should fall is likely to get mired 
in the usual battle among the party leaderships of yugoslavias six 
republics and two provinces 
the broad powers given those eight leaderships under the 1974 
constitution have enabled widely varying political cultures to 
develop 
the most obvious gap is between the rich westernoriented north 
and the bankrupt backward southern areas of montenegro macedonia 
and kosovo 
another rift has opened up between liberal northern slovenia and 
the demagogic populism of serbias milosevic 
party chief stipe suvar from the republic of croatia between 
slovenia and serbia hailed the vote of confidence in politburo 
members as a step to party democracy 
but the way milosevic tried to undo the verdict showed clearly 
that however much he supports economic and even political reform 
he will protect serbias and his own interests first 
the leaders agree that change is needed suvar said after the 
central committee meeting but he said the partys only experience 
in cleaning its own house is in purges ordered from the top 
we are still learning the rules of the game he said 
the halfhearted steps toward political reform show how hard it 
is for any oneparty system to change without the communists either 
relinquishing power to some form of popular control or simply 
carrying out a ruthless purge 
stane dolanc a former no 2 to the late josip broz tito said 
during the central committees debate that the crisis probably cost 
yugoslavia a billion dollars in lost foreign investments 
suvar tried to assuage what he said were foreign fears that 
yugoslavia is descending into chaos 
yugoslavia will not fall apart he said there is a great 
deal of quarreling in yugoslavia but it is not as dangerous as it 
may appear at first glance 
but western creditors are likely to remain uneasy about 
recovering any of yugoslavias 21 billion foreign debt 
economic and constitutional reforms designed to attract foreign 
and private investment are lumbering their way through party and 
government organs this fall 
for years yugoslavs have called for such reforms and more 
radical ones such as a return to private farming in this largely 
agricultural nation 
ironically the political struggle fueled by the ambitions of 
milosevic may deter foreign investors just as yugoslavia opens up 
to capitalist investment

the 100th congress which adjourned with a 
parting salvo in the war against drugs may best be remembered for 
its wrestling over two national controversies the irancontra 
affair and the nomination of robert bork to the supreme court 
both dramas played out in ornate committee rooms before 
national television audiences involved the lawmakers in bitter 
feuding among themselves and with the white house 
a host of other issues produced a lengthy list of 
accomplishments over a twoyear session that brought to a close the 
first 200 years of congressional history 
for the first time since 1976 the house and senate working 
furiously passed all 13 appropriations bills before the start of 
fiscal 1989 an event accomplished at three minutes to midnight on 
sept 30 the end of fiscal 1988 
i think its been one of the truly great congresses in my 
experience and in this century said house majority leader tom 
foley dwash its turned out to be not only a historic 
congress but also an extraordinarily productive one 
other major legislative accomplishments included 
a multibillion dollar attack in the war against drugs that 
features money for rehabilitation up to 10000 in civil penalties 
and loss of federal benefits for personal use of even small amounts 
of drugs and a death penalty for drug dealers who murder during 
drugrelated crimes 
a complex tax package whose main purpose was correcting errors 
in the 1986 tax overhaul but also included dozens of tax benefits 
to one group or another as well as the tax increases to pay for 
them it has a threeyear price tag of 41 billion 
the first complete overhaul of the federal welfare system since 
its inception during the depression of the 1930s 
ratification of the first ussoviet arms reduction treaty 
the intermediaterange nuclear forces or inf treaty requires 
elimination within three years of all missiles with a range of 300 
miles to 3400 miles 
a sweeping revision of the trade laws to reduce the trade 
surpluses that other countries run with the united states 
the 18 billion clean water act passed after two vetoes by 
president reagan and designed to improve the quality of many of 
americas waterways 
catastrophic health insurance for millions of elderly or 
disabled people who receive medicare providing free hospital care 
for lengthy illnesses after the recipient pays the first 564 
two civil rights bills the civil rights restoration act and 
the fair housing act 
an 800 million health package designed to fight the aids 
epidemic including money for testing research and home care 
a 12 billion bill providing individual payments of 20000 to 
japaneseamerican survivors of world war ii internment camps 
established in western states after the japanese attack on pearl 
harbor 
drought relief for crop and livestock producers hit by the 
summer drought with a price tag estimated from 39 billion to 
51 billion 
a package of veterans legislation including a bill to elevate 
the veterans administration to cabinet status an action that will 
give the new department veterans affairs additional political clout 
an 88 billion highway and mass transit bill that permitted 
states to boost the speed limit on some interstate highways to 65 
miles per hour 
legislation prohibiting smoking on domestic airline flights of 
two hours or less a period that covers the vast majority of 
commercial flights 
both senate majority leader robert c byrd dwva and house 
speaker jim wright dtexas called the 100th congress the most 
productive in two decades 
i believe it is the most productive one since lbj 20 years 
ago byrd said referring to the leadership of lyndon baines 
johnson and passage of the 1965 civil rights act 
perhaps the most productive since 19651966 wright echoed 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas was perhaps thinking 
of the sessions occasionally raucous partisan fighting moments 
as well as its accomplishments when he said he could sum 
everything up with two words historic and hysteric 
wright who assumed the speakers chair at the start of the 
congress replacing thomas p tip oneill ended the session 
the subject of an ethics investigation into whether he abused his 
office for personal financial gain a separate ethic probe was 
under way into whether he violated house rules by disclosing a 
purported cia covert operation in nicaragua 
congress prompt action on money matters partly as a result of 
the october 1987 stock market crash meant the government started 
fiscal 1989 this month without the usual threats of a 
governmentwide shutdown president reagan was relieved not to get 
another catchall spending bill wrapping together money for 
hundreds of government programs 
following the market crash white house officials and 
congressional leaders held a series of closeddoor meetings for a 
month seeking to end a year of clashes over spending and tax 
levels their budget summit of last november produced an agreement 
since adhered to that limited tax increases and set caps on 
spending levels for domestic military and foreign assistance 
programs for the last two federal fiscal years 
one of the congress earliest acts was to undertake a massive 
investigation of the irancontra affair for 14 weeks during the 
spring and summer of 1987 virtually all other business was shunted 
into the background while house and senate committees held 
unprecedented joint hearings 
television carried the proceedings to the nation as lt col 
oliver north and his former colleagues wove a tale of a clandestine 
enterprise extending to four continents parallels to watergate 
were drawn and suspense built over whether evidence ultimately 
would link the entire affair directly to reagan 
the committees reviewed more than 300000 documents and 
interviewed more than 500 witnesses as they probed the sale of 
weapons to iran and the diversion of some of the profits to aid 
the contra rebels fighting nicaraguas leftist government 
secretary of state george shultz who had opposed the 
armsforhostages swap summed it up for investigators our guys 
got taken to the cleaners 
but in the end there was no smoking gun in a report issued 
at the end of 1987 the committees concluded that a cabal of 
zealots had lied deceived congress and each other and exhibited 
disdain for the law the ultimate responsibility for the events 
in the irancontra affair must rest with the president they 
concluded 
of 110 judicial court nominees submitted by reagan to the 
senate 91 were confirmed as a result in nearly eight years in 
office reagan has named just more than half of the active judges 
on us district and appellate courts and the supreme court 
by far the most contentious nomination fight was over reagans 
nomination of bork to succeed lewis f powell the conservative 
nominee had written much that was controversial and he refused to 
back down from his criticism of what he saw as the supreme courts 
unconstitutional activism 
it was a fight basically fought out on television from the live 
broadcasts of the confirmation hearings and senate sessions to the 
taped commercials from both sides 
even though clearly defeated bork declined to withdraw 
insisting on a vote when it came he was rejected 5842 reagans 
second attempt to replace powell was torpedoed when douglas h 
ginsburg withdrew as a nominee after conflict of interest questions 
arose he after he admitted smoking marijuana while a harvard law 
school professor 
reagans third choice anthony m kennedy was confirmed 970

the most important social lawmaking done by the 100th congress 
was the welfare overhaul bill a painstaking compromise the new 
law requires states to create job training and education programs 
and requires welfare mothers of children over 3 to participate in 
them states are also told to crack down on child support 
collection and establish paternity in many more births involving 
welfare recipients 
the welfare changes are to be phased in over five years at a 
cost of 33 billion proponents caution that the act is not a 
panacea for poverty but their aim is scarcely less modest they 
hope to see the welfare system transformed from a checkmailing 
operation into an avenue to independence and parental 
responsibility 
while the welfare bill demonstrated cooperation between the two 
congress took on the reagan administration over civil rights 
over reagans veto congress enacted the civil rights 
restoration act to broaden the protections afforded to women 
minorities the elderly and the disabled under four federal civil 
rights laws 
the supreme court ruled in 1984 that only specific programs or 
activities receiving federal monies had to comply with the four 
antibias statutes under the new law entire institutions 
government agencies and some corporations must comply even if only 
one activity receives federal funds 
congress also strengthened the nations fair housing law by 
allowing stiff fines against those found guilty of discrimination 
previous law only gave the federal government a mediation role 
in the field of foreign affairs the longrunning dispute over 
aid to the nicaraguan contra rebels was the most divisive issue 
the rebels benefited from 100 million in aid including weaponry 
that had been approved by the previous congress but it was to 
prove the last military assistance congress would give 
on feb 3 1988 with speaker wright taking a highprofile role 
and urging colleagues to give peace a chance the house 
defeated by eight votes an administration plea to give the rebels 
new lethal aid followup legislation was approved to give solely 
humanitarian aid food clothing and medicine to the 
contras but by years end even their supporters conceded the 
rebels had ceased to be a fighting force

norman rockwell the little white house that holds his beloved 
illustrations groans from the weight of 13 million visitors 
and his saturday evening post covers that art critics scoffed at 
are fetching prices as high as 500000 from such collectors as 
texas billionaire h ross perot 
the tall thin pigeontoed artist who called himself a hack 
and feared losing his audience all his life would be amazed and 
amused at his enormous popularity said his son thomas rockwell 
he liked being recognized on the street but he was always a 
little surprised by it thomas said in a telephone interview from 
his poughkeepsie ny home 
rockwells growing popularity threatens to overwhelm the pretty 
town of 2300 people where he lived for 25 years before his death 
on nov 8 1978 at the age of 84 
nearly 130000 people will visit the rockwell museum this year 
said director laurie norton moffatt she said the museum which 
opened in 1968 in the 18th century georgian house has stopped 
advertising because it is filled to capacity six months of the year 
he would have said gee whiz that was his favorite 
expression i cant imagine why they would want to spend all that 
time looking at my pictures but he would be sorry about all the 
traffic in town said margaret batty assistant museum director 
and a friend of rockwells 
i go home every friday night and leave the town to the 
tourists for the weekend said insurance agent marty salvadore 
townspeople said they will breathe a sigh of relief when a new 
museum finally opens far from the center of town ground breaking 
is set for late 1989 
all the excitement is for a humble painter who told the 
associated press in an interview shortly before his death i just 
do the things that people pay me very high prices to do 
new york art dealer judy goffman believes rockwell is the 
bestknown artist in america he was on 3 million coffee tables 
with the saturday evening post she said 
she set an auction record for a rockwell painting in 1981 with 
her bid of 253000 for the homecoming marine she sold it to 
perot a few years later at double the price and believes rockwells 
finest works now can fetch 1 million 
norman percevel rockwell began his magazinecover career at 16 
after dropping out of art school in new york he was 22 when he did 
the first of 321 saturday evening post covers that would make his a 
household name 
his four freedoms paintings that traveled the country in 
1943 raised more than 130 million for the war effort the year 
before his death he was awarded the nations highest peacetime 
award the presidential medal of freedom 
up to his final year however rockwell worked almost 
obsessively he felt even up to the end that his popularity might 
all vanish his son said 
rockwell said shortly before his death i want to be working 
on a picture and just fall over dead i dont want to sit in a 
chair or go to florida or anything like that 
he did not get his wish ill health made it impossible for him 
to work the last year of his life 
rockwell never was much of a businessman his son said and so 
he often gave up the rights to his work and gave away his 
paintings when he died he wasnt really a wealthy man thomas 
rockwell said 
thomas rockwells brother peter a sculptor who lives in rome 
is casting a bronze sculpture of frolicking children for the new 
rockwell museum and eldest brother jarvis an artist who lives in 
stockbridge has shown some of his fathers whimsical spirit with 
temporary sculptures he has made out of plastic toys 
having norman rockwell for a father had its advantages and its 
disadvantages said jarvis 57 all i can say about it is that 
i miss him

a barbecued buffalo sandwich once 
bitten into by richard m nixon is being preserved for posterity by 
an illinois family 
steve jenne now 42 was a boy scout in his native sullivan when 
nixon then vice president sank his teeth into the sandwich jenne 
walked off with the uneaten portion and his family has kept it in a 
deep freeze since 
itll probably stay frozen forever jenne said recently 
its been a part of the family for 28 years 
nixon then a presidential hopeful was guest at a local 
republican barbecue in sullivan jenne 14 and his scout troop 
were detailed to surround nixons table to keep the throngs away 
security wasnt like it is today jenne recalled it was 
pretty lax 
nixon had taken just three or four bites when he had to leave 
i saw the sandwich sitting there so i just grabbed it 
plate and all jenne recalled 
that partially eaten sandwich became jennes claim to fame the 
incident got newspaper coverage at the time and again eight years 
later when nixon was elected president 
the sandwich jenne said has been stored in a glass jar over 
the years the paper plate on which it rested still sporting 
barbecue stains is between the pages of a folder which his mother 
hazel created especially for sandwich souvenirs 
printed on the plate in a 14yearolds handwriting are the 
words this is the plate on which vice president and future 
president nixon ate buffalo barbecue sept 22 1960 
the sandwich has survived weatherrelated power outages and once 
falling on the floor 
i think the sandwich has survived better than nixon has

like it or not if you plan to work during 
the winter season to qualify for a discounted ski pass in this 
mountain resort town you will have to attend smile school 
the vail chamber of commerce has decided that all bellhops 
bartenders and others working in the service industry must complete 
the 25 threehour courtesy class before qualifying for the ski 
pass 
the program officially is called guest service orientation but 
it quickly took the name smile school the name of a 
townsponsored orientation program for vail bus drivers and parking 
attendants 
not everyone is smiling over the chambers decision 
smile school is a wonderful idea so our guests will enjoy good 
service but the chamber of commerce went about it in the wrong 
way said allison sullivan a bartender at bart and yetis it 
really wasnt the 25 cost but just the way they announced that 
attendance was required for the discount like we were school 
children 
employers who didnt pick up the 25 cost for their employees 
would come off like a bad guy and that wasnt fair to them 
she said 
the merchant pass for employees will remain 625 for those who 
earn their smile school certificate and 725 for other community 
residents including workers who dont take the course 
we feel that excellent service to our guests must be stressed 
because we face a very important year at vail especially with the 
world championships that will bring the top international skiers 
here said shelbi williams chamber director

the lebanese with rival moslem and 
christian groups claiming to govern them fear the monthlong 
turmoil over a new president will formally sever ties that kept the 
nation together through a 13year civil war 
we have no president and parliament is lost what is there to 
help lebanon survive said kazem khalil 88 the eldest of 
lebanons parliamentary deputies and an architect of the countrys 
independence from france in 1943 
this is the worst crisis weve ever had said khalil 
appointed interim parliament speaker last week the political 
social and economic systems have ceased to exist we just dont 
know where were heading 
he echoed the despair of most lebanese at the creeping partition 
of the country into moslem and christian cantons after parliament 
failed to elect a president to succeed amin gemayel when his 
sixyear term expired sept 23 
parliamentary efforts failed because christian deputies opposed 
to syrianbacked candidates who were the most serious contenders 
boycotted the electoral sessions and blocked a quorum 
gemayel appointed army commander gen michel aoun a maronite 
catholic head of a caretaker military government minutes before he 
stepped down 
but acting prime minister salim hoss a sunni moslem declared 
that his cabinet installed under gemayel was the legitimate one 
three moslem army officers named as ministers under aoun quit 
all but one christian in hoss cabinet resigned and handed their 
ministries over to aoun 
the crisis deepened last week when parliament failed to elect a 
new speaker to succeed hussein husseini a prosyrian shiite 
moslem after his oneyear term expired khalil was appointed in 
the session which once again was boycotted by the christians 
the americans had sought with the syrians to produce a 
compromise candidate for the presidency but have backed off 
diplomatic efforts until after the us presidential election nov 
8 one wellinformed lebanese said 
the united states now appears to be as much at a loss about 
lebanese as the leaders of lebanon themselves said the source 
who spoke on condition of anonymity 
despite widespread fears that the constitutional crisis will 
touch off new fighting there have been only sporadic clashes 
between christians and moslems 
the two sides after years of warfare and intervention by syria 
iraq israel and libya have achieved a military balance 
the estimated 800000 christians led by samir geagea a former 
medical student who commands their main militia have been 
receiving shiploads of weapons and ammunition from iraq 
baghdad freed from the gulf war against iran by an aug 20 
ceasefire has been arming the christians to sabotage syrias 
efforts to pacify lebanon 
syria iraqs archrival in the arab world backed iran during 
the war and supports lebanons estimated 17 million moslems 
the christians are armed to the teeth a senior lebanese 
army officer said also speaking on condition of anonymity 
they can defend themselves against any moslem or syrian 
attack but they cant attack or make any territorial gains 
the stalemate has sent prices of food gasoline and other basics 
soaring a 22pound can of powdered milk cost 4000 lebanese 
pounds friday against 2700 pounds monday 
the lebanese pound pegged at 8 to the dollar in 1982 and 337 on 
sept 22 was at 540 friday 
so far the rival governments have not embarked on an economic 
war 
the christians easily could cut off electricity fuel and water 
supplies to moslem west beirut 
they may be refraining because the central bank where 70 
percent of lebanons 93 million ounces in gold reserves are held 
is located on the moslem side

an aircraft mechanic faces 
manslaughter charges and could lose his certification following his 
arrest for allegedly improperly installing an engine part that 
caused a fatal plane crash 
jack barker a spokesman for the federal aviation administration 
in atlanta said he knew of no other prosecution of a mechanic for 
a mistake that led to a fatal crash 
the circumstances in this case are peculiar volusia county 
sheriffs sgt edward carroll said friday by its very nature an 
aircraft is a very sophisticated and very dangerous piece of 
equipment its not like a car that if it breaks down you dump it 
by the side of the road 
dale e halter 43 of south daytona beach an employee at 
spruce creek airport was arrested thursday by volusia county 
sheriffs investigators on charges of manslaughter by culpable 
negligence a thirddegree felony carroll said he was released on 
2500 bond 
barker said halters faa mechanics license is under 
investigation and could be revoked for violations of agency rules 
the national transportation safety board blamed the july 24 
death of donald r paul of gatlinburg tenn on an airoil 
separator on his singleengine plane that had been worked on by 
halter 
improper installation of the separator caused the engine to lose 
its oil and freeze up carroll said paul crashed shortly after 
takeoff 
we could trace the path of the plane down the runway from the 
trail of the oil being expelled carroll said if the thing had 
been tested after the installation it would have been detected 
carroll said the charges did not represent a crackdown or a 
change of policy by his department 
this piece of equipment was installed in direct violation of 
faa regulations carroll said this person is an faa mechanic 
and should have known that adds up to to probable cause for the 
thirddegree manslaughter charge

one of the first lessons learned by a member 
of congress is that theres no better way to keep voters happy than 
to cut their taxes 
theres no money left in the federal treasury to grant any more 
acrosstheboard tax reductions such as were approved in 1981 but 
that doesnt prevent the lawmakers from granting targeted relief to 
one group after another 
thats exactly what they did in the tax bill that cleared its 
final hurdle in congress on saturday it now goes to president 
reagan and sponsors predict he will sign it 
the bill originally was designed to clear up confusing language 
and correct errors in the landmark tax overhaul enacted in 1986 
but it was amended over and over to extend some expiring benefits 
add some new ones for selected groups and raise taxes to finance 
the benefits 
the measure would have no effect on the federal deficit 
although it would cut taxes by 41 billion over three years it 
would raise others by the same amount 
and it is not just tax cuts and increases that were attached to 
the bill it includes a taxpayers bill of rights to rein in 
what some lawmakers view as an overly aggressive internal revenue 
service for example the agency would have to give 30 days notice 
before seizing bank accounts and other property and would be 
prohibited from promoting employees on the basis of how much they 
collect 
some of the other provisions 
diesel wipe out a 1987 requirement that farmers construction 
companies and other taxexempt offroad users of diesel fuel pay 
the federal tax of 151 cents a gallon and later apply for a refund 
mutual funds for 1988 and 1989 permit owners of mutual fund 
shares to deduct certain operating expenses of the fund without 
regard to a general provision allowing deduction of only 
miscellaneous expenses that exceed 2 percent of income 
higher education exempt from taxation interest earned on us 
savings bonds that are redeemed to finance a college or vocational 
education starting in 1990 
tuition aid renew for 1988 an expired law allowing a worker to

housing extend through 1989 a tax credit for owners of newly 
constructed lowincome rental housing also extend through 1989 
and modify a tax exemption for bonds issued by state and local 
governments to help lowincome families buy their first home 
tobacco impose a tax of 45 cents per pound on pipe tobacco 
writers allow freelance writers artists and photographers to 
deduct workrelated expenses even before a project produces income 
heifer tax permit livestock farmers to deduct expenses of 
producing livestock before the animals begin generating income 
thus repealing what has become known as the heifer tax 
athletics allow an 80 percent deduction for contributions to 
college athletic scholarship funds even when such gifts 
guarantee a fan the privilege of buying a game ticket 
research extend through 1989 a credit for increased spending 
for research and experimentation 
job training extend through 1989 a credit under which the 
government pays the first year of wages for certain newly hired 
economically disadvantaged workers 
contractors further restrict the completedcontract method 
of accounting that allows defense contractors and most big 
construction companies to delay taxes on part of their profits 
until a project is completed this change will raise 13 billion 
corporations accelerate estimated tax payments from 
corporations that switch from an annualized method of computation 
raising 869 million 
alaska corporations repeal a provision that has allowed alaska 
native corporations to sell some of their unused tax credits to 
other companies repeal will cost the alaska companies 1 billion 
life insurance remove some of the tax advantages of using 
singlepremium life insurance as an investment loans from such 
policies would be taxed as cash withdrawals the new rules would 
apply to policies whose cash value builds more quickly than one 
paid through seven equal annual premiums the change would cost 
policyholders 345 million 
mail carriers allow rural mail carriers to deduct 3375 cents 
for each mile a personal car is driven on a mail route most people 
are allowed 225 cents a mile for businessrelated mileage 
business meals permit operators of offshore or alaska oil rigs 
and of some commercial vessels but not luxury liners to deduct 
the full cost of meals provided to employees most business may 
deduct only 80 percent 
home sale allow a surviving spouse to defer taxation on 
profits from the sale of a principal home just as though the 
spouse had not died present law denies such a break if a spouse 
dies after a home is sold and before a new one is built also the 
provision allowing a person over 55 to avoid tax on up to 125000 
of profits from the sale of a principal home in which he or she had 
lived at least three of the last five years would be available to a 
person who spends up to four of those five years in a nursing home 
home phone prohibit any person with a homebased business from 
deducting any part of the base monthly telephone charge as a 
business expense 
farm machinery tighten depreciation provisions for 
singlepurpose farm structures such as poultry houses and farm 
machinery 
farm income expand a law allowing farmers to defer for one 
year income from the droughtforced sale of livestock also the 
measure would ensure that farmers may defer taxes on payments 
received as a result of droughtcaused crop losses 
banks renew a tax break for healthy savings and loan 
associations that take over failing associations and extend the 
benefit to banks 
highspeed rail permit use of taxexempt bonds to finance 
certain highspeed rail facilities

fire and flood consumed the stage of the 
metropolitan opera house in the final scene of wagners 
goetterdaemmerung but instead of fleeing in panic the 
audience leapt to its feet and cheered 
the triumphant premiere of the new production friday night meant 
that the nations leading opera house had forged the final link in 
its longawaited new production of wagners epic ring cycle 
the sets and the lighting were among the most spectacular ever 
seen at the met and at least as far as the heroine and the villain 
were concerned it seemed as if the company had even brought back 
the muchlamented bygone golden era of wagnerian singing 
soprano hildegard behrens singing and acting with passion and 
elegance as the noble bruennhilde consolidated her claim as a 
worthy successor to the great birgit nilsson she and bass matti 
salminen as the baleful hagen dominated the stage and easily 
penetrated even the cruelest waves of sound that wagner and the 
met orchestra could provide 
not for 13 seasons had the company performed this last and 
longest nearly six hours including two intermissions of the four 
operas in which wagner intertwined norse mythology and 19th century 
german philosophy with sometimes muddled but generally powerful 
results 
twilight of the gods as the opera is called in english 
turns on hagens determination to get his hands on the magical gold 
ring that has been the source of all the trouble since his father 
alberich stole it from the rhinemaidens in the first opera das 
rheingold 
the plot twists might seem silly were they not redeemed by 
wagners glorious music which carries the audience through 
contrivances like an amnesiainducing potion and a magical helmet 
that disguises siegfried so bruennhilde cant recognize her own 
husband when he kidnaps her 
the sets by guenther schneidersiemssen have combined naturalism 
with hightech effects throughout the earlier operas and reach 
their artistic peak in act 3 the first scene a forest clearing 
where hagen murders siegfried is strikingly realistic the tableau 
resembling a flemish painting gil wechslers lighting moves subtly 
from dappled sunlight to encroaching darkness as the heros doom 
approaches 
but the real stage wizardry is saved for the finale when 
bruennhildes suicide in siegfrieds funeral pyre literally sets 
the world ablaze causes the rhine to overflow and even burns up 
valhalla the kingdom of the gods all this is vividly brought to 
life as the orchestra splendidly conducted by james levine pours 
out the final measures of the score 
in a performance so strong its a shame the biggest weakness was 
the siegfried of toni kramer he seemed ill at ease on stage his 
mediumsized voice showed severe strain by act 2 and he gave only 
a workmanlike rendition of his wonderful final narrative baritone 
anthony raffell failed to make much impression in the thankless 
role of gunther hagens halfbrother soprano kathryn harries did 
better as gunthers sister gutrune but had trouble with her high 
notes 
in the small but vital role of waltraute bruennhildes sister 
mezzo christa ludwig who was singing in ring cycles 20 years ago 
made a dazzling impression and provided a valuable link with a 
tradition the met is bidding to revive 
goetterdaemmerung will be performed several more times this 
fall in the spring the met will stage three complete rings one 
of them on successive saturday afternoons in april for a nationwide 
radio audience

meat prices rose saturday and bread 
prices will rise by 60 percent the government said two days after 
an unpopular austerity program was amended to allow salary raises 
for some workers 
the belgrade daily politika ekspres said the latest price 
increases will drive the remaining shoppers out of meat markets 
and will further depress living standards 
thousands of yugoslavs in recent weeks have protested rising 
prices in a growing economic crisis in the communist nation 
as of saturday prime quality steak cost 636 a pound in 
belgrade up from 555 ground meat rose from 221 to 339 a 
pound 
the cheapest type of bread now available for 5 cents a pound 
will cost 8 cents when new bread prices take effect sunday 
politika ekspres said 
statistics published here say living standards have dropped to 
the level of the mid1960s inflation is running as high as 217 
percent 
meat prices were boosted considerably three weeks ago last 
year the government had to cancel sharp increases in bread prices 
after widespread protests 
the average monthly income in yugoslavia is 100 and experts 
say about 80 percent of it goes for food 
faced with increasing strikes and worker protests parliament on 
thursday eased an austerity program of wage cuts and price rises 
introduced in may 
the amendments allow wages increases of 140 percent to 152 
percent this year but only for workers in profitable companies and 
in hardpressed social services like health and education 
another belgrade newspaper vecernje novosti said about half of 
yugoslav companies employing more than 2 million workers will not 
be able to increase their wages because they are not making profits

oneliners say a lot says dan quayle 
contending that voters have been well informed this year even 
though the presidential campaigns have often aimed merely for 
catchy television sound bites 
there are a lot of subtleties communicated with a sound 
bite the brief tv clip on the evening news he said people 
receive messages 
voters quayle said can receive a complex message from a simple 
oneliner especially when such elements as body language are added 
in 
while quayle said television coverage of the campaign the 
dominant medium for most americans has occasionally lacked 
substance he also said the information is out there for voters 
to make up their minds 
both of the presidential compaigns spend millions of dollars on 
television advertising and they arrange candidate appearances and 
speeches with an eye toward getting a particular few seconds on the 
news but quayle said that isnt all bad 
what you have right now is you have to get a story across and 
the temptation is to say ok weve got a message today we want to 
get across on our own terms and nobody elses quayle said 
thats a pretty good strategy he said you cant fault 
the strategy 
the people by and large know a lot about all four of us 
he said its more oriented to oneliners but you know 
oneliners say a lot 
lets not minimize the importance of oneliners 
quayle made his comments friday night in an interview as his 
campaign plane returned to washington after he spent a week 
stumping in the midwest and south 
in the interview quayle was mildly critical of the coverage of 
the campaign but generally satisfied that voters had been told what 
they need in order to make a choice 
i found out that at least in my own case sometimes ive 
given what i think have been very susbtantative speeches there 
doesnt seem to be much interest in covering it he said 
the question is have we been wellserved i think we know a 
lot about michael dukakis and george bsh i think they really have 
a very good idea of the four candidates 
quayle said hes now more comfortable as a national candidate 
because a national campaign is now something thats more behind 
me than ahead of me 
that comfort level is increased because hes now settling into 
the traditional role of a vice presidential candidate rather than a 
lightning rod for controversy he said 
that point was underscored he said by a telephone call he 
received from his wife marilyn late in the week 
she said you must really be giving great speeches having 
great crowds doing all the right things because i havent heard a 
thing about you out here he said welcome to the traditional 
role of the vice presidential campaign 
quayle said both of the presidential campaigns have dealt with 
substantative issues 
there have been a number of speeches a number of debates 
probably too many speeches he said the information is out 
there the question is on how this information gets communicated 
the question then becomes what is being communicated is it 
the 15second sound bite 
ill be interested to find out what weve learned from this 
he said i think weve got to rethink it on both sides 
you have to look at how television is used by both 
campaigns he said it is very difficult to do in a 
substantative way even though there have been substantative 
speeches 
im sure well go back and therell be new benchmarks 
therell be new standards maybe some old standards will be thrown 
away

rep pat swindall is attempting to beat an 
election day deadline with his oneman rushtojustice defense in 
a federal perjury trial that will climax one of the countrys most 
bitter congressional elections 
if everything goes as expected the twoterm republican 
congressman will deliver his opening argument in us district 
court on monday just one week after his indictment was handed up 
and just 15 days before the nov 8 election 
swindall a lawyer is representing himself in the perjury case 
and hopes a quick acquittal will bring victory at the polls 
he has admitted to a mistake in judgment in negotiating an 
850000 loan last year with an undercover agent posing as a 
financier but denies criminal wrongdoing eventually swindall 
accepted a 150000 check from a middleman then returned it 
uncashed 
the 10 perjury charges brought against swindall stem from his 
testimony before a grand jury in february among other things 
swindall testified he could not recall any mention of drug money 
tapes of the meetings have the agent saying the loan money was 
probably drugrelated 
swindall is facing the same challenger he did in 1986 in his bid 
for a third term in the house he calls it a race between a 
dukakis liberal and a bush conservative 
voters in the suburbs east of atlanta will choose between 
swindall and democrat ben jones a onetime dukes of hazzard tv 
star who has had to answer repeated questions from swindall about 
his admitted bout with alcoholism 
though swindall demanded the speedy trial to obtain a verdict 
before the election he has stressed his disadvantage in manpower 
and time to prepare for the trial saying he will just have to rely 
on the ol innocent defense 
in fact he will have more going for him said lawyer guy davis 
a former policeman and prosecutor who was the republican nominee 
for governor in 1986 davis has been a critic of swindall but 
expressed admiration for his tactics in the case 
davis said he has seen both laymen and lawyers successfully 
defend themselves 
many defendants found that there was an advantage in that the 
jury was continously being exposed to the defendant himself while 
he conducts the trial he said 
if swindall is a good courtroom performer he said he will be 
able to impress his case on the jurors from the time the trial 
starts and not just from the time he takes the witness stand 
but robert fierer who has handled a string of highprofile 
criminal cases and represents another defendant in the 
moneylaundering probe said that while swindall may get the 
underdogs sympathy from the jury he is sacrificing some 
potentially important options in rushing to trial 
he really has given up investigative time the time to go out 
and find witnesses to get prepared on witnesses and that sort of 
thing fierer said davis however noted that swindall has had 
access to transcripts of his meetings with the undercover agent for 
some time so hes probably no doubt wellprepared to go to 
trial and i think probably it is a wise thing for him to do 
and davis said some pretrial skirmishing over what can be used 
in court and demands for information are not as crucial to swindall 
because in this case the facts are fairly simple 
if the trial starts monday swindall also gives up time for 
pretrial hearings that could have helped his defense especially 
on his claims that us attorney robert barr also a republican is 
promoting his career at swindalls expense 
us district judge robert vining ruled that swindall may not 
present those claims to the jury without conducting a pretrial 
hearing on whether barr could be subpoenaed swindall hasnt 
officially told the judge whether he wants the hearing but he has 
indicated he will not permit a delay in the trial 
it will be up to the jury to decide whether swindall can 
reconcile the tapes of his meetings with the undercover agent with 
his later grand jury testimony 
swindall has vowed to show his answers were not deceitful 
because he simply could not remember everything said in the 
negotiations 
the 38yearold congressman has had to curtail campaigning 
saying the trial has become the campaigns most important factor 
his preindictment polls he said found a dead heat jones 
campaign manager maren hesla disagreed 
congressman swindall has attempted to make the verdict the 
election but thats just not the case ms hesla said we 
enjoyed an 18point lead prior to the indictment 
jones who has acknowledged a conviction for assault on his wife 
during the days he was battling alcoholism has been quiet about 
his opponents criminal case ms hesla acknowledged that jones has 
lost news media attention because of the focus on swindalls case 
were doing what we can to be out there meeting the voters right 
now she said

here is the text of president reagans weekly 
radio address delivered saturday from camp david md 
my fellow americans abraham lincoln once said you cant fool 
all of the people all of the time well this week our liberal 
friends have been trying to prove him wrong 
theyve charged that our record of lowering your taxes ending 
runaway inflation and igniting the longest peacetime economic 
expansion ever has been bad for middle class working americans 
well its time to remind them of a few facts 
for example the misery index the miserly index was an election 
year gimmick they cooked up for the 1976 campaign by adding the 
unemployment and inflation rates it came to 134 percent in 1976 
and they declared that no one had a right to seek reelection with a 
misery index that high 
well four years later in the 1980 campaign they didnt 
mention the misery index perhaps because it had grown to almost 21 
percent and this year they still arent mentioning it under us 
its dropped to under 10 percent 
our liberal friends have been hopping around the country 
charging that real family income is no higher today than it was 20 
years ago now in fact its 14 percent higher but why would they 
bring family income up at all after all between 1977 and 1981 
maybe you can guess why i picked those years the typical american 
familys income after taking out inflation fell seven percent 
think of what it would mean to you and your family if somebody 
were to cut your familys paychecks by that much today 
think of how much less you could buy at the grocery store the 
clothes you couldnt get for your children how much less you could 
put in the plate at your church or synagogue each week 
and then think of this since 1981 when we came to office the 
typical familys income after taking out inflation has soared 
more than 10 percent 
one place you can see what this change means to you is in 
housing our liberal friends have been talking a great deal about 
affordable housing recently dont they remember that in 1980 as 
housing prices and interest rates skyrocketed together one of the 
few times in history thats happened and real family incomes 
plummeted the american dream of owning a home almost went down for 
the count 
and the top housing official of the previous administration 
finally threw up his hands in despair and said for many 
hardworking families housing is growing beyond their reach 
yes according to real estate industry economists in 1980 the 
average american family made just over threefourths of what it 
needed to buy a home today with interest rates half of what they 
were and inflation under control the typical american family makes 
over 110 percent of what it needs to buy home 
renters are also doing better when the liberals left office 
the national vacancy rates for apartments in the price range of low 
and medium income families were around five percent which means it 
had become hard for low and medium income americans to find an 
apartment today these national vacancy rates are around eight 
percent and its the landlords who are having to wait longer to 
find tenants 
add this all up and you see that we have more much more 
affordable housing today then we had eight years ago 
youd think all these facts would give our liberal opponents 
pause but apparently not 
when we note that since our expansion began america has created 
more than 18 million new jobs that unemployment is nearly the 
lowest its been in 14 years and that a greater proportion of 
americans are at work today than ever before in our history the 
liberals blandly respond that what we need are good jobs at good 
wages 
perhaps they believe that most americans have bad jobs i dont 
believe that and to tell the truth i find remarks that put down 
honest occupations yes including shortorder chefs offensive 
and i expect you do too in any event overall job for job the 
jobs created since our expansion began pay more than the jobs that 
existed before 
the liberals charge that weve given tax breaks to the wealthy 
but when we came to office the wealthy were paying 193 percent of 
the federal individual income tax revenues now its 26 percent 
the charges go on and on but the truth remains the same no 
matter how you look at it the last time they were in office the 
liberals clobbered the american middle class and we stopped them 
some are calling this lastditch opposition campaign an attempt 
at class warfare 
so whats new our liberal friends have been at war with 
americas middle class for years now they want you to turn the 
other cheek but will they just take that as an opportunity to 
really let you have it 
mainstream america is in better shape today than its ever been 
why would we ever want to put it back in the hands of those who 
almost turned out its lights 
until next week thanks for listening and god bless you

here is the text of the democratic response to 
president reagans weekly radio address saturday from senate 
majority leader robert c byrd of west virginia 
in less than three weeks the american people will elect a new 
president it may be the most important election of this century 
on the surface this election has been a series of negative tv 
ads quicky polls and instant experts the ads the polls and the 
experts seem to be driving the process 
most americans are unhappy with what they are seeing on their 
televisions we are a big people and we want a wide view of whats 
at stake in this election everything important to the american 
people cannot be reduced to a sevensecond sound bite 
the ads on television arent going to tell you much of anything 
a little music some flag waving and then poof the ad is over 
its time to look beneath the surface and start asking the 
important questions 
we need a president who tends to the nations business who has 
a sense of the future 
we need a president who has a plan for making the trade deficit 
a trade surplus who is willing to make a real commitment to ending 
the policy of borrow and debt that has put us into a sea of red ink 
we need a president who wants to keep america strong and who 
knows that economic power and military strength go hand in hand we 
need a president who believes in america so much that he is not 
afraid to tell us we have problems that need fixing 
we need a president who ways the same thing in public that he 
says in private and who wont make secret deals with the ayatollah 
two years ago the american people put the democrats back in 
charge of the senate we won in 1986 because we told the american 
people we would make a difference in their lives 
our agenda was clear and exact check and balance a white house 
that seemed to have lost its way we delivered despite two years of 
confrontation 
when the american people asked for a clean water bill we 
delivered despite a white house that said no 
when american workers wanted a new trade bill and jobs for 
americans we delivered despite a white house that said no 
when the american people demanded fairness on plant closing we 
delivered despite a white house that said no 
when the american people demanded an end to the slash and 
burn education policy of the white house it was the congress 
that said yes 
so who is in the mainstream of american politics a look at the 
record of the democratic congress will answer that question 
this congress has tried to be a family congress we have 
tackled the problems that people talk about when they sit around 
the kitchen table 
for our senior citizens we have expanded medicare to include 
catastrophic health insurance 
for twopaycheck families we fought for parental leave and 
child care bills only to run into a white house filibuster 
for millions of working men and women we fought for an increase 
in the minimum wage despite white house opposition 
for our nations security we fought against waste and fraud in 
the pentagon 
as majority leader of the senate democrats i take pride in the 
work of the 100th congress we have done our duty we have 
addressed your concerns we have listened to the people 
harry truman once said that polls are like sleeping pills 
designed to lull voters into sleeping on election day 
dont let the polls lull you to sleep dont let the political 
hucksters pick the next president 
look beneath the surface look to the record vote for the 
future remember that america is always at its best when we face 
our problems and never stand still 
thank you and god bless you

president reagan ridiculed presidential 
candidate michael dukakis campaign theme of good jobs at good 
wages on saturday asserting it is a cover for the belief that 
most americans have bad jobs 
president reagans weekly radio address from camp david md 
followed the pattern of recent weeks in which he has launched an 
entirely partisan attack against the liberals in this years 
election campaign 
while reagan contended that the republican party was the 
champion of the middle class senate majority leader robert c byrd 
of west virginia also claimed that honor in the democratic response 
as majority leader of the senate democrats i take pride in 
the work of the 100th congress we have done our duty we have 
addressed your concerns we have listened to the people byrd 
said in an address relayed only hours after the congress had 
adjourned for the year 
the senator said the democraticled congress fulfilled a 
specific agenda check and balance a white house that seemed to 
have lost its way we delivered despite two years of 
confrontation 
in his address reagan did not mention dukakis or the gop 
candidate vice president george bush by name but his target was 
clear 
using his favorite catchword for the democratic party reagan 
asserted that our liberal friends in the campaign have no 
response to the nations robust economy or its low unemployment 
rate 
reagan and bush have repeatedly boasted that more than 18 
million new jobs have been created during the economic expansion 
but dukakis has countered with the charge that many of the jobs 
created during the reagan presidency have been minimumwage 
positions such as those in the fastfood industry 
the liberals blandly respond that what we need are good jobs 
at good wages reagan said perhaps they actually believe that 
most american have bad jobs 
i dont believe that and to tell the truth i find remarks 
that put down honest occupations and thats including short order 
chefs offensive and i expect you do too reagan added 
the jobs created since our expansion began pay more than the 
jobs that existed before he said 
reagan also tried to counter democratic charges that his 
administration has given tax breaks to the wealthy by asserting 
that the middle class has flourished under his administration 
charging that our liberal friends have been at war with the 
american middle class for years reagan argued that mainstream 
america is in better shape today than its ever been why would we 
want to put it back in the hands of those who almost turned out its 
lights 
for his part byrd contended that the democratic congress has 
dealt with the problems that people talk about when they sit 
around the kitchen table 
byrd said the congress had expanded medicare to include 
catastrophic health insurance fought for parental leave and child 
care bills and tried to obtain an increase in the minimum wage 
despite white house opposition 
harry truman once said that polls are like sleeping pills 
designed to lull voters into sleeping on election day byrd said 
dont let the polls lull you to sleep dont let the political 
hucksters pick the next president 
look beneath the surface look to the record vote for the 
future remember that america is always at its best when we face 
our problems and never stand still he said

here is a chronology of major events in the attempts to free the 
three trapped whales in barrow alaska 
oct 13 the california gray whales were discovered trapped in 
the ice east of point barrow they apparently became stuck a week 
before biologists were unable to contact an icebreaker to give aid 
oct 14 the whales continued to swim several hundred feet 
offshore using two holes in the ice to breathe biologists 
believed time was running out for the grays as nighttime 
temperatures dropped to 13 degrees below zero threatening to 
shrink the whales breathing space efforts failed again to contact 
an icebreaking ship 
oct 18 a biologist said one whale may have pneumonia as an 
alaska army national guard skycrane helicopter went to tow a 
185ton hovercrafttype icebreaking barge 200 miles northwest to 
the whales president reagan telephoned with his support 
oct 19 eskimos cut new holes in ice but the barge effort was 
hampered by shallow water biologists said the whales health 
appeared to be stabilized and that they were handling their 
captivity better than first believed 
oct 20 the barge began its journey but moved only about six 
miles through sand bars mud and shallow water two minnesota 
brothersinlaw arrive with deicers to enlarge breathing holes for 
whales 
oct 21 one of the whales nicknamed bone disappeared and 
was presumed dead rescuers tried plan b a fiveton concrete 
bullet wielded by a helicopter loaned by the alaska army 
national guard easterly wind opened leads or open water 
through the ice within four miles of the whales the soviet union 
offered an icebreaker to help in the rescue 
oct 22 eskimos using chain saws had led the whales almost a 
halfmile closer to open water by carving a string of 24 breathing 
holes in the ice the skycrane dropping its bullet had punched 
four 15to20foot holes in the ice at 75yard intervals but a 
massive pressure ridge of ice stood in the way

lloyd bentsen warned his fellow texans on 
saturday against ticket splitting to support him for the senate and 
republican george bush for president in hopes of giving powerful 
jobs to two men with ties to the state 
some republicans are trying to peddle the notion that you 
can vote twice for texas bentsen told a union audience in 
beaumont as he stumped with democratic presidential nominee michael 
dukakis have you heard that one 
it was a rare acknowledgement of the political problem tied to 
his dual candidacies for vice president and reelection to the 
senate from texas 
a vote for george bush is a vote for dan quayle and a vote 
for dan quayle sure isnt a vote for lloyd bentsen a vote for 
george bush or dan quayle makes no sense if you care for texas 
he said 
a vote for george bush is a vote against a strong energy 
policy that will bring this state back he said 
under texas law bentsen is allowed to run for both the vice 
presidency and the senate he has said he would resign from the 
senate if he and dukakis win but he was staying in that race 
because resigning would automatically hand the seat to republican 
opponent beau boulter for six years a resignation on the other 
hand would force a special election 
bentsen made his comments at a joint rally with dukakis in a 
packed hall owned by the local pipefitters union whose members are 
highly dependant on the oil and gas industry east texas is a 
traditionally democratic part of the state and the dukakisbentsen 
ticket needs to win big there to have any chance of carrying the 
state and its 29 electoral votes on nov 8 
mike mccurry bentsens press secretary said the senator spoke 
up because some news editorials in texas had suggested that texans 
support the republicans for president and bentsen for the senate 
instead of his republican opponent beau boulter 
some bush supporters who also like bentsen have been making 
that suggestion to boost ticket splitting the polls show bentsen a 
handy winner in his senate race but the democrats behind in the 
presidential race and they dont want texas supporters of bentsen 
to feel satisfied by just supporting him for the senate 
after campaigning together in beaumont dukakis and bentsen went 
their separate ways and bentsen traveled north to gilmer for the 
annual yamboree celebrating the years crop of yams before 
heading on to missouri 
on a stage decorated with bushels of yams and some pumpkins 
bentsen told a crowd of several hundred people not to listen to 
republican ads claiming that the democrats wanted to take away 
their guns and were weak on defense he took particular umbrage at 
a republican party ad featuring former test pilot chuck yeager 
saying the democrats were bad for the defense industry which is a 
major employer in texas 
i decided he set some of those high altitude records and 
forgot to turn on his oxygen bentsen said 
orangelettered signs proclaimed yammin with 
dukakisbentsen as the senator spoke and then rode around town in 
a convertible waving at the friendly thousands attending the 
festival 
there was some disagreement in the campaign entourage as whether 
there was any real difference between yams and sweet potatoes and 
bentsen was asked what he thought the difference was 
well i dont know he said but im yam proud to be 
here

eddie haskell joined wally june and the 
beaver before the twostory cleaver home to mark the grand opening 
of universal studios florida where the new leave it to beaver 
series will be produced 
hey were really excited about being here tony dow who 
plays wally cleaver told reporters friday the set looks great 
dont you think 
standing before the familiar cleaver home which was trucked in 
from universal studios in hollywood executive producer brian 
levant introduced the cast members as they emerged one by one 
through the front door 
mindful of tradition levant said as he announced the members of 
the original cast barbara billingsley tony dow ken 
osmond and jerry mathers as the beaver 
the arrival of the show at universal studios florida was marked 
by the ceremonial mounting of the cleavers house number 211 
the numbers were hammered in and removed three times for the 
benefit of tv crews who may have missed it 
this is the day weve looked forward to for many many years 
the beginning of production at universal studios florida studio 
president steven lew said 
everything except the sidewalk painted plywood in front of the 
cleaver house came from hollywood even the brown leaves real 
leaves that were strewn about to simulate autumn 
once inside the cast wandered around their home 
mathers looked through curtains to the back yard 
gee here we are in florida and we have the same neighbors 
he said looking out at a wall mural of homes and yards 
much of the 444acre movietelevision complex is still being 
built but the new leave it to beaver which airs on cables 
superstation tbs will produce 19 episodes this season in the 
22000squarefoot sound stage which means the cast and crew will 
be in central florida until march 
the original leave it to beaver began in october 1957 on 
cbs then moved to abc in october 1958 where the sitcom ran until 
september 1963 twenty years later cbs aired a tvmovie titled 
still the beaver which in turn spawned a series of the same 
title on the disney channel in 1984 
disney droped the cleavers after two seasons but ted turner 
soon ordered 74 episodes for his cable station which could keep 
the series on the air until the early 1990s 
economy was a big factor in the move east michael houbrick a 
spokesman for the show said last season might have been the shows 
last if it had to continue production on the west coast where 
union wages are considerably higher than in florida 
the cast has nothing but praise for local hospitality and the 
universal facility the studios in california were musty and 
leaked mathers said 
every time it rained we had to move from one set to another 
levant however said he sees few differences between hollywood 
east and west 
weve still got to hide the palm trees when we go outside 
same as california

the itt corp will plead guilty monday to treating 
an air force employee to meals and golf greens fees to allegedly 
obtain inside information for two air force contracts worth 180 
million the company said 
quite frankly while we dont condone what the itt employee 
did it was fairly minor in the scheme of things itt spokesman 
jim gallagher said friday 
the corporate guilty plea to charges it conspired to defraud 
the government could result in a fine up to 500000 
the new yorkbased companys plans were disclosed in a statement 
which says the case is not related to the recently publicized 
justice department investigation of defense contractors the boston 
globe reported saturday 
its somewhat prototypical of the kind of cases that one can 
expect said us attorney frank mcnamara you have a lot of 
the same elements and it shows in a kind of generic way how the 
game is played 
itt was indicted in june 1987 several months before the 
investigation began of defense contractors use of consultants to 
get information for use in bidding for contracts 
the indictment said itt treated an air force employee at hanscom 
air force base in suburban bedford to golf greens fees baseball 
tickets meals and liquor in exchange for information used to bid 
on contracts 
the itt announcement follows a guilty plea to similar charges 
entered last july by edward m vicenzi a former senior marketing 
representative of the companys gilfillan subsidiary in van nuys 
calif 
federal prosecutors dropped three other counts in the indictment 
accusing itt of transmitting air force documents from bedford to 
itt gilfillan the globe reported 
itt gilfillan won a preliminary 64 million development 
contract for a missile decoy system that would lure homing missiles 
away from air force radar sites it also sought a contract for a 
mobile air traffic control radar system 
neither system was built 
however the indictment alleged that vicenzi obtained several 
documents relating to the two programs from maurice w raciti a 
deputy program manager in logistics in the tactical program office 
at the electronics system division at hanscom 
raciti a 31year veteran federal employee resigned in late 
1986 after being suspended by air force officials pending a federal 
investigation no charges have been filed against him 
vicenzi also has pleaded guilty to a separate charge of paying a 
government employee 300 to make changes in a bid for a contract 
sought by emerson electric co of st louis 
vicenzi has not been sentenced in either case the charges 
against him involve maximum penalties of up to 35 years in prison 
and 500000 in fines

parliament on saturday approved a 
package of constitutional amendments designed to make the economy 
more marketoriented and ease the worst economic crisis since world 
war ii 
the amendments also would give serbia more control over its 
autonomous provinces of kosovo and vojvodina the crisis has been 
fueled by hundreds of thousands of serbs protesting the alleged 
harassment of serbs in kosovo by the majority ethnic albanians 
adoption of the 34 measures was largely symbolic since strong 
opposition is expected when they are submitted to for approval by 
the legislatures of each of yugoslavias six republics and two 
provinces 
the government meanwhile approved price increases of up to 53 
percent on meat and 60 percent on bread two days after parliament 
eased an unpopular austerity program by allowing salary raises for 
some workers 
the wage increases of between 140 percent and 152 percent for 
this year will only partially compensate for falling living 
standards because inflation is now at 217 percent 
meat prices were boosted just three weeks ago last year the 
government had to cancel sharp increases in bread prices after 
widespread protests 
the economic amendments were designed to help ease a crisis that 
has reduced living standards by onehalf since 1980 
they provide for less state interference greater private and 
foreign investment and more market mechanisms in the economy such 
as closing unprofitable enterprises and sacking unnecessary or 
undisciplined workers 
the moves to give serbia more control over vojvodina and kosovo 
and a controversial proposal for army financing are likely to meet 
particularly stiff resistance in regional legislatures 
serbia would increase its control over kosovos largely ethnic 
albanian judiciary which serbs contend is biased against them 
the reforms also would require kosovo pupils to study according 
to programs drawn up in serbia the object is to broaden the 
nonalbanian cultural background given to ethnic albanian pupils 
kosovo and vojvodina administratively parts of the republic of 
serbia have strenuously resisted serbian communist leader slobodan 
milosevics efforts to curtail their autonomy 
serbs have held dozens of massive rallies to voice their support 
for the constitutional reforms in the past five months and 
vojvodinas party leadership was forced to resign this month over 
the issue 
the amendments also would allow the budget of the armed forces 
to be replenished from funds of the republics in case of a 
shortfall in the federal budget 
the liberal northern republic of slovenia has refused to endorse 
the proposal 
the army which now is financed from the federal budget long 
has complained that tripledigit inflation is eating into its funds 
and forcing it to take out loans from state banks to enable it to 
continue operating 
the constitutional proposals would amend about onethird of 
yugoslavias 1974 constitution said to be the worlds longest with 
406 articles 
the amendments due to be adopted by republican and provincial 
legislatures by nov 29 the national holiday are seen as an 
interim solution before a new and modern constitution is 
drafted the state news agency tanjug said 
stipe suvar who holds the annually rotating chairmanship of the 
ruling communist party said last week a new draft constitution may 
be ready for discussion by the next national party congress in 1990

claude montana perfected his aline chic and 
givenchy turned out his peppiest clothes in several seasons during 
saturday shows for next summers readytowear 
jeanpaul gaultiers collection drew gasps and occasional 
laughter with designs that ranged from a bawdyhouse look to a 
traveling circus act 
everything was long and beautiful by montana who showed only a 
few skirts between trousers shaped like fluid inverted cones he 
also showed an occasional pair of wide cuffed linen shorts 
he kept to a muted tone of greys browns and dusty pinks the 
highwaisted trousers he has done before but they never looked 
better 
montana showed silk jumpsuits and flowing skirts with tops 
draped in silk chiffon fichus sometimes off the shoulder 
some toppers had floppy lapels others had swooped stitched 
necklines and natural shoulderlines 
the sophisticated outfits also had vest fronts with open backs 
crossed by straps 
everything was sleek and easy jackets often had a long flared 
look from an easily fitted bodice squarenecked sundress tops were 
like trapeze dresses over pants 
while all the day clothes were dressy evening clothes were 
anything but showoff usually in austere black they had lacquered 
lace and net cutouts in the bodices over swirling chiffon skirts 
givenchy delivered a collection to keep his palm beachtoparis 
clients happy there were short skirts and pants or skirt suits 
came out with a snug silhouette 
these silk smooth wool and pique outfits looked peppy with very 
wide white piping all over creating a clean look in navy with 
white or yellow chunky or big pastille buttons also brightened up 
the scene 
with circular necks and slightly blousing tops the silk 
flowerprint dresses were completely givenchy even more striking 
were the widelystriped silks with standout capped sleeves square 
necks and straight short skirts 
jeanpaul gaultier threw caution to the wind after showing more 
conventional clothes last season he sees the upcoming nineties as 
naughty with lacy corsets jackets open to reveal bosoms and shiny 
tight pants 
there was a full line of underwear dressing including a 
multicolored girdle tunic and a clinging girdle dress with a bra 
top 
the finale was based on multisuspenders and garters covering 
the colorful elasticized jersey or satin body suits underneath

leftist guerrillas attacked two small 
police stations in the south with machine guns and antitank 
rockets killing a corporal and wounding a local farmer police 
said saturday 
they were the first significant terrorist actions since 
rightwing president augusto pinochet lost an oct 5 referendum on 
extending his rule to 1997 
according to a national police statement eight guerrillas 
opened fire friday night with machine guns and m16 rifles on a 
small frontier post in los quenes in the andes foothills 20 miles 
east of the city of curico 
the guerrillas then set a police building afire destroying it 
and a police jeep the statement said it said the gunfire killed a 
corporal juvenal vargas and wounded a farmer visiting the post 
fernando garcia 
an hour earlier other guerrillas fired two antitank rockets at 
another police post in pichipellahuen 55 miles southwest of the 
town of traiguen the communique said there were no injuries 
reported in the attack 
the communique blamed both attacks on the communist manuel 
rodriguez patriotic front 
a spokeswoman for a dissident faction of the front called 
foreign news agencies in santiago to claim responsibility for the 
actions saying they represented the start of a national 
patriotic war 
interior minister carlos caceres called the police officers 
death an extremely cold terrorist act and called on chileans 
to understand that this country wants to achieve democracy on a 
peaceful level 
caceres was named friday when pinochet replaced half of his 
cabinets 16 members in a shakeup prompted by pinochets 
800000ballot loss in his bid to extend his term 
the 72yearold army commander seized power in a 1973 coup 
under the constitution pinochet remains in power until march 
1990 the winner of open elections planned for december 1989 will 
take over 
while swearing in his new ministers pinochet firmly rejected 
opposition calls to step down early and for consitutional reforms 
opposition leaders said his declaration and new cabinet choices 
dashed their hopes for prompt negotiations on the reforms 
the cabinet is the same only the names are different said 
andres zaldivar vicepresident of the centrist christian 
democratic party the countrys largest it doesnt reflect 
the feeling of the immense majority of chileans who voted no on 
oct 5 
zaldivar however called on the oppositions ranks to keep a 
cool head and firm nerves and not to resort to violent actions 
the coalition has repeatedly condemned leftist terrorist actions 
saying they provide an excuse for government repression 
ricardo lagos a prominent socialist noted that two army 
generals public works minister bruno siebert and economy minister 
manuel concha and a retired navy admiral defense minister 
patricio carvajal were retained while generals from the air force 
and national police were ousted 
the air force and national police are considered more 
politically moderate than the navy or pinochets fiercely loyal 
army

twelve thousand law officers stood at attention 
saturday outside a church where a funeral mass was held for two 
city policemen who were shot in separate incidents within hours of 
each other 
busloads of new york city police officers their shields draped 
with black mourning bands were joined outside our lady of 
perpetual help church by colleagues from around the state and from 
massachusetts new jersey and connecticut 
they stood 10 deep filling more than six blocks of the bay 
ridge neighborhood of brooklyn hundreds of civilians also stood 
behind police barricades surrounding the church 
while the mourners waited outside in chilly windy weather a 
wedding proceeded inside the church an event planned nine months 
ago 
christopher hoban 26 an undercover officer from bay ridge was 
shot in the head and chest tuesday night during a manhattan drug 
raid michael buczek 24 a highly decorated street officer who 
lived in suffern was killed less than three hours later while he 
and his partner pursued a suspect in harlem 
we will never turn this city over to those demons of death who 
would take all our lives for a few coins of gold police 
commissioner benjamin ward told the mourners 
department officials called it the largest police funeral in 
city history it also was the first time in the departments 
history that a double funeral had been held for officers killed in 
separate incidents 
there was silence when two hearses arrived broken by the slow 
beat of drums from the police band a lone bagpiper played 
amazing grace while the flagcovered caskets were carried up 
the church steps 
it seems fitting for michael and christopher to lie together 
in this church because they shared so many common bonds the rev 
victor ulto said in an homily christopher and michael shared a 
vision that life could be better 
the mourners included mayor edward i koch us sen daniel 
patrick moynihan us attorney rudolph giuliani manhattan borough 
president david dinkins queens borough president claire shulman 
and city council president andrew stein 
at one point during the funeral koch held his head in his hands 
and appeared to be sobbing 
the social contract even with criminals was always that you 
didnt kill cops koch said later in an address to mourners 
now they go out of their way to kill cops 
in closing ulto said i plead to each and every police 
officer here please remain faithful to your calling stand 
true to what officers michael buczek and christopher hoban lived 
and died for 
there are no words to describe our familys grief the 
buczek family said in a written statement michael gave up his 
life to fight the war on drugs 
all we ask is that our nations local and federal governments 
support the death penalty and provide the funding necessary to win 
the drug war

relatives of a man who was killed 
in an unsolved hitandrun are offering as much as 1 million to 
anyone with information leading to the drivers identity 
but the family says that before it can pay off it first must 
win a 6 million lawsuit against the driver and his identity 
apparently is known only to one person an attorney who has won 
court permission to keep it secret because of lawyerclient 
privilege 
that lawsuit is pending in palm beach county circuit court 
while state and private investigators continue trying to track down 
the driver of the car 
the suit was filed in february over the march 9 1986 crash 
that killed mark baltes in palm beach 
attorney barry krischer says the driver approached him for 
counsel the day after the accident and he has steadfastly refused 
to publicly identify him 
on oct 12 circuit judge timothy poulton said krischer did not 
have to reveal that information because it is protected by 
attorneyclient confidentiality 
this criminal is out there laughing at the system hiding 
behind the attorneyclient privilege says joseph farish 
attorney for baltes family he devised the reward plan announced 
friday in order to make incentive for someone to come forward 
and expedite this mystery 
farish conceded that if someone comes forward with information 
leading to the drivers identity the tipster would have to wait 
for a favorable jury verdict in the lawsuit 
richard lubin who represents krischer said he is indifferent 
to farishs tactics as long as farish does not trample on the 
judges ruling 
its really not my concern as long as he and everyone else 
respects the attorneyclient privilege lubin said 
anything that mr farish or the baltes family will do to help 
us is welcome said chief assistant state attorney ken selvig 
if this helps we welcome it

the navy calls this ship a bargain but a halfbilliondollar 
battleship is no bargain for milwaukee and wisconsin taxpayers 
norquist said 
he said he it was incredible that taxpayers have been saddled 
so much to bring back a ship thats mostly of nostalgic value 
the wisconsin is 887 feet long 108 feet wide and displaces 
58000 tons 
it will be based in norfolk va until construction is

a rare public rift in the jewish community 
controversy over a political memo and harsh words from defense 
secretary frank carlucci have focused attention on aipac one of 
the most powerful lobbying groups on capitol hill 
the american israel public affairs committee referred to as 
aipac is wellknown in the corridors of power even though its 
staff generally stays out of the limelight and prefers to work 
behind the scenes 
thomas a dine aipacs executive director rarely gives 
interviews and aipac officials are not regulars on the television 
and radio talk show circuit 
yet aipac has compiled a stunningly successful record since 1951 
in promoting the relationship between the united states and israel 
jerusalem is the largest recipient of us economic and military 
aid amounting to 3 billion this year 
its the strongest lobby in washington the strongest lobby in 
the country said former rep paul findley an illinois 
republican who wrote a book attacking aipac after his defeat in 
1982 
it remains a powerhouse on capitol hill because they have an 
excellent highly professional highly trained staff he said 
aipac staff members track legislation and have broad contacts at 
the state department and in the white house 
aipac and its allies in congress have played a large role in 
opposing the sale of weapons to saudi arabia jordan bahrain and 
kuwait 
carlucci in a speech to an arabamerican group friday said 
congressional opposition to the sale of weapons to moderate arab 
countries was costing the united states tens of billions of 
dollars worth of jobs 
saudi arabia upset that its attempts to buy weapons such as new 
fighter jets and maverick antitank missiles from washington often 
have been stymied by congress recently signed a deal with britain 
to buy more than 30 billion worth of weapons 
carlucci did not mention aipac by name but he criticized 
various interest groups and many in congress for trying to 
block sales to arab countries 
the notion that us defense cooperation with moderate arab 
states poses a danger to israel is illfounded and untrue he 
said 
but rep mel levine dcalif a strong backer of israel said 
such sales are not in the american interest of peace in the 
middle east 
findley in a telephone interview from jacksonville ill said 
he thinks aipacs real power stems from an indirect linkage between 
the lobby and proisrael political action committees controlled by 
jewish groups 
aipac strenuously denies the allegation and says it does not 
make political contributions or endorse candidates 
spokeswoman toby dershowitz reiterated this position in a letter 
to washington jewish week which had published a story saying the 
cbstv show 60 minutes was looking into the relationship 
between aipac and proisrael political action committees 
60 minutes has no new evidence that aipac coordinates or 
directs pacs she said adding that earlier allegations fall 
far short of proving any such direction or coordination 
dershowitz also disavowed a 1987 memo written by a former junior 
staffer at the lobbying group to another exstaffer barbara 
amouyal 
the memo discussed the senate race in rhode island describing 
republican incumbent john chafee as a poor supporter of our 
issue it called for encouragement of the candidacy of richard 
licht the states lieutenant governor who is jewish 
no such negative campaign exists against chafee dershowitz 
said 
while aipac always has been a magnet for criticism from some 
members of congress the airing of a disagreement in the jewish 
community over the lobbys activities was unusual 
six officials of the american jewish committee the american 
jewish congress and the antidefamation league of the bnai brith 
complained in a letter that aipac had taken positions that were not 
in accord with the consensus of the organized jewish community 
the complaint was in the form of a letter that appeared first in 
the new york times 
the letter said aipac erred in trying to close the palestine 
liberation organizations un office in new york and some jewish 
leaders disagreed with aipacs opposition to a big kuwaiti arms 
deal 
last week the groups tried to paper over any differences with 
aipac 
they issued a statement in which they pledged to be fully 
supportive of aipacs work the three groups were among the 
founding members of aipac in 1951 
some of israels supporters on capitol hill also played down the 
significance of any rift 
do all jews have the same opinion on israel no said rep 
barney frank dmass but that doesnt translate into an overall 
lessening of support for israel he said 
although aipac officials generally do a good job frank 
said i think they sometimes tend to overkill 
the jewish community is not homogeneous said rep larry 
smith dfla who said i dont think it is anything but healthy 
to have different points of view on issues 
but rep mervyn dymally dcalif chairman of the congressional 
black caucus and an aipac critic said the open disagreement could 
weaken the lobby because when leaders begin to speak out then 
aipac will moderate their views 
aipacs money comes from its 50000 members who sent 
contributions the group which has a staff of about 70 will 
operate with a budget of 66 million this year dershowitz said 
six people registered as lobbyists for aipac between april and 
july this year lobbying reports filed with the senate show that 
dine and aipacs chief lobbyist douglas bloomfield each earned 
about 21000 in the second quarter of 1988 
meantime former cia agent victor marchetti and author mark lane 
said they have asked the justice department to investigate whether 
aipac should be registered as a lobby for a foreign government 
under the 1938 foreign agents registration act 
department spokesman john russell said the agency determined in 
the 1970s that aipac was not required to register because none of 
its money came from israel

iraq said saturday it will release 25 
iranian prisoners of war but the two countries traded accusations 
over the pow issue 
the official iraqi news agency quoted a foreign ministry 
spokesman as saying the new release will raise to 645 the number of 
sick and aging iranian prisoners who have been freed 
according to the international red cross iran holds 50182 
iraqi pows and iraq holds 19284 iranians but un officials and 
diplomats place the figures much higher saying iran holds 
6000070000 and iraq 3000050000 
the iraqi spokesman said the international committee of the red 
cross was asked to send a delegation to organize the new 
repatriation according to the news agency report monitored in 
nicosia 
it said he called on iran to reciprocate and claimed that iran 
had all along dealt with the pow issue as a political one in 
order to exploit it for the purposes of irans expansionist 
policies 
a tehran radio commentary on saturday welcomed iraqs planned 
release of prisoners but said real progress on the issue would only 
come through quicker peace negotiations 
it also accused iraq of waffling on the issue claiming irdaq 
first said it would not exchange prisoners within the framework of 
un resolution 598 but later supported elements of that plan 
the resolution is the basis for the aug 20 ceasefire in the 
8yearlong war 
the commentary monitored by the british broadcasting corp in 
london said iran was ready to exchange prisoners of war

more than 100 antiabortion protesters were arrested in 
bridgeport conn on saturday while a noisy rainsoaked protest 
in boston drew as many counterdemonstrators as demonstrators 
the crowd of protesters in front of the summit womens center in 
bridgeport delayed the opening of the clinic for more than an hour 
witnesses said 
the goal was to save babies lives said bob chuvala of 
danbury who helped organize the protest for the connecticut 
prolife action network if some mother decided not to have an 
abortion because of our presence there then yes weve 
accomplished our goal 
police originally said 131 people were arrested by midday but 
later revised that total to 103 adults and four juveniles officer 
sheila peeler said the adults were released on written promises to 
appear in superior court later and the juveniles were released 
into the custody of their parents she said 
chuvala said there were about 50 people taking part in the 
protest who were not arrested bringing the total number of 
participants to about 160 
there were far fewer arrests in boston where about 300 people 
turned out activists on both sides of the issue each claimed they 
had more supporters in the crowd 
they may be able to get away with this in atlanta but they 
are not going to do this in boston said louise rice an 
organizer of the prochoice counterprotest since july large 
antiabortion protests in atlanta have resulted in hundreds of 
arrests 
deputy boston police superintendent ronald conway said three 
abortion opponents were arrested on disorderly conduct charges as 
they sat on the sidewalk in front of the downtown gynacare clinic 
about 30 helmeted officers stood shoulder to shoulder in front 
of the clinic to clear a path for arriving patients 
no staff members or patients with appointments for abortions 
were denied entry said a clinic spokeswoman who would identify 
herself only as karla but she added that there was no way of 
knowing if any women were discouraged from coming in for 
unscheduled pregnancy tests 
we are not here to get arrested to close buildings to make 
an issue said joseph foreman a presbyterian minister from 
atlanta who helped organize the recent demonstrations there and was 
advising the boston protest 
we are here to save children who are going to be killed 
foreman said 
but tess ewing another organizer of the prochoice 
counterprotest said its not so much that they are profetus 
they are antiwomen these people are trying to win back by 
disruptive tactics the moral rights that they couldnt win by 
legitimate means 
in connecticut chuvala had declined to identify in advance 
which of about a dozen clinics in the state would be the target of 
saturdays action because we need an element of surprise 
after the protest began at the clinic in bridgeport a woman who 
answered the telephone at the center said im sorry we dont 
have anything to say earlier a coalition of abortion providers 
in the state had vowed to do everything possible to keep open 
whatever clinic was hit by the protest

a shiite moslem leader said saturday that 
kidnappers holding foreign hostages and threatening to hurt the 
american ones were committing an unforgivable crime 
nabih berri who heads the mainstream shiite amal militia spoke 
in an interview with the associated press after the islamic jihad 
a proiranian fundamentalist faction warned it would punish 
american hostages it is holding 
the islamic jihad threat was in retaliation for fridays israeli 
air raids on lebanon that killed 21 people and injured 34 
officials had said 16 people were killed in the attacks but police 
reported five more bodies were found in the rubble saturday in the 
southeastern town of mashgara one of the main targets of the 
israeli raids

the racketeering indictment of former 
philippine president ferdinand marcos signals the start of a 
lengthy legal process that is likely to include several rounds of 
plea bargaining with the justice department 
even if marcos and the government dont work out a deal that 
would spare both sides the expense of a trial it could easily be a 
year or more before marcos would face a jury 
federal prosecutors allege marcos embezzled more than 100 
million from the philippine government and used the money to buy 
three buildings in new york city the main charge carries a maximum 
prison sentence of 20 years 
paradoxical as it may seem imelda and i welcome the 
opportunity to show the whole world that these allegations of 
dishonesty and criminal activity cannot be proven by our accusers 
we are confident that we will be vindicated marcos said in a 
statement released saturday by his spokesman gemmo trinidad 
as part of what they promise will be a vigorous defense marcos 
lawyers will embark on an extensive legal process of pretrial 
discovery that is likely to involve a demand for a massive review 
of administration records for any documents suggesting marcos was 
offered assurances he wouldnt be prosecuted if he came to this 
country 
whether any such records exist the check for them and the 
discovery process in general will take a long time 
in honolulu on friday marcos attorney richard hibey referred to 
the matter indirectly saying president reagan was responsible for 
marcos being brought to the united states that marcos considered 
himself loyal to reagan and expected some loyalty in return 
including safe haven in this country 
marcos was president of the philippines for 20 years and a close 
ally of a succession of us administrations until he fled into 
exile in february 1986 
hibey also said his clients health will be a major factor in 
the case 
although he said marcos 71 is willing to attend his 
arraignment either in honolulu or new york by oct 31 where marcos 
and his wife would plead innocent hibey described marcos state as 
frail 
i am personally concerned that he may not be physically 
able to withstand the rigors of a criminal trial of this scope and 
magnitude said hibey 
trinidad the marcos spokesman said saturday that even at the 
expense of his life if he has to go to new york hell go the 
most important thing is not life but honor and he will defend his 
honor any place 
in the 2 years marcos has lived in hawaii he has been treated 
for a variety of illnesses including chest pains and an eye 
ailment 
marcos lawyers showed no enthusiasm with the deal the justice 
department offered prior to his indictment possibly pointing to a 
drawnout process of negotiation in the future 
calling the preindictment offer a set of nonnegotiable 
demands hibey said marcos had been instructed to accept or reject 
a deal that would have required him and his wife to plead guilty to 
felony racketeering charges and testify against others with no 
assurances marcos would not be jailed 
and marcos lawyers are showing no reluctance to publicly 
dispute information being put out by the government about the case 
one marcos attorney john j tigue flatly rejected the notion 
that marcos lawyers hadnt responded to the justice departments 
demands that he enter a guilty plea federal sources said thursday 
that the lawyers hadnt responded by a 5 pm edt deadline tigue 
said there had been miscommunication that the deadline had been 
530 pm and that the marcos lawyers had responded in time 
rejecting the offer of course we wouldnt let the deadline go 
by without responding said tigue 
marcos decision to face indictment rather than plead guilty to a 
crime also raises another intriguing question how much political 
damage might he inflict 
a state department cable that leaked out earlier this month 
touches on the potential problem 
it says in part that an indictment may prompt a vindictive 
marcos to seek to involve and embarrass us and philippine 
officials by making allegations of improper or illegal conduct 
however unfounded in an attempt to adversely affect relations 
with the current philippine government the cable doesnt elaborate 
in another development a congressman confirmed early saturday 
that marcos recently was subpoenaed to testify before a house 
subcommittee 
rep dante b fascell dfla chairman of the house foreign 
affairs committee said he signed the subpoena after it was 
requested by the asian and pacific affairs subcommittee 
fascell declined to discuss what the panel wants to question 
marcos about but the virgininianpilot and the ledgerstar 
newspapers in norfolk va reported from their washington bureaus 
that it involves longstanding allegations that marcos funneled 
millions of dollars into the 1980 and 1984 presidential campaigns 
of reagan 
in honolulu television station khon quoted hibey as confirming 
that the subpoena had been served i understand its for his 
appearance today oct 21 in washington hibey told the station 
thats not going to happen

the government said saturday that it wants 
solidarity leader lech walesa to meet with the interior minister to 
remove obstacles to upcoming toplevel talks with the opposition 
walesa last week refused a request for such a meeting but the 
government continues to hope he will meet with interior minister 
czeslaw kiszczak spokesman jerzy urban said 
at an unusual meeting with reporters urban said problems remain 
over the participants date and site of the talks but he strongly 
denied that the government was backing out of its promise to 
discuss polands future with the opposition 
i state tat we have wanted from the beginning and still want 
the roundtable to begin as quickly as possible he said the 
roundtable is our initiative not anyone elses 
solidarity the first independent trade union movement in the 
soviet bloc responded with a communique saying the insistence on 
another walesakiszczak meeting was a discouraging development 
this mounting of difficulties and the fact that nothing can as 
of today be recognized as settled gives a very pessimistic 
prognosis said the statement 
walesa confirmed he turned down a proposed meeting with 
kiszczak an army general who agreed with walesa to hold the talks 
in a meeting aug 31 during a wave of strikes in poland 
after getting the promise for the talks on the possible 
legalization of solidarity and union pluralism walesa quickly 
halted polands worst strike wave since solidarity was crushed in 
the 1981 martial law crackdown 
walesa speaking from his home in gdansk said he refused 
another meeting with kiszczak because a meeting on personnel 
problems makes no sense i wont permit any personnel changes in 
solidaritys proposed delegation 
i like the general very much and i am ready to talk but 
the talk cannot concern personnel problems or problems of 
solidarity and pluralism he said this is all for the 
roundtable 
walesa said the opposition could start the talks immediately if 
the government agreed 
im not going to travel and talk without a purpose but im 
ready to talk about the important things he said 
urban said there are various problems who should issue 
invitations where it takes place how many working groups there 
will be we also need to discuss and remove controversies 
concerning the personnel composition 
we strongly appeal to the opposition not to avoid the 
necessary preparatory work so that the roundtable can finally 
meet urban said 
catholic mediator andrzej stelmachowski who met with politiburo 
member jozef czyrek on saturday said only one major obstacle 
remained he said the government seeks to remove two people from 
solidaritys proposed delegation to the talks 
urban previously said there were problems with the proposed 
participation of longtime solidarity advisers adam michnik and 
jacek kuron who in the governments view advocate the overthrow of 
communism

authorities detained the captain of an 
italian freighter and accused him of ramming a greek cruise ship in 
an accident that killed two greek seamen injured 54 passengers and 
left two people missing 
italian officials on saturday denied the greek allegation and 
said the freighter was at a standstill before the crash 
officials had reported a british teenager was missing and 
feared dead after fridays accident and on saturday sponsors of the 
tour of british students said a teacher also could not be accounted 
for 
schools abroad the londonbased organizer of the trip 
identified the missing student as vivien barley 14 of sutton 
confield england and the teacher as bernard butt from the tp 
riley community in walsall england 
the collision involved the freighter adige and the 6300ton 
jupiter which was carrying 486 british students and teachers most 
of the schoolchildren arrived in london saturday for tearful 
reunions with their families 
the crash tore a gaping hole in the port side of the jupiter 
which sank less than a mile from shore all others aboard the 
jupiter were rescued and no injuries were reported from the adige 
italian officials denied greek claims that the adige was at 
fault 
the responsibility for the collision is that of the captain of 
the adige who through criminal negligence threw his ship into 
the left side of the jupiter said greeces merchant marine 
minister evangelos yannopoulos 
the adige a container ship owned by sicula oceanica spa siosa 
line of palermo sicily ignored warnings from the jupiters 
skipper as it was manuevering to dock said spyros mavrikis a 
spokesman for epirotiki lines the jupiters owner 
premier andreas papandreou returning to athens saturday after 
undergoing heart surgery in london told reporters before his 
departure that it was a question of the captain not knowing what 
he was doing 
but adige capt flavio caminale being being held in the port 
city of piraeus on manslaughter charges said the greek ship was to 
blame 
we were stopped outside the piraeus port waiting for the 
pilot so we could go in caminale said in a telephone interview 
with italys rai television network the pilot was coming towards 
me at a certain point i saw the cruise ship leaving port 
probably the wind pushed it and i found it coming upon me so 
when i realized after a few seconds that this ship was coming at 
me i ordered the engines in reverse and at the last moment 
when he the cruise ship saw that he couldnt pass he violently 
tacked to starboard and in so turning himself he struck my prow 
in rome italys merchant marine ministry said the adige had 
been at a standstill for 10 minutes when capt caminale spotted the 
jupiter leaving port and realized promptly that it was on a 
collision course 
the captain of the italian ship immediately ordered its 
engines to reverse direction the communique said 
there was not enough time for the order to be carried out said 
2nd lt enrico costantini at the ministrys operations center 
asked if the greek ship had struck the italian vessel he said 
i think so that is what it appears at this moment 
students and teachers were flown back to britain saturday aboard 
four chartered jets some were still wrapped in blankets and many 
wept as they boarded the jets 
a government spokesman said three people remained hospitalized 
in stable condition 
the 471 teenagers and their 15 teachers and chaperones were 
starting an 8day educational cruise when the collision occurred 20 
minutes after the jupiter left port 
according to mavrikis and port officials the adiges bulbous 
nose rammed the cruise ship amidships below the waterline 
its prow tore a gash all the way up to the boat deck and the 
engine room flooded the tug boats managed to keep the ship afloat

tens of thousands of lithuanians 
carrying torches and their national flag marched saturday to a 
cathedral the soviet government said it will return to the roman 
catholic church 
the procession began immediately after a lithuanian nationalist 
group was told the government had acceded to demands to return the 
14th century vilnius cathedral to its original use 
the vilnius cathedral was a center of christianity in the middle 
ages and its confiscation by the officially atheist soviet 
government had angered many lithuanians 
its been so many years i just cant believe it a 
67yearold catholic woman said the woman who marched as the 
scent of burning candles and torches filled the air said she had 
prayed at the cathedral as a girl before it was converted into an 
art museum in 1950 
the announcement came at the end of the first day of a twoday 
conference of the lithuanian restructuring movement a broadly 
backed group that is considering the most militant nationalist 
demands yet from the three soviet baltic republics 
the lithuanian government has decided to return the vilnius 
cathedral to believers as of oct 22 an official of the movement 
told more than 1000 delegates and hundreds of guests assembled in 
the vilnius sports palace 
members of the audience took to their feet clapping and 
cheering in the direction of the republics new reformminded 
communist party chief algirdas brazauskas 
on friday brazauskas told a news conference that services would 
be allowed in the cathedral every sunday and that another church 
converted into a museum would be returned to its original use in 
march 
but catholic officials were not satisfied and said they would 
boycott the vilnius cathedral until it was completely turned back 
to the church 
an estimated 4 million roman catholics live in the soviet union 
about half of them in lithuania 
the return of the cathedral was the latest in what many 
lithuanians consider a dizzying period of change in the republic 
brazauskas is a product of that change he was named to head the 
party just two days ago replacing ringaudas songaila a 
conservative who had expressed only lukewarm support for the 
restructuring group 
brazauskas had no reservations 
im sorry to say that in its evaluation of the movement there 
were mistakes and some were also made by the party central 
committee brazauskas told the 1100 delegates in a speech 
the 56yearold official stood on a stage in the sports palace 
in front of a huge banner bearing the yellow green and red stripes 
of the flag of lithuanias brief independence between world wars i 
and ii the flag was banned until this month 
brazauskas who was interrupted repeatedly by applause during 
his 20minute address met with mikhail s gorbachev last week and 
said the soviet president believes the lithuanian group can help 
perestroika gorbachevs plan to restructure society 
in his speech brazauskas expanded the list of reforms planned 
at the request of nationalist activists he said a nationalist 
monument in vilnius that was destroyed under soviet dictator josef 
stalin will be rebuilt 
victims of stalins repressions will be rehabilitated and they 
or their survivors compensated he said and all the blank 
spots in lithuanias history will be cleared up 
the soviet union took control of the independent baltic states 
in 1940 under a secret pact with nazi germany activists in all 
three republics are demanding that authorities renounce the pact 
in draft resolutions up for a vote over at the meeting the 
lithuanian group said the 1940 takeover was an unlawful 
occupation and that the republic reserves its right to withdraw 
from the soviet union 
groups in estonia and latvia have adopted similar resolutions 
but in several respects the lithuanian measures are more radical 
in its draft resolutions the movement says defense and foreign 
policy should be handled jointly by the republic and the kremlin 
it says lithuanians should have the right to perform compulsory 
military service in their republic and to set up their own 
diplomatic missions abroad 
the movement was formed in june and claims 180000 supporters 
among the republics 36 million people

president corazon aquino praised us 
officials saturday for indicting ferdinand marcos on racketeering 
charges and said that could deter dictators from robbing the people 
and seeking asylum abroad 
mrs aquino also said that former president marcos trial in the 
united states would hasten recovery of his hidden wealth 
billions of dollars her administration claims marcos obtained 
during his 20year rule 
marcos and his wife imelda who have lived in hawaii since he 
was ousted in february 1986 were indicted in new york friday on 
charges that could send them to jail for 20 years if found guilty 
they were charged along with eight associates 
the united states alleges that marcos and his wife embezzled at 
least 103 million in government funds including us aid and 
funneled the money to secret bank accounts in switzerland the 
united states and other countries 
the couple then allegedly used the money to buy valuable new 
york properties the indictment says 
this indictment is certainly welcome news in the philippines 
and i commend this evident commitment to the rule of law abroad 
mrs aquino said in a statement read by her press secretary 
teodoro benigno 
i hope that this and other similar efforts undertaken in other 
countries to investigate the crimes of the marcoses will lead to 
the early recovery of the stolen assets that rightfully belong to 
the filipino people the statement added 
significantly also the fact that the marcoses are being 
brought to justice will serve as a powerful deterrent to all those 
who believe themselves above the law and those who would abuse the 
public trust for private gain 
mrs aquinos government has accused the marcoses of stealing up 
to 10 billion in public and private assets during his rule and 
hiding the wealth in real estate shares of stock works of art 
jewelry and bank accounts around the world 
news reports on the indictment came too late for manilas 
newspapers saturday but most bannered reports from the previous day 
that the marcoses were about to be criminally charged 
political commentator belinda aquino no relation to the 
president said in a frontpage article in the philippine daily 
inquirer it was ironic that marcos was being prosecuted for 
violating us laws and not for crimes committed in the philippines 
but what does it matter she said the important thing is 
that the law has caught up with this rascal at last 
officials said marcos trial in the united states would delay 
his prosecution here even further but noted the us trial could 
result in the recovery of some of the illgotten wealth 
although it has repeatedly said it will file criminal charges 
against marcos the aquino government has not done so for fear 
marcos would insist on returning to defend himself the 
constitution forbids trial in absentia

federal authorities investigating the crash of 
a small plane near frederick md were looking saturday into 
whether the crash might be connected with the landing at about the 
same time of a jet carrying president reagan 
the wreckage of a single engine piper arrow that crashed friday 
evening was found in mountainous terrain west of frederick shortly 
after dawn saturday the pilot identified as ronald lee spring 
36 of fairfield pa was killed 
according to the national transportation safety board and the 
white house preliminary information from the federal aviation 
administration indicates the piper crashed about 20 minutes after 
the landing at frederick of a small gulfstream ii jet carrying the 
president 
the president and his wife nancy were bound for the 
presidential retreat at camp david and flew into nearby frederick 
airport because rain and fog prevented them from taking a 
helicopter directly to the retreat 
there was speculation that the arrival of the presidents plane 
might have caused the smaller plane to be ordered into a holding 
pattern until reagans plane landed 
alan pollock a spokesman for the ntsb said he had no 
preliminary information that the piper was ordered to hold off its 
landing but he said air traffic communications with the plane 
would be reviewed as part of the investigation 
we still have to check the information out pollock said 
maj robert ayres of the maryland wing of the civil air patrol 
said the piper had two to three hours of fuel left in its tanks 
when it crashed 
white house spokeswoman liz murphy said the presidents plane 
landed at frederick at 532 pm friday 
pollock said preliminary information from the faa showed that 
the piper was given clearance to land at 538 pm but that the 
plane disappeared from radar at 553 pm

throughout the 100th congress democrats struggled to pass a 
campaign spending limitations bill over republican opposition 
in the end they failed 
but the battle will be remembered 
at 130 am one day last march republicans fled the senate 
floor to prevent a quorum from being established and to force the 
democratic leadership to adjourn 
a call went out for the sergeantatarms to arrest absent 
senators 
sergeantatarms henry giugni used a master key to enter the 
private office of sen robert packwood rore 
packwood was arrested and escorted to the senate chamber 
but he refused to enter 
giugni ordered a squad of detectives to lift packwood from his 
feet and to carry him inside 
they did so and his presence gave the democrats a quorum and the 
republicans a severe case of outrage 
the senate remained in session all night

the senate worried about its quality of life 
younger senators especially those with children grumbled about 
legislative chaos sessions that stretched deep into the night 
roll calls that stretched far beyond their allotted 15 minutes a 
tuesdaythursday club that saw senators stretch a twoday 
weekend into four 
action was taken 
in exchange for time off every fourth week senators were 
expected to be present monday through friday for the rest of the 
month 
roll calls were restricted to 15 minutes with no waiting for 
senators who did not show up on time 
almost immediately the law of unintended consequences went into 
effect 
with the 15minute clock running a band of senators piled off 
elevators in the subway lobby of the hart senate office building 
the roofless threecar train was waiting 
but it was filled with visitors who happened to be blind 
it took a while for the senators to get possession of the train 
fuming they stormed onto the senate floor minutes after the 
roll call ended only to be told that they could not vote and would 
not be recorded 
now during roll calls the trains are reserved for the 
exclusive transportation of senators

senate oratory can get heated and at times just a little 
twisted 
as the 100th congress neared its end sen steve symms 
ridaho complained at length about the failure of congress to 
provide further military aid to the contras in nicaragua 
he said 
the gutless nogood 100th congress on this issue has decided 
to create its own doctrine and that is to write it off 
in other words we will write off freedom in nicaragua throw 
them to the alligators and hope the alligators will eat someone 
else and eat us last and they can peel off a slice of that salami 
and they will not bother us for now do not rock the boat

one of three trapped whales was presumed 
dead saturday but its companions inched toward open water as 
eskimos cut a string of breathing holes and a helicopter battering 
ram smashed a path through thick ice 
they certainly have a very good fighting chance in their 
battle to escape david withrow a federal marine mammal 
biologist said saturday 
however a huge ridge formed by colliding ice masses stood in 
the way of a breakthrough for the california gray whales members 
of an endangered species the big marine mammals were about four 
miles from open water 
a second icesmashing skycrane cargo helicopter was standing by 
two hours away in prudhoe bay in case rescuers decided a second 
concrete icebashing bullet was needed 
and at white house direction the air force assigned the largest 
aircraft in its inventory the c5a galaxy to ferry more 
equipment from prudhoe bay to barrow air force maj doug mccoy 
said saturday 
the whale nicknamed bone disappeared beneath the footthick ice 
friday afternoon by midnight friday rescuers on the ice near this 
small eskimo town on the arctic ocean had given up hope bone might 
rejoin the others 
north slope borough biologist geoff carroll said the whale was 
presumed dead 
everyone is sorry to hear about the whale but i dont think 
it was totally unexpected carroll said saturday he had told 
reporters earlier the whale was the weakest of the three and had 
some respiratory problems 
bone crossbeak and bonnet became trapped at a small breathing 
hole in unseasonably heavy ice more than two weeks ago during their 
annual migration south open water was too far away for them to 
reach it without surfacing to breathe 
the missing whale got its name because skin on its snout had 
been rubbed to the bone by the rough ice surrounding the breathing 
hole that condition may have led to bones death said biologist 
craig george 
once they get a bone infection they go pretty quick george 
said 
the whales body probably sank to the bottom but may float in a 
few days because of gases from decomposition george said well 
either find it or a polar bear will he said polar bears feed 
on whale carcasses 
something will have to be done about the ice ridge and soon if 
the remaining whales are to be freed said col tom carroll in 
charge of the alaska national guards two skycrane helicopters on 
loan for the rescue 
we looked for an alternate route bypassing the ridge and 
didnt find it he said if theres no way through it it will 
have to be tackled early while the whales still are some ways from 
it 
the ridge lies about a quartermile from an area of open water 
leading to the open sea 
the ridge was believed to be too thick to be punctured by the 
helicopters fiveton steelreinforced concrete hammers and local 
ice specialists were assessing the situation saturday said geoff 
carroll i think were going to blast he said 
bone disappeared about the same time rescuers had their greatest 
success 
about two dozen eskimo volunteers many of them bowhead whale 
hunters led the whales almost a halfmile closer to open water 
friday by using chain saws to carve a string of 10by30foot 
breathing holes they continued carving holes on saturday 
deicers which keep the holes open by agitating the water 
freed the eskimos to work on new holes 
after waiting so long for high tech equipment its the local 
people who have kind of taken over and made some progress 
carroll said 
the whales meanwhile were swimming from hole to hole 
apparently responding to efforts to lead them to open water 
biologists said 
their swimming patterns now are about what youd expect them 
to be said withrow who is from seattle 
biologists removed a deicing machine from the whales original 
hole late friday and started one of the machines in the most 
distant new hole they also shined a bright light in the farthest 
hole 
in a matter of minutes the whales popped up in that hole 
touching off a chorus of cheers from people on the ice 
rescuers shoveled snow and ice into the original hole friday 
evening in an effort to seal it and discourage the whales from 
returning but late friday they did just that nosing up through 
the slush 
thats ok morris said its just a little retrogression 
were in good shape 
the first huge ch54 skycrane helicopter loaned by the guard 
worked in the opposite direction from the eskimo crews working 
from the open water back toward the whales so as not to frighten 
the mammals 
the aircraft designed to haul heavy cargo used a concrete 
block suspended from its cargo hook to punch four 15 to 20foot 
holes in the ice at 75yard intervals 
they hover the helicopter 20 feet over the ice and drop the 
bullet said spec 4 wade palmer a guard spokesman it drops 
through the ice on the second or third try then they pull it back 
out 
the second skycrane abandoned the repeatedly frustrated effort 
to drag a 185ton icebreaking hoverbarge 230 miles from the 
oil fields at prudhoe bay 
the population of endangered california gray whales has risen to 
about 20000 growing at an annual average of 25 percent for the 
past decade officials said 
the whales spend their winters in the warm water off mexicos 
baja california and southern california and summer in the foodrich 
northern seas

a boxcar filled with radioactive waste 
was headed back to the rocky flats nuclear weapons plant in 
colorado on saturday three days after gov cecil andrus banned the 
temporary storage in idaho of any new shipments 
the boxcar full of lowlevel nuclear waste had been in limbo at 
a rail yard in the eastern idaho city of blackfoot the last stop 
before a temporary waste storage facility at the us department of 
energys idaho national engineering laboratory about 35 miles 
northwest of here 
it originated at the does rocky flats facility 16 miles 
northwest of denver but was stopped after andrus issued an order 
wednesday banning the storage of additional waste at the lab 
the boxcar will return to rocky flats and well probably just 
leave it on our siding until we get permission to ship it someplace 
else said charles bogard shift superintendent at rocky flats 
the boxcar left blackfoot midafternoon saturday an idaho state 
police officer and a union pacific railroad agent had kept an eye 
on the boxcar while it was in blackfoot it had been inspected for 
safety by an environmental engineer from the idaho national 
engineering laboratory 
lab spokeswoman penny phelps said the decision was made late 
friday by energy department officials in idaho colorado and 
washington 
primarily the decision was made to kind of clear the air and 
remove what we considered a contentious item mrs phelps said 
the move was delayed by the need to examine the potential impact 
of returning the waste to rocky flats she said its not as easy 
as turning your car around and driving back 
andrus issued the order in an effort to force the energy 
department to open the waste isolation pilot plant near carlsbad 
nm the nations first permanent repository for 
defensegenerated lowlevel nuclear waste 
more than 2 million cubic feet of lowlevel radioactive waste 
already is stored above ground at the idaho lab awaiting transfer 
to a permanent dump like the one in new mexico which was supposed 
to open this month but has been postponed until at least january 
they have broken their word too many times said andrus who 
traveled to the new mexico site last week they cannot give us a 
date 
hopefully the opening of the wipp facility will be the final 
solution rocky flats bogard said saturday we have about 90 
days capacity and space on the plant site thats available where we 
could safely store it 
the opening of the new mexico site was pushed back after doe 
engineers raised questions about the safety of the proposed 
repository there have also been delays in certifying the casks 
that will carry the waste to the site 
new mexico gov garrey carruthers said new mexico communities 
will object to opening the site until congress provides money for 
road bypasses and improvements on the route to the site 
the idaho governor won an assurance from don ofte manager of 
the idaho laboratory on friday that the doe will voluntarily abide 
by his ban on all further shipment of waste into idaho 
the bulk of the waste at the lab built up over two decades has 
come from the rocky flats plant other facilities also have been 
ordered to stop shipping waste to the lab 
andrus said a westbound truckload of waste from the argonne 
national laboratory in illinois was turned back at little america 
wyo after federal officials were notified it would be intercepted 
by state police at the idaho border 
meanwhile an oct 19 letter from sen tim wirth dcolo to 
energy secretary john herrington indicated the doe began assessing 
the storage situation only after andrus blockaded idaho 
wirth in his letter to herrington again pressed for a list of 
contingency plans to cope with the andrus ban declaring that in 
his state the situation has changed from urgent to critical 
wirth said deputy energy secretary joseph salgado had notified 
him wednesday afternoon shortly after andrus imposed the ban that 
he was pulling together an internal doe working group to assess 
the governors action

thousands of nicaraguans unfamiliar 
with hurricanes and jaded by repeated warnings of possible us 
invasions refused to flee hurricane joans deadly path saturday 
the hurricane with 125 mph winds destroyed about 90 percent of 
the buildings in the caribbean city of bluefields and slashed 
through the corn islands off the nicaraguan coast the two areas 
have a population of about 68000 
although thousands were evacuated thousands of others remained 
in their homes despite warnings president daniel ortega said in a 
speech broadcast on radio and television 
initial reports said 15 nicaraguans were killed saturday and the 
overall death toll from the storm that began ravaging the south and 
central american coasts last monday was at least 65 in nicaragua 
costa rica panama colombia and venezuela 
the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm but torrential rains 
continued and nicaraguan officials said they would order forced 
evacuations if need be as the storm struck managua 180 miles west 
of bluefields 
david zuniga director of civil defense angrily called for 
people to go to shelters 
sandinista police and the eps the army have orders to 
evacuate by force if necessary zuniga said on television 
some who refused to evacuate lowlying ground said they didnt 
believe the government which has on numerous occasions called on 
the people to mobilize against a us invasion 
the people were tired of these calls they dont believe 
them said ruben hernandez who refused to evacuate his home in 
the las torres neighborhood on the edge of lake managua 
the government has told us so many lies that we just dont 
believe them any more said a managua woman who spoke with the 
condition she not be identified 
others said people didnt realize what damage a hurricane could 
inflict the last hurricane to strike nicaragua was in 1911 
government radio repeatedly issued storm warnings 
ortega said during his address that he had visited bluefields on 
friday and urged people to leave 
i told the people to leave their homes because it is easier to 
rebuild your home than to reconstruct your life he said 
only a few thousand people left bluefields in a government 
evacuation program friday although others fled coastal zones 
authorities feared joans heavy rains could cause more flooding 
especially in managua which is relatively flat and poorly drained 
thousands of refugees from the sevenyear civil war with the 
ussupported rebels known as contras have moved into managuya 
swelling its population to 1 million many live in wooden shacks 
beside dirt fields 
civil defense committees piled sand bags in front of many 
buildings cut tree limbs that might be blown down and cleared 
drainage ditches windows of the eightstory hotel intercontinental

polls are illuminating an electorate in turmoil 
with voters still groping some of them dispiritedly toward a 
decision in the presidential election analysts say 
while surveys indicate a healthy george bush lead striking 
differences in gauging the size of the lead underline a certain 
unhappiness with the choices some pollsters said in recent days 
and that means things still can change with just over two weeks 
to go they said 
people are having lots of second thoughts said andrew 
kohut president of the gallup organization even in polls that 
have found stable results for weeks he said i term it stable 
uncertainty 
several pollsters but not all agreed with such an analysis 
that a good number of voters even at this late date remain 
loosely committed to either bush or to democrat michael dukakis 
and could change their minds 
i see more indecision than usual and i ascribe that a lot to 
the negativism of the campaign said ia lewis chief of polling 
for the los angeles times i think theres a kind of reluctance 
for people to commit themselves to one of two people neither of 
whom they like 
lewis in the times poll has found that four in 10 of dukakis 
supporters and nearly three in 10 of bushs oppose the other 
candidate more than they favor their own hardly an inspiring 
reason to cast a vote 
gallup has found less than half of each candidates supporters 
backing him strongly and a sizable share roughly three in 10 
saying they could change their minds and in an nbc newswall 
street journal poll 57 percent of likely voters wished they had a 
different set of choices 
neither of these guys seems to attract the kind of commitment 
that some other presidential candidates have had said larry 
hugick political pollster for gallup even though gallup has found 
a stable bush lead since august he said if you look at the 
depth of commitment youll see theres still potential for 
change 
the view of a stillvolatile electorate was not unanimous jeff 
alderman pollster for abc news saw a more stable contest his 
surveys like gallups biweekly ones have found a steady lead for 
bush and he has found considerably stronger support for the 
candidates than gallup has 
my polling doesnt show very much volatility at all said 
alderman who has polled every night since labor day theres a 
clear indication of a very stable race 
but not all polls are in line with each other 
an nbcjournal poll taken friday through sunday last weekend 
found an enormous 17point bush lead a harris poll friday to 
monday the same weekend put it down to nine points and an 
abcwashington post poll from the previous wednesday to tuesday put 
it at seven roughly where its been for weeks 
most recently a newsweek poll of 1013 registered voters 
conducted by telephone on thursday and friday showed bush leading 
dukakis 50 percent to 41 percent with a margin of error of 4 
percentage points 
nbc pollster laurily epstein said her poll could have caught a 
swing to bush after the presidential debate last week then missed 
some shifting back to dukakis on monday she noted that bush 
received wide publicity as the debate winner 
other pollsters shared her view noting that dukakis surged 
after the democratic convention last summer and bush after the 
republican convention but settled back as the publicity wore off 
their hypothesis when voters dont have strong opinions they 
are more likely to be influenced by events albeit momentarily 
polling immediately after momentous events catches people in 
the process of making up their minds what you see are these 
distortions said kohut the gallup president he likened it to a 
runners pulse after a race its an accurate reading but you 
cant generalize a lot from it 
kohut and others said such skittishness in the electorate 
magnifies the methodological differences in polls whether or not 
they urge undecided voters to make a choice for example and can 
help skew results

republican presidential nominee george bush picked up editorial 
endorsements saturday from newspapers in chicago new york and 
cleveland while democrat michael dukakis won endorsements from 
papers in atlanta st louis and dayton ohio 
the chicago tribune and the chicago suntimes each endorsed bush 
in their sunday editions though the tribune lamented the quality 
of the campaign and bushs choice of sen dan quayle rind as a 
running mate 
also endorsing bush in their sunday editions were the new york 
daily news which said there are more fitting candidates than he or 
dukakis but that none will be on the ballot and the plain 
dealer of cleveland 
in a time of peace and prosperity even a prosperity built on 
credit most voters dont want to take a chance the plain dealer 
said adding that voters know more about bush than dukakis 
the atlanta journal and the atlanta constitution said in their 
joint sunday editions dukakis would strike the newer course of 
the two candidates and has shown a far better grasp of the 
nation and its people 
the st louis postdispatch said in its sunday editions that 
dukakis has been more realistic than bush in addressing the 
trade and federal budget deficits and has set forth a humane and 
enlightened social policy 
dukakis also picked up an endorsement from the dayton daily news 
in ohio which said in its sunday editions that he has a keener 
intellect than george bush 
the chicago tribune called bushs campaign abysmal but said 
it favors him over dukakis because we agree more with what he 
says and fear less his leadership in the white house 
the suntimes said bush was its emphatic choice for 
president and called the republican probably the most experienced 
candidate ever to run for president

democrat michael dukakis defended his 
record on crime saturday in the south where his prospects have 
been hurt by george bushs allegations on the subject 
later in a taped speech on abctv the democratic presidential 
candidate accused bush of waging a campaign of fear and of 
smear 
at sunup saturday dukakis spoke at a crowded pipefitters union 
hall in beaumont accompanied by his running mate texas sen lloyd 
bentsen he capped the day by speaking backtoback with bush 
before the national italian american foundation in washington 
many of you know the vice presidents been going to a lot of 
ethnic festivals lately dukakis told the italian group 
george it would have saved you a lot of time if youd just 
picked pete domenici to be your running mate domenici a 
republican senator from new mexico is the son of italian 
immigrants 
dukakis who delivered part of his address in italian repeated 
many of the same selfdeprecating jokes that he delivered at the al 
smith dinner in new york two days earlier 
on a serious note he told the group the immigrants dream is 
the american dream it is now in our hands we must never forget 
that dream belongs not just to the privileged few but to all of 
us 
earlier dukakis visited hawkinsville ga for a barbecue rally 
with top georgia democrats in what was to be a show of solidarity 
in a major southern state where the campaign has been in trouble 
before some 4000 people at a rally in a high school football 
field in rural georgia dukakis was joined by former president 
jimmy carter and the states top elected democrats 
people say theres not a very good chance that well have a 
governor from massachusetts in the white house carter said 
but i think that we and you and mike dukakis and lloyd bentsen 
can turn it around 
sen sam nunn denounced bushs campaign as one of distortions 
and in many cases outright and total lies 
attacking bushs use of the case of furloughed inmate willie 
horton who attacked a family while released from a massachusetts 
prison nunn described in graphic detail the rape and murder of a 
pregnant young mother by an inmate furloughed from a federal prison 
under president reagan and said it was richard nixon who signed 
into law the federal furlough program 
a governor and a president cannot prevent all the horrible 
crimes we have today even though its on his watch nunn said 
a presidential candidate though can be expected to tell the 
truth and put it in perspective and vice president bush has a duty 
to do that 
the case of patsy pedrin is one dukakis is usuing in new 
television ads and which he spoke about earlier texas and louisiana 
while saying he would never use that kind of human tragedy 
for political purposes 
in both texas and georgia where he campaigned saturday and in 
louisiana where he was friday night dukakis trails bush in polls 
by as much as 10 points 
in his texas speech dukakis recounted the crimes of a prisoner 
released on furlough from a federal prison while bush was vice 
president 
i would never use that kind of human tragedy to accuse the 
president of being soft on crime dukakis said maybe thats 
the difference beteen me and george bush 
in his television speech which was set for 1055 pm edt on 
abc dukakis spoke of the beating and robbing of his father and the 
hitandrun death of his brother as examples of how my family has 
been touched by violence 
ive led the fight against crime and drugs in my own state and 
i intend to do so as president he said 
before the rally with state party leaders in georgia state 
democratic chairman john henry anderson said with this kind of 
show of support it sends a signal to the people of this state that

michael dukakis pressed his counterattack against frontrunner 
george bush on saturday blaming a bush campaign of fear and of 
smear for distorting his image to voters bush disavowed illinois 
gop ads asserting rapists and murderers vote for dukakis 
the two presidential candidates later capped their campaign days 
by making backtoback appearances before a national italian 
american foundation banquet in washington sharing a dais for the 
second time in three days 
dukakis repeated many of the same selfdeprecating jokes he had 
delivered when he and bush addressed the al smith dinner in new 
york earlier in the week but on a more serious note told the 
italian group the immigrants dream is the american dream it is 
now in our hands we must never forget that dream belongs not just 
to the privileged few but to all of us 
bush maintained a serious tone throughout his remarks recalling 
his emotions when he has witnessed immigrants take the oath of us 
citizenship 
i saw their tears of joy and felt their appreciation of the 
american dream bush told the crowd we share that joy tonight 
and we resolve together as americans to preserve and protect 
and indeed extend it in the years ahead 
in a tapedfortelevision speech dukakis touched on criticism 
of his campaign style in a race in which all polls show him 
trailing i may not wear my heart on my sleeve he said but he 
promised that in the remaining two weeks he would fight my heart 
out for the things i believe in 
his remarks came in a fiveminute speech his campaign paid to 
air on abctv at 1055 pm edt 
earlier dukakis and running mate lloyd bentsen campaigned in 
texas and dukakis joined state party officials in a show of 
solidarity in georgia two southern states where polls suggest 
bush has made headway by portraying the democrat as soft on crime 
dukakis took the issue on in his speech saying simply in 
their tv ads the republicans accuse me of being soft on criminals 
thats a lie 
bush in a brief appearance at his washington home dissociated 
himself from one printed ad along that line 
he was asked about brochures distributed by the state republican 
party in illinois with a headline saying all the murderers and 
rapists and drug pushers and child molesters in masschusetts vote 
for michael dukakis 
asked if he approved bush said no i dont and i dont back 
some of the stuff theyre saying about me no i disapprove of 
that he didnt say what he objected to on the democratic side 
bush was questioned after he met privately with former cuban 
prisoner armando valladares who was freed after 22 years in 1982 
on another matter bush was asked to comment on the racketeering 
indictment of former philippine president ferdinand marcos 
that speaks for itself and let the justice system go forward 
thats what i say he said 
bushs running mate dan quayle who was out of the public eye 
saturday said in an interview friday night that the two campaigns 
concentration on producing 15second sound bites for evening 
news shows wasnt so bad because oneliners say a lot 
the information is out there for voters to make their 
decisions he said 
dukakis televised speech was part of a concerted effort by the 
dukakis campaign to reach a wider audience 
he also is airing a tough new set of commercials accusing bush 
of distortions and lies and is planning a number of other 
television appearances including an interview tuesday on the abc 
show nightline 
bush has repeatedly criticized dukakis for a former 
massachusetts prisonerfurlough program under which an inmate 
failed to return after a weekend pass and later attacked a maryland 
couple 
dukakis in a speech saturday in beaumont texas recounted the 
crimes of a prisoner who raped and murdered a pregnant young mother 
after being released on furlough from a federal prison 
i would never use that kind of human tragedy to accuse the 
president of being soft on crime dukakis said maybe thats 
the difference between me and george bush 
national polls show bush leading dukakis by margins ranging from 
seven to 17 points and state polls show dukakis trailing in such 
key states as california texas and ohio that are critical to his 
hopes for victory on nov 8 
dukakis said in the taped tv speech that he enters the final two 
weeks of the campaign an underdog and that some of you dont know 
much more about me than a name and a set of labels 
part of the fault may rest with our own effort he said 
but i think it is also fair to say that the other side has 
pursued a campaign of distortion and distraction of fear and of 
smear 
he cited bush campaign ads attacking him for the massachusetts 
prison furlough program and for pollution in boston harbor 
are you satisifed with what you are hearing this year he 
asked do you think this is the way to pick the president of the 
united states 
it isnt easy for the truth to catch up with the lies he 
said and to clear up the fog of deception that has been spread 
across the campaign 
but i am determined to fight this fight 
i may not wear my heart on my sleeve but i hope tonight you 
have some sense of what is in my heart and in the remaining days 
of this campaign i intend to fight my heart out for the things 
that i believe in 
responding to the bush ads on crime he mentioned the beating 
and robbing of his father and the hitandrun death of his brother 
as examples of how my family has been touched by violence 
ive led the fight against crime and drugs in my own state and 
i intend to do so as president he said 
president reagan in his weekly radio address derided dukakis 
campaign slogan of good jobs at good wages contending it 
amounts to a slur against such hardworking americans as 
shortorder chefs 
in the democratic response senate majority leader robert c 
byrd of west virginia said we need a president who has a plan 
for making the trade deficit a trade surplus who is willing to 
make a real commitment to ending the policy of borrow and debt that 
has put us into a sea of red ink

does not approve of campaign literature that republicans in 
illinois distributed saying democrat michael dukakis is supported 
by rapists murderers and other criminals 
no i dont and i dont back some of the stuff theyre saying 
about me no i disapprove of that bush said without 
elaborating on what in particular he was taking exception to on the 
democratic side 
he made the statement in answer to a question following a 
meeting saturday with former cuban political prisoner armando 
valladares who was freed after 22 years in 1982 
bush called the cuban who wrote the book against all hope 
an inspiration to all who are for human rights 
at a banquet saturday night sponsored by the national italian 
american foundation bush and dukakis shared a dais for the second 
time in three days 
they shook hands briefly and both applauded politely as the 
other was introduced before the dinner bush met briefly with 
former italian prime minister bettino craxi 
in brief remarks the vice president recalled his emotions when 
he has witnessed immigrants take the oath of us citizenship 
i saw their tears of joy and felt their appreciation of the 
american dream bush told the crowd of 3000 attending the 
dinner we share that joy tonight and we resolve together as 
americans to preserve and protect and indeed extend it in the 
years ahead 
bushs campaign also announced the formation of catholics for 
bushquayle 88 to be headed by former gop cabinet members william 
simon and william bennett rep henry hyde rill and 
conservative activist phyllis schlafly 
in general the vice president was spending a quiet weekend 
mostly out of the campaign spotlight he planned to head to new 
england on monday then begin an extended campaign trip across the 
country 
on another matter raised by questioners outside his residence 
saturday bush responded briefly when asked for a comment on the 
racketeering indictment of former philippine president ferdinand 
marcos 
that speaks for itself and let the justice system go forward 
thats what i say said bush 
the indictment returned friday in new york alleges marcos and 
his wife imelda defrauded three us lending institutions of 165 
million in order to buy and finance real estate in new york and 
amassed 103 million through embezzlement bribes and kickbacks 
then laundered the money through secret bank accounts 
bush said little about the presidential campaign except in 
answer to a question about the illinois brochures 
distributed by the state party they bore the headline all 
the murderers and rapists and drug pushers and child molesters in 
masschusetts vote for michael dukakis 
bush has consistently sought to portray dukakis as soft on 
crime citing in particular massachusetts former prisonerfurlough 
program 
dukakis held up the illinois brochures in campaign appearances 
wednesday and called them political garbage

lengthy legal process that is likely to include several rounds of 
plea bargaining with the justice department 
even if marcos and the government dont work out a deal that 
would spare both sides the expense of a trial it could easily be a 
year or more before marcos would face a jury 
federal prosecutors allege marcos embezzled more than 100 
million from the philippine government and used the money to buy 
three buildings in new york city the main charge carries a maximum 
prison sentence of 20 years 
as part of what they promise will be a vigorous defense marcos 
lawyers will embark on an extensive legal process of pretrial 
discovery that is likely to involve a demand for a massive review 
of administration records for any documents suggesting marcos was 
offered assurances he wouldnt be prosecuted if he came to this

the multibilliondollar takeover deals surfacing 
almost every day make it clear that practically any company no 
matter how large can now be bought with borrowed money 
but this craze of debtfinanced buyouts and other types of 
restructuring while often rewarding stockholders with windfall 
profits also raise a number of troubling questions such as where 
is all the money coming from how will it affect the economy and 
what happens if the money cannot be repaid 
many critics believe the stupendous movement of money and 
rapidly rising debt loads associated with these transactions 
reflect nearsighted values that continue to grip corporate america 
and wall street despite the lessons of speculative excesses 
learned from the stock crash a year ago 
critics also blame the reagan era of deregulation lax 
enforcement of antitrust laws and to some extent the stock crash 
itself which cut the price of many publicly held companies and 
made them attractive targets 
all of these elements have lured staggering sums of investor 
cash from pension managers to foreign banks into the hands of 
dealmaking strategists who promise a quick return 
money the ability to get money when you need it in these 
huge amounts is critical to all thats happening said kathryn 
rudie harrigan professor of strategic management at columbia 
business school in new york 
more conservative use of this money she said doesnt look 
attractive when youre in a shortterm world we cant wait that 
long weve got to have instant pudding 
by some estimates the amount of money available to finance 
leveraged buyouts or lbos in which a buyer borrows to acquire a 
company and repays the debt with the companys earnings cash flow 
or assets totaled less than 100 million in 1980 now it totals 
at least 250 billion 
contrary to popular belief most of this money does not come 
from the fortunes of the rich much of it comes indirectly from 
the pension funds of millions of american workers and retirees 
federal reserve board statistics show that the assets in these 
funds alone totaled nearly 2 trillion last year 
the money also comes from foreign lenders notably japanese 
banks the worlds richest even some of the most conservative us 
banks and wall street firms which once shied away from lbos as 
laden with uncertainty are now joining in with hundreds of 
millions in their own capital 
its really staggering the amount of money out there that can 
be focused in any area said chriss street managing director of 
seidler amdec securities inc a los angeles investment firm 
i think its a sign of greed more than anything he said 
money always tends to drive in the rearview mirror it follows 
track records right now the track records of people involved in 
lbos are staggering 
dealmaking firms that specialize in lbos such as kohlberg 
kravis roberts amp co have enjoyed spectacular success giving 
their own investors and clients returns of 30 percent or more a 
year 
compare that with 125 percent so far this year in the stock 
market roughly 8 percent for a 1year treasury bill 75 percent 
in a money market mutual fund and less in a standard savings 
account 
kohlberg completed the biggest lbo on record two years ago a 
61 billion deal that took food conglomerate beatrice cos private 
but the definition of how big an lbo can get was rewritten this 
past week when the management of tobaccofood giant rjrnabisco 
said it was considering a 17 billion lbo which would be the 
biggest corporate takeover ever 
this gargantuan proposal came only three days after philip 
morris launched an 114 billion takeover bid for kraft inc and 
only a few weeks after british conglomerate grand metropolitan plc 
offered 52 billion for pillsbury co 
the common message in these undertakings many securities 
professionals said was that any company can be a takeover target 
they once said that just because everest wasnt climbed 
doesnt mean it couldnt be street said my gut feeling is 
youve got probably a couple of years before the real megadeals 
will come to the fore 
charles m laloggia editor of special situations report a 
respected market newsletter based in rochester ny said ill 
bet by the end of the year something happens that even dwarfs this 
rjr deal 
by far the biggest worry about this frenzy of dealmaking is its 
effect on the economy aside from the upheaval on millions of 
affected workers and managers there is an increasing fear that 
lborestructured companies have too much debt and could default if 
interest rates rise even slightly 
if our current economic picture should change if we should 
go into a recession the consequences for these lbos are not 
good james van horne a stanford business school professor 
wrote in a recent edition of the schools magazine they are 
financed with 90 percent debt or more allowing almost no margin of 
error or cushion 
the concern has been heightened recently because these 
debtfinanced takeovers are growing at the waning stages of an 
economic recovery cycle that is now nearly 6 years old 
when you want to be leveraged the most is when youre 
bottoming out and on the way up said laloggia who predicts the 
relentless pace of lbos could lead to another financial crisis like 
the crash last year 
i dont see where bankers or businessmen no matter how 
sophisticated they are are less susceptible to the herd 
instinct he said theyre going to have to pay the piper a 
year or two down the line in hindsight its going to be 
incredible how bad their judgment was

the latest outbreak of buyout fever on wall 
street has unsettled the corporate bond market and analysts say it 
may prompt more corporate borrowers to offer some buyer protection 
when selling new bonds 
in the past week two of the biggest buyouts in history have 
been suggested philip morris companies inc proposed an 114 
billion takeover of kraft inc and rjr nabisco inc said its 
management is considering taking the company private in a 176 
billion deal 
that kind of talk is bad news for those holding a buyers bonds 
because chances are the buyer will take on a lot more debt to 
accomplish the deal 
suddenly the company that looked so solid when it sold the bonds 
that individual and institutional investors now hold in their 
portfolios doesnt look like such a great credit risk anymore 
news of the latest potential buyouts sent prices reeling and 
yields higher on billions of dollars in debt from philip morris and 
rjr nabisco 
dealers said the price of long bonds from rjr for instance 
tumbled about 14 points or 140 for every 1000 in face value 
after word of the possible buyout reached the market as prices of 
its bonds fell their yields rocketed nearly two percentage points 
to about 119 percent 
but the announcements had a broader impact putting downward 
pressure on corporate bond prices generally as speculation flared 
about which other companies could be next analysts said 
thats a big difference between this and earlier buyout waves 
said ronald morse senior vice president in charge of corporate and 
government bond trading at dean witter reynolds inc 
morse said recent buyouts of a number of retailing firms mainly 
affected only the bond prices of the companies involved 
the opinion going into 1988 was that there are some companies 
that are just too big to be put into play and their debt securities 
were safe from event risk the event being a takeover or leveraged 
buyout he said 
but he said the latest buyout wave has substantially destroyed 
this article of faith 
as a result he said this past weeks developments made some 
investors wonder about the chances that the companies whose bonds 
they hold may become involved in a similar situation either as 
aggressor or target 
james ednie corporate vice president and senior industrial bond 
trader at drexel burnham lambert inc said another reason for the 
decline in corporate bond prices is that some big investors such as 
pension funds are required to invest only in securities carrying 
the higher credit ratings 
when it appears a company may face a ratings downgrade he said 
these bondholders often scramble to sell those securities and 
reinvest in highergrade issues such as treasury or utility bonds 
one of the most common realities in leveraged buyouts is that 
they tend to turn doublea and singlea credits into new credits of 
less than investment grade ednie said 
the two major debt ratings agencies standard amp poors corp and 
moodys investors service said that they were monitoring philip 
morris and rjr to see if a reduction in rating is warranted 
dean witters morse said one likely impact of merger mania will 
be that those who buy bonds will demand greater assurance from the 
issuer that they will be able to sell their bonds for a fair price 
if the issuer later decides for whatever reason to load up on more 
debt 
morse said some companies have attached socalled poisonput 
options to their bond issues giving bondholders the right to sell 
the bonds back to the issuer at specified terms if the issuer 
becomes involved in a buyout 
corporate managements generally dont like such provisions 
because it limits their ability to make moves without incurring a 
sizeable liability to buy back outstanding debt 
but morse said since the notion that some deals are too big to 
be done has been called into question companies may find they must 
offer some protection to find ready buyers for their debt

the takeoverbuyout mania now sweeping through 
corporate america has some wall streeters applauding and others 
shaking their heads 
the fans of these multibilliondollar deals say they are 
powerful medicine for a stock market still struggling to recover 
from the crash of 1987 
in the absence of buying by individuals and many institutional 
money managers they ask where would the stock market be today 
without the leveragedbuyout specialists and the traders known as 
arbitragers who follow in their wake 
whats more they say takeovers and buyouts are a longterm 
plus for the market because they reduce the supply of stock in the 
marketplace giving an upward bias to the prices of the shares that 
remain available 
but more skeptical observers while acknowledging some of those 
points argue that all this wheeling and dealing is contributing 
huge new amounts to an already dangerous accumulation of debt in 
the us economy 
and the activity it generates in the market they say 
represents unhealthy speculation rather than stable longterm 
investment 
the mergers and acquisitions binge is nothing new of course 
takeovers and buyouts were a dominant force in the 198287 bull 
market 
a similar phenomenon occurred in the 1960s when 
conglomeratebuilding was the financial rage 
lately however the game has been played on an expanded scale 
in the past week alone philip morris proposed an 114 billion 
offer for kraft and rjr nabsico said it was considering a 176 
billion management buyout plan 
if such deals can be done analysts say there appears to be 
virtually no limit to what might be attempted in the future no 
company too big to be ruled out as a takeover or buyout candidate 
that prospect helped propel stock prices higher in the past 
week the dow jones average of 30 industrials rose 5032 to 
218350 hitting its highest levels since the crash of 87 as the 
first anniversary of that debacle passed 
the new york stock exchange composite index gained 396 to 
15942 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
added 400 to 38859 and the american stock exchange market value 
index was up 352 at 30607 
volume on the big board averaged 17063 million shares a day up 
from 14705 million the week before 
the shortterm rewards to selling shareholders in the form of 
capital gains are indisputable analysts at wright investors 
service in bridgeport conn observed in a recent appraisal of the 
mergersandacquisitions craze 
but the longerterm effects of takeovers are less healthy for 
the economy and for equity investors generally 
excessive debtleveraging of corporate assets makes companies 
more vulnerable in the event of a recession the report said 
in fact there is the potential that defaults arising from 
high debt service requirements for companies with reduced cash 
flows will even aggravate the economys troubles when the next 
recession comes 
although industry consolidations and restructurings may often 
be useful for strengthening the competitive edge in global markets 
the transformation of billions of dollars of equity into debt is 
eroding the financial footings of us industry 
market volatility and instability have increased as a result 
of the takeover wave with the effect of driving many individual 
investors out of the stock market for years to come if not for 
good it said 
wright noted that the greatest takeover wave in history was a 
basic cause of the stock market decline last october the collapse 
was as severe as it was precisely because the takeover wave had 
pushed stock prices to artificially high levels the report said 
for that reason alone wright concluded one should find 
little comfort in the continuing high level of takeover activity

one year after black monday the question of which government 
agency should oversee the financial futures markets remains 
unresolved a fact highlighted this past week at a gathering of 
futures industry leaders and regulators in chicago 
a number of other crashrelated issues also overhang the 
nations futures and options exchanges but none arouses a more 
emotional response among futures industry leaders than the control 
question especially among officials of the chicago mercantile 
exchange and the chicago board of trade the worlds largest 
futures exchanges 
futures and options trading is regulated by the 14yearold 
commodities and futures trading commission trading of stocks and 
bonds is regulated by the securities and exchange commission set 
up in 1934 as part of the new deal 
despite the undeniable link between the stock market and 
stockindex futures which can be used for either hedging stock 
positions or speculating on stockmarket movements the chicago 
exchanges have strongly opposed postcrash proposals that one 
agency should regulate both markets 
instead they have argued for the creation of an agency that 
would coordinate sharing of trading information among all the 
financial markets 
sec chairman david ruder asked congress in january to enlarge 
his agencys jurisdiction to give it direct regulatory 
authority over stockindex futures and any new futures contracts 
related to stocks 
in chicago on thursday ruder took a more lenient stance saying 
postcrash efforts to better coordinate the activities of the sec 
the cftc and the markets were working satisfactorily 
nonetheless ruder said in a speech to the economic club of 
chicago i continue to believe that in the long term there needs 
to be an ability to look beyond the parochial concerns of each of 
the separate stock and futures markets in the long run unified 
jurisdiction over these increasingly linked and unified markets 
will prove to be desirable 
earlier in the day while sitting on a discussion panel with 
cftc chairwoman wendy gramm and four futures industry leaders 
ruder was even more conciliatory on the issue saying that 
contrary to many press reports i do not regard that as a very 
serious matter 
chicago merc president william brodsky who also sat on the 
panel expressed his position bluntly i dont think you need a 
single regulator to create cooperation 
ms gramm a reagan appointee who has been in office less than 
eight months did not comment on the control issue but focused 
instead on the likelihood of increased regulation of futures 
trading under a michael dukakis administration 
dukakis is a democrat and most of the bills introduced in 
congress in the past year proposing greater regulation of the 
futures markets were sponsored by democrats 
but ms gramm said she expected republican vice president george 
bush to win the november election the big question she said was 
whether bush would be willing to veto any futuresrelated 
legislation backed by a congress likely to be dominated by 
democrats 
the issue of regulatory jurisdiction over financial futures 
could come to a head next year when congress must vote on 
reauthorizing the cftc for another four years by law the agency 
dies next year unless reauthorized by congress

chevron usa citing increased 
competition and reduced profit announced plans friday to cut the 
workforce at its largest refinery by about 400 jobs 
company officials said a portion of the jobs will be eliminated 
through attrition and early retirement 
the 4000acre plant was purchased by the chevron subsidiary in 
1984 from gulf oil corp and employs more than 2200 people 
chevron usa has announced plans to streamline the refinery 
operations and the organization here to make the refinery more 
competitive and not only to make it more competitive but to 
assure its continued operation said company spokesman art 
spencer 
the exact number of layoffs will not be known until company 
officials meet with union leaders to discuss the changes he said 
but chevron plans to operate the plant with about 400 fewer 
employees 
any announcement involving a reduction in manpower is 
difficult but this has come as something of a relief to many of 
our port arthur business people because it means that chevron has 
decided to keep the plant open spencer said 
a company task force had presented four options to improve 
refining operation profits including the possibility of shutting 
down the plant or reducing the workforce by more than half 
spencer sasid 
this was the best of the task force alternatives he said 
its a relief that we did not have to go to the big numbers 
the changes were prompted in part by continuing volatility in 
the energy industry he said 
it relates to the extremely competitive market in which this 
refinery functions spencer said 
this gulf coast region is the most competitive petroleum 
products market in the united states he said we have not been 
competitive in this market for a long time 
smaller chevron refining operations in pascagoula miss and el 
paso have proven more profitable he said 
the port arthur refinery is the largest owned by chevron with 
an operating capacity off 407000 barrels of crude per day after 
streamlining which is expected to begin immediately ready 
capacity will be about 329000 barrels per day spencer said 
weve never run 400000 barrels a day here he said 
a renewed marketing strategy calls for the refinery to place a 
greater emphasis on the production of petrochemicals premium 
unleaded gasoline and lubricating base oils spencer said the 
plant is one of few along the gulf coast with its own packaging 
facilities 
the company plans to complete the cutbacks by the end of the 
first quarter 1989 spencer said 
the port arthur refinery first opened in 1901 and has undergone 
numerous renovations including a 600million improvement project 
in 1980 he said

the stock markets bestknown indicator edged up to its highest 
level of the year while bond prices lost ground and oil futures 
prices slipped 
consumer prices meanwhile posted their smallest gain in three 
months with a 03 percent advance in september the government 
reported friday 
on wall street stock prices finished mostly higher lifting the 
dow jones average of 30 industrials by 231 points to 218350 
it was the third 1988 high this week as the bluechip indicator 
scored a net gain for the week of 5032 points 
bond prices moved lower however the treasurys 30year bond 
lost nearly 5 for every 1000 in face value pushing its yield 
toward 89 percent 
in the oil futures market prices edged lower as traders awaited 
word from two committees of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries that were meeting for a second day to discuss the 
cartels overproduction 
the increase in the labor departments consumer price index 
meant consumer prices were rising at a moderate annual rate of 41 
percent last month down from an annual rate of 52 percent in 
august 
the most recent inflation report triggered an automatic 40 
percent costofliving increase for the nations 384 million 
social security recipients the second highest boost in the last 6 
years 
the increase which will increase the average retired workers 
pension by 21 a month will show up in january 
economists who had been worried about a new inflationary spiral 
fueled by tight labor markets and droughtdriven food increases 
said the price slowdown in september was an encouraging sign 
the september price report should allay a lot of the 
inflationary fears that were in financial markets the past few 
months said david bassett an economist with the wefa group an 
economic consulting firm in bala cynwyd pa 
for the first nine months of the year inflation has been rising 
at an annual rate of 45 percent little changed from the 44 
percent increase for all of 1987 
the 03 percent overall rise in consumer prices in september was 
down slightly from increases of 04 percent in july and august as 
gasoline prices fell by 17 percent the biggest decline since 
february 
however food prices climbed 08 percent and clothing costs shot 
up 22 percent these two components accounted for 70 percent of 
the september price increase 
in another government report the labor department said 
americans average weekly earnings after adjusting for inflation 
rose a seasonally adjusted 05 percent in september after falling 
a sharp 13 percent in august the worst drop in four years 
the september increase stemmed from a rise in the number of 
hours worked and in the earnings per hour which more than offset 
the increase in consumer prices

earlier this week the november contract for wti which expired on 
thursday dropped 60 cents on tuesday soared 79 cents on wednesday 
and then tumbled 80 cents in its final day 
oil futures have traveled a rocky road in recent weeks because

output

million barrels a day although current production is estimated at 
close to 21 million barrels a day

news story came out the market would make a big move said jim 
fiedler a trader with edampf man international futures inc 
the markets headlinedriven he said 
refined products traded on the mercantile exchange were mixed 
the november contract for home heating oil slipped 035 cent to 
close at 4271 cents a gallon
