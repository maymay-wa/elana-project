a sheriff who came out against semiautomatic 
weapons found his fears borne out only hours later when a gunman cut 
a bloody path through his district killing two people and wounding 
three including two deputies 
during thursdays rampage by a man wielding a semiautomatic 
mac11 machine pistol arapahoe county sheriff pat sullivan again 
lashed out at the sale of such weapons 
our officers are outgunned by these weapons of war these guns 
are designed to kill and maim people he said 
he held up a bloodstained revolver one of his deputies had used 
against thursdays suspect and said the deputy was totally 
outgunned 
sullivan said the mac11 can hold 32 rounds and fire 10 times 
faster than the standard 38caliber pistol issued to all deputy 
sheriffs 
deputies said 20yearold eugene thompson jr went on a 12hour 
rampage in which he abducted a woman killed her and her 
motherinlaw raped another woman shot two police officers shot a 
hostage in the back and then killed himself thursday ending 12 
hours of terror 
in his position paper issued wednesday sullivan said i am a 
western coloradan who enjoys big game hunting and i dont want to 
see anything that would hurt sport hunting but we have to do 
something about these weapons of war 
sullivan said laws should be tightened to control who can buy 
such weapons and if they cant be controlled he urged the colorado 
legislature to pass a law to ban their sale 
in his paper sullivan cited the january shooting in stockton 
calif in which five children were killed and 29 children and a 
school teacher were wounded by a man carrying a copy of the 
chinesemade ak47 semiautomatic rifle 
this tragic event has stimulated city county state and 
federal legislative efforts to control or ban these weapons of 
war sullivan said 
the california assembly has approved a ban on 40 types of 
assaulttype weapons and similar bills are pending in other states 
the bush administration temporarily has banned the import of 
semiautomatic assault rifles 
sullivans paper said that although the constitution gives 
citizens the right to import manufacture sell and possess 
semiautomatic weapons there is also a burden to place some 
reasonable controls on these weapons of war without abridging the 
sportsmans right to legitimate sporting rifles 
i do not propose their absolute ban but simply to bring them 
under the same or similar controls as machine guns silencers 
sawedoff rifles sawedoff shotguns antitank guns bazookas 
mortars and caneguns he said 
included in his list of weapons to be restricted are the mac10 
and mac11 the gun used in thursdays attacks 
sullivan said recent raids in arapahoe county have netted a fully 
automatic ak47 a fully automatic mac10 with a silencer an ar15 
and a semiautomatic shotgun

the mayor of a brussels suburb who 
ordered three roger somville frescoes to be painted over because she 
found them too glaring has asked the belgian artist to restore them 
for free 
the frescoes in the offices and restaurant of the 
watermaalbosvoorde city hall were covered over with paper and 
painted over last week when somville was in barcelona opening a 
retrospective show of his art to much acclaim 
mayor andree payfas view of somvilles work stirred widespread 
protests on wednesday she changed her mind and suggested somville 
could return the works to their former glory free of charge 
but earlier somville called payfas decision a crime pure 
lunacy 
and even if the covering is removed payfa still wants to put the 
frescoes behind curtains 
the harsh greens yellows and blues made it difficult for her 
staff to work normally she said

on march 26 1979 israel and egypt signed a 
historic peace treaty to try to break the cycle of middle east wars 
for egypt it has meant better produce in the shops but also a 
feeling of mistrust here is the second of two reports 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
egypt and israel have been on speaking terms 
for a decade but its the relationship of nextdoor neighbors who 
keep a wary eye on each other 
egypt is whole again on the maps under the peace treaty signed 
march 26 1979 israel returned most of the sinai in 1982 15 years 
after capturing in the 1967 war 
it completed the turnover last week by delivering taba a tiny 
beach enclave on the gulf of aqaba 
oil wells in sinai and the gulf of suez developed under israeli 
occupation pump money into egypt the united states which under 
president jimmy carter sponsored the first peace between arab and 
jew provides more than 2 billion a year in aid 
even the arab diplomatic boycott caused by the treaty has ended 
except for libya syria and lebanon 
there will be no celebration of the 10th anniversary however 
for the average egyptian there is little to show for the 
governments cool friendship with israel except juicier grapes 
redder strawberries and fatter cucumbers in the market 
peace is so important to the israelis and arabs president 
hosni mubarak said after the red black and white egyptian flag rose 
over taba for the first time in 22 years it is worth whatever 
concession 
he called for mutual flexibility to solve the remaining problem 
which has led to four arabisraeli wars the future of the 
palestinians 
butros ghali minister of state for foreign affairs said taba 
could be the key solving the taba problem peacefully opens 
the door to joint action to solve the palestinian problem 
by terms like flexibility and joint action egyptian officials 
mean israel should change its policy negotiate with the palestine 
liberation organization and give back arab territories occupied 
since 1967 
egyptians tend to mistrust israel because of the four wars and 
many years of regarding it as the eternal enemy ghali once 
characterized the relationship as cold peace 
many israeli tourists visit egypt but few egyptians go the other 
way the government discourages trips to israel and some prosperous 
egyptians say it is too expensive 
also egyptians generally sympathize with the palestinians 
especially since the uprising against israeli occupation began in 
the west bank and gaza strip more than 15 months ago 
israel often asks egypt to use friendlier language and fully 
implement treaty provisions designed to improve relations through 
trade tourism and cultural exchanges 
experts on both sides say agricultural technology is about the 
only field in which cooperation flourishes 
hany abdelnour whose company sells irrigation systems that 
involve israeli innovations said the advantage of working with 
israel is that our climatic conditions are similar 
most of his clients are former expatriate workers home from arab 
oil states with money to invest 
they are broadminded and ready to accept new techniques 
abdelnour said some people had reservations at the beginning 
but after a while their misgivings vanished 
another businessman who uses israeli technology is a former 
ranking army officer who fought in the 1967 war was captured and 
spent eight months as an prisoner of war 
the officer who requested anonymity grows grapes with israeli 
knowhow and equipment 
this has no relation to war he said my brother was killed 
in the war so my hard feelings should be double but i still take 
technology from them 
his family is less pragmatic the former officer said his wife 
refuses to socialize with his israeli colleagues 
four years after president anwar sadat went to jerusalem and two 
after he signed the peace treaty moslem extremists assassinated him 
in 1981 
sadats campaign to win over egyptians included repeated promises 
of prosperity for a people shackled with spending billions on war 
early in the peace decade billboards depicted a longstemmed red 
rose with a slogan assuring citizens of a happy future now the 
bloom is off the rose 
i was against the whole peace move said ahmed a young 
agriculture graduate i wasnt fooled that the treaty would bring 
prosperity you can see there is no prosperity quite the contrary 
rising inflation aggravated by mismanagement corruption and 
lower prices for oil exports has disappointed many egyptians and 
dashed much of sadats dream although none of it can be blamed on 
the treaty 
taba will be a test for both sides 
egyptian and israeli employees will work together in large 
numbers for the first time at a resort hotel egypt bought from its 
israeli owner 
i dont know how itll be working with egypt cook alice 
zerber said on the day the egyptians took over i dont know 
whether ill accept taking orders from them 
egyptian law requires that 90 percent of a companys employees be 
egyptian but when and or how that will be implemented at taba is 
unclear 
about 20 waiters and cooks sent from cairo arrived minutes after 
the 326room hotel became egyptian and filed into the poolside 
dining room to take instructions from their israeli counterparts

if the academy award race for supporting actor 
goes according to form the winner would be alec guinness for 
little dorrit or so the experts say 
after all the reasoning goes for the past three years the award 
has gone to veterans who have amassed an impressive body of work 
don ameche cocoon 1985 michael caine hannah and her 
sisters 1986 sean connery the untouchables 1987 
the trouble is that academy award voters dont always follow 
tradition and some of them may have had trouble sitting through the 
six hours of little dorrit 
the britishmade film is based on charles dickens last often 
overlooked novel guinness oscar winner as best actor for the 
bridge on the river kwai in 1957 was cast as william dorrit 
longtime resident of debtors prison 
the character itself i found fascinating said the 
74yearold actor in a magazine interview because in many ways 
its unsympathetic feckless and foolish you know youd like to 
kick him and yet at the same time there is a sympathy for him 
because of the social situation at that time being chucked into 
prison for 20odd years for debt 
but oscar voters other veterans for whom to vote first theres 
martin landau nominated for tucker the man and his dream for 
30 years he has been contributing solid performances in films such 
as north by northwest cleopatra and nevada smith though 
he is best known as the master of disguises in the original tv 
series mission impossible 
francis coppola gave landau the role of his life as abe karatz 
financial adviser to car builder preston tucker of coppola landau 
54 remarks like all the good ones he lets you go he hires you 
thats a vote of confidence francis really creates a background for 
you the more you bring the happier he is 
landau is a director of the actors studio in hollywood and he 
prepared for the role with customary thoroughness once an 
illustrator for the new york daily news he drew portraits of abe 
and analyzed him as a lonely new york businessman who really has 
no family no friends and no life outside work 
then theres dean stockwell nominated as the outrageous mafia 
don in married to the mob hes been in films for 46 of his 52 
years the son of singer harry stockwell dean was a child actor in 
such films as anchors aweigh gentlemans agreement and 
the boy with the green hair 
his career since then has been a roller coaster obscurity after 
his childstar days success as a young man in compulsion 
sons and lovers and other films descent into hippiedom during 
the 1960s he tried to return to acting after cleaning up his act 
but found jobs scarce thinking his career over he and wife joy 
moved to santa fe nm suddenly producers were sending for him 
stockwell credits director jonathan demme for taking a chance on 
him in married to the mob he remarked no one had ever 
thought of me for this type of role its a romantic comedy and i 
play a charismatic guy who chases after women and people are afraid 
of and its charming and funny prior to that everyone always 
thought of me as this serious actor who plays psychotics and 
neurotics and sensitive people 
kevin kline won his nomination as the madcap but vicious 
underworld type in a fish called wanda known for his flamboyant 
roles in the theater kline 41 has created a series of indelible 
performances on the screen as meryl streeps erratic lover in 
sophies choice the college reunion host in the big chill 
the swashbuckling buccaneer in the pirates of penzance 
the actor believes that his screen potential hasnt been reached 
ive done tons of roles on the stage that i havent even 
approached on the screen i see my film career as wide open id 
like to do serious dramas love stories actionadventures 
comedies no one has pigeonholed me yet and i hope to keep it that 
way 
the youngest nominee is 18yearold river phoenix named for his 
running on empty role as the son of political activists on the 
run from the fbi phoenix has established himself as one of the 
screens best young actors in such films as stand by me the 
mosquito coast and little nikita 
as part of a freethinking family that was repeatedly on the 
move phoenix had a similar childhood to the one he portrays in 
running on empty he believes that his peripatetic upbringing 
was good training for acting 
i think it helps you become versatile in adapting to new 
situations new atmospheres new people just as you do when you go 
from film to film he said it also gives you an insight on 
different forms of life and different perspectives

while solidarity seeks agreement with 
authorities at roundtable talks the small but noisy confederation 
for an independent poland has stepped up street protests in a drive 
for followers to fight communism 
shouts of kpn the groups initials in polish can be heard 
at most demonstrations these days its banners painted with a black 
anchor the symbol of the polish resistance during world war ii 
often appear in the front ranks of marches even those called by 
other groups 
strikes and demonstrations awaken peoples emotions and they 
become enthusiastic said zygmunt lenyk the kpn leader in krakow 
its easier to awaken the enthusiasm of people who strike and 
demonstrate than among those who sit 
lenyks tiny krakow apartment serves as the headquarters for a 
determined core of young activists dedicated to publicizing the name 
of the organization even though it is illegal 
kpn is the largest and most active of a range of smaller 
opposition groups that reject cooperation with the government and 
criticize solidarity on grounds that it is too moderate 
the groups which also include fighting solidarity and the banned 
polish socialist party have become more active in recent months and 
appear to be trying to coordinate activities through joint meetings 
of the selfstyled antisystem opposition 
during a recent national kpn congress a small brigade of young 
people covered city walls with black anchors until they ran out of 
paint while more than 200 of their elders debated the 
organizations future strategy 
if we want to be a civilized country we must liquidate 
socialism lenyk said we have to become a parliamentary 
country and we want to liquidate communism 
socialism and communism often are used interchangeably 
kpns straightforward strategy has begun to win new sympathizers 
many of whom once belonged to solidarity 
but kpn is far from becoming a movement on the scale of 
solidarity which as a labor union claimed 10 million members in 
1981 kpn claims an active membership of 1600 and 1000 more in 
youth organizations 
kpn was founded by the historian leszek moczulski on sept 1 
1979 the 40th anniversary of hitlers invasion of poland 
supporters say they are attracted by the clarity of kpns call for 
polands independence from communist authorities and the soviet 
union 
though the group claims to favor a peaceful path to independence 
young members of kpn often wear military caps and pants and shirts 
made of camouflage fabric and have thrown stones at police in 
protests they say such action is taken only in selfdefense 
the organizations militarism and staunch anticommunism has 
resulted in a rift between kpn and solidarity leaders who are now 
seeking change by talking with polish government officials 
kpn fighting solidarity and other independence groups are 
treated by us as rival organizations said zbigniew bujak head of 
the warsaw region of solidarity 
but kpn appeals to those who favor fighting communists rather 
than supporting a strategy of negotiating changes with authorities 
i was always engaged in the fight for a free poland solidarity 
is a trade union so now im going with kpn said henryk holfeier 
a retired economist and former solidarity member who joined kpn a 
year ago 
i was attracted to a program with very decisive and clear 
goals said maria grcor a psychologist and editor of opinia 
krakowska a bimonthly underground publication solidaritys goals 
are clear but they are too few and too small 
grcor is also a former solidarity member 
kpns ultimate goal is full independence for a democratic free 
poland she said solidarity is a bridge to this goal and our 
interests are linked together 
while solidarity defends the right of independent groups to 
exist the union leadership has kept its distance from kpn 
maintaining it intends only to be a trade union 
kpns main activity is street protests 
street demonstrations break down the barrier of fear and 
encourage the belief that people can do something said grcow 
our main goal is for the group to become a mass organization that 
will have an influence on society kpn has attracted strong 
support among students especially in krakow where university 
students allied with kpn founded a new group they call the student 
organization 
the historic center of this southern city has been the scene 
recently of several violent clashes between young people and police 
and kpn has been represented at almost every demonstration

miss america gretchen elizabeth 
carlson is midway through her reign but only one event so far has 
been less than enjoyable for the 22yearold selfdescribed 
overachiever from minnesota 
she said miss america pageant officials had set her up as the 
victim on a bloopers and blunders television show an episode 
that forced her to adlib a description of a complicated satellite 
dish 
it was the perfect joke for me an attempt to make me look 
stupid she said thats my biggest pet peeve making me look 
stupid 
her most memorable occasion so far was meeting president reagan 
in the oval office 
he reminded me exactly of my grandfather i wanted to hug 
him she said 
as she discussed her reign at its halfway point the anoka 
minn resident shivered and explained she is recovering from a 
cold she was deliberately keeping a quiet schedule wednesday until 
a salvation army luncheon where she had to play the violin 
such performances are a part of many functions giving miss 
carlson the opportunity to show off the talent that won her the 
crown 
i wouldnt mind if the pageant got away from the crown she 
said yes it makes you immediately recognizable but thats not 
the point id rather have people know me from the inside rather 
than the outside 
during the past six months she has visited schools conventions 
nursing homes ribbon cuttings state pageants and endless events on 
behalf of the pageant sponsors 
on a typical evening she irons her outfit for the next day and 
writes back to admiring young girls and women who have asked for her 
photograph 
after her reign miss carlson intends to complete her senior year 
at stanford university she wants to go to law school and to become 
a very successful corporate executive 
she added however that she doesnt consider herself a celebrity 
i like the term role model she said the more 
approachable i am the better

a 250yearold ban on dancing during easter 
may finally become a thing of the past authorities acknowledge the 
law sends few norwegians to church for solemn prayer so many are 
on the slopes 
every easter holiday norwegians abandon their cities and close 
their shops jamming up mountain roads and ski trails 
few actually go to church 
the dancing ban made law in 1965 stems from strict 1735 decrees 
by the lutheran evangelical state church that limit public 
entertainment and sports events on religious holidays said peter 
selaeg of the ministry of church and education 
but he added the rules get a little confusing and may be 
relaxed when the government finishes reviewing them next spring 
almost everything but church services and skiing is banned on 
good friday and easter sunday dancing is allowed saturday until 9 
pm though municipalities are empowered to override the rules or 
make them stricter 
similar blue laws and entertainment bans exist on good friday and 
easter in finland where the lutheran church also is an arm of the 
state 
norways staterun liquor stores are closed until tuesday but 
restaurants can still serve alcohol over parts of the long weekend 
at certain times its possible to buy a drink at a discotheque 
though customers must keep their feet under the tables and off the 
dance floor 
the central bureau of statistics says 878 percent of norwegians 
belong to the state church in a recent newspaper survey however 
143 percent of those asked said they would consider attending an 
easter church service 
about 75 percent of the 604 norwegians surveyed said they no 
longer consider easter a religious holiday and would rather go 
skiing said the oslo newspaper aftenposten 
some norwegians say easter has become more like a viking spring 
festival than a christian ritual 
the easter holiday has been five days long since the 1700s but 
many norwegians now begin the traditional exodus to the mountains 
the weekend before drawing on their vacation time 
the statistics bureau says its a myth that cities are totally 
abandoned only 25 percent of the population is on vacation 
said a bureau official however the figure does not include people 
merely gone for the weekend he added 
with more than 1 million of their 42 million residents skiing in 
the mountains relaxing in cabins by the fjords or flying off to 
sunny lands a strange calm engulfs norways largest cities during 
the last workdays before the holiday 
city traffic jams disappear chronic parking shortages become 
parking space gluts skeleton office crews explain that nothing can 
be done because its easter 
among the few people left working by wednesday afternoon were red 
cross personnel foreign businessmen and thieves police say easter 
brings a wave of burglaries as thousands of people leave their 
homes vacant 
the red cross 8000 volunteers with blood hounds helicopters 
and other equipment staff 280 mountain posts to help skiers who get 
lost exhausted or swept up in avalanches 
for those left in the cities the red cross published a list of 
cafes and places of holiday entertainment 
a city emptied by easter can intensify the loneliness and 
isolation felt by those left in the lowlands said a red cross 
statement

house republicans gave new status to their most 
ardent democratbasher by electing newt gingrich as their no 2 
leader but they also put him on the firing line with the democrats 
loaded up 
i think it is manna from heaven said house majority whip 
tony coelho dcalif who said democrats would remind voters of the 
many controversial stands such as support for social security cuts 
that the rightwing georgia lawmaker has taken over the years 
were no longer talking about someone who is just another 
member of the republican party coelho said 
gingrich emerged from a closed meeting of house republicans on 
wednesday with an 8785 victory over edward madigan of illinois in 
the race to become house minority whip the post made vacant when 
dick cheney became secretary of defense 
his was a victory for those republicans who after 34 years of 
minority status in the house want more confrontation with the 
democrats the gop now holds just 174 of the 435 house seats 
gingrich filed the complaint last year that launched an ethics 
committee investigation into house speaker jim wright dtexas and 
that was only the most notable salvo in a career of using television 
and the house rules to agitate against the majority party 
after the vote gingrich insisted he also could work with the 
democrats as one would expect in his new leadership role if they 
give him a chance he walked across the aisle in the house chamber 
that divides the two parties and shook democratic hands 
i will be fair with anyone who will be fair with me he told 
reporters but ill be ruthless on corruption he said 
insisting that he wont give up his fight against wright 
democrats said they hoped gingrich was sincere about focusing on 
the votecounting and other legislative tasks of the whip and would 
leave behind his longstanding tactics of disruption but they were 
skeptical and wasted no time serving notice that gingrich will feel 
the political heat 
one of the prices on leadership is a certain moderation 
sometimes learning that is a costly lesson said rep john 
dingell dmich the chairman of the house energy and commerce 
committee 
rep bill alexander dark took to the house floor to confront 
gingrich 
gingrich had made his name with a personal attack on the 
good name of jim wright alexander said because of allegations 
surrounding the speakers book publishing royalties 
now questions are being raised this week about gingrichs 
financial arrangements surrounding a 1984 publishing deal of his own 
i think he should answer for all of the members of this house 
and for all of the american people who have observed this action 
alexander said 
wright himself made the same point but with subtly in the 
unusual way in which he congratulated gingrich 
the speaker sent gingrich a copy of his book reflections of a 
public man and inscribed it 
for newt who likes books too congratulations and if you 
think a twovote victory is thin try it sometime with one as i had 
to settle for in 76 to be chosen by your peers is a great honor 
wright said referring to his first leadership race 
wright signed and dated the inscription and decorated it with a 
sketch of himself bushy eyebrows and all wielding a gavel overhead 
while gingrich telephoned coelho and house majority leader thomas 
s foley in a spirit of conciliation after the vote he didnt call 
wright and wright didnt call him 
gingrich also made clear that his spirit of conciliation was 
limited and not in the mold of bob michel the republican leader 
all too often in the republican party and in the news media 
bipartisanship means republicans have to be passive and 
surrender while democrats and liberals get what they want thats 
nonsense he said 
with that kind of aggressive stance gingrich could well be a 
unifying factor for the democrats 
rep richard durbin dill said if republicans were looking for 
legislative accomplishments they would have picked madigan the 
deputy whip and widely respected master of the legislative process 
they really missed the bet he said 
gingrich was fully predictable in his tactics he said 
maybe hes trying to wear the robe of a statesman but i dont 
think thats going to work he said 
many democrats said they didnt expect gingrich to be much of a 
problem either way

pregnant women should be warned that smoking 
marijuana may stunt the growth of their unborn babies and even a 
single joint results in prolonged fetal exposure to the drug 
researchers reported today 
this study documents that marijuana during pregnancy is 
associated with poor fetal growth said dr barry zuckerman who 
directed the study 
the research based on 1226 patients at a pregnancy clinic at 
boston city hospital found that women who smoked pot produced 
babies who averaged three ounces lighter and twotenths of an inch 
shorter than nonusers newborns 
zuckerman said the study underscores the belief that the effects 
of bad habits during pregnancy add up while one may have a small 
impact on the baby several together can significantly harm the 
childs growth 
for instance his study suggests that a woman who gains only 10 
pounds during pregnancy smokes a pack of cigarettes a day and uses 
marijuana and cocaine will produce a baby who is 15 ounces smaller 
than normal 
it definitely supports the case that marijuana has an effect on 
the fetus said coryl jones a research psychologist at the 
national institute on drug abuse in bethesda md 
the study also confirmed earlier reports showing that cocaine 
users also produce unusually small babies 
zuckermans study differs from earlier research which has not 
shown a clear association between pot and fetal growth those 
studies were based solely on mothers admissions of drug use 
his work conducted with researchers from boston university 
school of medicine and published in the new england journal of 
medicine used urine tests to document whether pregnant women were 
taking drugs 
the babies of drugusing women experience a double jeopardy 
said zuckerman they experience biological vulnerability during 
pregnancy from these drugs and after birth they are more likely 
to experience abuse and neglect because of their parents use of 
drugs they catch it both ways 
the researchers speculated that the active chemical in marijuana 
may somehow slow fetal growth since the drug can remain in the 
bloodstream for a month the study said a single episode of 
marijuana use will lead to prolonged exposure of the fetus to the 
drug 
marijuana also raises carbon monoxide levels and cuts the amount 
of oxygen that reaches the fetus although cigarette smoking does 
the same thing the damage from marijuana may be greater because pot 
users take bigger puffs and hold in the smoke longer 
twentyseven percent of the women said in interviews or showed on 
urine tests that they had used marijuana while 18 percent had used 
cocaine when only urine test results were considered 16 percent 
showed signs of marijuana and 9 percent of cocaine the researchers 
said those who had drugs in their urine may have been the heaviest 
users 
the researchers compared the babies of mothers with positive 
urine tests to those of women who had negative tests and also denied 
drug use those who used cocaine produced babies who were slightly 
smaller than the marijuana mothers and their babies also had 
unusually small heads 
the women studied were largely poor blacks and hispanics 
however zuckerman said their drug use may not have been much 
different from that of young pregnant women elsewhere 
a nationwide study in 1985 found that 31 percent of women in 
their late teens and early 20s said they had used marijuana during 
the previous year

federal officials and environmental groups are 
calling for stronger laws to control toxic air pollutants in light 
of a government report showing that at least 24 billion pounds of 
deadly chemicals are released into the air each year 
the magnitude of this problem far exceeds our worst fears 
declared rep henry waxman dcalif after he made a report public 
wednesday that provided the first nationwide glimpse into the volume 
of toxic pollutants released by chemical plants and other industrial 
sources 
the report covered 328 chemicals or chemical groups including 60 
agents the government has identified as causing cancer among the 
chemicals are phosgene used as a nerve gas in world war i and 
methyl isocyanate which killed more than 2000 people in bhopal 
india in 1984 
spokesmen for the chemical industry which accounted for about a 
third of the total volume of toxic pollutants cited in the report 
said it is misleading to link the raw figures to health risk because 
they do not take into account actual exposure or concentration 
they said the emissions are legal and take place within the 
restrictions of various state and federal permits 
anyone who says that there is a national health crisis based on 
these numbers is wrong to use those numbers is misleading 
insisted jeffrey van chief spokesman for the chemical manufacturers 
association 
waxman chairman of the house subcommittee on health and 
environment acknowledged that the raw figures do not provide a 
clear picture of the health impact because we dont really know 
how much of which pollutants individuals are actually breathing 
many of the chemicals on the list however have been linked to 
cancer birth defects reproductive dysfunctions neurological 
disorders and genetic mutations the congressman said 
the report was compiled by the environmental protection agency 
based on information from industry while the figures which 
reflected emissions from manufacturing facilities in 1987 were 
called staggering by some congressmen environmentalists and 
government officials suggested they represent only a fraction 
perhaps no more than onethird of the toxic substances that 
actually leak into the air 
the emission totals are based on reports only from large chemical 
manufacturers and others with emissions of at least 75000 pounds a 
year it does not include smaller polluters such as service 
stations dry cleaners and petroleum tank farms 
but waxman and other congressmen said they hoped the preliminary 
government figures even though they may not present the entire 
picture will provide fuel for enactment of strong air quality 
legislation that includes provisions for regulating toxic air 
pollutants how to deal with toxic emissions will be a focus of 
debate when congress rewrites the clean air act later this year 
environmentalists also called for stronger legislation to deal 
with toxic emissions and donald clay the epas top air quality 
official told reporters some other approach is needed to deal 
with toxic air pollution 
clay said the epa has been hamstrung because the law requires the 
agency to act on each chemical separately a time consuming and 
expensive process when each action may face legal challenge 
the idea of going down 320 separate rules is just too 
cumbersome he said 
clay said the report showed higher emissions than he had expected 
its a big number i think its a health problem that needs to 
be addressed he said 
only seven of the substances included in the report are now 
regulated by the epa although a separate agency the occupational 
safety and health administration has set standards within the 
workplace for more than 400 toxics including many on the list 
the national wildlife federation called on congress to enact 
legislation that would direct the epa to establish healthbased 
standards for all of the listed toxic pollutants conduct emission 
audits and require polluters to put into place the best available 
emission control technology within five years 
of the 24 billion pounds of toxic emissions the chemical 
industry accounted for 8865 million pounds followed by the primary 
metals paper transportation rubberplastics and fabricated metals 
industries each of which accounted for more than 100000 pounds 
texas led the nation with 2299 million pounds of toxic 
emissions followed by louisiana tennessee virginia ohio 
michigan indiana and illinois all with more than 100 million pounds 
during 1987

if youre a north dakota barley farmer a texas 
sheep producer or a north carolina tobacco grower the agriculture 
department has some reasons for keeping an eye on saudi arabia 
scores of other agricultural and food processing operations also 
are involved in the growing saudi arabian market says john a 
williams us agricultural trade officer in jeddah 
over the last five years saudi food imports averaged nearly 5 
billion annually up from 15 billion in 1977 williams says the 
growth has been fueled by the presence of thousands of european 
and us expatriates and elaborate consumer food subsidies 
financed by saudi arabias oil wealth 
an influx of immigrant workers in the mid1970s dramatically 
changed saudi consumer spending patterns williams writes in the 
april issue of agexporter magazine 
in 1987 saudi arabia which has a population of about 11 
million imported about 70 percent of its food tops in value were 
barley live sheep tobacco milk poultry meat rice spices 
canned vegetables fruit juices fresh vegetables sugar and corn 
more than 10 percent of the agricultural imports are from the 
united states making saudi arabia the top cash customer in the 
middle east for us farm products 
consumer subsidies are used to distribute national income 
derived almost entirely from petroleum williams said 
in 1987 oil accounted for 92 percent of saudi arabias total 
exports of 25 billion total imports were put at 19 billion 
including 45 billion worth of agricultural products the us 
share was about 486 million 
williams said the foreign influence has been felt deeply and has 
helped change saudi foodbuying customs and diets 
the saudi population rarely eats out he said the usual 
practice is to have parties at home even so with a population of 4 
million foreigners the number and variety of restaurants have 
increased over the past few years 
besides many european lebanese chinese and other ethnic 
cuisines fastfood places serving hamburgers fruit juice chicken 
pizza and sandwiches are becoming more widespread 
competition for the thriving saudi food business is also growing 
with us interests vying with european asian and south american 
suppliers 
the european economic community in particular places a high 
priority on expanding sales of farm products to saudi arabia 
williams said it has used aggressive market development 
activities and a regular flow of trade delegations to widen its lead 
over the united states in this market 
saudi arabia the worlds leading barley importer has been the 
target of fierce competition among the eec australia canada and 
the united states in 1987 the united states captured a third of 
the saudi barley market with the help of subsidized sales under the 
departments export enhancement program

the agriculture department says private 
exporters have sold china an additional 400000 metric tons of us 
wheat at subsidized prices 
melvin e sims general sales manager for the departments 
foreign agricultural service said wednesday the wheat was part of 2 
million tons authorized feb 27 for china under the export 
enhancement program or eep 
under eep arrangements private exporters can sell us 
commodities at reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition 
in selected overseas markets and then collect free government 
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses or subsidies 
the latest sale boosted the amount of wheat sold to china for 
198889 delivery under eep to about 82 million tons 
sims said the latest sales were handled by cargill inc 195000 
tons louis dreyfus corp 50000 bartlett and co 30000 
ferruzzi usa inc 85000 and richco grain ltd 40000 
the wheat was sold for shipment in may and will carry an average 
subsidy rate of 1994 per ton or about 54 cents a bushel he said 
slightly more than 12 million tons are still available under the 
current authorization 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of wheat the 400000 tons would be about 147 million bushels and 
at recent prices of about 416 per bushel would have a farm value 
of around 61 million

a trade association representing banks is 
accusing the bush administration of overkill in proposing civil 
fines up to 1 million a day for institutions that recklessly 
violate regulatory rules 
ed yingling of the american bankers association said the fines 
would be wholly disproportionate and would inhibit the ability 
of banks and savings institutions to attract quality managers and 
directors 
we must guard against an overreaction that may harm innocent 
parties and fundamental rights yingling said in testimony 
prepared for delivery today to the house judiciary subcommittee on 
criminal justice 
bush is proposing a top fine of 25000 a day for most violations 
but up to 1 million if the violation was made with reckless 
disregard for the safety of the institution yingling said the 
maximum penalty should be set at 2500 
he was appearing before the panel one day after the general 
accounting office congress investigative agency told the 
subcommittee that it had examined 26 insolvent savings and loans in 
eight states and found evidence of fraud or abusive insider dealing 
in each 
meanwhile at a hearing wednesday of a house banking 
subcommittee joe d whitley acting associate attorney general 
urged congress to maintain stiff penalties as a deterrent to 
financial fraud 
because most bankers are honorable people one might think that 
modest sanctions are all that is required to enforce compliance with 
our laws a slap on the wrist is all that a gentleman requires 
whitley said the flaw in this rationale is that it is not the 
honorable bankers who have caused the massive problems we face 
today 
gao officials said the pattern of fraud and abuse among failed 
thrifts clearly is pervasive 
the bulk of the losses are directly attributable to the failure 
by management of a minority of the industry to follow basic prudent 
business practices assistant gao comptroller general frederick 
wolf said he did not name the 26 sampls it examined 
the justice subcommittees chairman rep charles e schumer 
dny complained that of the 11000 sampl cases the federal home 
loan bank board has referred to the justice department in the last 
two years for criminal prosecution fewer than 200 have resulted in 
convictions 
whitley told the banking subcommittee that financial institution 
cases have overloaded the criminal justice system a survey of fbi 
field offices showed more than 8000 pending cases half of them 
involving losses of 100000 or more 
bush is proposing spending 50 million a year on discovering and 
prosecuting fraud at banks and sampls the money would pay for 760 
investigators auditors attorneys and support staff whitley said 
rep doug barnard dga chairman of the examination task force 
of the house banking committee warned of increasing shortages of 
experienced examiners he noted that the creation of a 
multiagency sampl task force with more than 1200 examiners has left 
the federal deposit insurance corp which regulates commercial 
banks several hundred examiners under strength 
comptroller of the currency robert l clarke whose agency 
regulates nationallychartered banks told barnard that he is having 
trouble hiring and retaining experienced examiners nearly 30 
percent of the examination force consists of examiners with on 
average less than 3 years experience he said in a plea for 
authority to offer higher salaries 
in another development federal reserve board chairman alan 
greenspan said his agency is working closely with the treasury 
department to develop a plan to handle the billions of dollars in 
real estate the government will inherit from failed sampls 
but greenspan who would be a member of the oversight board of 
the government entity set up to dispose of the real estate declined 
to provide details of the plan to a house banking subcommittee 
some members of congress are worried that government dumping 
of sampl property at fire sale prices will ruin regional real 
estate markets particularly in the southwest 
treasury and white house officials are considering a proposal 
developed by rt mcnamar a california investment banker and a 
former deputy treasury secretary that would spend state and federal 
money to hold onto foreclosed real estate for as long as 10 or 15 
years

housing secretary jack kemp says congressional 
inaction to create tax incentives is holding up designation of 
federal enterprise zones 
president bush is in favor of it its in the budget kemp is 
in favor of it its now up to congress to move he said wednesday 
after his appearance before the house banking finance and urban 
affairs subcommitte on economic stabilization 
in this case were not looking for an appropriation were 
looking for a tax change i dont want to make any announcements 
of zones until theres actually a tax change kemp said 
lets not pass a bill that simply authorizes a zone but doesnt do 
anything to put a dramatic change in that entrepreneurial climate 
kemp said reduction or abolishment of capital gains taxes 
sameyear tax deduction on up to 100000 worth of investment and 
credits on employee income taxes for individuals and businesses 
located in the zones were needed 
neither the house nor senate tax committees has held or scheduled 
hearings to consider the proposed changes 
the department of housing and urban development received 270 
applications for the designation before the january 17 deadline 
thirtyseven states and the district of columbia have enacted local 
enterprise zone programs 
the housing and community development act of 1987 as amended by 
the mckinney homeless assistance act of 1988 authorizes the hud 
secretary to designate up to 100 federal enterprise zones onethird 
of which must be located in rural areas 
the zones are expected to encourage economic development and 
employment in previously depressed areas through tax incentives and 
reductions improvements in public services reductions in 
government bureaucracy and involvement of public and private 
agencies to provide jobs and job training 
but a december 1988 study by the general accounting office the 
investigative arm of congress found the program in maryland did 
not stimulate local economic growth as measured by employment or 
strongly influence most employers decisions about business 
location 
gao said the maryland program was similar to many of the federal 
programs that had been proposed since 1980 when thenrepublican 
congressman kemp and rep robert garcia dny first initiated 
legislation 
i just dont want to go through another eight years of getting 
these gao studies of some zone some place that shows that nobody 
started a business because there were no incentives said kemp 
whether successful or not the program wont cost anything 
kemp said 
but gao estimated more than 1 billion in lost tax revenues 
during the first three years of a program that involved 75 zones and 
475 billion during the first six years of operation the bush 1990 
budget estimates 105 billion in lost revenues over a fouryear 
period

when a hospital computer catches a virus the 
results can be hazardous to patients health a doctor says 
in a letter in todays new england journal of medicine a 
radiologist described what happened when computers used for 
analyzing patients nuclear scans were infected with two computer 
viruses 
computer viruses are devious pieces of computer code that move 
from machine to machine often reproduce themselves and sometimes 
make computers sick 
although this time the infection was cured without lasting harm 
dr jack e juni said potential damage was serious 
the information on these machines was the actual scans we were 
using to make diagnoses he said in an interview if the data 
had been lost it would have affected the diagnoses of patients 
one of the viruses was relatively benign making copies of itself 
while leaving other information in the computer alone however the 
other virus inserted itself into programs and directories of patient 
information and made the machines malfunction 
juni of william beaumont hospitals in royal oak mich said 
about threequarters of the programs stored in two macintosh ii 
personal computers were infected 
he said he did not know the origin of the less harmful virus but 
the more serious one apparently was on the hard disk of one of the 
computers when the hospital had bought it a hard disk is the 
internal device used by computers to store programs and data the 
virus spread from one computer to another when a doctor used a word 
processing program on both machines while writing a medical paper 
juni said the virus caused occasional random malfunctions 
sometimes the computers would freeze up or garble patients names 
the hospital had backup copies of patient records and eventually 
purged the viruses from the computers it has since instituted 
precautions in an effort to keep out viruses 
juni said the virus was on a hard disk manufactured by cms 
enhancements of tustin calif 
cms spokesman ted james said a virus was inadvertently put on 600 
hard disks last october the virus had contaminated a program used 
to prepare the hard disks for use it apparently got into the 
companys plant on a hard disk that had been returned for servicing 
james said that of the 600 virustainted disks 200 were shipped 
t dealers and four were sold to customers 
however he said the virus was as harmless as its possible to 
be it inserted a small piece of extra computer code on hard disks 
but did not reproduce or tamper with other material on the disk he 
said he did not think junis problems were caused by that virus

to renaissance artist leonardo da vinci and to 
many christians since then jesus christs last supper was a 
formal seated gathering at a rectangular table 
but scholars at a bible research center say diners in christs 
era more likely reclined on floor cushions for festive meals as the 
romans did in that day 
they also speculate that judas contrary to popular belief may 
have had a place of honor at the last gathering of christ and his 
apostles 
religious art normally pictures the period of the artist not 
the period of the bible said jim fleming of the biblical 
resources study center with apologies to da vinci things 
probably looked different 
during the last supper commemorated thursday by most of the 
worlds christians christ broke bread and blessed wine with his 
closest disciples hours before he was turned over by judas to roman 
soldiers and crucified 
relying on bible verses ancient jewish writings and roman 
historical works fleming and his associates have concluded that the 
last supper probably was served at a low ushaped table that the 
romans called a triclinium 
straw mattresses generally were placed around the outside and 
guests ate and sometimes slept at the same place fleming said 
the 45yearold useducated bible scholar who has done research 
in israel for 15 years noted the early greek versions of the new 
testament describe last supper participants as reclining 
he said the greek words anekaito and anepesen used in 
matthew mark and luke were often translated as sat but 
actually mean reclined 
fleming agrees with other scholars that christs last supper may 
have been a passover dinner held by jews then as now to commemorate 
the exodus from egypt rabbis of the day urged followers to recline 
at this meal in the style of the romans who ruled the holy land in 
that era fleming said 
today christian pilgrims visit the cenacle a building on mount 
zion in jerusalem where tradition has it the last supper was held 
flemings group has built a pilgrims center on the southern edge 
of jerusalem where visitors can share a passover feast while 
reclining around a stone triclinium 
the menu which is as close as the center can get to a passover 
meal in christs day typically includes roast lamb unleavened 
bread wine baked eggs nuts and fruits such as grapes and figs 
in artistic renderings of the last supper judas generally is 
seated at one end of the dining table the guy without the halo 
said fleming 
but the biblical study center can cite verses from the gospels of 
matthew mark luke and john that indicate judas was very close to 
christ probably to his immediate left 
the most convincing is in the gospel of mark which alludes to 
the practice of sharing food from a common bowl 
when the apostle john at christs right asked who would betray 
him christ answered it is one of the 12 one who is dipping 
bread into the dish with me 
christ likely would have shared the bowl with only one or two 
people fleming said 
in the end what were really trying to do is give people a 
better understanding of the bible of the world of christ he 
said these are just clues that may help

yves saint laurent closed the winter readytowear 
collections with a pithy statement of elegance his show wednesday 
was short and to the point with beautiful nononsense daytime wear 
and a burst of colorful folklore for evening 
this classic couturier no longer has to invent anything as he 
has done it all but his unmistakably saint laurent silhouette and 
color palette made good sense for women who want to look chic and 
sexy 
tailoring was easy emphasizing softness though the inimitable 
saint laurent sleeves under padded shoulders still gave shape to the 
outfits 
at the end of the show saint laurent looked pale and 
hunchedover his smile somewhat pained as he walked out and took a 
bow kissing a model who wore a smooth and plain black jersey gown 
spokesmen for the designer say he is suffering only from fatigue 
the short kneerevealing or longer skirts were both split 
modified versions of saint laurents theme last season he wisely 
carries over ideas from his more expensive couture looks 
translating them into clothes many more women can afford in 
readytowear 
the fluid charcoal or oxford gray capes over knickers or wrap 
skirts worn with nailheadstudded belts kicked off the show and 
set the relaxed tone 
lots of pants and wrapped skirt suits were in caviar tweeds gray

the head of nbc entertainment said the 
network would boost the quality of its programming next season 
because of viewer and advertiser concerns over the content of shows 
such as nightingales 
when we set the fall schedule we can upgrade the quality 
of nbc by carefully choosing what shows return and what prospective 
new shows we select brandon tartikoff said wednesday 
weve beefed up broadcast standards we are sensitive to 
changing audience tastes 
the executive spoke at a preview for advertisers and advertising 
agencies of 32 prospective new programs for next season the new 
offerings will include the return of mash star alan alda in a 
onehour dramatic series and a comedy created and produced by mel 
brooks 
tartikoff said nbc was concerned about the content issue of 
its shows and the restlessness on the part of advertisers 
affiliates and the audience 
he did not name any specific program but nightingales has 
been criticized by nursing groups that claim it demeans the 
profession by showing scantily clad nurses chrysler corp and 
sears roebuck amp co said they would stop advertising on the show 
because of such complaints 
tartikoff acknowledged some advertisers had withdrawn from the 
show but he said such pullouts were common and the show was doing 
well 
anytime you push the boundaries of what is acceptable youre 
going to find that you sometimes push too far tartikoff told 
reporters 
next seasons prospective new offerings were highlighted by the 
return after a sixyear absence of alda who played hawkeye pierce 
and won five emmys in 11 years on the smash comedy mash 
i havent been tempted to get back into television until now 
said alda the actor will be involved in the creation and writing of 
the show but he declined to say what it would be about except to 
say well be very proud of it were very up about it 
tartikoff said the show probably would not debut until the middle 
of the 198990 season 
the prospective programming continues to place a heavy emphasis 
on comedy which has been largely responsible for making nbc no 1 
in the ac nielsen co ratings 
brooks will create and produce a series called the nuthouse 
about a new york hotel starring harvey korman and cloris leachman 
rodney dangerfield will have cameo roles in young rodney 
about a boy whose idol is the comic 
also among the shows previewed 
jack warden mason adams and hope lange will star in knight 
and daye a comedy about two feuding former radio partners forced 
to reunite after a long separation 
ann jillian will star as a widow and mother of a teenage girl 
who moves from new york to california to start a new life 
robert mitchum will play a homeless former merchant seaman who 
becomes a surrogate grandfather for four newly orphaned children in 
one mans family

president bush says religious faith and family 
togetherness are the best antidotes to the drug threat in america 
during visits in pennsylvania with amish and mennonite leaders 
and young people bush wove much of his philosophy about proper 
lifestyles into discussions surrounding drug abuse 
the president listened sympathetically wednesday as mennonite 
leader elmer burkholder wondered aloud whether his 4yearold son 
would be able to say no to maintain his values 
bush who traveled to southeastern pennsylvania as part of his 
antidrug campaign called the religious and traditionminded amish 
and mennonites of the area a shining example of what family and 
faith can do 
bush reiterated his contention that prayer should be restored in 
public schools he also said that while we want to preserve 
freedom of expression he believes much of todays popular music 
has really bad lyrics 
sitting around a table in a classroom of an old simple onestory 
amish school the president listened as his hosts talked of the 
increasing pressures brought to bear on young people 
the amish and mennonite leaders told bush that their relative 
success in childrearing came from their deeprooted family and 
religious values 
bush marveled at how they had kept drugs away from their 
doorsteps he told the amish and mennonite leaders to keep the 
moral underpinnings of your community and hopefully others will see 
your example 
after watching a karate demonstration by young boys and girls 
enrolled in a program in wilmington del aimed at keeping kids off 
drugs bush chatted informally at length about the pressures on 
todays youth 
they had drugs around when i was a little guy but i hate to 
tell you how old i am said the 64yearold president it wasnt 
as much there wasnt the pressure on kids in schools its just 
kind of come in more lately you know 
a few moments later he was asked what do you do to keep drugs 
out of your life 
well kind of getting along in my level of life here the 
pressures arent quite that big bush replied you dont have a 
lot of guys coming up to you in daily life saying hey 
so i dont have the temptations and the pressures that youve 
got like young guys in school and all of that he added but i 
think if i did id try to do what youre doing id try to have 
that lifestyle going in such a way and helping the law enforcement 
so people wouldnt be tempted to offer up those narcotics 
bush acknowledged to his young audience that as president he 
probably wont have an opportunity to test that approach personally 
it would be pretty hard for some drug guy to come into the 
white house and start offering it up you know he said

taxpayers whose 1985 federal refunds were 
shortchanged or lost because they forget to subtract taxes already 
withheld have only 25 days to file a claim with the irs 
after april 15 the refunds will be lost forever 
the internal revenue service on wednesday outlined a procedure 
for filing such refund claims one day after acknowledging that an 
old policy had prohibited irs employees from notifying taxpayers who 
neglected to take a credit for withheld taxes 
the agency indicated that most people who got squeezed by the old 
policy probably were taxpayers who in 1985 received lumpsum pension 
payments from which some taxes were withheld most such payments 
were reported to the taxpayer and the irs on form 1099r 
taxpayers should review their 1985 returns especially if tax 
withholding was reported on a form 1099 the irs said wednesday 
if taxpayers find that they have not claimed all their withholding 
for 1985 they should file a special claim 
the irs also announced that after additional review it will 
issue instructions on how to apply for refunds that were not made 
for the same reason on returns filed in 1987 
the new policy which acting commissioner michael j murphy says 
simply restates the basic irs position that taxpayers pay only the 
tax due no more no less affects returns filed in 1988 and 
later years 
murphy announced tuesday night that irs employees were no longer 
barred from informing taxpayers who forgot to consider withheld 
taxes when they calculated what they owed 
the agencys hand was forced by several employees in the irs 
memphis regional service center who complained privately to sen 
albert gore jr dtenn that the old policy amounted to stealing 
from taxpayers one of those employees linda johnson a returns 
examiner went public with her complaints after talking to gore 
on a lot of returns the taxpayer often failed to notice 
that money was withheld especially from pensions ms johnson 
explained a lot of times these taxpayers had paid someone else to 
do their returns but when we questioned it we were told that 
taxpayers would have to find their own mistakes 
ms johnson said she personally handled dozens of such returns 
on which taxpayers overpaid their taxes in most cases she said 
the taxpayers were pensioners and the overpayment was between 100 
and 1000 
a taxpayers failure to subtract withheld taxes would likely be 
detected as part of the operation in which w2 and 1099 forms from 
employers banks and other payers are matched against income 
reported on a tax return a computer will find for example that 
interest income was not reported where it should be on a return 
ms johnson or some other examiner would then try to determine 
whether the taxpayer reported it on the wrong line or the wrong 
form if the examiner could not resolve the discrepancy the 
taxpayer would be sent a letter demanding an explanation 
to claim a refund of 1985 taxes because of the withholding 
problem a taxpayer may file form 1040x form 843 or a simple 
statement explaining the circumstances in any case the notation 
1985 income tax withholding claim should be entered at the top 
of the page 
if the taxpayer opts to file a statement explaining the claim it 
must include the taxpayers name address and social security 
number the withholding figure that was entered on the original 
return the correct withholding and the refund due the statement 
must be signed dated and postmarked by april 15 
claims should be sent to the problem resolution officer at the 
irs service center to which the 1988 tax return is being mailed

chrysler corp chairman lee iacocca is telling 
business it must help schools teach youth or end up paying the cost 
of remedial education for workers 
you and i are spending more money teaching remedial mathematics 
to our employees than all the grade schools high schools and 
colleges in the country are spending on mathematics instruction 
iacocca said in a speech wednesday to the national association of 
manufacturers i am getting more scared every day 
shirley frye president of the national council of teachers of 
mathematics and director of curriculum development for the 
scottsdale ariz public schools said she did not know how much 
was spent on teaching mathematics or where iacocca got his estimate 
but she had no reason to doubt it 
that is an alarming statistic she said 
the council earlier this week released recommended standards to 
make sure students learn how to reason mathematically knowing when 
to perform various mathematical operations as well as just how to 
add subtract multiply divide and do other calculations 
iacocca gave no source for his mathematics estimate but said 
chrysler spends 117 million a year on training 10 percent of it 
on the three rs elementary reading writing and arithmetic 
business executives and parents must demand tougher educational 
standards more effective expenditure of the 328 billion annually 
that the nation devotes to education and measures to strengthen the 
professionalism and status of teachers iacocca told his luncheon 
audience 
in japan teachers are on a pedestal like they were when i was 
a kid growing up in allentown pa years ago and japanese 
teachers are among the highestpaid professionals in the country 
iacocca said 
chrysler has had to reduce the difficulty of its training 
materials from ninth and 12th grade levels to sixth grade or below 
because a frightening number of workers could not read it and 
sometimes even sixth grade isnt enough 
one assembly line had a button reading bad hood fit but we 
had to replace that with graphics because the guys just couldnt 
handle those three monosyllables

congress wants a solid financial commitment 
from foreign countries before moving ahead with the 46 billion 
superconducting super collider but the foreign countries want 
congress to take the first step 
rep tom bevill chairman of the house appropriations 
subcommittee on energy and water development said wednesday they 
are going to have to put their name on the line we like to talk in 
specific terms and congress likes to hear specific figures i dont 
like to be vague about it 
but energy secretary james d watkins said foreign countries are 
waiting for congress show its commitment to building the highenergy 
physics project in texas before they chip in 
watkins complained its a chicken and egg situation this year 
and testified wednesday that everyone is looking for the next 
person to make the next commitment 
india is the only country that has signed a costsharing 
agreement and will provide 50 million 
bevill dala countered there wont be much incentive for other 
countries to participate once the united states takes on the funding 
when congress agreed to spend 100 million on the super collider 
last year thats getting pretty serious thats pretty 
committed bevill told watkins 
asking congress to approve the project without knowing exactly 
how much is coming from nonfederal sources is asking for 
trouble bevill said 
the energy department is proposing 18 billion toward the cost 
come from nonfederal sources including 1 billion from the state 
of texas 
but even texas is not willing to begin spending its share if 
congress is not committed to construction and wants a refund clause 
in case the federal government backs out 
president bush has proposed a 250 million appropriation for next 
fiscal year including 160 million for construction congress 
restricted last years appropriation to research and development 
the doe has chosen a site around waxahachie for the super 
collider a 53mile underground tunnel in which beams of protons 
would smash into each other with 20 times the energy of todays most 
powerful accelerators

us officials are sorting through the views 
expressed in four hours of discussion with the palestine liberation 
organization in which the plo was urged to ease tensions in 
israeliheld territory 
assessing wednesdays meeting in tunisia between us ambassador 
robert h pelletreau jr and yasser abedrabbo of the plo state 
department officials were unable to draw any immediate conclusions 
there was no definitive answer said one official who spoke 
on condition of anonymity he said the two sides would have to 
analyze the fourhour discussion and meet again at a date to be 
determined 
secretary of state james a baker iii hopes the meeting will be a 
springboard to eventual peace talks and immediate 
confidencebuilding measures on the west bank and in gaza where 
a palestinian uprising helped propel the united states into dealing 
with the plo 
the idea is to try to move toward dialogue and away from 
fighting with some practical steps the official said but beyond 
that the idea is to keep in mind there are ultimate goals 
basically now is the time for considering each others views 
for future discussion the official added 
in the meeting pelletreau under instruction from baker asked 
the plo not to stand in the way of palestinians on the west bank and 
in gaza who might be willing to talk to israel 
the us side stressed the need to get inhabitants on the 
ground involved in steps toward peace the official said 
pelletreau made those points without going into much detail on 
the measures but bakers aim is known to include an easing of the 
15month palestinian rebellion in exchange for israels release of 
arabs detained in the violence that has taken a death toll of more 
than 400 civilians 
its a twoway street in this respect the official said 
while baker wants to begin the peace process in small steps he 
has told congress his goal is a dialogue between israel and 
palestinians or the plo if that is the only meaningful form 
of negotiations 
he also told the house foreign affairs committee on tuesday that 
israel should trade land for peace as a solution to the problems 
in the middle east 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir declines to negotiate with 
the plo and holds it responsible for continuing terrorist attacks 
against his country shamir will be here early next month for talks 
with baker and president bush 
abedrabbo the head of the plo delegation is secondincommand 
of the democratic front for the liberation of palestine 
the faction was accused by israel last month of sending 
guerrillas on an infiltration mission despite chairman yasser 
arafats renunciation of terrorism last december the guerrillas 
were intercepted in southern lebanon across israels border 
the us government in its terrorist group profiles 
described the democratic front which is headed by naif hawatmeh as 
marxistleninist and prosoviet in policy it has repeatedly 
affirmed its hostility and resistance to us policy in the region 
and carried out bombings and grenade attacks against israel the 
document said 
rep charles e schumer dny said it troubles me that the 
person meeting with the american ambassador is a leader of an 
organization that continues to participate in terrorism even after 
arafats promises 
in december hawatmeh called for an escalation of the palestinian 
uprising against israeli control from its headquarters in syria he 
said maneuvers to stop the uprising under slogans of a partial 
truce or deals with occupation forces will never succeed 
hawatmeh added we warn the plo to beware of becoming a victim 
of this trap

antitrust investigators are looking into a 
planned merger of two airlineoperated computer reservations systems 
that critics say will further decrease competition in commercial 
aviation 
officials of american and delta airlines said wednesday they 
still hope to start the new system may 1 capturing a 44 percent 
share of the airline reservations market and reducing the number of 
companies in the field from five to four 
the systems accept reservations for any airline but critics say 
they tend to favor the airlines that own them all existing systems 
are owned by major airlines 
the justice department which on jan 1 took over jurisdiction of 
airline industry mergers from the transportation department has 
sent out requests for information from both airlines and has issued 
several civil investigative demands to other companies that 
might be affected according to delta and american officials 
justice spokeswoman amy brown confirmed that a civil 
investigation of the merger is under way but said department rules 
prohibit disclosure of actions taken during the inquiry 
such investigations would ordinarily seek information from 
competitors and others that might have an interest in a merger as 
well as the companies directly involved she said 
the combined americandelta system would control 44 percent of 
the nations airline reservations americas sabre system is already 
the largest in the industry handling about 35 percent of 
reservation business deltas datas ii has about a 9 percent market 
share 
the systems are leased by travel agents 
the merger does not need federal approval but the department has 
30 days from the filing of an announcement to bring an antitrust 
case if it wants to stop the deal requests for additional 
information extend the deadline to 20 days after company response to 
the requests 
both american and delta officials said they were putting together 
responses to several broad questions the department is asking 
james lundy delta spokesman said the companies still hope to 
meet the may 1 date for setting up the new reservations company no 
name has yet been selected for the partnership he said 
among those critical of the merger are some other airlines state 
attorneys general and consumer advocates some say it threatens to 
reduce competition further among the dwindling number of major 
carriers 
several groups had written the justice department urging an 
antitrust inquiry 
christopher witkowski of the aviation consumer action project 
said in a letter that the industry is dominated by airlines that own 
interests in reservations systems 
karen cook american spokesman said we are still very 
optimistic that the merger can take place on may 1 
under the proposed merger delta is to pay american 650 million 
for a 50 percent share in the new company us airlines without 
ownership in another us reservations system will be allowed to buy 
shares at 20 million for a 1 percent interest 
other domestic and foreign carriers as well as other 
travelrelated companies may buy in with approval of existing 
owners but delta and american will each retain at least a 25 
percent share

the air force is defending its deal with a 
major defense contractor for 68 million in kits to repair crash 
damage to c5 cargo aircraft despite overpriced parts and the 
ineffectiveness of the kit on a damaged plane 
we in the air force logistics command remain firmly convinced 
that the decision to buy c5 crash damage repair kits and the 
methodology of the acquisition for these kits is correct and 
appropriate major gen richard d smith told the house energy and 
commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations wednesday 
testimony by air force officials and members of the general 
accounting office revealed that lockheed aeronautical systems co 
proposed prices of 22994 for a nickelsize washer and 21113 for 
an inchlong aluminum shim that was an excess part from production 
of the c5b the part originally was valued at 2209 
it looks to me that no matter how we look at the matter were 
being taken and the taxpayers are being skinned here said rep 
john dingell chairman of the subcommittee 
smith defended the price of the washer saying its not a 
common washer its critical for the structure of the aircraft 
the air force based its need for the kits on two crashes and a 
lightning strike according to the gao but a c5a that was damaged 
in a fire at travis air force base in california on dec 30 1988 
cannot be repaired with the kit which is for repair to the 
underbelly of the aircraft 
the damaged c5a has a hole about 13 feet by 33 feet in the upper 
fuselage 
the gao congress investigative arm also found that retired air 
force col anthony diferdinando negotiated the pentagon contract 
with lockheed and later went to work for the company 
diferdinando did not comply with provisions in a conflict of 
interest law requiring that he report his employment contracts and 
disqualify himself from procurement functions involving lockheed 
the gao said 
however we did not find any evidence to indicate that his 
actions regarding the purchase of the kits were influenced by 
employment 
dingell said the air force office of special investigations began 
a criminal investigation of the colonel for conflict of interest 
last thursday 
a spokesman for lockheed hugh burns said the company has 
complied with all conflict of interest laws and to the best of our 
knowledge so did mr diferdinando diferdinando remains an 
employee at lockheed

more than 100 countries have endorsed a 
proposed un treaty that supporters say will slow the alarming and 
unregulated rise in toxic waste shipments across international 
borders 
the treaty immediately signed by 34 countries after its approval 
wednesday requires signatories to provide detailed information on 
intended toxic shipments and to ensure that importing nations can 
handle them in an environmentally sound way 
signers of the convention also pledge to forbid the shipment of 
hazardous wastes to countries that have banned their import 
waste generation and dumping in foreign countries are to be kept 
to a minimum and developing countries are promised technical aid 
backers say the treaty is the first step toward restricting 
shipments of dangerous waste to nations unequipped to deal with it 
but environmentalists contend it would merely legalize the transport 
of such materials 
the treaty was adopted by delegates of 105 countries after a 
threeday unsponsored conference and 18 months of hard 
bargaining it intends to confront growing international waste 
traffic and fears about poor countries accepting shipments in 
exchange for lucrative payments 
twenty countries must formally ratify it before it can go into 
force un officials have said this could take up to two years 
the united states britain and west germany were among major 
industrialized countries not signing immediately delegates were 
taking the text back for consideration by their governments 
among the countries that signed on wednesday were canada france 
italy and host switzerland hungary was the only soviet bloc country 
to sign 
none of the 40 african delegations signed the convention 
mostafa tolba chief of the sponsoring un environment program 
said african lands are committed to the treaty and he expects their 
signatures after a policysetting summit meeting in june of the 
organization of african unity 
most waste traffic is between industrialized countries but tolba 
warned that movements between developing countries were on the verge 
of becoming a problem which god knows how we are going to control 
our agreement has not halted commerce in poison tolba said 
in prepared remarks but it has signaled the international resolve 
to eliminate the menace hazardous wastes pose to the welfare of our 
shared environment and to the health of all the worlds peoples 
he urged all countries to ratify the convention quickly 
the greenpeace environmental group said the text merely legalizes 
the international waste trade and was weakened to please 
industrialized countries it again called for a complete ban on 
crossborder dangerous shipments 
a total of 42 countries more than half of them in africa have 
banned waste imports greenpeace said 
the convention does not explicitly cover shipments through a 
members territorial waters a point demanded earlier by many 
coastal states 
another contentious issue liability for damage from wastes was 
put off for further talksus delegate philip winn said washington 
would oppose such talks 
under the treaty individual nations can sign separate waste 
trade treaties with nonsigners but they must offer at least as much 
environmental protection as the un provisions

a former nuclear plant technician says he 
believes the nuclear regulatory commission paid him 4000 to 
testify against the agencys no 2 investigator only so it could 
quash evidence against other highranking officials 
douglas s ellison said wednesday that he was giving the nrc 
information about roger a fortuna the deputy director of the 
agencys office of investigations late last summer when nrc 
officials offered to pay him 
he said the unsolicited and highly unusual offer came after he 
warned nrc officials that he would scream fire and foul play if 
the commission did not follow up on his alleged evidence of 
wrongdoing against fortuna and other nrc officials 
the nrcs contract with ellison under a section titled special 
terms and conditions specifies that ellison may not discuss 
this contract or the information to be furnished the nrc hereunder 
with any person 
the effect of it was to gag me to prevent me from going in 
front of the media ellison said in a telephone interview from new 
smyrna beach fla 
ellison claims the nrc has done nothing with his information and 
only moved recently to fire fortuna after ellison took his 
information to federal prosecutors in manhattan he said the nrc is 
ignoring evidence he provided against other highranking commission 
officials singling out fortuna as a scapegoat 
nrc spokesman frank ingram declined comment on ellisons 
accusations and other aspects of the fortuna investigation saying 
the case was ongoing the nrc wants to fire fortuna citing his 
refusal to testify before a court reporter on allegations of 
misconduct originally leveled by ellison 
rep sam gejdenson dconn had provided the associated press a 
copy of an nrc purchase order that authorized ellison to be paid 40 
per hour for the 100 hours of effort estimated under this 
contract plus 117 a day in expenses 
in a letter wednesday to nrc chairman lando w zech jr 
gejdenson and rep george miller dcalif charged that the payment 
appears to be part of an ongoing effort by the nrc to undermine 
the effectiveness and independence of the agencys office of 
investigations 
the office of investigations probes wrongdoing by plant 
operators the nrc is often accused by lawmakers and other critics 
of being too soft on the industry it is assigned to regulate 
ellison 40 worked at the nine mile point unit i plant in 
scriba ny when he told nrc investigators in 1986 about alleged 
safety problems at the plant fortuna decided against pursuing the 
allegations and federal prosecutors in syracuse ny declined 
prosecution according to gejdenson 
in august ellison charged that fortuna discussed sensitive and 
confidential nrc information and strategies concerning several oi 
investigations with unauthorized third parties and matters 
involving ellison with third parties according to a partial 
transcript of his testimony from sept 12 1988 
one of the third parties was stephen b comley a massachusetts 
antinuclear activist in the interview wednesday ellison charged 
that comley urged fortuna not to take action on the evidence ellison 
provided because it would interfere with comleys personal 
investigations of the nuclear industry 
ellison says he has 42 secretly recorded tapes of conversations 
with various nrc and plant officials he says he made the tapes by 
strapping a miniature tape recorder around his ankle and attaching a 
microphone to his belt

hundreds of people demonstrated on behalf of 
popular reformer boris n yeltsin and condemned what they call the 
perks and privileges of a corrupt communist party bureaucracy 
yeltsin who was ousted as moscow party boss last year because of 
his outspoken views is running for a seat representing moscow in 
the newly created soviet legislature the 2250seat congress of 
peoples deputies 
a rally wednesday on his behalf the second in less than a week 
was also a protest against the party elite 
yeltsin is strongest in the struggle with bureaucracy and 
dishonesty in society said olga ulitova a communist party member 
for 27 years he is the only one in 70 years of soviet power who 
did not take the privileges offered by his high position 
he struggles for the party for a clean party moscow worker 
valery reptov shouted to the crowd 
several hundred yeltsin supporters gathered near a statue to 
moscows medieval founder yuri dolgoruky across from city council 
headquarters the crowd soon grew to about 5000 many of them 
onlookers 
authorities did not grant permission for the demonstration which 
came in the final days of campaigning before sundays elections 
busloads of police were present but did not try to stop it 
also wednesday members of the academy of sciences considered a 
new election for its delegates to the new legislature after a 
rebellion against old guard candidates gave new life to the 
candidacy of human rights activist andrei d sakharov 
the day before more than 1200 academy members approved just 
eight of a list of 23 candidates presented by its leadership the 
academy has been alloted 20 seats and a new election must now be 
held to fill the 12 vacancies 
a new slate of nominees is to be presented in two weeks but it 
is not yet clear how they will be chosen the previous selection 
process was widely criticized as undemocratic 
this was a result of a great grassroots movement of the 
scientific intelligentsia if they choose me to be a candidate and a 
deputy i will not refuse said sakharov a physicist who won the 
1975 nobel peace prize 
the soviet unions first experiment with contested elections has 
spurred rare open debate and criticism of the government 
even foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said the 
soviets were feeling their way toward democracy and he said the 
present election law likely will be changed after the new 
legislature is seated 
gerasimov said the new soviet electoral law was passed a little 
too quickly without sufficient study of foreign legislatures 
he made his comments to the french diplomatic press association 
in paris which he is visiting in part to make arrangements for a 
july trip by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
gerasimov also acknowledged that yeltsin has become an opposition 
symbol 
he said that on listening to yeltsin you get the impression 
that his platform is not different from the partys at the same 
time some of his ideas make you think he is deviating from the party 
line 
moreoever those who want such a divorce from the party have 
rallied around him he is on the way to becoming the symbol of the 
opposition if it is not already the case its starting to happen 
gerasimov said he did not find a sunday demonstration by several 
thousand yeltsin supporters in moscow unusual in the context of a 
political campaign 
the best means for public opinion or at least a part of it to 
express itself is to peacefully demonstrate he said 
yeltsin who did not appear at wednesdays rally was moscow 
party chief until his ouster in november 1987 for criticizing the 
slow pace of reforms and warning that a cult of personality could 
develop around gorbachev 
he has remained popular among muscovites as he runs for the 
legislature against yevgeny brakov director of the giant zil 
factory that produces limousines and household appliances 
both as moscow party leader and in his campaign yeltsin has 
lashed out at the privileges party and government officials receive 
they include chauffeurs and access to special stores stocked with 
scare goods 
the congress of peoples deputies which will meet only one day a 
year is to elect the countrys acting fulltime legislature from 
among its membership and choose the soviet president 
a total of 750 seats in the congress are alloted to organizations 
like the academy of sciences and the communist party the rest are 
to be filled in sundays nationwide elections

the government has appealed to the 
united states and other western countries to reopen their embassies 
saying the country has not become a bloodbath after the soviet 
withdrawal as had been feared 
a foreign ministry statement containing the appeal was read to 
foreign reporters on wednesday ministry spokesman mohammed nabi 
amani said it would be delivered to the united nations 
the united states and 11 other western nations closed their 
embassies in january and february as the red army completed its 
withdrawal after nine years of helping the marxist kabul regime 
fight ussupported moslem guerrillas 
the insurgents began fighting after a communist coup in april 
1978 
speaking to a group of about 20 foreign journalists amani 
repeated official allegations that closing the embassies was a 
propaganda maneuver designed to undermine the kabul government and 
boost guerrilla morale 
amani whose remarks were translated by aides from dari into 
english said the embassies were closed on a pretext of insecurity 
and they were saying after the soviet withdrawal afghanistan will 
change to a bloodbath the last 40 days have demonstrated that this 
was not correct 
the ministry statement specifically asked the united states as a 
guarantor of the unsponsored agreement under which the soviets 
withdrew to reopen its embassy 
remaining us embassy staff members were evacuated jan 31 and 
the 11 other embassies also closed including those of britain 
france and japan 
only 19 diplomatic missions have remained open in kabul since the 
last soviet soldiers left on feb 15 
after the soviets were gone the insurgents launched a major 
offensive against government troops in jalalabad 75 miles east of 
the capital kabul has come under rocket attack but not to the 
extent of last year 
amani said 159 guerrillas eight afghan soldiers and 10 civilians 
had been killed in the battle for jalalabad in the previous 24 
hours but said he did not have total casualties in the fighting 
which began march 6 
reports on official kabul radio put the death toll since the 
battle began at more than 1900 but guerrilla accounts of their own 
casualties usually are only about 10 percent of those claimed by 
kabul 
residents of kabul say government troops in the city have been 
firing sovietmade scudb missiles toward jalalabad daily the 
missiles have a range of at least 175 miles 
government officials speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the insurgents had fired at least 50000 rockets at jalalabad 
huge soviet ilyushin76 transports have landed with increasing 
frequency at kabuls airport during the battle for jalalabad which 
is considered strategic because it is on the highway that connects 
kabul and the pakistani border 
staff members of un agencies said they counted 112 landings by 
the ilyusihins last week and 109 by smaller antonov12s 
when asked what the planes brought amani said they were 
aeroflot cargo planes carrying supplies from the united nations 
he said they were bringing part of the 600 million in food and 
medicine pledged by the soviet union to a 2 billion un relief 
program 
leon de reidmatten the un aid representative in kabul 
responded we have not been informed about this and noted that 
all supplies intended for the program must be distribted through 
un offices 
douglas manson of the un development program said he did not 
know what the soviet aircraft were hauling 
noting that an ilyushin can carry 40 tons of cargo and an antonov 
six tons he said if theyre bringing food none of it is showing 
up in the silos and marketplaces 
afghanistan has said it will continue to receive military 
supplies from the soviet union as long as the united states arms the 
guerrillas

bahamian prime minister of participating in a ring that imported 22 
tons of cocaine 1 billion worth into the united states 
this is an encompassing indictment that talks about the whole 
system of importing cocaine from colombia through the bahamas to the 
united states beginning in about 1974 and continuing into 1989 
said jack hook a dea spokesman 
those indicted are tied to carlos lehder rivas the colombian 
drug kingpin who was convicted in jacksonville last year of 
smuggling cocaine into the united states 
this prosecution will further dismantle the medellin cartel and 
its distribution network in the united states us attorney 
robert w genzman said of the latest indictments 
the cartel named for the colombian city where it is based is 
considered the worlds largest cocaine trafficking ring its said 
to be responsible for up to 80 percent of the cocaine imported into 
the united states

gaviria of organizing the 1984 assassination of colombian justice 
minister rodrigo lara bonilla escobar and fabio ochoa vasquez also

american country and eventually traveled to nicaragua the 
indictment said they stored 3000 pounds of cocaine at los brasiles 
air force base in the leftistruled country before flying it into 
the united states the indictment said 
in may 1984 lehder and other cartel leaders arranged to pay 
nicaraguan officials large sums of money to allow them to remain in 
the central american nation and to use it as a base for smuggling 
cocaine to the united states the indictment said in addition in 
july 1984 a piper navajo owned by lehder was given to the 
nicaraguan government as a gift the indictment said 
also indicted was everette bannister a close associate of

from the associated press bill kalis a spokesman for pindlings 
office said the bahamian government would have no comment on 
bannisters indictment 
nbc news citing unidentified federal law enforcement officials 
reported that an early draft of the indictment said bannister shared 
the alleged payoffs with pindling and other bahamian officials 
pindlings name was dropped from the indictment after it was 
reviewed by the justice and state departments in washington nbc 
said the network did not say whether the early draft named pindling 
as a defendant

the government of prime minister margaret thatcher 
is proposing a bill of rights for hong kong to ensure civil 
liberties are protected there after china takes over the british 
colony in 1997 
foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe proposed the idea on 
wednesday during a meeting of the house of commons foreign affairs 
committee 
questioned about prospects for human rights in light of chinas 
suppression of recent nationalist demonstrations in tibet howe 
noted that drafts of a new constitution for hong kong have not yet 
addressed the issue out in detail 
he said despite beijings commitment to observe international 
conventions on human rights it may be desirable to consolidate 
the human rights provisions of international covenants into a hong 
kong bill of rights 
hong kong governor sir david wilson told the committee that 
britain and china would ensure that hong kong has a system of 
representative government but said its development would be gradual 
britain plans to hold hong kongs first democratic elections in 1991 
asked if a bill of rights was planned wilson said its 
certainly one of the things well want to look at in the final 
version of hong kongs new constitution 
he said the proposed constitution calls for enforcing 
international covenants on human rights through the laws of hong 
kong ensuring that same rights and freedoms that now exist will be 
protected when the colony becomes a special administrative 
region of china in 1997 
the committee was meeting for an update on the status of the 1984 
sinobritish agreement that will transfer hong kong to chinese 
jurisdiction a key part of its implementation is the drafting of 
the constitution known as the basic law a committee composed of 
hong kong and chinese members has completed a second draft of the 
law 
china has promised that hong kongs capitalist system and 
lifestyle will remain unchanged for 50 years after the transfer of 
sovereignty 
wilson told the committee which will visit hong kong and beijing 
next month that plans still are under way to have elections in hong 
kong 
theres no change of objective wilson said reiterating 
plans to have 10 members elected by universal suffrage to the 
legislative council in 1991 for threeyear terms and an additional 
15 to an enlarged council of 80 in 1995 
until now the only elected members of the council have been 
elected from limited groups 
the whole process is one of steady and gradual evolution of 
representative government he said

a 14yearold girl is back home today 
after winning an age discrimination battle but says she cant 
forgive the elderly neighbors who forced her eviction from a mobile 
home community 
im glad to be home staci elmer said wednesday after a judge 
allowed her to return to her parents home in this rural central 
florida town 
but my family was separated i dont care if the neighbors got 
down on their knees and apologized i dont think i could look them 
in the eye and forgive them it hurt that much 
neighbors waged a court battle for more than a year to enforce a 
deed restriction on the elmers property and other homes in the 
twoblock subdivision the deed banned children under age 15 
they won an injunction in january and staci was kicked out of 
her familys home jan 31 after pasco circuit judge wayne cobb 
threatened to jail her parents for contempt the teenager went to 
live with a married brother several miles away coming home to visit 
on weekends 
but cobb ruled wednesday that the ban was rendered illegal by a 
federal housing law that took effect march 12 
this court cannot continue an injunction in violation of the 
law the federal act now makes these deed restrictions unlawful and 
im going to dissolve the injunction cobb said at the end of a 
brief hearing 
the federal housing law is controversial in many retirement 
communities where some residents say theyre entitled to live 
quietly and without children 
all of the elmers neighbors who occupy the 16 other mobile homes 
in the small subdivision are retirees in their 60s 70s and 80s 
the long court battle left bitterness on both sides 
i just feel weve been taken said arlene murray who lives 
across the street from beverly and thomas elmer we bought here 20 
years ago with the idea of peace and quiet we raised our family 
our grandchildren are raised 
it isnt that we are against children she said out of 17 
families it comes down to the fact that 16 dont have any rights 
i dont think thats fair 
i really dont care if they like me or not said mrs elmer 
45 there are some grayhaired monsters here 
mrs elmer who sells real estate admits she knew about the age 
restriction before buying the property but liked the area because 
it was affordable and convenient to work and school 
other residents violated deed restrictions governing placement of 
clotheslines and propane tanks she said so she didnt think staci 
would be a problem when the family moved in in november 1987 
neighbors said they werent sure whether they would continue 
their fight most live on a pension and dont have the funds for a 
long legal battle and carrying on the dispute may be too stressful 
for those who are in frail health mrs murray said 
staci will turn 15 on april 7 and would be allowed to stay then 
anyway still she said she was surprised by the judges ruling and 
didnt think her battle had ended 
for the most part i was shocked i dont think its over 
maybe for the judicial system but not for the neighborhood she 
said

broken nose had an ulcer on the bridge and a clump of hair appeared 
to have been snatched from her head she was bruised and wounds on 
her legs were badly ulcerated and infected she walked with a stoop 
and her hair was matted and gray 
charges against her were dropped when prosecutors determined she 
was too physically and mentally incapacitated to be responsible for 
the girls death 
ms nussbaum 46 testified under immunity as the star 
prosecution witness in steinbergs trial during which defense 
attorneys contended she was responsible for lisas fatal beating 
a jury convicted steinberg in january of manslaughter rejecting 
a murder charge because as one juror said ms nussbaum could have

been properly forwarded the license was renewed the day after she 
was ticketed she pleaded guilty and will be fined a maximum 100 
next week 
the steinberg case focused national attention on domestic 
violence and the question of who should report cases of suspected 
child abuse 
janet segal director of clinical services at four winds 
testified at trial that ms nussbaums situation was like being a 
prisoner of war she also likened it to the battered spouse 
syndrome in which victims suffer an erosion of spirit of will

commonly prescribed arthritis and 
painrelieving drugs pose a serious risk of peptic ulcers 
intestinal perforations and other gastrointestinal problems the 
food and drug administration is warning 
the fda is requiring manufacturers to add to their labels a 
warning reporting that studies show up to 4 percent of patients on 
longterm therapy with these drugs may have serious gastrointestinal 
reactions 
the new labeling announced wednesday is required for voltaren 
nalfon tolectin indocin dolobid meclomen feldene ponstel 
anaprox naprosyn orudis butazolidin rufen motrin ansaid and 
several generic versions of ibuprofen indomethacin and 
phenylbutazone 
nonprescription ibuprofen does not have to carry the new warning 
because the risk of serious reactions with overthecounter products 
appears to be much less particularly if they are taken as 
directed over a shorter period of time the fda said

share prices rebounded today on the tokyo stock 
exchange after four consecutive losing days while the us dollar 
was off slightly against the japanese yen 
the 225issue nikkei stock average a 21156point loser 
wednesday recouped 14542 points or 046 percent to finish at 
3158866 
although the markets key index suffered some setbacks as 
speculative investors sold issues for profittaking in the afternoon 
session the nikkei maintained earlier gains as other participants 
traded a variety of issues dealers said 
the foreign exchange market that has been stabilized for the 
last couple of days and oil prices that dont seem to be rising 
further were two encouraging factors for the nikkeis rise today 
said a broker with a major securities firm in tokyo 
trading was moderate with volume estimated at 800 million shares 
among the winners were steel and department store issues 
in currency dealings the dollar ended trading at 13088 yen 
down 052 yen from the previous days 13140yen finish the 
currency started trading lower at 13073 yen and moved in a range of 
1306013091 yen 
the dollars lower start in tokyo followed a similar trend in new 
york overnight after comments by federal reserve board chairman alan 
greenspan and a government figure on factory orders for durable 
goods wednesday 
the us commerce department reported american factory orders for 
major durable goods fell 36 percent in february the second 
consecutive monthly decline and the largest drop in seven months 
recent economic reports have indicated some softening of the 
economy in february retail sales industrial production and orders 
for durable goods lasting for more than three years have all fallen 
greenspan in response to a question at a house banking 
subcommittee hearing said the conditions that led to interest rates 
in the high teens in the 1980s are not present today 
its our view that the actions we have taken to date probably 
have made interest rates certainly in the long end of the market 
significantly lower than they would have otherwise been he said 
an analyst with a commercial bank in tokyo said the dollaryen 
rate hardly moved after it marked 13088 at the end of the morning 
session 
he said trading became thin as a majority of participants stepped 
to the sidelines before the easter holidays in new york and european 
markets in addition to a general lack of market incentives 
the new york market is closed for a threeday weekend starting 
friday while the london market reopens on tuesday

two defectors from north korea said 
today that there is little public resistance in their former country 
to the transfer of power from president kim il sung to his son 
the north koreans both students were studying in czechoslovakia 
when they defected on feb 13 
all people in the north are brainwashed to believe that kim 
jong il kim il sungs son is a genius and they therefore think 
he must succeed to his father one of the students cho sungkun 
told a news conference 
but i think kim jong il is a bum and most czechoslovakians i 
have met said the succession problem shows that north korea is not a 
communist nation but a feudal state he said 
other north koreans have defected while traveling abroad but the 
defection of cho 22 and kim unchui 23 was the first time north 
korean students who had studied abroad have defected 
both had attended a medical college in prague 
north korean official radio broadcasts confirmed the students 
defection and said they were dopes who did not like to study 
kim il sung 76 has ruled north korea for four decades building 
a personality cult that has virtually deified him in his country and 
maintaining strict isolationist policies 
he has designated his eldest son as his successor creating the 
worlds first communist dynasty 
kim il sung he became premier in 1948 commanded north korea 
forces in the 195053 korean war and was named president in 1972 
cho a son of a north korean army colonel said that after living 
in czecholovakia for nearly two years he realized that leaders of 
the pyongyang government were lying to their people about the 
outside world especially south korea 
in czechoslovakia we knew by publications that south korea is 
one of the fastest developing economies and is rich enough to hold 
the olympics this is quite contrary to what has been known in the 
north he said

the government of prime minister margaret thatcher 
is proposing a bill of rights for hong kong to ensure civil 
liberties are protected there after china takes over the british 
colony in 1997 
foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe proposed the idea on 
wednesday during a meeting of the house of commons foreign affairs 
committee 
questioned about prospects for human rights in light of chinas 
suppression of recent nationalist demonstrations in tibet howe 
noted that drafts of a new constitution for hong kong have not yet 
addressed the issue out in detail 
he said despite beijings commitment to observe international 
conventions on human rights it may be desirable to consolidate 
the human rights provisions of international covenants into a hong 
kong bill of rights 
hong kong governor sir david wilson told the committee that 
britain and china would ensure that hong kong has a system of 
representative government but said its development would be gradual 
britain plans to hold hong kongs first democratic elections in 1991 
asked if a bill of rights was planned wilson said its 
certainly one of the things well want to look at in the final 
version of hong kongs new constitution 
he said the proposed constitution calls for enforcing 
international covenants on human rights through the laws of hong 
kong ensuring that same rights and freedoms that now exist will be 
protected when the colony becomes a special administrative 
region of china in 1997 
the committee was meeting for an update on the status of the 1984 
sinobritish agreement that will transfer hong kong to chinese 
jurisdiction a key part of its implementation is the drafting of 
the constitution known as the basic law a committee composed of 
hong kong and chinese members has completed a second draft of the 
law 
china has promised that hong kongs capitalist system and 
lifestyle will remain unchanged for 50 years after the transfer of 
sovereignty 
wilson told the committee which will visit hong kong and beijing 
next month that plans still are under way to have elections in hong 
kong 
theres no change of objective wilson said reiterating 
plans to have 10 members elected by universal suffrage to the 
legislative council in 1991 for threeyear terms and an additional 
15 to an enlarged council of 80 in 1995 
until now the only elected members of the council have been 
elected from limited groups 
the whole process is one of steady and gradual evolution of 
representative government he said

ten years after three mile island officials 
who faced the nations largest nuclear emergency vividly recall a 
time of fear one says hell never forget as long as i live 
there was the fear on the faces of expectant mothers evacuation 
plans in which two counties used the same bridge but in the opposite 
directions the us army signal corps building phone lines and the 
white house trying to commandeer lead bricks from the military 
you really dont want to revisit this event you hope you or 
anyone else never has to deal with it again said us attorney 
general dick thornburgh this whole event was like a roller 
coaster you didnt know when it was going to stop or when it was 
going to end 
thornburgh was in his 72nd day as governor of pennsylvania on 
march 28 1979 when the worst commercial nuclear accident in us 
history riveted world attention on a power plant 10 miles south of 
harrisburg 
at a reunion dinner wednesday night thornburgh was host for 
those who faced what he said was something that had never happened 
before on the face of the earth when the worst fear of modern man 
almost came to pass 
the participants swapped stories about the lack of reliable 
information the response of government and the complexity of making 
steam by splitting atoms in a nuclear reactor 
if it goes wrong theres no human capability of dealing with 
it the bottom line is we were very lucky at three mile island 
said eugene eidenberg an assistant to former president carter 
other white house staffers recalled the difficulty in getting 
accurate details about an accident in which a series of mechanical 
breakdowns and human error robbed the reactor of cooling water and 
released radioactivity into the air 
what we really had to fear was what we didnt know said 
jessica mathews a staffer on carters national security council 
we were in the dark we really didnt know what we were talking 
about 
no one really knew what was going on said jack watson who 
was white house counsel at the time 
at the peak of the crisis when some federal officials were 
urging a general evacuation of residents thornburgh pleaded with 
carter to send me one good man somebody who can translate this 
foreign technical information 
that man was harold denton chief of operating reactors at the 
us nuclear regulatory commission he traveled by helicopter to the 
site and brought instant credibility thornburgh said 
one of the things we learned was you cant manage a crisis from 
100 miles away denton said he called tmi and the accident at 
chernobyl in the soviet union a reminder of the downside of 
nuclear power if its not successful 
two days after the accident thornburgh wrestled with the 
decision of having to order a general evacuation after gleaning 
information from his staff between 9 am and 10 am he advised 
pregnant women and young children living within five miles of the 
plant to leave 
i will never forget that hour as long as i live thornburgh 
said 
much of the dinner talk recalled fears about a hydrogen bubble 
that formed in the reactor robert wilburn former director of the 
states office of management and budget remembered a report about 
the nrc saying the bubble was becoming potentially explosive 
you could hear the sounds of the cars starting up and leaving 
the city wilburn said 
two dozen reporters stormed into the governors office at that 
time and wanted to know if they should leave too they werent 
worried about reporting the story anymore they were worried about 
their own safety said paul critchlow thornburghs former press 
secretary 
former lt gov william scranton iii now a private businessman 
in california recalled the optimistic statements from metropolitan 
edison co the plants owner which downplayed the seriousness of 
the nearcatastrophe 
i got this sinking feeling like a stone out of an airplane that 
this was bigger than any of us thought scranton said 
no one from the utility was invited to the reunion

a 10yearold girl cannot be forced to have 
genetic tests to determine her parentage just because a pennsylvania 
couple says she is their natural daughter lost in a baby swap an 
appeals court has ruled 
the ruling wednesday by the second district court of appeal here 
was a major setback in the legal battle ernest and regina twigg of 
langhorne pa are waging to prove the girl is their daughter 
the twiggs contend the girl was swapped in the hospital days 
after her birth for a sickly child who later died 
but the court ruled that genetic testing of the sarasota girl 
kimberly mays would deny her privacy and freedom from unjustified 
humiliation and psychological damage 
they ruled with me every which way said arthur ginsburg 
attorney for kimberly and the father who raised her robert mays 
im thrilled about it 
kimberly was also happy with the decision ginsburg said 
but the twiggs attorney john blakely said the court seems 
to have totally ignored the anguish that mr and mrs twigg have 
knowing they have a child somewhere in the world that they have 
never seen 
blakely said he plans to ask the full panel of judges to 
reconsider the opinion if they refuse he plans to take the case to 
the florida supreme court 
if wednesdays ruling holds the twiggs will have to file a new 
motion explaining why they want to know if kimberly is their 
daughter and their reason cannot be merely to satisfy their 
curiosity according to the appeals court ruling 
attorneys for boths sides agreed that the twiggs next step would 
be to seek custody of kimberly or the right to visit the girl 
if the court rules that the twiggs dont have those rights the 
question of genetic tests would become irrelevant 
admittedly natural parents have certain presumptive rights of 
custody as to their offspring the court said those rights 
however are not absolute children are not property but 
individuals whose needs and physical and mental wellbeing find 
protection in the law 
ginsburg filed testimony from mental health experts who said 
kimberly would be severely disturbed if she were forced to visit the 
twiggs or undergo genetic tests 
the ruling is the latest twist in a case which began more than a 
decade ago in hardee memorial hospital 
the girl the twiggs brought home from the hospital arlena died 
of a congenital heart condition last summer and the couple now 
believes arlena was actually the child of robert and barbara mays 
who died seven years ago 
blood tests performed before arlena died proved she could not 
have been the twiggs biological daughter 
last fall blakely said the twiggs would seek custody of 
kimberly in part because they believed mays had participated in the 
baby swap 
but recently they softened their position saying they would like 
to get to know kimberly but wouldnt seek to take her away from the 
only father she has ever known

the students of the penn johns school for 
amish and mennonite children spent their recess soaking up the 
spring sun and talking about the important man who had just stopped 
by 
he looked different than in the pictures said ellis reiff a 
thirdgrader at the tworoom schoolhouse shortly after president 
bush and his entourage went bounding back down the winding country 
roads of southeastern pennsylvania to their next destination 
he looked a little older ellis added as some of his many 
cousins with the same last name nodded 
wearing a blue windbreaker dark blue pants and a shortbrimmed 
hat with a scoop in the middle ellis and his classmates said they 
would have to watch neighbors televisions wednesday evening to see 
if they made the national news their amish beliefs forbid them from 
owning television sets or radios 
when he came into the room i couldnt believe my eyes said 
ivan reiff a fourthgrader 
both boys spoke with pennsylvania dutch accents 
some of the boys said they would like to be president one day 
but conceded that their futures would probably be linked to family 
farms since their beliefs also prevent them from holding public 
office 
bush spoke briefly with the schools 55 children in first through 
eighth grades and then met with about a dozen amish and mennonite 
leaders for about 30 minutes the president chatted with the 
students about his dogs puppies his trip to asia and how his 
large staff of secret service agents keeps him safe 
the children said he mentioned nothing of the only thing he had 
talked about before and after his meeting with them the nations 
drug problem 
earlier in the day bush spoke to about 3500 students and guests 
in the stuffedtocapacity conestoga valley high school gymnasium 
after leaving the amish school he traveled to wilmington del to 
meet with community organizations fighting drug abuse 
ben martin an old order mennonite minister stood in stark 
contrast to the giggling redcheeked schoolchildren when he 
discussed the meeting with bush 
amish historians believe the meeting could be the first with a 
sitting president and members of their community which is more 
traditional than the mennonite sect from which it separated in the 
17th century 
martin 57 a farmer by profession said the leaders told bush 
their strong family ties and emphasis on religion helped keep 
children and teenagers away from drugs 
but he added the amish and mennonite communities are not 
perfect 
we realize we are just human like everybody else and we dont 
want to forget that he said 
martin said the president shook hands with each of them and even 
remembered his first name when saying goodbye 
he was a downtoearth president martin said 
elmer burkholder 44 a father of three of the children who 
attend penn johns said he was nervous talking with the nations 
chief executive but overcame the jitters when he kept on 
talking 
burkholder said he told the president of how his two sons ages 
18 and 22 had been offered drugs 
the children are taught values from the parents and those are 
passed on he said i was thankful that my sons were able to 
withstand the temptation 
the president accompanied at the meeting by attorney general and 
former pennsylvania gov dick thornburgh and bushs drug control 
policy director william j bennett told the leaders their 
community is a shining example of what family and faith can do

lawyers for three white students didnt 
prove they were discriminated against when dartmouth college 
suspended them after a confrontation with a black professor said a 
judge who dismissed the case 
us district judge shane devine concluded the students were 
not entitled to relief under any set of facts they could prove 
sean gorman an attorney for dartmouth said wednesday the ruling 
vindicated his claim the lawsuit was a public relations stunt 
a companion lawsuit is pending in a state court however and one 
of the students lawyers said wednesday that the real action will be 
there 
the focus of our efforts has always been the first 
amendment freespeech claim in the state court said art 
ruegger were looking forward to a trial in front of a jury on 
those claims 
the plaintiffs christopher baldwin of hinsdale ill john 
sutter of st louis and john quilhot of fort wayne ind worked 
for the dartmouth review an offcampus weekly newspaper that is 
criticized as racist sexist and antihomosexual defenders call it 
a courageous bastion of conservatism and traditional values 
persecuted by a liberal campus 
at issue in the lawsuits was a february 1988 classroom 
confrontation between the three and william cole a black music 
professor described by a review article as part of dartmouths 
dynamic duo of mediocrity 
though the students accused cole of grabbing quilhot by the arm 
and breaking the flash on his camera during the angry encounter a 
campus disciplinary board found them guilty of harassing him and 
they were suspended 
shortly before the march 1988 suspensions dartmouth president 
james freedman spoke at a rally held during the furor triggered by 
the incident 
i feel dreadful about the attack on professor cole freedman 
said i do not want one minority or woman student to decline to 
come to dartmouth because of the perception that this incident is 
representative of the true dartmouth it is not 
in a ruling issued tuesday devine rejected the students claim 
that those comments and others demonstrated freedmans bias against 
them 
though it could be inferred that freedman believed the students 
acted on racial motives in confronting cole it is not reasonable 
to infer that president freedmans motives in making his comments 
were racial that the plaintiffs race was the reason for his 
actions devine said 
another of the students lawyers francis murphy jr said the 
students may appeal or ask the judge to reconsider 
devine noted that state superior court judge bruce mohl ruled in 
january that he found no persuasive evidence to support the 
students political discrimination claim 
in that ruling mohl ordered baldwin and sutter reinstated 
because one member of the panel that disciplined them had been 
biased against the review 
dartmouth could have renewed disciplinary action against them 
but did not and they returned to campus soon afterward quilhot 
already had completed his sixmonth suspension 
dartmouth spokesman alex huppe said all three were off campus 
wednesday for semester break

emerge until monday when 35 survivors of the accident on the high 
seas between vietnam and malaysia arrived in the port of yokohama 
the refugees said their wooden ship was carrying 165 people when 
it struck the propeller of the 239000ton japanese tanker 
nisseimaru said nagasaki refugee center official masanami 
nakatsukasa the boat had left long an in southern vietnam for 
malaysia on march 4 he said 
nakatsukasa quoted the survivors as saying their boat overturned 
and sank after it hit the propeller of the tanker while trying to 
approach the japanese ship for help 
many passengers were seasick and suffering from a lack of fresh 
water after four days at sea nakatsukasa quoted them as saying 
the refugee boat somehow overturned when the tankers captain 
yasuo kawamura stopped his ship and prepared ladders to let the 
refugees come on board said hiroshi hattori spokesman of tokyo 
tanker the nisseimarus agent 
hattori denied reports that the boat overturned after hitting the

the house judiciary committee has 
overwhelmingly recommended that the state treasurer be impeached for 
his role in the loss of 279 million from the consolidated 
investment fund 
the legislative committee voted 196 wednesday night to recommend 
treasurer a james manchins impeachment 
committee chairman john hatcher said one more formal vote is 
needed before the impeachment resolution can be sent to the house of 
delegates floor he gave no timetable for that vote or a related 
decision on whether to reprimand state auditor glen gainer 
if 51 of the 100 house members vote to impeach manchin the 
popular twoterm democrat will be tried in the state senate where 
twothirds approval of the 34 members is needed to remove him from 
office 
the resolution accuses manchin of neglect of duty incompetence 
maladministration and high crimes and misdemeanors for either 
failing to report the losses the bulk of which occurred from april 
to june 1987 or for failing to supervise his staff 
manchin blames his employees primarily former associate 
treasurer arnold margolin and former investment director kathy 
lester for the losses he says he didnt learn of them until 
december 1988 
manchin was not in his office when the committee voted and a 
person who answered his home telephone wednesday evening said he was 
not home 
shortly before the committee voted however manchin 61 
appeared on a television newscast in charleston 
ive been in public service for 41 years he said neglect 
of duty i wouldnt know how to neglect duty i work constantly 
after endorsing the impeachment committee members voted to have 
their staff lawyers draft a resolution reprimanding or publicly 
censuring gainer 
some committee members were upset when gainer testified last week 
that he delegated many of his duties to his top aide don adams and 
did not take an active interest in board of investment activities 
that board made up of the treasurer auditor and governor sets 
general policies for the investment fund and the treasurers office 
takes charge of daytoday investments 
he didnt seem to know anything said delegate jack roop 
the legislature in its wisdom did not put him on the board of 
investments to be a potted plant said delegate rick staton 
the committee spent more than three hours over two days on a 
linebyline review of the impeachment resolution but engaged in no 
debate before the vote 
it defeated most attempts to weaken or make major modifications 
to the impeachment resolution wednesday but agreed to delete 
allegations that manchin or his staff solicited treasurers office 
employees for campaign contributions which would violate state law 
if you impeached every elected officer whose subordinates 
solicited campaign contributions youd have to impeach every 
elected official who ever served in the state of west virginia 
said delegate danny jones 
the committee also eliminated an allegation that manchin asked 
margolin to solicit funds from brokers with which the state did 
business 
i think it amounts to an attempted extortion said delegate 
david grubb who fought to retain the solicitation allegations 
other committee members said no evidence existed that manchin 
knew about or condoned the solicitation of his employees or that his 
request of margolin to seek funds from the brokers broke any laws 
lets not throw up a bunch of mud on the wall and see what 
sticks staton said

attorney for the man accused of masterminding the robbery said his 
client knew beforehand about the 1983 robbery received the money 
after the crime and helped the robber escape 
but weinglass told the us district court jury that the 
government failed to offer any physical evidence or testimony to 
prove that his client juan segarra palmer was responsible for the 
robbery itself 
he knew what was going to occur he wanted the robbery to 
succeed but he was not there and the government has not proven he 
took steps to help it succeed weinglass said 
segarra and four other men have been on trial since oct 11 on 
charges stemming from the robbery segarra faces 150 years in prison 
if convicted on all 16 counts against him 
for her part dejesus volunteered to come to hartford in may to 
work as an interpreter and legal aide to the attorney representing 
another defendant carlos m ayes suarez who is accused of using 
20000 from the 1983 robbery to finance a toy giveaway in hartford 
as a publicity stunt for the group 
her grandfather was 36 on nov 1 1950 when he and another 
nationalist griselio torresola tried to shot their way into blair 
house where truman was staying while the white house was being 
renovated 
truman was uninjured but collazos companion and a white house 
guard were killed 
collazo was sentenced to die in the electric chair but truman 
commuted his sentence to life in prison in 1952 
president carter granted collazo clemency in 1979 with three 
other puerto rican nationalists convicted in a 1954 shooting attack 
on the us house of representatives five congressmen were wounded 
in the attack 
collazo now 75 was freed from federal prison at leavenworth 
kan and is living with his daughter in vega baja puerto rico 
surely i am proud of her collazo said of his granddaughter 
in a telephone interview 
he said he saw no similarity between what he did and what she is 
doing except for the fact that we are fighting for the same 
cause 
i was involved in a violent action this case is more a 
political action than violent action he said 
dejesus who attended lehman college of the city univerity of new 
york for one year as a psychology major said she may remain in 
hartford after the current trial ends to assist in the defense of 
nine other wells fargo defendants still awaiting trial 
i consider it totally political she said of the trial 
they did it with political and ideological purposes if its true 
that they did it

a tribal court has issued a temporary 
order prohibiting navajo chairman peter macdonald from exercising 
his authority and barring him from his offices 
navajo district judge robert yazzies order late wednesday told 
macdonald and 27 others not to enter or stay in tribal offices 
except for the purpose of removing personal belongings unless 
further authorized by this court 
yazzie ordered macdonald and the others to appear before friday 
to show why the order should not be extended indefinitely among the 
27 named in the order were vice chairman johnny r thompson press 
secretary tazbah mccullah and marshall tome director of navajo 
public safety 
i feel a sense of relief said interim tribal chairman 
leonard haskie who was appointed by the tribal council majority two 
weeks ago this has been a lengthy and exhausting process 
majority council members meanwhile filed a lawsuit wednesday 
asking for a permanent injunction against the chairman 
tribal offices were closed late wednesday and macdonald could 
not be reached for immediate comment on whether he would obey the 
order which came in response to a motion filed by the council 
majority 
the council placed macdonald on paid administrative leave last 
month following us senate testimony linking him to alleged graft 
macdonald contends the council action was illegal and has refused to 
leave 
he has continued to use his office and has changed the locks on 
the tribal council chambers 
yazzies order banned macdonald from using tribal funds or 
equipment including airplanes and from issuing tribal directives 
or making contracts 
haskie said he was confident tribal police would enforce the 
order council delegates noted that police are funded by the us 
bureau of indian affairs which has requested that they not take 
sides in the dispute 
however tome head of the police has been one of macdonalds 
staunchest allies and police disregarded yazzies order last year 
prohibiting closure of the navajo education and scholarship 
foundation headed by macdonald rival peterson zah police closed off 
the building and changed the locks

a sheriff says he must have been living on 
borrowed time for more than 12 years while his predecessor and three 
others plotted to kill him 
cyrus bobby tardo a former lafourche parish sheriff and 
three others pleaded guilty wednesday to planting the homemade bomb 
that nearly killed sheriff duffy breaux last december 
it looked like i lived a little bit longer than i thought i was 
going to live said the 60yearold breaux who is still on 
crutches it was really surprising to hear what went on in the 
courtroom today the testimony that these people gave themselves 
federal prosecutors said the scheme was fueled by political 
rivalry revenge and dreams of unfettered drug trafficking in the 
coastal parish or county about 40 miles southwest of new orleans 
federal prosecutor lance africk said the scheme began in 1976 
when breaux defeated tardo for sheriff and culminated with the 
remotecontrol detonation of a pipe bomb in the thibodaux civic 
center parking lot on dec 15 1988 
breauxs left foot was maimed a parttime deputy was injured in 
the blast 
the four who pleaded guilty were tardo 58 marshall k 
mcclendon 42 ralph j bergeron 42 and john g tullier jr 23 
they were accused of conspiracy possession of an unregistered 
destructive device and damaging a law enforcement vehicle tardo 
also pleaded guilty to soliciting to commit a violent crime 
sentencing was set for may 31 tardo faces a maximum of 45 years 
in prison and 1 million in fines tullier bergeron and mcclendon 
each face a maximum of 35 years in prison and 750000 in fines 
tardo mcclendon and tullier also face state charges of attempted 
murder authorities said attempted murder charges against bergeron 
had been dropped in exchange for his cooperation 
in 1979 tardo made an unsuccessful attempt to unseat breaux and 
discussed again having the sheriff killed africk said 
tardos motivation to kill breaux grew through this time 
period breaux was tardos political enemy and tardo blamed breaux 
for personal and employmentrelated failures he suffered africk 
said 
in 1984 tardo became president of the parish but he was not 
reelected in 1987 it was then africk said that tardo and 
mcclendon a former police officer in baton rouge and new orleans 
decided to kill breaux with a bomb 
mcclendon enlisted the help of bergeron a former houma 
policeman and later tullier to create the remotecontrol bomb and 
plan its use 
federal authorities estimate that tardo paid mcclendon a total of 
34000 over the years to kill breaux several days after the 
bombing tardo gave mcclendon 8000 most of which went to tullier 
to buy cocaine for sale africk said

president hosni mubarak told visiting israeli 
journalists that by always rejecting arab overtures for peace their 
government is acting as the arabs did for 40 years 
you are still living in illusion everything has changed 
mubarak said sitting surrounded by israelis in a sunlit garden of a 
presidential palace we used to live in illusion before but got no 
result 
the arabs from 1947 until recently have been saying no to every 
israeli suggestion now i find you have become like the arabs of 
old we are saying yes you are saying no 
in december the palestine liberation organization through its 
chairman yasser arafat renounced terror as a weapon in its fight 
for a homeland and recognized for the first time that israel too has 
a right to exist in the middle east 
ezer weizman israels minister of science and research sat next 
to mubarak during wednesdays news conference weizman who had just 
held talks with mubarak was among several israeli cabinit ministers 
in cairo since sunday for a seminar on middle east peace 
the session occurred days before the 10th anniversary on sunday 
of egypts peace treaty with israel still the only peace accord 
between an arab country and the jewish state 
citing arafats december proclamations as evidence mubarak said 
the arabs have changed their intransigent positions and are making 
proposals for peace he said they encounter repeated negativism from 
israel which has refused to deal with the plo 
mubarak noted that there has been discord in the region for four 
decades and warned that 40 more years without peace would be 
disastrous especially in light of the new weapons of mass 
destruction 
the only answer he said is for israel to talk peace with the 
plo repeating a common egyptian theme 
theres no way dont bother you will have to talk to the 
plo the president said 
we cant fool ourselves the plo is everywhere those at your 
end wont stop unless they have some hope in life believe me they 
wont talk to you alone and i know what i am saying 
he referred to palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip who 
for the last 15 months have had almost daily riots against israels 
occupying forces israel seized the west bank and gaza in the 1967 
middle east war 
the conference was mostly in arabic mubarak usually 
mildmannered appeared sometimes angered sometimes exasperated in 
his comments 
joking with peace advocate abie nathan who said he would beam 
arabic lessons on a radio station he runs mubarak said in english 
i am giving you a good lesson in the arabic language to persuade 
your people to learn arabic and cooperate with the arab people 
then changing to a more serious tone he said 
you are living in an arab world its better just to cooperate

a man convicted of torturing and murdering 
his sisterinlaw and trying to kill his wife should spend the rest 
of his life behind bars said the judge who sentenced him 
you must never be free you must never be in a position where 
this can happen again circuit judge gary carlson told john r 
weber as he sentenced him wednesday to life plus 164 years nine 
months in prison 
weber 25 of phillips was charged with 18 counts in the 1986

murder of his 22yearold wife in september in this northern 
wisconsin town

firstdegree murder of miss lenz and the attempted murder of his 
wife but pleaded innocent to charges of sexual assault and 
mutilation 
a jury convicted him of the sexual assault and mutilation charges 
and decided weber was sane at the time of the attacks 
webers attorney has said he will appeal 
among the evidence was a tape recording describing the slaying 
that weber said he made to scare his wife but never played for her 
this court must insure that no other unsuspecting female is 
ever exposed to your depravity there is no way that i could face 
the family of such a girl the judge said 
webers wife said she was satisfied with the sentence weber was 
accused of using a lighted cigar safety pin and wheelbarrow handle 
to assault her before beating her with a shovel

a group of cree indians who are asking the 
american museum of natural history to return a sacred symbol will be 
true to their heritage and wait patiently for the museums decision 
their spokesman said 
after meeting with jim thunder and three other cree indians from 
western canada wednesday museum officials said it could take them a 
week to decide whether to give up the cloth bundle holding bear 
claws sweet grass and a clump of tobacco 
officials are concerned about jim thunders standing among the 
cree people his selfproclaimed mandate to claim the object and 
his relationship to chief big bear who created the relic more than 
150 years ago museum spokesman herb kurz said 
thunder completed a 2700mile run from edmonton alberta on 
tuesday to voice his claim for the artifact 
the 38yearold cree has said he was inspired by numerous dreams 
and visions in which big bear directed him to fetch the sacred 
bundle which has been in the museum collection for more than 50 
years thunder wants to return it to his people for use in 
traditional religious ceremonies 
its our tradition as cree people to respect and have patience 
the bundle is away for 55 years so i think we can wait for another 
few days said lewis cardinal spokesman for the indians 
kurz said a curator in the anthropology department would consider 
thunders presentation and make a recommendation to museum 
officials he said thunder had downplayed his role as a political 
representative of the cree and stressed that he had a spiritual 
mandate to return the relic 
to us a political mandate would be to make it as simple as 
possible numbers of persons who agree that he should be the person 
to take it out of the museum kurz said 
other cree whom kurz would not identify have told museum 
officials thunder does not represent the majority of their people 
and have asked that the museum keep the sacred bundle in its 
collection or give it to them the spokesman said 
thunder admits he is not a blood relative of the chief he was 
adopted several years ago by a woman who was big bears 
greatgranddaughter 
the sacred bundle made by big bear when he was 13 years old was 
given to a museum anthropologist in 1934 for safekeeping by a son of 
big bear since then it has been in the museums research 
department but has never been on public display

more than 120 people have been killed 
this week in an upsurge of political violence by sinhalese 
extremists trying to topple the sinhalesedominated government 
authorities said 
the government of president ranasinghe premadasa has vowed to 
deal harshly with the rebels who it blames for the rise in murders 
on this strifetorn indian ocean island 
we have to get rid of subversives one day or another the 
sooner the better deputy defense minister ranjan wijeratne told a 
news conference late wednesday 
wijeratne said at least 60 people were killed in northern 
anuradhapura province on tuesday a buddhist holiday 
officials said at least 53 people were killed sunday and monday 
and nine were killed wednesday as the extremists crippled the island 
with a daylong strike by threatening violence against anyone trying 
to do business 
most of the victims have been members of the governing united 
national party or policemen wijeratne said 
the laws will be ameded to strengthen the hand of the security 
forces against the subversives he said late wendesday we are 
now working without emergency laws subversives cannot be controlled 
by ordinary laws 
subversives is the official term for members of the extremist 
peoples liberation front which contends the government has offered 
too many concessions to the minority tamils who have been fighting 
for a separate homeland in the north and east since 1983 
wijeratne said the sinhalese extremists were killing security 
personnel and government suppoers because they were desperate 
following military and police operations 
the pressure is on them and we are closing in he said 
premadasa elected to a sixyear term on dec 19 took office on 
jan 2 the newly elected members of parliament controlled by the 
united national party were convened on march 9 
the front claims the elections were fraudulent 
tamils are mostly hindus and make up 18 percent of the islands 
16 million people they say they are denied jobs and education by 
the majority sinhalese who comprise 75 percent of the population 
and control the government and military 
the government signed an accord in july 1987 aimed at ending the 
insurgency by offering the tamils limited autonomy in exchange for 
surrender of weapons but many tamil militants rejected the accord 
as insufficient

foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze says a new 
parliament now being formed should debate foreign policy issues in 
order to prevent the kind of closeddoor decision making that sent 
soviet troops into afghanistan 
in an interview published wednesday by the government newspaper 
izvestiya shevardnadze said i foresee the time when open debates 
on some or other international problems will become natural 
practice 
high officials of the foreign ministry the minister included 
will be giving answers to informal questions from deputies when 
referendums and public opinion polls will be held before taking 
fundamental decisions he said 
the soviet policy of glasnost or greater openness on some 
issues has affected mainly internal issues dissent on questions of 
foreign policy has only recently surfaced in the media

consist of 750 representatives of the communist party its

members elected from geographical districts 
voting for geographical districts will take place sunday but the 
organizations are electing their deputies now the congress will 
then choose from among its members a new supreme soviet parliament 
shevardnadze said the new parliament by serving as a forum for 
foreign policy debates could bring about new forms of glasnost in 
foreign policy and diplomacy shevardnadze said 
president mikhail s gorbachev who launched the current 
reorganization also says the new legislature must take a greater 
role in setting policy 
under the soviet constitution any decision to use armed forces 
abroad must be sanctioned by the supreme soviet shevardnadze said 
top soviet officials have criticized the process that led to the 
afghanistan intervention in 1979 saying a narrow group of people 
made the decision without consulting anyone

bottomley told the house of commons that the new rules expected

first in an accident involving the transport of explosives since 
1957

the clean government party today joined other 
opposition groups in demanding the prime minister and his cabinet 
resign saying a stock scandal has stripped the government of its 
mandate to rule 
junya yano chairman of the secondlargest opposition party told 
reporters that public distrust in the government has reached a 
critical level because of the socalled recruit stock scandal 
involving prime minister noboru takeshita and a number of prominent 
figures in the governing circle 
an unpopular 3percent sales tax effective april 1 will further 
erode public confidence in government yano said 
the cabinet should immediately resign to let opposition parties 
form an interim government for the management of new general 
elections yano told a news conference at the japan national press 
club 
yano was referring to the recruit scandal in which the 
information conglomerate recruit co offered hundreds of thousands 
of unlisted shares in its real estate subsidiary to more than 150 
people including politicians bureaucrats and businessmen 
takeshitas secretary was implicated as was former prime 
minister yasuhiro nakasones secretary in the scandal in which many 
recipients of the stock sold the shares for handsome profits 
the scandal rocking the japanese establishment since the summer 
has seen the arrest of 13 people and the resignation of three 
cabinet ministers 
all opposition groups but the clean government party had been 
demanding that the cabinet resign and the powerful lower house of 
parliament be dissolved to clarify the responsibility of the 
government 
yano explained that his party had waited for takeshita to make an 
honorable retreat by dissolving the cabinet on his own initiative 
but we have come to a conclusion that mr takeshita has an 
illusion that he can survive the crisis now well fight to 
topple his government 
the clean government party backed by the huge buddhist 
organization soka gakkai has 200000 members nationwide and holds 
79 seats in the two houses of japans parliament making it the 
secondstrongest opposition force after the japan socialist party 
which has 128 seats

a man who claimed israeli agents killed his 
bride during a honeymoon cruise and framed him for the crime has 
been convicted of throwing her overboard to her death 
a federal jury wednesday found scott robin roston guilty of 
murder after three days of deliberation 
the prosecution said roston 36 of santa monica had argued with 
karen waltz roston 26 and choked her and tossed her over the 
railing as the ship headed toward southern california in 1988 at the 
end of a threeday cruise to mexico 
rostons defense was that israeli agents on board drugged him and 
killed his wife for writing the book nightmare in israel in 
which he claimed he was brutalized in an israeli mental hospital 
after his arrest on a robbery charge 
the defense was absurd his claim was absurd us attorney 
robert c bonner said at a news conference 
the defense called no witnesses the prosecution offered 
testimony from one of two israelis a jerusalem photographer who 
had been aboard the ship the man denied he was a government agent 
hes disappointed defense attorney david kenner said of 
roston scott feels that its incomprehensible for anyone to 
believe that he would have killed his wife that he loved very 
dearly 
kenner said he will appeal on the ground that us courts lacked 
jurisdiction because the ship was registered in the bahamas and the 
crime took place on the high seas 
assistant us attorney kendra mcnally said the ship was partly 
owned by americans conferring jurisdiction here 
federal guidelines call for 11 to 14 years in prison but the 
judge could sentence roston to up to life sentencing was set for 
june 5 
jury forewoman theresa mattaddocon said jurors immediately 
rejected the claim about israeli agents 
why on a honeymoon cruise would a man take his brides life 
that bothered all of us said another juror patricia kellogg 
we couldnt get into his mind we could only surmise it was a fit 
of anger 
mrs rostons body was found 30 miles off san diego an autopsy 
revealed she died of strangulation associated with drowning

victory in the referendum and could be pressured into calling new 
elections many south koreans are critical of the government for 
failing to sever links with rohs authoritarian predecessor former 
president chun doohwan

plo chief yasser arafat said today he is 
convinced the bush administration favors in principle convening an 
international middle east peace conference 
his comments came one day after us and plo representatives 
talked for 4 hours in their first formal meeting since bush took 
office 
the united states talked about reducing tension in the 
israelioccupied lands but the plo vowed the palestinian uprising 
will not let up until israel withdraws from the territories 
arafat told reporters today that the palestine liberation 
organization believes the only solution to the middle east crisis is 
an international conference involving all of the parties including 
the plo israel and the five permanent members of the un security 
council 
as for the american administration they are for an 
international conference in principle but say it should be very well 
prepared the plo chairman asserted 
israel opposes the idea of an international conference as it 
does the american decision to talk with the plo the reagan 
administration while not enthusiastic about an international 
conference said such a conference could be helpful if it led to 
direct arabisraeli talks 
arafat speaking to reporters in a plo office said a leadership 
meeting was held wednesday night 
our evaluation one is that we consider that the content of 
the meeting was a positive one and second it was a serious one in 
so far as the topics on the agenda were concerned said arafat 
wearing his traditional arab headdress and green military uniform 
we consider the meeting an indication of the new american 
administration is seriously interested in this ploamerican 
dialogue 
officials at the us embassy in tunis refused to discuss the 
meeting and referred all queries or requests for comment to the us 
state department 
arafat said it was israels responsibility to ease tension in the 
west bank and gaza strip where more than 400 palestinians and 17 
israelis have died in the 15monthold uprising 
i understand that a request for reducing tension is directed at 
israel because it is israel that is causing the tension not only 
the army but settler groups using arms against palestinians 
arafat said 
a first contact between the united states and the plo occurred 
dec 16 shortly after washington reversed a 13year policy of 
refusing to deal with the plo that decision followed arafats 
public renunciation of terrorism and recognition of israels right 
to exist 
wednesdays session was the first to get down to the substantive 
issues of peace and conflict in the middle east terrorism 
negotiations and who represents the palestinian people delegates 
from both sides said 
israel rejects the plo as a terrorist organization 
asked by reporters if the united states demanded the plo put an 
end to the uprising arafat said no such request was presented by 
anyone and no one can ask us to do that no one can stop a people 
from resisting occupation 
no date for a further session was announced but both american 
and plo officials said they fully expected the talks to continue 
the issues wont be finished in one meeting even two said 
the chief plo delegate yasser abedrabbo 
the leading us delegate ambassador robert h pelletreau said 
he focused on practical steps which can be taken to reduce 
tensions in the occupied territories and lead to direct 
negotiations 
abedrabbo said he stressed to the americans that the source of 
the violence in the territories was the israeli occupation and the 
israeli repressive measures he said the uprising will 
continue until the israelis evacuate our homeland 
neither side was precise about what proposals may have been made 
with regard to the territories or specific areas discussed

the city council approved mandatory drug tests for 
city employees but did not extend the policy to itself even after 
one member said he had abused just about everything 
instead the council on wednesday approved a measure asking 
members to take voluntary drug tests 
i have smoked snorted sneezed drank just about 
everything said councilman al lipscomb 64 i have abused 
drugs alcohol et al lets show some leadership and be the first 
to take the test 
but after an hours debate his amendment proposing that council 
members be tested for drugs before city employees was defeated 83 
lipscomb an independent councilman known for his outspokenness 
said today that he used drugs in the 1940s and the 1950s but quit 
when i found the lord 
i took drugs in the days i was sowing my oats he said we 
called it reefer back then i havent been 64 always 
the drug policy for city employees takes effect oct 1 and 
stipulates that all people applying for safety sensitive 
positions such as driver mechanic and maintenance worker must 
take drug and alcohol tests to be hired about twothirds of city 
jobs fall under the policy 
in addition an employee would be asked to take drug or alcohol 
tests if two supervisors determined there was reasonable 
suspicion that the employee was using drugs or alcohol 
an employee who refused testing could face disciplinary action 
city attorney analeslie muncy said she did not think lipscombs 
proposed amendment would have withstood a legal challenge because 
council members are not in safety sensitive positions and 
because the test would be required without reasonable suspicion 
on tuesday the us supreme court upheld drug testing for 
railway workers involved in accidents and by a narrower margin 
for customs service workers seeking assignments as drug enforcement 
agents or in jobs requiring them to carry firearms experts were 
divided on whether the rulings mean the justices would be likely to 
accept drug testing for many other types of workers 
nancy burkett business manager for the american federation of 
state county and municipal employees argued against the city drug 
policy and said the council was yielding to hysteria sweeping out 
of washington 
there is no evidence that a drug problem exists among city 
employees said ms burkett whose organization represents 400 of 
dallas 13000 city workers

a us supreme court ruling striking down the 
citys equal division of political power among five boroughs with 
huge population differences prompted an immediate threat of 
secession from staten island 
mayor edward i koch responded that he would protect the 
interests of staten island the least populous borough 
the board of estimate a body unique to new york city is a 
substantial departure from the oneperson onevote ideal justice 
byron r white wrote in the unanimous ruling striking down the 
citys form of government wednesday 
the justices upheld a us court of appeals ruling requiring a 
plan that meets that standard currently staten island with fewer 
than 400000 residents has the same voting power on the board as 
brooklyn with 22 million 
the board governs everything from landuse decisions to setting 
sewer and water rates negotiating city contracts and awarding 
franchises and leasing property it also has partial authority for 
the citys 25 billion budget 
its powers are greater than those of city council a lawmaking 
body whose 35 representatives are elected from proportional 
districts citywide 
the board is made up of the five borough presidents each with 
one vote and three citywide elected officials the mayor 
comptroller and city council president each with two votes 
it was created in 1898 when the bronx brooklyn manhattan 
queens and staten island joined to form new york city 
white said the underrepresentation on the board for the citys 
largest boroughs is severe and he rejected arguments that the 
makeup legitimately balances regional interests 
he said a voter is shortchanged if he may vote for one 
representative and the voters in another district half the size also 
elect one representative 
the ruling left city government in disarray before novembers 
elections in which all eight positions on the board will be 
decided it also renewed calls from the smallest borough that it 
leave the city 
staten island would be better off back under the rule of george 
iii said state sen john marchi who is sponsoring a bill in 
albany to have his borough leave new york city 
the ruling drops 400000 staten islanders into a colonial state 
by effectively separating them from the governance of the larger 
community in which we live said marchi 
the boroughs president ralph lamberti said i will not stand 
up as a representative of 400000 people and lead them in a colony 
state 
but he added that if a new voting system reduces staten islands 
participation in government to that of a spectator he would 
give serious consideration to seceding 
the mayor said hes concerned about the problem adding well 
find a way to protect staten island ill protect it 
after the lower court ruling koch appointed a charter revision 
commission which he said would now move full speed ahead with a 
new governing plan in time for a november referendum 
koch said he expects the high court will allow the board to 
function until a substitute can be authorized he also said that 
while he favored continuing the board i never believed we could 
win it in court 
the city population is more than 7 million with wide disparities 
in the size of the boroughs besides brooklyns 22 million people 
queens has 19 million manhattan 14 million and the bronx 12 
million 
the presidents of brooklyn queens and manhattan called for the 
board to be revised by weighting voting according to population but 
bronx borough president fernando ferrer opposed weighted voting and 
instead urged a county executive form of government in each borough 
removing some power from city hall 
city council president andrew stein said he wasnt sure if the 
board should change to weighted voting but added that he was 
confident his own office will have a strong role in the new 
setup 
comptroller harrison j goldin who is expected to run against 
koch for mayor said an alternative government should make it 
impossible for a centralized administration to run roughshod over 
communities which until now have had direct input into decisions 
affecting them

two scientists claim to have carried controlled 
nuclear fusion in a test tube using a ridiculously simple 
technique that could transform the worlds energy resources it was 
reported today 
if their discovery is confirmed they will have gone a long way 
toward taming the forces powering the sun and the hydrogen bomb 
the financial times said these could provide virtually unlimited 
clean and inexpensive energy 
the paper identified the scientists as martin fleischmann of 
southampton university in england and stan pons of the university of 
utah a formal announcement will be made in salt lake city later 
today 
nuclear fusion is regarded as sciences next great frontier in 
developing new sources of energy but has generally been considered 
to be years away from commercial exploitation it differs from 
conventional processes in that it fuses atoms rather than splits 
them 
the financial times said the two scientists have apparently 
done in a simple laboratory what has not been achieved by gigantic 
projects costing hundreds of millions of dollars a year 
the fleischmannpons experiments technically are no more 
complex than the practical work done by chemistry undergraduates 
they use electrochemical techniques to achieve fusion of deuterium 
nuclei trapped inside an electrode made from palladium a metal 
similar to platinum the financial times said 
dr mick lomer head of the uk atomic energy authoritys fusion 
laboratory told the newspaper were approaching it with a 
skeptical but open mind we shall be doing our utmost to reproduce 
the experiment 
fusion produces little radioactive waste its material 
deuterium is abundant in seawater and fusion reactors are expected 
to be safer than fission reactors because the fusion process would 
shut down if anything went wrong one past problem has been safely 
containing the reaction 
the newspaper quoted fleischmann as saying what we have done 
is open the door to a new area of research our indications are that 
the discovery will be reasonably easy to make into a usable 
technology for generating heat and power but a lot more work is 
needed to prove its validity further and then to develop practical 
generating devices 
he was quoted as saying the nature of the experiment is 
ridiculously simple yet in a way so farfetched that we decided 
not to raise money from external sources but to finance the early 
work ourselves 
the paper said physicists find it hard to believe the deuterium 
nuclei could be squeezed together enough for fusion to occur 
in a separate report the financial times said the discovery 
could transform the outlook for the worlds energy supplies in the 
next century 
it said the idea for the experiment originated in the 1960s and 
pons and fleischmann began discussing possible test methods while 
working together at southhampton and then at salt lake city 
stan and i often talk of doing insane experiments said 
fleischmann 61 we each have a good track record of getting 
impossible experiments to work in this case the stakes were so 
high that we just had to try out the idea

illinois highest court has barred 
authorities from closing down an adult bookstore under the states 
public nuisance law 
the illinois supreme court ruled 42 on wednesday that the law 
could not be used against the denmark ii bookstore near aurora 
because it might prevent the sale of nonobscene books and magazines 
protected by the first amendment 
states attorney dallas ingemunson who filed 44 criminal 
obscenity cases against the bookstore from 1982 to 1986 expressed 
disappointment at the ruling which he said would be appealed to the 
us supreme court 
because of obscenity violations a lowercourt judge had ordered 
the store to close or post a 5000 bond to be forfeited if the sale 
of obscene matter resumed 
the store persisted and was ordered closed in 1987 under a law 
that allows a judge to shut down a building for a year if it is 
deemed a public nuisance 
the high court said the order to post bond or close smacks of 
prior restraint which is unconstitutional the justices noted 
that in a dozen previous trials some of the magazines sold at the 
store were found not to be obscene 
justice william clark said the law takes a blunderbuss approach 
to the regulation of obscenity and that law enforcement officials 
had far less draconian means available including prosecuting 
smut peddlers 
justice ben miller in a dissent said the closeandbond 
provision doesnt restrict free speech because the bookstore can 
remain open as long as it sells nonobscene material

the legislature in a southern 
province today approved constitutional amendments that would reduce 
its autonomy prompting clashes between police and thousands of 
ethnic albanians opposed to the change 
the tanjug news agency said the amendments were approved by 176 
of the 188 kosovo province lawmakers they are designed to give the 
countrys largest republic of mainly christian serbia a greater 
degree of control over the affairs of kosovo which has a mainly 
moslem ethnic albanian majority 
it was not immediately clear why the deputies about 80 percent 
of whom are ethnic albanian would vote for the measure but there 
was a report that some deputies may have been intimidated by state 
security police 
the decision prompted demontrations by about 3000 people in the 
town of urosevac in kosovo province hundreds of clubwielding 
police dispersed the protesters who were chanting slogans against 
the changes tanjug said 
police also stopped about 200 ethnic albanian women and children 
who attempted to march in protest from urosevac to pristina 
witnesses said 
urosevac is 15 miles north of the provincial capital pristina 
ethnic albanians who make up about 85 percent of kosovos 18 
million inhabitants have in the past opposed the changes claiming 
they would restrict wide autonomy granted to the region by the 
yugoslavias 1974 constitution 
more than 100000 ethnic albanians demonstrated in november in 
pristina and thousands walked off their jobs in february to protest 
the amendments 
the protests prompted yugoslavias federal presidency to impose a 
partial state of emergency in the province last month 
under todays changes serbia would no longer need the approval 
of kosovos parliament to approve amendments in the serbian 
constitution that affect the province serbia would also get tighter 
control over the judiciary and police 
serbian authorities have been pressing for the changes of the 
constitution claiming they are necessary to provide greater 
security for kosovos mainly serbian minority which they claim is 
being harassed and forced to emigrate from the region by the ethnic 
albanian majority 
ethnic albanians have disputed this claim contending that the 
serbians are emigrating from the province due to its severe economic 
problems which include a 30 percent unemployment rate and average 
monthly incomes of less than 100 
ethnic albanians say that if the kosovo legislatures approval is 
no longer necessary for future constitutional changes such rights 
as the use of the albanian language in official matters and in 
education could be restricted 
the mladina biweekly from yugoslavias northern republic of 
slovenia reported in its current issue that a considerable number of 
the deputies in kosovos parliament have been invited in the 
past few days by the state security police for talks and 
consultations on how they would vote 
several intellectuals from the countrys other republics have 
claimed that the vote in kosovos parliament on the amendments was 
undemocratic since it is conducted amid emergency measures in the 
province

the federal communications commission has 
ordered the nations local telephone companies to reduce their 
interstate calling access charges by 705 million which will 
require american telephone amp telegraph co to cut its longdistance 
rates again 
the fcc on wednesday directed local exchange carriers to file 
revisions to their interstate access rates to be effective april 1 
the local companies last dec 30 proposed reductions of 489 
million in the charges they levy on atampt and other longdistance 
carriers to connect with the local phone networks 
the fcc said that based upon data collected since their december 
filing the local companies had understated expected demand and 
costs 
atampt last month proposed a 533 million reduction in rates 
effective april 1 to reflect the anticipated lower charges it would 
have to pay the local companies 
the 533 million cut also reflected savings to atampt from the 
scheduled april 1 increase in the socalled subscriber line charge 
that residential and small business customers pay to maintain the 
local phone system that charge rises by 30 cents a month to 350 
on april 1 
with residential and business users paying more atampt has to pay 
less and the fcc requires atampt to pass those savings along to its 
customers atampts longdistance competitors generally have followed 
suit 
it was not immediately clear how much atampt would have to adjust 
its proposed cuts on april 1 
that reduction would be the eighth for atampt since 1984 when the 
company shed its local operating companies 
atampts rates have dropped about 39 percent during that period

officials of eastern airlines striking 
machinists union and pilots union will sit on a creditors committee 
that will review any bankruptcy reorganization plan the crippled 
carrier proposes 
the union representing the airlines flight attendants didnt get 
a seat on the committee a move their union president today called a 
slap in the face however the creditors panel does include a 
representative of nonunion employees most of whom were laid off a 
few days after the machinists walkout began and are demanding back 
pay 
harold jones the federal trustee supervising easterns 
bankruptcy reorganization appointed the 15member committee 
wednesday in addition to the employee representatives the members 
are mainly from aircraft and engine makers banks and bondholders 
that have claims against eastern 
in tallahassee fla a federal appeals court today was scheduled 
to hear an eastern request to force pilots to cross machinists 
picket lines and go back to work 
the machinists struck the airline on march 4 after 17 months of 
contract wrangling the pilots support for the walkout virtually 
grounded eastern and forced it to file for protection from its 
creditors under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code march 9 
the eastern pilots are owed more than 500 million in back pay 
and other claims said ron cole a spokesman in miami for the air 
line pilots association 
flight attendants also have honored the machinists picket lines 
the creditors committee has the right to review any 
reorganization plan proposed by eastern and can propose its own plan 
to the bankruptcy judge the unions have opposed easterns plans to 
sell assets including its agreement to sell its northeast shuttle 
to developer donald trump 
jones told a gathering of 400 creditor representatives financial 
analysts and reporters the role of the creditors panel is far 
more expansive than his 
eastern says it has 59 billion in assets and 45 billion in 
liabilities unsecured creditors such as ticketholders and travel 
agents are the most likely to lose money in a bankruptcy 
reorganization because they have no collateral from the debtor in 
case of default 
the airlines secured creditors met with eastern president phil 
bakes on tuesday 
easterns liabilities include 165 million in unused tickets 
issued to passengers airline attorney harvey miller told the 
creditors meeting 
the objective of chapter 11 is to rebuild eastern said 
miller it is easterns plan to resuscitate the airline and build 
back its flight schedule 
the embattled airline recently started advertising for new pilots 
because only about 200 of its 3600 pilots have crossed picket 
lines the airline has been operating less than 10 percent of its 
normal schedule of 1040 flights a day mainly its northeast shuttle 
and latin american routes 
the committee representative for nonunion employees is mary 
grace shore she is an elected representative of a group called 
peace or positive employee action committee at eastern which union 
officials allege is sponsored by eastern management 
mary jane barry president of a transport workers union local 
representing eastern flight attendants said in a telephone 
interview from miami that the unions exclusion from the panel is a 
slap in the face 
i think its quite insulting that every employee group at 
eastern is on the creditors committee except the flight 
attendants she said 
she asserted that ms shore is really a representative of eastern 
management and that peace is nothing but a unionbusting group of 
people

fawn hall dissolved in tears today on the 
witness stand as she described her former boss oliver north as a 
tireless worker at the national security council 
testifying at norths trial on 12 criminal charges she said that 
in many cases i would be almost falling asleep at the typewriter 
while north worked extraordinarily long hours at the nsc 
he was an excellent man to work for she said 
she began to cry as she told north lawyer brendan sullivan that 
she had met colonel north his wife betsy and their four kids in 
easter of 1983 
when sullivan asked her to describe the work pace she responded 
that it was pretty crazy and that north would work at the nsc 
late into the night while everyone else would be at home with 
their wife and family 
sullivan asked for a break after hall starting to tell a story 
about an american who was shot on the honduran border 
appeared unable to go on 
it was the second interruption of the morning so that ms hall 
could compose herself 
earlier she requested a break after questioning from prosecutor 
john keker who kept referring to earlier testimony she had given to 
congress and a grand jury 
she told congress and a federal grand jury in 1987 that north had 
specifically instructed her to retype memos detailing his deep 
involvement with the contras 
in front of the north jury she said she recalled that he asked 
her to make changes but she said i dont remember the exact 
word that its very hard to remember what happened three years 
ago 
sullivan led her gently through the documentshredding episode 
she had testified to before and asked her how long it took 
i really dont know she said i was not looking at the 
clock i was just doing my job 
it wasnt lock door pull down windows pull down the 
shades she added it was no big deal 
when she learned on nov 25 1986 that thenpresident reagan had 
fired north she said i was very upset it was very unfair 
her testimony which began in midafternoon wednesday was 
completed before noon and miss hall left the stand appearing weary 
at one point during her testimony ms hall began talking at the 
same time as us district judge gerhard a gesell who told her 
please keep your mouth shut while i am talking 
gesell then admonished keker saying ms halls earlier testimony 
was wholly consistent with her later statements 
when keker resumed questioning she asked could i take a 
break she stepped off the witness stand appearing distraught and 
returned five minutes later 
in grand jury testimony in march 1987 she said she deleted 
altered documents from her word processor she told the north jury 
she wasnt certain she did that 
she testified in 1987 that she told north the day he was fired 
that she was smuggling documents out of the nsc offices she told 
the north jury she simply asked him whether he could see anything in 
her back 
she testified in 1987 that she recalled north and lawyer thomas 
green chuckling in the car after she pulled the smuggled documents 
out of her boots and back of her skirt on nov 25 1986 she told 
the north jury that i dont really have a recollection of that 
but acknowledged her earlier grand jury testimony was accurate 
she insisted there was no agreement among her north and another 
nsc staffer col robert earl to keep quiet about altered 
documents shredding and smuggling papers out of the nsc as the 
irancontra affair came unraveled 
she said that when the los angeles times ran a story on 
thanksgiving day 1986 saying there had been shredding at the nsc 
offices she was contacted by thenwhite house counsel now us 
attorney jay stephens 
i said that we shredded every day said ms hall 
asked whether she told stephens there had been an unusually large 
amount of shredding she replied i dont believe i did 
asked whether she told stephens she had altered documents and 
smuggled some out of the nsc she twice replied no i didnt 
asked why she didnt tell stephens about the smuggled documents 
she said i dont know he may not have asked 
in testimony wednesday ms hall acknowledged that north joked 
about going to jail in 1985 when she typed false letters to congress 
denying that north was involved with the contras north now is 
charged with lying to congress 
colonel north made jokes and there were jokes made about 
going to jail hall testified he is one to jest often he had 
a great sense of humor 
hall described how at norths instructions on nov 21 1986 the 
day before the attorney generals aides began combing national 
security council files for evidence of the irancontra affair she 
altered several classified memos 
the documents described norths recommendations to his superiors 
on how to help the contras including providing aid to guatemala 
after military officials there supplied phony enduser certificates 
for arms shipments to the contras the memos also referred to 
thirdcountry assistance to the contras and the possibility of 
seizing an arms shipment headed for nicaragua 
former national security adviser robert mcfarlane had raised 
questions about those memos with north in 1985 shortly before 
mcfarlane signed the letters to congress containing denials of nsc 
assistance to the contras

the zimbabwe red cross has launched an 
appeal for donkeys to replace wheelchairs used by disabled people in 
the countryside 
what is the point of giving a disabled person a wheelchair in 
the rural areas where you know its unnavigable and long distances 
are involved said spokesman victor chitongo 
a donkey has been found to be suitable because its unlike a 
wheelchair which needs repairs he said it feeds while the user 
is in class the only problem arises when it cant be used to 
take the disabled to the toilet 
chitongo said the society was willing to pay about 15 for each 
donkey about a tenth the cost of a wheelchair

when george and barbara bush are traveling the 
job of walking the first dog belongs to longtime family retainer don 
rhodes a shy awshucks texan who is known around the white house 
as millies best friend 
rhodes doesnt see much these days of his pal millie the bushes 
2yearold english springer spaniel because she is busy nursing her 
first litter of six puppies they were born last weekend with mrs 
bush serving as midwife 
when the bushes are home the first lady feeds millie herself and 
walks her around the white house south lawn three or four times a 
day rhodes says the president occasionally takes the first pooch 
along for an evening stroll around the south lawn after dinner 
but when theyre away rhodes finds millie in the secondfloor 
family quarters of the white house pats her head tosses an old 
tennis ball for her to retrieve her favorite game and takes her 
outside for some exercise 
rhodes 51 is a lifelong bachelor who lives in a small apartment 
on capitol hill hes never owned a dog yet he and millie share 
that special sort of chemistry that produces strong bonds of 
affection and loyalty between man and dog 
she always stops and wags her tail when she sees me coming 
says rhodes his voice as soft and gentle as the wind whispering 
through the piney woods of east texas 
shes a very friendly dog he said shes nice to 
everybody although shes sort of bashful with strangers she likes 
to please people so to speak 
shes not a rambunctious dog some peoples dogs start running 
and barking and jumping on you shes just the opposite she very 
seldom barks unless shes shut away in a room shes a little 
lady 
millies real name is mildred kerr bush named after a houston 
friend of mrs bush the dog was given to mrs bush in february 1987 
by william s farish a wealthy kentucky horse breeder and 
republican supporter shortly after the death of her beloved cocker 
spaniel c fred bush 
millies first litter five females and one male was sired by 
tug farish iii a yearold springer spaniel from the farish farm at 
versailles ky where millie was born the puppies like their 
parents are white with livercolored spots 
rhodes has been bushs loyal personal assistant for the past 
quartercentury they met in 1964 when rhodes was a student at 
texas aampm university and bush campaigning unsuccessfully for the 
us senate gave a campus speech that rhodes liked 
bush hired the young campaign volunteer from houston as a file 
clerk after bush was elected to the house in 1966 and rhodes has 
been on the bush payroll ever since 
nowadays from a small office in the east wing of the white 
house rhodes handles the presidents personal mail pays his 
incidental bills and runs errands for the bushes 
im just a waterboy he says with a smile 
the bushes however consider him a close friend last year they 
invited rhodes to join the family for thanksgiving dinner at their 
kennebunkport maine vacation home 
rhodes steadfastly refused to allow a photographer to take his 
picture posing with millie or even alone 
im bashful too he said

civic duty came as a shock to 12 people 
who were minding their own business in a courthouse when a burly 
deputy seized their drivers licenses and told them they were 
prospective jurors 
i dont mind jury duty but the way it happened was rather 
frightening said paul croskrey who with 11 other unhappy people 
was pressed into service at the order of superior court judge 
richard bartalini last week 
bartalini took the unusual step after he ran out of potential 
jurors in a murder case thursday and he still needed two alternates 
to complete the jury roster invoking a rarely used law the judge 
sent his deputy to go find some jury candidates 
lets say some were more understanding than others said sgt 
george tarnow who told the recruits they couldnt leave the 
building by an order of the court 
tarnow picked the 12 from a line at a window where tickets for 
traffic violations and other minor offenses are paid or assigned 
court dates they were threatened with jail if they didnt come with 
him 
bartalini told them the case they might hear could take as long 
as a month 
they were not happy to be there said assistant public 
defender howard bloom you could hear the breath whistling out of 
people 
but the two who were eventually chosen as alternate jurors and 
the other jurors who had been chosen earlier in the day were 
thanked and sent home when they showed up for the trial monday the 
defendant had entered a lastminute plea of no contest to a lesser 
charge of voluntary manslaughter

short or long skirts fitted or trapeze coats the 
fashion capital saw several silhouettes during the winter 
readytowear fashion circus 
as fashion sails into the 1990s the passage may be a bit rough 
for women looking for direction and designers who dont seem to know 
where to turn 
but the good news is that individuals are truly free to choose 
their style whether in pants and skirts or jackets and coats and 
there is no evidence of designers conspiring to put women into 
stylishly ridiculous gear 
those fed up with the skirtlength dilemma may just abandon the 
skirt altogether and wear a beautiful hacking jacket or dressier 
model over opaque tights as lagerfeld displayed at both his own and 
at the chanel collection with an elegant bow to the 1960s 
elsewhere skirts were the familiar short lengths to just above 
the knee or nearly anklelength in trumpet shapes pleated or 
handsome in a circle of leather at ungaro 
christian lacroix went his own eccentric way showing softly 
feminine silhouettes and his favorite flowing trapeze styles some 
loved his loud patchwork looks for readytowear others were 
dazzled by his more expensive luxe collection shimmering with 
byzantine splendor 
shoulders were softened or reduced to natural proportions in 
feminine silhouettes that marked the waist without undue emphasis 
the new long jacket was gently fitted sometimes with a 
martingale belting the back while some were asymmetrical in front 
or outlined in bold piping yet others appeared in swallowtail or 
cutaway style 
snug spencers battle jackets and boleros shared the honors for 
diminutive jacket styles 
from the mens wardrobe but looking handsomely feminine were 
pinstriped bankers suits at hanae mori and the straight tweed 
trousers pleated at the waist by master tailors yves saint laurent 
and jeanlouis scherrer 
long redingotes and short hooded duffel jackets looked terrific 
but paris also offers some handsome belted trenches lounging coats 
or car coats in luxury cashmere or wool blends sometimes collared 
and lined with generous lashings of fur 
capes were a big item at saint laurent and patrick kelly whose 
little red riding hood was a showstealer and italians angelo 
tarlazzi and romeo gigli placed their models in cocoon coats 
giglis fabulous byzantineembroidered cocoon made news over his 
outfits in butterflylight fabrics 
the color spectrum zoomed from a range of darks especially 
chocolate brown and charcoal to autumnal beaujolais cognac 
caramel gold mustard olive forest green and misty shades of 
lavender and pink 
claude montanas collection brought out hues of blue from 
glacier to deep petrol in his trouser suits 
but there were hot colors too and those who love red will be 
happy as every shade pepped up the runways from garnet 
fireengine or poppy to orangecoral fuchsia and magenta 
the fabrics gave new softness to the clothes with flecked 
tweeds big and bold glen or windowpane grid plaids looking peppy 
when placed on the diagonal 
buttersoft leather calfskin or suede gave the appeal of luxury 
to many outfits remarkable when appliqued with arabesque designs 
on short yves saint laurent jackets 
a taste for exoticism ran to wildanimal prints done in various 
styles and fabrics at hanae mori scherrer lacroix and kelly but 
the only true furs seen were fox vicuna mongolian lamb and mink 
montanas mink was amazing dyed in his favorite blues and ridged 
to look like chenille or corduroy otherwise coats looked 
appealingly warm in bright mohairs or shetland 
wool and silk jerseys were used generously in softer styles 
especially in dresses which made a modest comeback for day wear 
knits often had ethnic overtones black and white at chanel 
startlingly bright at lacroix 
for lateday the designers came up with some stunning cocktail 
suits or dresses with jackets all fit to sup at the ritz among 
the most memorable chanels lightly fitted gold corduroyridged 
lame jacket over a satinpiped wrapped skirt topped with floppy 
satin bows 
black velvet gave opulent allure to day or evening clothes and 
crimped panne or cut velvet added oldfashioned charm to much of the 
evening wear 
in fact fabrics for after sunset were so luxurious that they 
defined the lines of the outfit satin and slithery crepe de chine 
were favorites for slinky dinner gowns or pajamas 
black silk grain de poudre was used in all versions of the 
smoking or tuxedo style still a wardrobe staple whether with 
pants or a skirt 
sheer chiffon revealed body lines while iridescent taffeta 
lightly puffed around it in other models lame fabrics and 
embroidery made evening wear look bewitchingly shimmering sometimes 
sexy but never glitzy 
and the lame brocades at houses like hanae mori lacroix and 
saint laurent shone with an extra dash of exoticism as the designers 
went at least partly to the far east byzantium or north africa for 
inspiration

toshiba corp and fuji photo film co said thursday 
they will jointly develop a new type of electronic camera that can 
show photos on tv monitors immediately after the picture is taken 
without processing 
a similar camera was introduced by sony corp last year but the 
toshibafuji system is aimed to record images as digital signals 
enabling easy transmission of pictures using personal computers and 
telephone lines 
there are hundreds of advantages in the digitalized system 
said shozo iijima toshibas chief engineer the system will bring 
revolutionary changes in the field of still pictures 
digital electronic signals will be stored on a floppy disc inside 
the camera because it is recorded digitally pictures can be stored 
in personal computers iijima said 
the camera will be too costly for broad commercialization 
the memory portion of the system involving semiconductors is 
too expensive with the current cost of microchips iijima said 
so the main objective of our project is to lower the cost of the 
memory without reducing the quality of the picture 
officials of the two companies predicted the system will be 
available by 1990 for industrial use and by 1991 for commerical use 
toshiba and fuji film also said they plan to call on other 
electronic and camera manufacturers to standarize the format of the 
digital camera system

a new tower will be built to replace the 
900yearold structure that collapsed last week authorities 
announced thursday 
a request for the appropriation of funds had been filed to the 
government to restore the symbol of this city said lionello 
costanza fattori head of the regional office for protection of 
monuments 
four people were killed and 15 were injured when the 255foot 
tower collapsed march 17 onto a downtown square of this northern 
city 
city officials also announced they would inspect other medieval 
towers and monuments a 501yearold cathedral adjacent to the tower 
suffered substantial damage in the collapse 
experts said the collapse may have been caused by a sudden 
sinking following a threemonth dry spell that lowered the water 
table others blamed natural decay in the mortar holding the bricks 
together

between now and the end of april we will run a 34state field 
operation including targeting specific media markets said kate

the washingtonbased group describes itself as the largest 
national nonpartisan organization working solely to keep abortion

the economy expanded at a moderate 24 percent 
annual rate in the last three months of 1988 the government 
reported thursday but analysts said the figure was held down by 
last summers drought and masked strong underlying growth at years 
end 
the increase in the gross national product the broadest measure 
of economic health would have been closer to 35 percent last 
quarter were it not for the drought the commerce department said 
analysts are divided over how much of that momentum extended into 
1989 but most expect a slowdown as the aging economic expansion 
stretches through its seventh year 
the fourthquarter gnp figure was revised upward from an initial 
government estimate of 2 percent and contributed to growth of 39 
percent for all of 1988 the best showing since a 68 percent 
increase in 1984 
the upward revision underscores a banner year for the economy 
growthwise in 1988 and indicates the strong momentum that the 
economy carried over into 1989 said economist allen sinai of the 
boston co inc 
several recent government reports however have offered signs 
the economy already may be cooling off in response to efforts by the 
federal reserve board to raise interest rates to dampen inflationary 
pressures 
retail sales housing construction orders for durable goods and 
factory operating rates all were down last month while inflation 
remained above last years levels 
the federal reserve wants to slow growth to a more sustainable 
pace to reverse what fed chairman alan greenspan has called 
disturbing price increases although some critics are afraid the 
central bank could go too far and push the country into a recession 
economist lawrence chimerine of the wefa group in bala cynwyd 
pa said the critical question is how significantly the economy is 
cooling although it appears the nation is moving toward slower 
growth rather than an outright downturn 
its much too premature to conclude were heading into a 
recession chimerine said 
the feds antiinflation efforts and a trade deficit that is 
worsening as the export boom stalls both are expected to contribute 
to slower growth this year 
gnp growth is likely to decline by more than a percentage point 
in 1989 to around 27 percent analysts believe despite an 
anticipated sharp upswing in the first quarter due to a rebound from 
the drought 
the bush administration is counting on growth of 32 percent to 
help it reduce the federal budget deficit while adhering to the 
presidents no new taxes campaign pledge 
the government next month will release its initial estimate for 
gnp growth in the first quarter forecasters are pegging the figure 
at around 47 percent with a 25 percentagepoint boost from the 
farm rebound masking a broader economic slowdown 
michael evans head of a washington consulting firm said the 
economy could be particularly sluggish in the second half of this 
year with the risk of recession running at about 40 percent 
nevertheless the fed had no choice but to tighten its grip 
on the money supply given the troubling inflation numbers evans 
said 
some analysts warn the nation could experience a double negative 
this year if the economy cools but inflation fails to respond 
quickly to that slowdown 
this may be the year in which real growth may be slowing while 
inflation is accelerating said economist david jones of aubrey g 
lanston amp co 
an inflation index tied to the gnp rose at an annual rate of 53 
percent in the octoberdecember quarter up from 47 percent in the 
third quarter those figures represent high levels for the gnp 
deflator which had risen at an annual rate of 38 percent or less 
for the last three years 
corporate profits meanwhile were up 28 percent in the fourth 
quarter and 146 percent for all of 1988 the government reported 
last years increase was the biggest since a 224 percent 
postrecession jump in 1983 
the upward revision in last quarters gnp figure reflected higher 
government spending than earlier estimated and a smaller drop in 
business investment 
those gains were partially offset by a larger trade deficit as 
the gap between imports and exports grew at an annual rate of 115 
billion during the quarter the biggest widening in more than three 
years 
exports grew by 65 percent during the threemonth period but 
the increase was overwhelmed by a 135 percent rise in imports 
the gnps 24 percent rate of growth last quarter held back by 
the drought was the slowest advance since a 14 percent rise in the 
fourth quarter of 1986 and followed an increase of 25 percent in 
the third quarter which also was affected by the drought 
the economy expanded at a 34 percent clip in the first quarter 
of last year and at a 3 percent pace in the second

authorities searching the english 
channel for a container of deadly insecticide detected an object on 
sonar but it turned out to be a block of reinforced concrete the 
navy said thursday 
the container was lost when the indonesian ship perintis sank in 
a storm march 13 northwest of the channel islands 
ecologists say that if the containeer spills its six tons of 
toxic lindane insecticide it could cause an ecological disaster 
with dire consequences for the next 30 years 
lindane is used widely by european farmers and small amounts 
routinely wash down the rivers to the sea but large amounts of it 
would kill fish 
two french navy mine sweepers have been searching for the 
container in sometimes heavy seas and their sonar detected an 
object similar to the container wednesday 
but two minisubmarines determined the object lying in 400 feet 
of water near a world war ii ammunition dump was a block of concrete 
rhonepoulenc which manufactures lindane in france says it 
would not dissolve easily in the cold waters of the channel it is 
also well packed in strong plastic sacks inside the reinforced 
container company officials said 
the french government said small quantities of lindane had been 
traced in waters near the mouth of the seine river but added that 
these were normal and well below limits allowed in europe 
the container was originally retrieved with five others from the 
wreck of the perintis by the french navy but the container was lost 
again when tow ropes snapped as it was being hauled back to 
cherbourg port

arriving at last years academy awards was a 
featurelength disaster starring some of hollywoods biggest names 
this year some of the biggest names in city traffic control say 
there will be no sequel 
limousines making their way to the 1988 awards ceremony at the 
shrine auditorium came to a dead stop in sweltering smog many 
blocks short of their destination for hours they sat motionless in 
a highglamour gridlock as the clock ticked toward the televised 
shows opening credits 
acting nominee and presenter glenn close nine months pregnant 
finally emerged from her limo and hiked up jefferson boulevard to 
make the ceremony on time others followed suit among them olivia 
de havilland and meryl streep 
i saw quite a few gorgeous women holding their skirts with one 
hand and highheel shoes with the other out of breath and trying to 
get in on time said official oscar greeter army archerd 
hundreds of dollars in hairdressing and makeup were ruined 
because they had to run in the broiling sun he said 
a tribute to oscars 60th birthday presenting nominees from all 
59 previous ceremonies had to be scratched because so many 
principals were late 
it was a nightmare said davel limousines chauffeur rick 
cameron we actually rehearsed the drive the day before but we 
had no idea it would be as bad as it was he said he arrived with 
moments to spare 
another celebrity who got stuck was los angeles mayor tom 
bradley needless to say things will be done a little differently 
this year 
within days of last years debacle a team of traffic experts 
began work to assure a smooth street performance for the 61st 
academy awards next wednesday said timothy f crowder a city 
traffic engineer who handles special events 
the team concluded there were several problems including too 
many vehicles trying to squeeze through narrow royal street at the 
front of the auditorium to unload their passengers in a timely 
fashion 
among the changes this year is a different celebrity arrival area 
with five lanes to accommodate the big cars 
the number of traffic officers will be nearly doubled from last 
year crowder said along with street engineers trained to rearrange 
traffic patterns while an event is occurring 
officials also will use automatic traffic surveillance and 
control a system linked by fiber optics to a centralized computer 
to adjust signal lights the system was installed in the area for 
the 1984 summer olympics 
crowder said officials expect 500 to 800 limousines for oscar 
night along with 800 passenger cars inside the auditorium will be 
5700 guests another 550 people devoted to production of the live 9 
pm est broadcast on abctv and about 150 academy personnel 
the city does not look good when things like this happen 
crowder said of last years traffic jam this is the home of the 
film industry and we dont want to lose something like the oscars 
to somewhere else

track superstar carl lewis said thursday it was 
his guess that as many as 10 olympic medals last summer went to 
athletes using anabolic steroids and he urged random testing at all 
levels of sports competition 
we want to elevate ourselves ethically to the point where 
everyone sacrifices ourselves to make the sport clean the 
threetime olympian and winner of six gold medals told a 
congressional subcommittee 
lewis received a gold medal in the 100meter dash at last 
summers olympics in south korea after the first contestant to cross 
the finish line canadas ben johnson tested positive for anabolic 
steroids compounds that develop strength and speed but which are 
banned as dangerous drugs 
lewis told members of the house judiciary committees crime 
subcommittee he felt certain that other medal winners also were 
steroid users 
i would say at least five to 10 if i had to guess and some 
of those were gold medals said lewis in answer to a question 
from rep bill mccollum rfla 
members of the subcommittee which is weighing proposed 
legislation to ban mailorder steroids did not ask lewis the names 
of other users who may have won medals he ducked the question when 
reporters asked him after the hearing 
thats not the issue he said the issue is that it should

yasser arafat said thursday the second 
formal meeting between us and plo representatives was positive and 
reflected the desire of both sides to make the dialogue a success 
to a reporter who asked the smiling chairman of the palestine 
liberation organization whether wednesdays meeting was responsible 
for his good mood arafat replied yes exactly 
he described the content of the meeting between us ambassador 
robert h pelletreau and yasser abedrabbo of the plo executive 
committee as positive and serious but gave few details of the 
discussion 
there is a mutual interest and intention to lead this dialogue 
to success arafat said 
pelletreau and abedrabbo met for 4 hours at the tunisian 
governments dar el maghreibia guest house with two senior advisers 
present on each side the ambassador would not talk about the 
meeting and referred all inquiries to the state department 
arafat said no one has the right to say what they asked of us 
or what we asked of them 
did the americans ask him to stop the 15monthold uprising in 
the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip that has taken the 
lives of more than 400 palestinians no one presented such a 
request and no one can ask a people to stop resisting an 
occupation he replied 
it was the second formal meeting since talks began in december 
after arafat publicly renounced terrorism and recognized israels 
right to exist there was no indication whether a third meeting was 
scheduled but the plo chiefs mood suggested the dialogue will 
continue 
the fact that the agenda was loaded with a lot of subjects to 
be discussed shows clearly the importance given to it both by the 
us administration and the plo he said its importance is even 
greater if you take into consideration all the israeli efforts to 
stop it 
arafat reiterated his demand for an international peace 
conference on the middle east with the participation of the nations 
involved the plo and the five permanent members of the un 
security council the united states soviet union china britain 
and france 
this is the position announced by the arab summits in 
casablanca amman and algiers and it is very similar and parallel to 
the european soviet chinese and nonaligned position on the same 
issue he said the american administration is in principle for 
an international conference but says it should be very well 
prepared 
asked about reports that the plo would consider the possibility 
of american soldiers replacing the israelis in south lebanon arafat 
said we accept united nations forces under the un flag to 
replace the israeli army in the territory but i never mentioned the 
us army 
on wednesday arafats spokesman bassam abu sharif said american 
soldiers could play a transitional role and help oversee free 
elections in an independent palestinian state 
to a question about palestinian measures to reduce tension in the 
middle east arafat said it should be addressed to the israelis 
because it is they who are causing tension with the israeli army 
and the armed settler groups using force against the palestinians 
the essential question is whether the israeli army and air 
force will stop bombarding villages and palestinian camps in 
southern lebanon he said 
he was asked about the unexplained delay in organizing an exile 
palestinian government and said the palestine national council 
wanted to include representatives of palestinians living inside 
palestine which includes israel 
we need to know how the israelis will react to those who are 
appointed he said will they deport them or put them in jail 
or put them to death 
the palestine national council which acts as the plo 
legislature declared palestinian independence last november 
arafat said of israels readiness to deal with palestinians 
outside the plo according to an internal rule of the plo there 
is not a single palestinian who is not in the plo 
he will let israel name the palestinian delegates to an 
international conference arafat said if israel will not object 
to me naming the israeli delegation

more than three decades after fighting 
federally ordered integration the arkansas legislature took a 
series of landmark steps to shed the states segregrationist past 
the keystone of the legislative session concluded last week was 
the approval of a 118 million settlement in a lingering civil 
rights lawsuit stemming from state and local actions that the 
plaintiffs said helped resegregate innercity schools in little rock 
and encourage white flight to the suburbs the settlement 
includes beefing up city schools and redrawing some school district 
boundaries 
a national statement for desegregation was made today little 
rock school board member skip rutherford said after the state house 
of representatives narrowly approved the settlement 
it was a clear determination on the part of a majority of the 
legislators to put the legacy of 1957 behind us forever gov bill 
clinton said in an interview this week 
it was 1957 when thengov orval faubus refused to allow nine 
black students to enter the allwhite central high school president 
dwight d eisenhower ordered federal troops to central to keep the 
peace and enforce courtordered desegregation 
in addition to approving the settlement lawmakers this session 
voted overwhelmingly to repeal more than a dozen laws passed during 
the late 1950s and early 1960s to preserve segregated schools 
one statute required local school officials to consider public 
sentiment in making school assignments another provided for 
jailhouse school board meetings in case board members were jailed 
for disobeying integration orders 
a cosponsor of the legislation to repeal the segregation laws 
was freshman rep ben mcgee the first black since reconstruction to 
represent the largely black mississippi river delta region of 
eastern arkansas 
whats historic about the whole thing was the commitment on the 
part of people to wipe the slate clean said mcgee who noted that 
some of the votes to repeal the segregation laws came from lawmakers 
who had helped adopt them years ago 
lawmakers also decided to put on the november ballot a measure 
asking voters to repeal a 1956 amendment to the state constitution 
that required the legislature to pass laws and use all other means 
necessary to circumvent federal desegregation rulings any state or 
local official could be prosecuted for failure to enforce state laws 
to preserve segregation 
faubus now 79 said this week that repealing the old laws and 
attempting to amend the constitution is commendable but unnecessary 
all those things had been nullified by the federal court 
rulings he said im not objecting to it but i think its 
mostly posturing and for propaganda purposes 
faubus does object to the settlement involving the little rock 
north little rock and pulaski county special school districts 
it may turn out as one of the worse things that ever 
happened said faubus who served six terms as governor this 
could break the state government theres no limit to what it could 
cost and theres no limit to how many lawsuits that can be filed 
these lawyers are making too much money to let it stop 
clinton calls the agreement a model for other states grappling 
with desegregation issues and he and other proponents argue it 
could buffer the state from liability in any future desegregation 
litigation at least two such lawsuits are pending 
lawmakers from outside pulaski county little rock and the 
surrounding area were angry that money earmarked for schools in 
their districts will be funneled into the pulaski schools among the 
states wealthiest rep lloyd george called the settlement an 
openended entitlement program that ultimately could cost the 
state more than 260 million 
in addition to the money the state agreed to pay in the 
settlement court orders in the case require the state to fund other 
compensatory programs in the little rock district and pay 93 
million a year for the operation of magnet schools designed to 
attract white students back to the little rock district 
also approved were programs such as mandatory kindergarten and 
college grants to entice more minority students into teaching 
drafted to benefit blacks 
the state senate easily approved the settlement 312 but it 
took four ballots in the house before the agreement finally passed 
5442 just 30 minutes before the 68day session ended friday 
of the house members who changed their votes in the final ballot 
clinton said they concluded that the old triedandtrue southern 
strategy of whipping up on the federal courts had never worked for 
anybody that it would generate a lot of votes but never show any 
positive results in the civil rights area 
he complimented the legislators from outside pulaski county for 
voting for the settlement 
we are trying to close the books on the little rock crisis and 
essentially make a statement that were committed to equal 
opportunity to giving all of our children a chance to learn and 
that were committed to a progressive course in education economic 
development and race relations clinton said 
we have to deal with all of those things if this state and its 
people are ever going to fulfill their potential

13yearold girl assistant district attorney daniel cotter argued 
at the arraignment 
richard and victoria tinyes whose daughter kelly was slain

the afternoon of the killing were the main focus of their 
investigation

an arrest but district attorney denis dillon said he wanted to 
present the case to a grand jury to strengthen it the grand jury

charges of resisting arrest have been 
dropped against a black policeman whose head shattered a plate glass 
window in a confrontation with a white officer that was videotaped 
by a news crew 
im very elated don jackson 30 said after the prosecutor 
announced there was not enough evidence to bring him to trial 
wednesday 
jackson a hawthorne police sergeant who has accused white 
officers of racism set up his own sting by traveling into 
nearby long beach on jan 14 in a car while an nbc news crew 
followed 
jacksons vehicle was pulled over by police in a scene later 
televised on nbc jacksons head is seen apparently being smashed 
into a store window the city filed charges of resisting arrest 
on wednesday deputy city prosecutor john vander lans told 
municipal judge gary hahn there was insufficient evidence to obtain 
a conviction 
vander lans said he based his decision on the videotape the 
testimony by the arresting officer mark dickey during a state 
senate hearing and interviews with witnesses 
police said jacksons car had been weaving in traffic and 
officials had suggested jackson instigated the confrontation through 
his words and actions 
but dickey told the state senate panel that jackson had never 
sworn at him as he had stated in his police report the officer 
attributed the discrepancy to a faulty memory 
after the charge was dismissed jackson denounced long beach 
authorities attempt to prosecute him as a ridiculous spectacle 
jackson is on disability leave from the hawthorne department 
because he contends he suffered stress as a result of racism there 
mike minton a spokesman for the long beach police officers 
association criticized the decision to drop the case 
the don jacksons of the world are going to go out there and try 
to intimidate police officers and somebody is going to get hurt 
he said 
jacksons lawyer thomas e beck said he has filed a complaint 
with the state bar against vander lans alleging malicious 
prosecution and claimed city officials conspired against jackson 
vander lans denied the charge

this small eastern south dakota town has done 
without one of the more common trappings of the modern world for 113 
years a paved main street 
but crooks residents voted tuesday to cover up the past by 
approving a 70000 project that will put pavement on main 
work to lay the asphalt carpet will begin this spring on the 2 
blocks made up of mud and gravel 
you bet its a big deal mayor paul anderson said wednesday 
one of the things weve found is when we go out and try to lure a 
business into crooks a paved main street is a priority 
crooks located about 10 miles northwest of sioux falls began as 
a settlement called new hope in 1876 the town changed its name in 
1904 to honor the thenpostmaster and banker do crooks 
although most of the towns 750 residents work in sioux falls 
there are about a dozen businesses and anderson said he would like 
to attract more 
it seems to have an effect on the general feeling of the 
community as a whole he said a lot of people come and drive 
through and they wont stop 
residents approved a 20000 bond issue to help pay for the 
project 10047

crawfish mascot 
not much decided woodbine city officials so they got a friend 
of a resident to stitch up a costume 
the woodbine citizens steering committee unveiled crawford 
tuesday night 
i think it turned out very well fran hewitt the costumes 
designer said from her home in marietta ohio 
mrs hewitt a housewife who has been designing costumes for 20 
years said she has designed costumes resembling bears rabbits 
ducks and geese to entertain children but never a crawfish 
woodbines deputy city clerk sandy rayson sent her a crawfish 
in a box to help spur her creative juices mrs hewitt said she 
said she had seen crawfish before but never that big

a state senator says he has found the 
appropriate time to hear testimony on a bill to make the kingsmens 
classic recording of louie louie the official state rock song 
my hunch is well get it in with the nut bills said sen 
glenn otto a member of the senate government operations and 
elections committee 
otto hastened to add that he meant two bills to designate the 
hazelnut and the chinquapin as official oregon nuts 
otto earlier referred to the song as lousy lousy 
the bills author sen bill bradbury admits that the idea of 
giving official state status to the worlds mostrecorded rock song 
was a gimmick to get some free entertainment 
can i be honest with you bradbury said tuesday the 
reality of the bill was to get the kingsmen down here to play at a 
legislative party last week 
the lure was enough to persuade several members of the kingsmen 
who recorded the original louie louie in portland in 1963 to 
show up at the party and play music for free bradbury said 
bradbury plans to continue to push the bill even though an 
identical measure died without a hearing in the 1987 legislature

next years national head count could cost 3 
billion congress was told thursday but census bureau officials 
doubt theyll have to spend quite that much 
we estimate that the 1990 census will cost about 26 
billion deputy census director c louis kincannon told the house 
census subcommittee 
but gene l dodaro of the general accounting office told the 
subcommittee he believes the bureau is underestimating the cost 
on the basis of continued inflation and more current cost 
estimates we believe that the 1990 census as planned will cost 
about 3 billion dodaro testified 
kincannon responded that factors outside our control such as 
lower than expected mailreturn rates or productivity could 
increase costs but added that we do not expect that to happen 
the 1980 national head count eventually cost 11 billion 
initial estimates had been lower 
more than 100 million census forms will be mailed a year from 
now with the constitutionally mandated count scheduled for april 1 
1990 
political representation and money are allocated based on 
census results and the data are used for planning at every level of 
government and in the private sector kincannon pointed out 
he and dodaro agreed that a major problem will be recruiting the 
estimated 480000 temporary workers the bureau is expected to need 
to do the counting 
in test counts last year kincannon said the bureau found that 
its planned wage range of 550 to 6 an failed to attract workers 
in some areas thus he said officials are developing a regional 
pay scale keyed to local costs and salaries 
even so with many twoearner families fewer people are 
available to recruit for these temporary jobs 
rep thomas j ridge rpa suggested one possible solution 
would be to recruit census enumerators from among retired federal 
workers around the country if rules can be changed to allow them to 
be paid without reducing their retirement benefits 
dodaro and kincannon supported that idea ridge and rep thomas 
c sawyer dohio said they were introducing legislation to allow 
the retirees to take these temporary jobs without benefit cuts 
kincannon also said major efforts are underway to better count 
the homeless and minorities 
meanwhile the mexican american legal defense and education fund 
launched its effort to encourage hispanics to be counted 
with the census numbers used to apportion seats in the house 
state legislatures and other governing bodies many minority groups 
will be encouraging members to participate in the count 
hagase contar or make yourself count is the slogan of 
the mexicanamerican effort

it takes courage heart and brains to take on 
judy garland and the wicked witch of the west 
but producerdirector michel m grilikhes disney on parade 
has attempted to do so with a live road show of the wizard of 
oz which opened wednesday night at radio city music hall and will 
visit 70 cities after it leaves new york april 9 
the 75 million production features flying monkeys and sparkling 
human snowflakes a firethrowing evil witch a computerized yellow 
brick road and a house that chugs along an overhead dolly but with 
all the stage gimmicks and pyrotechnics its a long slow trip to 
emerald city 
grilikhes who spent 12 years trying to adapt the 1939 film 
classic version of the l frank baum stories closely follows the 
film script and includes all the harold arlen and ey harburg songs 
from the original but the staging is stiff the pacing slow and the 
direction falters 
still it is a delightful event for families and in those 
communities without repertory companies or little theaters the 
production is a wonderful way to introduce children to live 
performances however those under 3 might grow restless by the time 
dorothy the scarecrow the tin woodsman and the cowardly lion reach 
the witchs castle 
the story opens in kansas of course with a set as flat as the 
plains fourteenyearold dorothy lives on a farm with her auntie em 
and uncle henry and three lovable farm hands her little dog toto 
takes a nip out of mean spinster miss gulch who takes the pooch 
off to be dispatched to that great dog pound in the sky 
toto escapes finds dorothy and they run away from home she 
meets prof marvel who persuades her to return home she does just 
as a tornado is twisting through the landscape 
the house is lifted by wires to a figureeight dolly on the dome 
of the music hall where it totters slowly over part of the 
orchestra like a car on a ferris wheel the effect doesnt work 
there is no brutal force even the sound effects and lighting are 
limp 
the house crashes on the wicked witch of the east dorothy meets 
glinda the good witch gets the bad witchs ruby slippers and heads 
off to emerald city to see the wizard so she can be sent home 
as dorothy the diminutive 23yearold grace grieg is appealing 
but her singing voice is thin as she attempts somewhere over the 
rainbow and the supposedly tiny munchkins tower above her she 
was spotted by grilikhes while appearing as snow white in a las 
vegas production of beach blanket babylon joe mcdonough is no 
ray bolger but does a splendid job as the scarecrow joe giuffres 
tin man is less inspirational but adequate guy allen is lovable as 
the lion polly feale rivals margaret hamilton as miss gulch and the 
wicked witch in many respects shes even more sinister bart 
williams is the wizard prof marvel and the guard at emerald city 
toto actually five trained terriers appears and disappears 
with great frequency 
the wizard of oz includes a cast of 42 performers huge sets 
and computer robotics but one of the most interesting effects in 
the show is a simple piece of theatrics when the witch melts she 
flattens herself down a staircase unseeen by the audience 
bill campbells costumes are a whimsical treat especially the 
ornate munchkin attire the yellow brick road though is a 
disappointment its difficult to see and just sort of pops up 
every now and then dorothy and crew halfheartedly trot along

the federal aviation administration has warned us 
airlines of a possible hijack attempt by palestinian terrorists in 
europe the us embassy and the faa said today 
but officials at the us embassy in london the faa and the 
white house denied a report today in the tabloid daily express that 
us diplomats and military personnel had been notified of the 
warning they also denied that the warning said the hijacking could 
occur over easter weekend 
a spokesman for the us european command which is in charge of 
us military forces in europe said it was aware of the warning but 
did not pass it along to military personnel the spokesman army 
maj dennis pinkham spoke with the associated press from stuttgart 
and refused to elaborate 
the frontpage daily express report came during a political 
debate in britain over whether airlines were properly informed about 
a radiocassette bomb before pan am flight 103 a boeing 747 bound 
for new york was blown apart over lockerbie in scotland dec 21 
killing 270 people 
airports in england italy belgium and west germany stepped up 
security after receiving the warning but no additional precautions 
were reported today at airports in the netherlands greece or spain 
the white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said today the 
warning was issued march 16 and that it was similar to many many 
similar kinds of information and security bulletins that go out 
fitzwater said in washington that it was not given to any 
military or diplomatic personnel but rather just to security experts 
at aviation airports and airlines the notice did not mention any 
specific time period such as easter fitzwater said nor did it 
mention a specific airline or airport 
the faa said in a statement in washington that the security 
bulletin was issued to provide information to air carriers and 
airports about the possibility of a hijacking of a us airliner 
in western europe the faa said the bulletin was sensitive 
information not designed for public distribution 
the release of this information by unauthorized persons can be 
counterproductive to the civil aviation communitys efforts to 
provide a totally effective security system the faa said 
the faa said the bulletin did not refer to a time period or name 
an airline or airport nor was there any reference to the eastern 
holiday period it said no warning was issued to us government 
employees 
richard calder a spokesman at the embassy press office in 
london said the faa office in london passed on the warning to 
britains department of transport and to us carriers in britain 
in bonn today officials said the west german interior ministry 
and us government offices were notified of a threatened terrorist 
attack but that they did not issue a warning to the public flight 
103 originated in west germany 
an interior ministry spokesman roland bachmeier said bonn 
authorities received a vague warning that a hijack threat had 
been made but declined to give any details of the threat or how it 
was received 
in another development independent television news today showed 
videotape taken by three youths who said they were able to board an 
empty british airways jumbo jet at heathrow on monday without being 
challenged the video included a shot of one youth sitting in the 
captains seat in the cockpit 
they say they are cracking down on security and they are 
confident no one else can do what happened at lockerbie said one 
of the youths identified only as shoaib khan it is just not 
true 
british airways said in a statement it regarded the incident as 
extremely serious and was investigating 
the london tabloid the daily express said the possible hijack 
threat was detailed in a secret memorandum dated march 17 from the 
faa the paper said it had been given a copy of the memorandum 
britains department of transport said in a statement we dont 
discuss security matters 
the daily express said 
american military personnel and diplomats and their families 
have been told of the threat which centers on us airlines they 
were advised to alter routine plans to return home from europe for 
easter 
the daily express said the faa memo warns all airlines and 
security forces in the us britain and the rest of europe it was 
passed to the department of transport in london it quotes 
security sources as saying a copy of the memo arrived at the 
london offices of international aviation security a company owned 
by trans world airlines

the navy believes it obtained enough radio 
telemetry from this weeks failed trident 2 missile launch to 
determine the precise cause but already suspects a fault in the 
rocket nozzle system of the first stage motor the pentagons chief 
spokesman said thursday 
dan howard the spokesman said a preliminary investigation 
suggests either an electrical or mechanical glitch in the part of 
the missile that swivels the rocket nozzles from side to side 
and we do believe that we have the necessary data to be able to 
evaluate it and pinpoint the problem even without the recovery of 
the vehicle howard said 
we do have further launches scheduled at this point there are 
no plans to delay or alter that planned launch program and we still 
expect that the trident 2 will be fully operational aboard the uss 
tennessee in december 
the investigation began tuesday shortly after a trident 2 
missile fired from the submarine tennessee selfdestructed four 
seconds after launch the missile popped to the surface as planned 
and the first stage ignited properly but the missile then began 
spinning like a burning pinwheel and exploded 
it was the first submarine launch of the navys newest and most 
powerful weapon 
according to howard the missiles firststage rocket nozzles are 
supposed to swivel immediately after firing to put the weapon on a 
19degree angle of flight another internal command is then sent to 
the nozzles to straighten back up thus maintaining the missiles 
19degree angle 
in this case the spokesman the radio telemetry discloses the 
second command to the nozzles to straighten was sent but not 
executed 
they do not know yet whether the difficulty is in the 
electrical system that that signal did not get from the sending 
point to the receiving point or if the difficulty was simply 
mechanical that a pump didnt operate correctly or whatever he 
continued 
in any event the nozzles did not correct so the missile 
continued in that pitchover maneuver round and round in circles 
and as it did so it generated gforces internal to the missile 
triggering a selfdestruct safety system he said 
howard declined to predict how long it would take technicians to 
isolate the cause of the failure 
the threestage trident 2 is a more lethal version of the weapon 
that is the heart of americas naval nuclear deterrent the trident 
1 the new missile can deliver three to 12 nuclear warheads to 
individual targets up to 6000 miles away 
the trident 1 experienced similar test failures but still was 
deployed on schedule howard noted thursday after 19 test launches 
the trident 1 had worked only 13 times compared to 16 for the 
trident 2 he said 
the navy says the new weapon is much more accurate than its 
undersea predecessors polaris poseidon and trident 1 and can 
match the targeting ability of landbased missiles even though it is 
launched from a submerged moving submarine 
the tennessee is the first of nine submarines equipped to carry 
24 of the deadly missiles

vietnamese refugees said thursday about 130 
countrymen drowned two weeks ago when their overloaded 30foot 
wooden boat capsized and sank near a japanese tanker in the south 
china sea 
japanese authorities said first reports of the march 8 accident 
did not emerge until monday when 35 survivors of the accident on 
the high seas between vietnam and malaysia arrived in the port of 
yokohama news agencies in malaysia said thursday that floating 
bodies were sighted off malaysia 
it was the latest reported accident involving the increasing 
number of vietnamese fleeing political repression and economic 
hardship in the communist country the refugees known as boat 
people risk piracy and disaster in hopes of achieving asylum and 
permanent resettlement outside vietnam 
surviving refugees said the boat collided with the 239000ton 
nisseimaru and sank but the tankers captain said he believed a 
wave capsized the boat 
survivors said their boat was carrying 165 people a nagasaki 
refugee center official masanami nakatsukasa said the boat had 
left long an in southern vietnam on march 4 
many passengers were seasick and were suffering from a lack of 
fresh water after four days at sea and they had been trying to 
approach the tanker for help the official quoted survivors as 
saying 
the tanker came very close to our boat and the waves pushed us 
into the ship survivor chan kin kan told the japan broadcasting 
corp late thursday 
our boat capsized the children and others trapped in the boat 
were drowned chan said 
the boat overturned and sank after hitting the propeller at the 
back of the nisseimaru the refugee official quoted survivors as 
saying 
the tanker captain yasuo kawamura had stopped and prepared 
ladders to take the refugees on board he said in a tv interview 
that the reason for the sinking was unclear 
i couldnt see it with my own eyes but we were completely 
stopped so i dont think we hit the boat kawamura said i 
think their boat was capsized when it was hit broadside by a wave 
hiroshi hattori spokesman for tokyo tanker the nisseimarus 
agent also denied reports of a collision he said the tanker crew 
did not know how many refugees were missing after the accident 
reports that 165 refugees had been crammed into the boat were 
unbelievable said seichiro okamoto head of ocean operations 
for tokyo tanker 
the nisseimaru conducted an allday search and rescued 35 
refugees then sailed for singapore where the refugees were refused 
entry news reports said 
the refugees were brought to yokohama on another japanese vessel 
after japan granted them entry said chikako saito spokeswoman for 
the un high commissioner for refugees in tokyo 
maritime safety agency spokesman kazuhiro numata said tokyo 
tanker had not mentioned any missing reporting only the rescue of 
35 refugees 
the agency japans coast guard will send officials to the 
refugee center where the 35 survivors are staying to investigate the 
accident numata said 
saito said the refugees will become japanese residents unless 
they have close relatives in third countries 
foreign ministry spokesman taizo watanabe said his ministry 
viewed the case as a really serious issue but could not comment 
until the coast guard completed its investigation 
in malaysia decomposed bodies sighted by fishermen in the seas 
off northeast malaysia were believed to be those of the refugees 
police said 
the body of a girl found on a northeast malaysian beach tuesday 
also is believed to be one of the drowned refugees trengganu state 
police chief wan razak muda told the national news agency bernama 
there are 16500 vietnamese refugees in malaysian camps more 
than 750 who arrived since march 14 bernama said 
last year more than 45000 boat people landed in southeast asian 
countries compared with fewer than 30000 in 1987 
under a new policy by the association of southern asian nations 
recently arrived boat people will be put into temporary camps and 
screened to determine if they are genuine refugees fleeing for 
political purposes or just economic refugees seeking a better life 
in the west 
the economic refugees are returned to vietnam so far no one has 
been deported from malaysia 
un officials also are trying to stem to exodus they plan to 
stress the advantages of the 10yearold orderly departure 
program under which 23000 people were flown from vietnam last 
year most for resettlement in the united states and australia

senior leader deng xiaoping said thursday that he 
skipped the opening session of chinas legislature so he could 
conserve my health and live longer 
in his first public appearance since the national peoples 
congress opened monday he also acknowledged the government has made 
mistakes such as not paying enough attention to education and 
forgetting its tradition of hard work and plain living 
i seldom do the daily work of government now deng told 
visiting ugandan president yoweri museveni 
deng 84 did not attend even though he is a delegate to the 
congress from his home province sichuan government officials said 
only that deng had asked for leave 
deng confirmed to museveni i have asked for leave i want to 
conserve my health and live longer what is more important is that i 
should gradually withdraw from the stage and let others preside over 
the work 
he noted new government and party leaders were chosen in 1987 and 
1988 deng retired from all his posts except that of chairman of the 
central military commission which sets military policy 
we should not let the new leaders feel that there is a kind of 
force above them deng said 
yes but young people need the guidance and leadership of the 
older generation museveni responded 
in a later report by the official xinhua news agency deng was 
quoted as saying the government has made small mistakes in the last 
10 years during which china has enacted a reform program to open its 
economy to market forces 
china is facing an inflation rate of 36 percent the highest 
since the communist victory in 1949 corruption also is on the rise 
deng said it would take the country two to four years to overcome 
the problems 
deng said premier li peng had referred to the mistakes in his 
report monday to the national peoples congress 
foreigners have commented that we have made selfcriticisms 
about these mistakes we veterans too have to take 
responsibility he said 
deng chain smokes despite doctors advice to cut down he wears a 
hearing aid in one ear and moves more slowly than he did several 
years ago but is not known to have any major ailment 
he has cut down sharply on his public appearances in the past 
year but is still believed to play a deciding role in policymaking 
and apparently is the final voice when party leader zhao ziyang li 
and other officials disagree 
some western experts believe he is the only leader with the full 
support of the military

police arrested about 80 antiabortion 
protesters today at a clinic the first target of an easter season 
offensive undertaken with a blessing from the head of the nations 
biggest roman catholic archdiocese 
some 400 members of operation rescue sang jesus loves the 
little children all little children of the world as the 
protesters were dragged away from the family planning associates 
medical group clinic in cypress 20 miles from los angeles 
the arrests brought cheers from about 150 counterdemonstrators 
who had chanted not the church not the state women will decide 
our fate 
this is too big to ignore we need to do something for our 
voices to be heard said sue otti one of the prochoice advocates 
the antiabortion protesters went limp as police in helmets and 
face shields carried them away others crawled up to the clinic on 
hands and knees to continue the blockades they too were carried 
off by police 
those arrested were taken on buses to the orange county jail 
where they were to be issued misdemeanor citations for failing to 
disperse said sheriffs lt dick olson 
operation rescue said it expected up to 2500 people to protest 
today at targeted clinics with most willing to risk jail by 
ignoring a federal court order against blocking entrances the new 
yorkbased group says 21000 of its antiabortion advocates have 
been arrested in nationwide protests since 1987 
archbishop roger mahony lent his prayers to the demonstrators in 
a statement issued wednesday 
i understand and respect the goals of operation rescue 
appreciate the manifestation by its participants of the value of 
human life and the need to take active steps to safeguard each human 
life from the moment of conception he said i offer my prayers 
for those who choose to participate 
prochoice advocates describing the demonstrators as bullies 
vowed the clinics would remain open throughout protests 
los angeles officials promising to enforce laws to keep the 
clinics open set up a command center four floors under city hall 
just as they do to mobilize forces during earthquakes 
organizers of the protests wednesday displayed what they said was 
a human fetus in a small white coffin at a news conference 
this is baby choice said randall terry founder of 
operation rescue she was killed at 19 weeks by a saline solution 
abortion and she will answer all your questions terry left 
quickly refusing to answer further questions 
the archbishop has no comment on the tactics involved said 
bill rivera a spokesman for the archdiocese when asked about the 
coffin display 
one local antiabortion group the right to life league of 
southern california declined to take part in the protests because

a top army officer in tibet said thursday more 
than 600 casualties have resulted from 21 riots in lhasa in the past 
18 months the official xinhua news agency reported 
both the casualty figure and the number of clashes exceeded 
levels previously acknowledged by authorities who for months sought 
to minimize the degree of violence in the remote region 
since the latest clash march 5 however the government has 
stressed the violence of antichinese protesters in its efforts to 
portray the clashes as the result of outside plotting 
these riots all organized have been escalating in scale with 
a rising toll of life and property xinhua quoted maj gen zhang 
shaosong political commissar of the tibet military region as 
saying it said zhang was in beijing as a delegate to the national 
peoples congress chinas legislature which is holding its annual 
meeting 
he did not say how many dead and wounded his casualty figure 
represented nor did he give details of the 21 incidents 
casualties are known to have occurred only in four confrontations 
between chinese security forces and tibetan nationalists beginning 
with a mob attack on a police station oct 1 1987 
official reports on those clashes have listed 24 dead and more 
than 432 wounded unofficial estimates by tibetans have said at 
least 70 people died in the four clashes 
about a dozen smaller nonviolent protests by tibetans also have 
been reported by foreign travelers to the region resulting in 
arrests but no violence that could be described as a riot 
xinhua quoted zhang as saying that martial law imposed on lhasa 
on march 8 has punctured the reactionary activities of separatists 
and won support from the whole nation tibetans included 
xinhua has carried many articles recently quoting delegates to 
the national peoples congress as supporting martial law and 
condemning tibetan proindependence demonstrators 
foreign reporters have not been allowed to interview tibetan 
delegates 
lhasa and nearby counties remain closed to foreign travelers 
under the martial law no date for lifting martial law has been 
specified despite official reports from lhasa that life has 
returned to normal 
china says it has ruled tibet for more than seven centuries many 
tibetans say they actually were independent for much of that time 
ruled by a buddhist theocracy headed by the dalai lama those taking 
part in the antichinese protests say they want the dalai lama to 
return ending his 30year exile in india

a man with an automatic weapon today 
killed a mother and daughter after taking the younger woman hostage 
then sexually assaulted a third woman and fled a traffic accident on 
foot authorities said 
about 100 law enforcement officers hunted for the man in a 
suburban denver area of housing tracts cut by creeks and grassy 
floodplains helicopters helped look for the killer 
the man was last seen wearing a cowboy hat blue jeans and cowboy 
boots and was believed armed with either an uzi or a mac10 
submachine gun said sheriff steve zotos 
hes extremely dangerous said sheriffs lt bill walker 
we have four or five crime scenes and a lot of people hurt and 
injured 
authorities withheld the names of the shooting victims 
zotos said the episode began southwest of denver when a woman 
phoned an emergency number about 3 am to report a burglary but 
hung up before sheriffs deputies could ask her questions 
authorities traced the call and discovered the woman and her car 
missing from her home 
shortly after 6 am the louviers fire department got a report 
of shootings in a subdivision zotos said the gunman had taken his 
hostage to her mothers home in the subdivision and shot both women 
the sheriff said one of two men in the home at the time initially 
was thought to be wounded but was only covered with blood and not 
harmed 
about 8 am the gunman went to a home in another subdivision 
sexually assaulted a woman there and also terrorized a man and 
child holding them at gunpoint authorities said 
after the man fled police learned about the traffic accident 
involving a vehicle matching the car the gunman was thought to be 
driving based on the damage to the car authorities believed the 
man was injured in the accident

budget talks between the white house and 
congress will continue into april as negotiators remain hopeful of 
accord despite the slow pace of the talks according to a statement 
released thursday 
the secret sessions involving president bushs aides and the 
leaders of the house and senate budget committees broke off 
wednesday until congress returns next month from its easter recess 
the bargaining group released a letter thursday reporting to the 
president and the congressional leadership that they believed their 
talks may eventually bear fruit a deficitreduction plan for the 
fiscal 1990 budget 
the letter said the meetings have been cordial and 
constructive and added a number of budget options have been 
discussed we intend to continue to negotiate on the basis of these 
and other options in an effort to reach a compromise 
the goal of the group is to agree on a plan for the 116 
trillion budget that would meet the guidelines of the grammrudman 
law which calls for reducing the federal deficit to 100 billion in 
fiscal 1990 the current years deficit is expected to exceed 160 
billion 
treasury secretary nicholas brady one of the white house 
negotiators predicted thursday a bipartisan agreement could be 
negotiated which would not violate bushs notax pledge 
bush proposed in his budget raising government revenues by about 
14 billion through a combination of tax increases user fees and 
sales of government assets however the administration contends 
none are new taxes 
in an appearance before the national association of 
manufacturers brady also defended the economic assumptions 
underlying the administrations budget the forecast has been 
attacked for using overly optimistic assumptions about economic 
growth and interest rates 
he said that a credible budget deficit reduction plan would lower 
interest rates and the administrations growth forecast for 1989 and 
1990 of 32 percent as measured by the gross national product 
reflected the average growth rate of the economy over the past 
several years 
rep leon panetta the chairman of the house budget committee 
said recent government reports indicating a possible return of 
inflation haunt the negotiations and has helped spur the 
negotiators toward creation of a substantive proposal 
while it began with everybody thinking they really could slide 
by with a minimal plan this year the economic news has created 
a facetoface confrontation with reality 
panetta said democrats were not going to propose raising taxes 
any more than bush but he said one of his goals in the talks was to 
make sure the 14 billion in revenue would actually be raised and 
that it was not a figure based on unrealistic expectations 
a third of bushs total is his estimate for revenue raised by 
lowering the tax rate on capital gains a proposal given little 
chance on capitol hill 
the talks are expected to resume april 3 
congress has an april 15 deadline for completing its annual 
budget resolution and it is unlikely a pact could be reached before 
then congressional leaders have indicated the deadline could slip 
somewhat

young men who boarded a jumbo jet at heathrow 
airport and got into the cockpit said the caper proved the security 
has not improved since a bomb brought down pan am flight 103 over 
scotland 
british airways said it considered the breach to be extremely 
serious but stressed that the boeing 747 was in a maintenance area 
and was not operational 
a videotape taken by three young men who said they boarded the 
aircraft early monday was shown thursday by independent television 
news 
they say they are cracking down on security and they are 
confident noone else can do what happened at lockerbie said 
shoaib khan the only one of the three who was identified it is 
just not true 
we want to prove the point and just want to tell the whole 
world that they are not doing anything about it he said we did 
break the law and we are ready to stand up and say it was us who did 
it and this is the reason why we did it 
airport security has been a sensitive issue since the bombing of 
pan am flight 103 which was blown apart dec 21 over lockerbie 
scotland killing 270 people 
the british airways jet boarded by the young men reportedly was 
at the airlines maintenance base adjoining heathrow 
the transport department said it was most concerned and had 
asked british airways for a report 
it seems that the incident took place in the ba maintenance 
area which is bas private property and outside the restricted area 
of the airport on monday morning the department said 
british airways has its own security but the young men said they 
were not detected 
john prescott the opposition labor partys transportation 
spokesman said the incident was a clear breach of security and 
said in the house of commons he wanted an explanation from transport 
minister paul channon 
he assured us in this house less than 70 hours ago that 
security at heathrow is ok said prescott it is not and the 
traveling public are absolutely concerned about it 
robert adley a lawmaker from the governing conservative party 
called for prosecution of the three 
people who trespass for whatever reason are behaving as 
irresponsibly as people who make hoax telephone calls and should be 
treated as such adley said 
a spokesman for scotland yard said detectives would interview the 
young men but added there appeared to be no crime involved

rubella has almost vanished in the united states 
since a vaccine was licensed 20 years ago but federal health 
officials said thursday they are concerned that a large number of 
the remaining cases are occurring among adults 
preliminary figures released thursday by the us centers for 
disease control showed there were 221 cases of rubella also known 
as german measles reported in 1988 a final count for 1987 
indicated there were 306 cases of rubella the cdc said 
the 1988 figure amounted to about one case per 1 million people 
and represented the lowest total since 1966 when the government 
began compiling statistics on the disease it was a 99 percent drop 
from 1969 when the vaccine was licensed 
the disease is fairly mild in most people but it can cause 
serious birth defects such as heart disease and mental retardation 
in babies whose mothers are infected while pregnant because of 
this health officials are most worried about the risk of infection 
to women of childbearing age 
the cdc said its preliminary figures indicate there was just one 
case reported last year of a baby born with signs of rubella 
infection or related birth defects down from three in 1987 but so 
far this year there have been three more cases reported of babies 
with rubella or related problems 
in 1980 the federal public health service set a goal cutting the 
number of overall cases to 1000 by 1990 and the number of cases 
among newborns to fewer than 10 
although both goals were reached years ahead of time 
unacceptable morbidity is still occurring the cdc said in its 
weekly report 
the cdc said people 15 and over accounted for 582 percent of all 
us rubella cases in 198587 nationwide statistics from before the 
rubella vaccine was licensed are not broken down by age group the 
cdc said but data from areas that did count rubella cases by age 
group during that time indicated that only about 23 percent of all 
cases were in people 15 and over in 196668 
the continued occurrence of rubella in childbearingaged 
populations suggests that potentially preventable cases of 
congenital rubella syndrome may continue to occur during the next 10 
to 30 years the cdc said in its weekly report 
dr paul a stehrgreen an epidemiologist with the atlantabased 
cdc said that during the last major rubella epidemic in 196264 
there were 125 million cases reported in the united states 
including 20000 babies born with the disease and 11000 fetal 
deaths 
stehrgreen said most of the rubella cases occurring now stem 
from people failing to get vaccinated though there are some cases 
of the vaccine failing to work 
this is more an issue of failure to vaccinate rather than a 
failure of the vaccine he said

south carolinas roman catholic bishop 
has banned bingo in his diocese because he considers the game an 
unseemly way of raising money 
this is an evil in the country bishop ernest unterkoefler 
said wednesday people think they are getting something for 
nothing and we are aiding and abetting something that is not 
good for society 
im not saying gambling is sinful but i am saying that under 
state and church auspices it is no way to raise money he said 
instead money should be raised by sacrificial giving by 
churchgoers the bishop said 
the diocese which covers the entire state has 100000 
parishioners in about 100 parishes and missions the directive 
issued last week is one of the first such measures in the country 
said john conick a permanent deacon 
the diocese could not say how many institutions would be affected 
and how much revenue they would lose but cardinal newman high 
school in columbia raises 70000 through bingo games it must end by 
july 1990 
bingo is legal in south carolina if it is for the benefit of 
charitable religious or fraternal organizations but state records 
show that bigtime promoters have found ways to get around the law 
and keep most of the proceeds

the house passed legislation today to raise the 
hourly minimum wage to 455 after rejecting president bushs more 
modest offer of an increase to 425 sending the partisan battle to 
the senate for another round next month 
the vote was 248171 
it isnt enough but it certainly is better than nothing 
house speaker jim wright said of the legislation during a floor 
speech in favor of the democrats bill 
passage came after a 240179 vote to amend the legislation to set 
the final level of the minimum wage at 455 an hour and add a 
provision allowing employers to pay new entrants in the job market a 
subminimum wage for two months 
earlier bushs proposal offered by republicans as a substitute 
to the democrats bill was defeated 218198 with more than 40 
democrats joining the gop effort 
i see no defensible argument to say that is adequate rep 
augustus hawkins dcalif said of bushs offer of a 1992 hourly 
minimum wage of 425 
hawkins was the sponsor of the democratic bill which originally 
called for the minimum wage to rise to 465 an hour by 1992 but he 
supported the amendment rolling back the final target by a dime 
while at the same time moving the effective dates of the increases 
forward each by three months 
under the amendment the first increase from the current 335 
an hour to 385 would take effect oct 1 
hawkins and other democratic sponsors of the measure are staunch 
opponents of the socalled training wage contained in the amendment 
that allows some new hires to be paid 85 percent of the minimum wage 
for 60 days 
however they reluctantly agreed to add it to the bill to win the 
support of enough moderatetoconservative democrats particularly 
from southern states to keep them from defecting to the republican 
effort to substitute bushs proposal hawkins bill 
fortythree democrats defected nonetheless while 16 republicans 
voted against the bush offer 
we need an increase in the minimum wage but we do not need the 
job loss and the inflation that sometime accompany excessive 
increased in the minimum wage rep jim cooper dtenn said in 
joining the republicans 
the democraticbacked amendment was expected to pass before the 
house voted later today on the legislation itself the final order 
of business before a weeklong easter recess the senate already in 
recess is to take up a similar minimumwage bill in early april 
the house considered the amendments today after spending several 
hours wednesday engaged in a largely partisan debate with 
supporters arguing that a pay raise was needed for the working poor 
was long overdue and opponents saying too big of a boost would hurt 
those it is designed to help 
we are not arguing against an increase in the minimum wage our 
concern is the size of the increase said rep william goodling 
rpa 
bush has insisted his offer is his last and appears to have the 
votes to sustain a veto 
democrats supporting the bill however said the changes they 
would make through the amendment today represent considerable 
concessions and called on the president to compromise as well 
joining that effort was a republican congressman who helped draft 
the amendment rep thomas j ridge of pennsylvania 
inflexibility will not serve the interest of the minimum wage 
worker said ridge 
several democrats asserted they had compromised too much already 
and blamed republicans for blocking attempts to raise the minimum 
which has been 335 an hour since 1981 
we ought to be ashamed of having this long period of no 
realization of the need to have an improvement in the minimum 
wage said rep henry b gonzalez dtexas

about 200000 us and south korean 
troops ended joint military exercises thursday and a senior us 
commander said the annual maneuvers would help discourage aggression 
by north korea 
gen louis c menetrey said team spirit exercises were held 
solely to test and improve the capability of korean and us 
military forces to deter war or defeat aggression on the korean 
peninsula 
also thursday 13 us marines who were seriously injured in a 
helicopter crash during the maneuvers left for the united states for 
further medical treatment a us military spokesman said 
nineteen marines were killed in the crash of a sikorsky ch53d 
sea stallion helicopter on monday near pohang on the southeast 
coast four others died in a separate crash march 17 
communist north korea repeatedly demanded the exercises in 
their 14th year be called off and claimed team spirit was a front 
for us war prepartions radical south korean students have 
protested the exercises and opinion polls indicate many ordinary 
south koreans have a growing doubts about it 
menetrey said the exercises were necessary because north korea 
poses a major military threat to the south he said the exercises 
were purely defensive and north koreas annual protests proved their 
worth 
the exercise threatens no one north korea or anyone else 
menetrey said in fact as an effective means to ensure our 
defense readiness team spirit is a major factor for peace 
the general expressed regret that north korea had rejected an 
invitation to send observers to team spirit to reassure the 
pyongyang government they posed no threat to the north 
about 43000 us troops are based in the south under a mutual 
defense treaty and they were joined during the exercises by 27000 
from okinawa hawaii and the us mainland 
us forces have been based in the south since washington 
intervened in 1950 to aid the seoul government against the north 
korean invasion that started the korean war the two koreas are 
still technically at war 
a us military spokesman said two c141 transport planes 
carrying 13 injured marines left a military base near seoul to carry 
the burn victims to brooke army medical center in san antonio texas 
two burn victims remained in good or fair condition at a seoul 
military hospital and were not evacuated to the united states the 
spokesman said 
mondays helicopter accident was still under investigation

as serious and solemn as religious 
holidays can be there is plenty of room for humor just ask cal 
samra on easter monday 
thats the first day of the holy humor season a monthlong 
celebration created by samras fellowship of merry christians a 
kalamazoobased ecumenical group that believes theres a serious 
lack of humor in faith 
between 100 and 200 churches in 24 states are expected to 
celebrate monday in their own funny way festivities built around 
the resurrection will include singalongs and joketellings 
sessions the merry christians say raising jesus from the dead was 
the ultimate in practical jokes that god played on satan 
samra who says his 3yearold group has 10000 members believes 
humor and christianity often are thought of as mutually exclusive 
there are two traditions in christianity theres a lot of joy 
and humor and theres also a tradition of solemnity we felt things 
had gotten out of balance and we thought we should focus on 
christian humor christian wit christian joy samra said 
in his bimonthly publication the joyful noiseletter samra 
relays references of joy from the new testament as well as 
religiousoriented anecdotes and jokes from the famous and 
notsofamous 
the good lord didnt create anything without a purpose but the 
fly comes close mark twain 
question what do you get if you cross a praying mantis with a 
termite answer an insect that says grace before he eats your 
house 
samra figures that if he can bring an occasional chuckle or 
even a grin to those he touches he has served his purpose 
his theory which is shared by scholars and scientists is that 
humor is healing 
samra who began collecting rare drawings that depict jesus with 
a smile described his theory in a book the joyful christ 
published in 1986 by harper amp row 
herb true an adjunct professor at the university of notre dame 
applauds samras work he believes most members of the clergy would 
be receptive to it 
comedy is meant to get laughs usually at someone elses 
expense but humor is a form of love its purpose is to lift the 
load said true a psychologist who claims to have the nations 
only humor database 
samra said about half the fellowships subscribers are members of 
the clergy with nearly every denomination represented other members 
are health professionals and humorists even clowns 
but not everyone agrees that religion should be presented in a 
lighthearted manner 
there is a tiny minority out there who have difficulty with the 
concept of the joyful christ samra said

bankers and consumeradvocacy groups urged 
congress on thursday to narrow the insurance industrys exemptions 
from antitrust laws 
consumers suspect theyre not getting their moneys worth from 
insurers said philip s corwin of the american bankers 
association 
how could they he said when price collusion at the 
wholesale level is permitted by the antitrust exemption competition 
at the retail level is inhibited by state antirebate laws and 
the potential market entrant with the greatest ability to provide 
new underwriting capacity and more efficient distribution the 
banking industry is barred at the door 
in testimony to the commerce consumer protection and 
competitiveness subcommittee of the house energy and commerce 
committee corwin endorsed in general terms a bill by the 
subcommittee chairman rep james j florio dnj to forbid some 
collective activities that insurance companies may engage in under 
their antitrust exemptions 
several insurance companies and trade groups argued against 
florios bill contending it would lead to a reduction in the number 
of companies offering property and casualty insurance 
rep don ritter rpa said he would not stand idly by if he 
thought congress would jeopardize the existence of any companies in 
his home state 
evidence has not been forthcoming to justify a need to change 
the present system ritter said 
peggy miller of the consumer federation of america said this 
legislation will not cure problems of high premium costs and 
limited availability of auto health and life insurance but only 
provide one critically needed step 
there is no federal regulation of insurance which is left to the 
states under a 1945 law 
florios bill would forbid the sharing of information to 
determine premiums or coverage areas bar tiein sales such as 
requirements that motorists buy a homeowners policy with their auto 
policy and ban any action to impair the availability or 
affordability of insurance companies could still share loss and 
reserve data 
craig a berrington a lawyer for the american insurance 
association representing member casualty and property insurers said 
the tiein prohibition appeared so strict it would have prevented 
the marketing of todays standard homeowners policy and the 
marketing of commercial multiperil policies and it would prevent 
innovation in the future 
however linda a lipsen representing consumers union said such 
purchase requirements currently leave virtually no avenues for 
redress 
if the only butcher in town conditioned the sale of deluxe 
boneless chicken breasts on the purchase of soup bones such conduct 
might be subject to a substantial fine she said

a millionaire with a hankering for russian 
pumpernickel has struck a deal with the soviet union to fly 2000 
loaves a week to new york consumers 
i thought it was an interesting metaphor breaking bread with 
the russians i call it peace bread said fred kayden 58 of 
harrison who describes himself as a retired multimillionaire 
kayden grew to love russian bread during his business travels 
and always brought home a few loaves its like oldfashioned 
bread with no preservatives he said 
two months ago he began talks with valery saikin chairman of 
the moscow city council who arranged the venture with help from 
aeroflot and the usussr trade and economic council 
the bread will be served at the waldorfastoria and new york 
hilton hotels and sold at 15 zaros bread basket stores in the 
metropolitan area at a price of 4 to 5 for a 2pound loaf 
the russian bread has a slightly sour taste that you would find 
in a traditional jewish rye bread but with even more flavor and 
taste said stuart zaro president of zaros 
it has a very good shelf life because its very dense and 
moist said john doherty executive chef of the waldorf 
the officials sampled four varieties during a waldorf tastetest 
wednesday regular rye unzhensky darnitzky and borodino the 
latter a dark slightly sweet bread lightly laced with caraway 
seeds anise and coriander 
they ordered 500 loaves of each and will let the public decide 
what kind to import in the future

police launched an investigation thursday after 
western journalists photographed plainclothes policemen who had 
pasted press signs on their car to disguise their identity while 
investigating palestinians 
the incident drew a formal complaint from the foreign press 
association in israel which said in a letter to the government that 
such action places journalists at great personal risk and urged 
authorities to cease such behavior immediately 
the army and other security agencies repeatedly have denied 
rumors their agents pose as reporters to get into arab areas to 
watch suspects and make arrests 
journalists covering the 15month palestinian uprising have 
expressed fears that such activity could endanger them if arabs 
became fearful of vehicles with press tags 
police spokesman uzi sandori said there were two policemen 
involved but it was the idea of just one of them his own 
personal idea 
police commissioner david krauss has called for an officer to be 
appointed to investigate the matter sandori said 
the policemen will remain on duty while the inquiry is made 
the policeman did not break the law but of course this is a case 
of ethics sandori said 
among the journalists who saw the undercover policemen using a 
car with a press sign was a crew from the londonbased visnews 
television agency 
michael sposito the visnews bureau chief in israel said a team 
first noticed the car parked near one of the gates to jerusalems 
old city 
it was a latemodel subaru a rental car with handwritten 
press signs in the front and rear windows sposito said press 
was written in english 
the crew became suspicious when it did not recognize the men in 
the car and photographed them 
about three hours later sposito said visnews photographed the 
same two men arresting palestinian women after a stonethrowing 
incident in the arab east jerusalem neighborhood of wadi joz 
sposito said 
both were armed with sidearms and had handcuffs he said 
one was talking on a police radio and one was dragging a 
palestinian girl away after arresting her 
eli hershkowitz of the zoom photo agency said he had seen the 
rented subaru twice with press tags 
yesterday i saw it with handwritten signs that said press 
hershkowitz said today i saw it in the morning with signs front 
and back that said television 
the statement issued by the press association for foreign 
journalists quoted the visnews description of the incident it said 
the foreign press associated deplores such an impersonation of 
journalists by the authorities as an act that places us at great 
personal risk 
we cannot accept such behavior it conveys to those we are 
trying to cover that we the real journalists may well be police 
agents

ugandan warriorpriestess alice lakwena did 
not flee a rioting refugee camp in central kenya earlier this week 
because she was never there a un official said thursday 
she has been in kenya but she wasnt in a camp said ernest 
allison a un high commissioner for refugees official in nairobi 
after her release from prison she was placed in what was 
considered a safe hideout the government of kenya knew where she 
was and we knew where she was 
allison would not say where that hideout was whether ms 
lakwena still was there or what she was doing he said she had not 
been placed in a group 
allison said that since early 1988 when ms lakwena finished a 
fourmonth jail sentence for entering kenya illegally she has been 
under un auspices while her application for asylum is under 
consideration 
the application is still being processed said allison it 
has neither been approved nor rejected 
a local newspaper tuesday reported ms lakwena was among more 
than 100 refugees who fled from a un camp in thika 27 miles north 
of nairobi on monday after rioting refugees damaged a car broke 
doors and beat up a storekeeper 
ms lakwena 28 who called herself a medium of god fled to 
kenya in december 1987 after ugandan government forces defeated her 
yearlong suicidal crusade to wrest power from president yoweri 
museveni 
her forces were battalions of believers she inspired to go into 
battle singing hymns their chests smeared with oil they believed 
would repel bullets and armed with stones she said would explode 
like grenades 
thousands of her followers died before musevenis army crushed 
her campaign 
musevenis government has not asked for ms lakwenas 
extradition according to o adala head of the africa division in 
kenyas ministry of foreign affairs 
however allison said he could not elaborate in detail on ms 
lakwenas circumstances because of the nature of the case and 
ugandas interest in it

congress will consider reducing the 1 
millionaday fines proposed by president bush as part of a 
crackdown on fraud in the savings and loan industry a house 
subcommittee chairman said thursday 
rep charles schumer dny chairman of the judiciary 
subcommittee on criminal justice said in an interview that he 
supported stiffer fines but added we have to discuss how much to 
raise them 
bush is proposing an increase from 1000 to 25000 a day for 
most violations of banking regulations but up to 1 million daily if 
the violation was made with reckless disregard for the safety of the 
institution 
edward l yingling executive director of government relations 
for the american bankers association in testimony to schumers 
panel said such extraordinarily harsh penalties could prevent 
banks and sampls from attracting qualified managers and directors 
increasing civil money penalties to such a substantial amount 
sets a dangerous precedent giving regulators the power to assess 
penalties that could threaten the stability of an institution he 
said 
yingling also objected to provisions of the bush proposal 
permitting regulators to decide when a violation was committed with 
reckless disregard triggering the 1 million penalty he said fines 
should be capped at 2500 a day 
schumer during a break in the hearing said i think thats 
too low but i think you could find a happy medium 
after the house banking committee acts on legislation next month 
other panels including schumers likely will amend sections coming 
within their jurisdiction 
officials of the general accounting office a congressional 
investigative agency told the subcommittee earlier that most of the 
money lost by failed thrifts is attributable to fraud rather than 
adverse economic conditions or deregulation they said the gao 
examined 26 insolvent savings and loans in eight states and found 
evidence of fraud or abusive insider dealing in each 
as part of a broader bill to bail out the insurance fund backing 
sampl deposits bush is proposing spending 50 million a year on 
discovering and prosecuting fraud at banks and sampls 
schumer suggested that more spending might enable the justice 
department to prosecute a greater proportion of the 4000 pending 
fraud cases involving losses of 100000 or more 
but the acting associate attorney general joe whitely declined 
to ask for an appropriation larger than recommended by the president 
meanwhile david lewis a new york attorney representing the 
national association of criminal defense lawyers said the bush bill 
represents a permanent threat to the rights of the people of this 
nation and a blatant attempt to avoid the constitution in 
exchange for a quick economic score for the government coffers 
he specifically criticized provisions that would give financial 
institution investigators greater access to grand jury testimony 
which is normally considered secret and that would extend the 
statute of limitations for bank fraud from five years to 10 years 
the abas yingling complained that a proposal to pay rewards of 
up to 100000 for information leading to bank fraud convictions 
could lead to widespread abuse by disgruntled employees or 
disappointed customers he predicted that overworked authorities 
would be inundated with tidbits or hunches

although the soviet position remains very rigid 
against returning a group of northern islands to japan tokyo 
welcomes moscows willingness to continue talks a foreign ministry 
official said thursday 
the nations concluded three days of workinglevel meetings on 
tuesday without reaching any agreement on the territorial dispute 
over the kuril islands that blocks a peace treaty to formally end 
world war ii hostilities 
it is noteworthy that this session has taken place and both 
sides agreed to have another round of talks on this issue 
ministry spokesman taizo watanabe said at a briefing 
this is something we welcome i think we do share the common 
recognition about the need to continue dialogue of this kind he 
added 
the soviet union long has balked at even talking about the 
islands off northern japan that the soviets seized at the end of 
world war ii about 10000 soviet troops are stationed there 
this time watanabe said they decided to spell out their views 
on the issue almost for the first time 
the japanese contend there never had been any question about the 
islands being under japanese rule until after world war ii 
rather than discussing the legal points of the issue the soviets 
insisted they had taken the lead in discovery and exploration of the 
islands watanabe said 
this is a working group discussion rather than a kind of pure 
negotiations and the purpose of this is to deepen understanding 
of the positions of each party watanabe said we have found out 
the russian position is very rigid on this territory issue 
asked how the talks had affected a possible visit to japan by 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev watanabe said having 
studied the position of the japanese government if the soviet 
leader decides to come that is welcome it is up to them 
whether they would decide to come 
japanese foreign minister sousuke uno will visit moscow in may 
the workinglevel talks were headed by vice foreign ministers 
igor rogachev of the soviet union and takakazu kuriyama of japan 
they also took up sovietchina relations tensions in korea and 
vietnams withdrawal of troops from cambodia foreign ministry 
officials said

in the latest round of tit for tat diplomacy 
between washington and moscow secretary of state james a baker iii 
has ordered a new yorkbased soviet trade official to leave the 
united states by next week it was announced thursday 
with two soviets expelled from the united states and one american 
from moscow thus far this month state department spokesman charles 
redman expressed hope there will be no further expulsions 
the ouster of sergei malinin an employee of the soviet trade 
organization amtorg was in retaliation for moscows expulsion of a 
us army attache from the soviet union last week 
state department spokesman charles redman said baker told soviet 
ambassador yuri dubinin on wednesday he was concerned by the soviet 
expulsion of army lt col francis van gundy on march 14 
dubinin had no comment when asked about the us action at a 
press luncheon thursday 
redman asked whether malinin had engaged in wrongdoing said 
simply he was being declared persona non grata 
we expect that mr malinins departure will put an end to this 
matter redman said 
the soviets had accused van gundy of engaging in gross 
violations of the diplomatic regime by secretly photographing 
military sites and attempts to enter a closed area 
at the time us officials called the allegations totally

the government is threatening 
punitive action against an antiapartheid newspaper even before it 
publishes its first regular edition a spokesman for the newspaper 
said thursday 
the newspaper the new african could be required to pay a 
registration fee of about 16000 to begin publishing as planned on 
april 3 said spokesman ricky naidoo 
the weekly intended to serve readers in natal province received 
a letter last week from the justice ministry saying a registration 
fee was under consideration 
the government does not automatically charge a fee for a new 
publication but may do so if it rules that the publication may 
later be banned for violating security regulations 
the letter said justice minister kobie coetsee had received 
information that the new africans staff was committed to the 
south african liberation sturggle 
information at the ministers disposal indicates that the new 
african will probably operate on similar lines as the new nation 
said the letter referring to a johannesburgbased weekly newspaper 
shut down by the government for three months last year for allegedly 
publishing subversive material 
naidoo said the new africans lawyers would talk to the 
government in hopes of avoiding or minimizing any fee and expected 
to get a final ruling next week 
in a response to coetsee the new african protested the way in 
which a small publication like our own is placed in jeopardy in 
advance of publication 
the association of democratic journalists which often criticizes 
government censorship said the threat against the new african shows 
the government has so little legitimacy that it cannot afford to 
allow even a single new critical voice to be raised against it

into britain 
two americans brian van den breen and robert cermac also were 
jailed for 12 and seven years respectively for their part in 
importing 880 pounds of the drug in 1986 the largest amount ever 
smuggled into britain 
in passing sentence on businessman roy garner and the americans 
judge kenneth machin said substantial sentences were needed to 
make it clear beyond peradventure that drugtrafficking will be 
stamped out by the courts 
he said the drugs trade causes untold misery damage and 
sometimes death to the takers of drugs 
addressing garner the judge said i am quite satisfied that 
but for your involvement in this conspiracy a huge quantity of 
cocaine would never have come to the united kingdom 
a jury found the three guilty wednesday following a trial at the 
old bailey criminal court 
the court heard that garner 52 ran part of the operation from 
prison after he was jailed in connection with a gold fraud case 
van den breen 40 of london and cermak 28 of key largo fla 
pleaded guilty to taking part in the conspiracy a 43yearold 
woman who could not be identified under court rules also was found 
guilty of conspiracy to supply cocaine she will be sentenced at a 
later date 
the drugs were shipped from colombia to the cornish coast off 
england in 1986 then taken to london for distribution but when 
customs officials confiscated the cocaine about a year later only 
120 pounds was left

nearly 47 million acres of land were damaged 
by wind in the great plains last winter one of the most extensive 
losses on record the agriculture department said thursday 
much of this damage is due to the drought said wilson 
scaling chief of the departments soil conservation service we 
went into the wind erosion season with poor cover in much of the 
great plains because of the drought then this winter weve had a 
combination of no snow cover and highvelocity winds in many areas 
scaling said 88 percent of the acreage damaged was cropland with 
rangeland accounting for most of the remainder 
the scs surveys great plains damage annually from nov 1 through 
the following may 31 a sevenmonth period when winds are highest 
and soils are driest the damage to 47 million acres was through 
february 
scaling said the northern plains were hard hit with montana 
showing damage to nearly 14 million acres about 30 percent of the 
10state total losses in montana and wyoming have been greater than 
at any time since scs began the regular surveys in 1955 
agency records go back to the mid1930s but figures for some of 
those years were obtained from other sources 
the worst damage was done to about 16 million acres in 195455 
although the old dust bowl probably exceeded that in the early 1930s 
before annual figures were compiled 
but the 198788 season was bad too with more than 13 million 
acres damaged in the region another was in 198081 when the agency 
reported 125 million acres 
land is considered winddamaged when the effects of wind are 
apparent to the eye by that time according to conservationists 
the erosion rate has reached about 15 tons per acre a year usually 
at least three times faster than is tolerable or naturally 
replaceable 
a loss of five tons per acre translates into a layer of soil 
about the thickness of a dime spread over one acre 
scaling said farmers used emergency tillage on more than a 
million acres to help reduce the blowing by roughing the surface 
exposed to wind texas accounted for 80 percent of the emergency 
tillage about 880000 acres 
in addition to the land damaged during the fourmonth period 
scaling said more than 225 million acres were in condition to 
blow as of march 1 the most in 32 years highest on the list are 
kansas north dakota and texas he said 
according to the survey which was made in 541 counties of the 
regions 10 states here is the statebystate breakdown comparing 
damaged acres in november december january and february with the

prosecutors today decided not to retry randall 
dale adams for the 1976 slaying of a policeman as adams left the 
state that imprisoned him for 12 years for a murder to which another 
man has all but confessed 
dallas county district attorney john vance said the case has been 
dropped because there is not enough evidence to try adams again 
adams who was freed on bail tuesday after an appeals court march 
1 overturned his 1977 conviction for killing a dallas policeman 
boarded a plane this morning for ohio where his family lives said 
his attorneys office 
ill be glad to get back to ohio he said wednesday no 
offense but i hate texas 
adams whose conviction was questioned in the 1988 documentary 
film the thin blue line was headed for grove city outside 
columbus where his mother mildred had decorated her trailer with 
yellow ribbons 
the texas court of criminal appeals overturned adams conviction 
for killing patrolman robert wood saying prosecutors withheld 
evidence and used perjured testimony 
adams originally was sentenced to death and at one point was 
three days from being executed but his sentence was commuted to 
life in prison in 1980 
despite his experience the 40yearold adams said the states 
judicial system in my case worked texas did not execute me 
adams has called dallas county hell on earth but said he 
holds no grudge against texans 
i do not blame the people of dallas or the people of texas for 
the actions of a few he said 
he also reiterated that he would welcome the chance to come back 
and clear his name in a retrial 
of course i would love to have a jury release me in dallas 
he said i did not kill robert wood 
i believe that if the retrial happens we may be able to 
receive some answers as to why all of this happened and i would 
like that adams said 
his case gained international attention after the release of 
the thin blue line the documentary questioned the testimony of 
then16yearold david harris of vidor texas who had picked up 
adams the day of the shooting after adams car ran out of gas 
wood was killed after stopping a car for a traffic violation 
adams has said harris dropped him off before the shooting occurred 
during the trial harris was the states key witness saying he 
saw adams kill wood but the film showed harris recanting his 
accusations as well as other witnesses reporting information that 
conflicted with their testimony harris all but confessed to the 
shooting and is on death row for another slaying 
adams said he has received a few job offers but has no specific 
plans he said he hasnt quite grasped the fact that he is finally 
free 
i just want to go home i will see where i stand at that 
point he said

department spat worked out a compromise with paul h nitze that 
keeps the veteran arms control specialist working for secretary of 
state james a baker iii on a parttime basis us officials said 
thursday 
nitze who at 82 can look back on nearly a halfcentury in 
government life wanted to stay on the job fulltime as the bush 
administration prepares to resume negotiations with the soviet union 
on nuclear weapons reductions 
but the officials said he initially was offered only the role 
of ambassadoremeritus meaning he would be on occasional call and 
turned it down 
there was no major spat an official told the associated 
press it was all handled in a gentlemanly way 
but still the officials said on condition of anonymity nitze 
had freed his staff to take other jobs and was prepared to leave 
himself until bush invited him to the white house a few weeks ago to 
discuss the situation 
the session the officials said produced the compromise that he 
would be a parttime consultant to the president and to baker his 
resignation as a fulltime adviser effective may 1 still stands 
charles e redman the state department spokesman rejected 
published accounts that linked nitzes departure to disagreements 
with baker over what nitzes job would be in the bush 
administration saying the reports were unfortunate because they 
are inaccurate 
having talked to both sides i feel confident in assuring you 
that there was not that kind of atmosphere involved in this 
particular case redman said 
nitze under former secretary of state george p shultz played a 
key role in the ussoviet treaty signed in 1987 to abolish 
intermediaterange nuclear missiles his government service began

more than 300 women police 
officers from 39 countries called for better career opportunities 
thursday as they ended a conference on issues ranging from child 
care at the police station to sexual harassment in the patrol car 
although more and more women are now pursuing a career in law 
enforcement the top slots in police organizations worldwide remain 
in the hands of men said maj marian de labije one of the dutch 
organizers of the fourday meet 
and that means that it also remains very difficult to draw the 
attention of the higher echelons to the problems facing female 
police personnel ms de labije said 
she noted only a handful of about 100 male dutch police 
commanders and other law enforcement dignitaries invited to the 
conferences opening monday showed up 
the conference the first of its kind to be held outside north 
america where women police officers founded their organization as 
early as in 1915 was attended by women police officers from nations 
ranging from bahrain to the united states to zimbabwe 
what we ought to do is change the minds of men their dinosaur 
mentality said kathy burke a detective in the narcotics division 
of the new york city police department and the president of the 
international association of women police officers an organization 
with members in the united states and canada 
men and women must train side by side to convince the men that 
were not just the captains girl ms burke said in an interview 
in this western dutch town 20 miles southwest of amsterdam 
in the netherlands 7 percent of the nations 30000member 
police force is female a figure that reflects the situation in many 
parts of the world said ms de labije in new york 3000 of the 
citys 28000 police officers are women 
the dutch want to increase the womens share to 25 percent by 
1995 but ms de labije said its unlikely that goal will be met 
one of the problems facing women in law enforcement is proper 
child care said ms burke who brought her two children to the 
conference 
in new york theyre trying to develop a child care system but 
so far only civil personnel is benefiting from it because its a 
9to5 scheme ms burke said its worthless to people whore 
working in shifts 
the only area where proper child care facilities are less of a 
roadblock is africa where such care traditionally has been part of 
the extended family said ms de labije an officer in the juvenile 
department of the dutch national police 
one of the conferences workshops dealt with sexual behavior in a 
mixed police force but the problem of harassment seems to be on the 
wane according to superintendant phyllis nolan of the police 
community relations department in dublin ireland 
it is easier now for female officers now that there is total 
integration now all sections are open to women said ms nolan 
the acceptance is good and we have women in all departments 
from motorcycle patrol people to special branch detectives said 
ms nolan who noted that until 1974 women police officers were 
forced to resign from the irish garda when they married 
at the meeting participants from western europe founded the 
european network for policewomen which plans another conference in 
two years

syrian army gunners and allied druse 
militiamen fought artillery duels with christian army units 
thursday and police said 15 people were killed and 42 wounded 
most of the casualties were civilians in christian east beiruts 
where rockets sometimes landed at the rate of 40 a minute 
a police spokesman said the dead included an 80yearold woman 
who was crossing the street in east beiruts saloumeh residential 
district a lebanese soldier also was wounded police said 
the new casualities brought the toll to 81 killed and 253 wounded 
since fighting began march 8 between gen michel aoun who commands 
the 20000 christians in the lebanese army and the druse militia 
led by walid jumblatt 
other moslem militias and the 22000 moslem soldiers led by maj 
gen sami khatib appear to have stayed out of the dispute the 
fighting threatens arab league efforts to mediate a political crisis 
that split the army on sectarian lines and created competing 
christian and moslem governments 
aoun heads the christian government in addition to commanding the 
armys christian units 
more than 5000 shells and rockets landed overnight in both 
sectors of the capital in the christian region to the north and 
east and druseheld territory to the southeast 
residents of aramoun seven miles south of beirut said syrian 
gunners operated rocket launchers overnight from the hill on which 
the village sits it was the first independent confirmation of 
syrian involvement 
aoun has accused syria of firing on the 310squaremile christian 
region where 1 million christians live in a crescentshaped enclave 
with the mediterranean at their backs 
one witness in aramoun said syrian rocket launchers were 
pouring fire all night at the christian sector 
syria has 40000 soldiers in lebanon and has become the countrys 
main power broker during a 14year civil war aoun has declared a 
war of liberation against the syrian forces 
in washington state department spokesman charles redman said all 
foreign troops except for peacekeepers of the un interim force in 
lebanon should leave the country 
asked if that included syria redman said that would be all 
those nonlebanese armed elements and organizations currently on 
lebanese soil with the exception of unifil 
the thuds of exploding shells echoed across beirut and the 
surrounding wooded mountains residents huddled in basements and 
bomb shelters 
the latest violence began two days after aoun blockaded private 
ports militias use to finance their operations which skim the 
government otherwise would collect at the five legal harbors on 
lebanons 130mile coastline 
lebanons government has been divided since sept 22 when 
parliament could not agree on a successor to president amin gemayel 
and he appointed aoun to lead an interim military cabinet 
moslems rejected the appointment and swore allegiance to salim 
hoss the sunni moslem premier who served during gemayels term 
under an unwritten national covenant dating to independence from 
france in 1943 lebanons president is a christian the premier a 
sunni and the parliament speaker a shiite moslem

million a year ago the march 1 flock included about 232 million 
hens producing eggs for consumer use and 389 million producers of 
hatchingtype eggs

a human rights lawyer died of his 
injuries one day after being shot by an unidentified gunman a human 
rights organization said thursday 
oscar tonog 37 was the sixth human rights lawyer slain during 
the administration of president corazon aquino 
he died wednesday from bullet wounds to the head and chest 
suffered in tuesdays attack in catarman capital of northern samar 
province about 300 miles southeast of manila according to the free 
legal assistance group 
word of his death reached manila on thursday shortly after the 
group sent a chartered plane to transfer tonog to manila for 
surgery said milabel cristobal a member of the group 
the group on wednesday blamed the attack on the military which 
has also been accused of involvement in the previous killings of 
lawyers the military has denied most of the charges 
a member of a governmentorganized militia was convicted of 
murder after admitting he was the gunman in the 1988 slaying of 
human rights lawyer alfonso surigao last year but charges were 
dropped against a military major whom the gunman identified as the 
mastermind the other killings remain unsolved 
all the victims were members of the legal assistance group or 
other human rights organizations they all acted as defense 
attorneys for people accused of either being communist rebels or of 
supporting the insurgents 
these attacks against human rights lawyers also symbolize a 
breakdown in the judicial machinery and the death of the rule of 
law the group said while no lawyer is safe to fight for 
peoples rights in the courts due process and other guarantees of 
human rights enshrined in the constitution remain beautiful but 
empty phrases 
the group said wednesday that four gunmen attacked tonog while he 
and his wife merlita were at a roadside shed waiting for a ride 
home during a heavy rain mrs tonog was not hurt 
on thursday it said only one gunman was involved and that he 
shot tonog from pointblank range in the head chest and back the 
gunman fled aboard a motorcycle driven by an unidentified companion 
tonog had received many death threats recently the group said 
he survived a knife attack in 1981 in his catarman law office and 
the assailant a policeman was arrested tried and convicted 
mrs aquino ordered investigations into the other killings after 
human rights and lawyers groups charged it was only since she took 
over from deposed president ferdinand marcos three years ago that 
lawyers were being killed for defending alleged subversives 
during marcos 20year rule most forms of harassment of alleged 
subversives attorneys consisted only of telephone threats bugged 
telephone lines and military surveillance lawyers have said

officials said thursday that the nations eight 
socalled democratic political parties will continue to operate 
under communist guidance and that new parties will not be allowed 
on tuesday communist party authorities announced a plan to allow 
the eight parties to participate in the government yan mingfu who 
heads the communist partys office that deals with other parties 
said the plan will be ready by june or july 
the parties will operate only under the leadership of the 
communist party which has ruled china since 1949 he said 
the plan comes as a growing number of intellectuals are calling 
for more political freedom and appears to be an attempt by the 
communist party to silence critics without relinquishing power 
leaders of the eight parties said thursday they expected more 
government officials to be appointed from their ranks 
the communist party of china and the eight democratic parties 
share the same goals we are in the same boat wan guoquan vice 
chairman of the china democratic national committee said at a news 
conference 
just like a symphony a country needs a conductor the 
communist party is our conductor 
the news conference was held by the chinese peoples political 
consultative conference a prestigious but powerless advisory body 
currently meeting in beijing 
members of the conference said new political parties are not 
needed because the eight democratic parties represent a wide range 
of chinas people

district of columbia mayor marion barry jr 
said thursday that the nations capital remains safe for tourists 
and visiting business people even in the face of a record murder 
rate 
for the most part the targeted killings and drug activity take 
place in a small section of the city barry told a luncheon 
audience at the national press club except for the killings 
washington has one of the lowest crime rates in the country 
barrys address the first delivered by a washington mayor to the 
press club in 81 years came in the midst of a drugrelated crime 
wave that has thrust barrys government into the international 
spotlight 
in 1988 a record 372 people were killed in the district police 
say drugs played a part in 60 percent of those killings through 
thursday 119 people have been murdered this year in the nations 
capital roughly twice the number at the same time last year 
barry stressed repeatedly that washingtons drugrelated killings 
are occurring in poorer neighborhoods far from the downtown and the 
national monuments 
congress is safe everyone is safe barry said i hope to 
come back here next year and tell you washington is safer than ever 
before 
barry who is under federal investigation for his ties to a drug 
suspect said that the citys crime problems not his personal 
difficulties are behind the citys public relations difficulties 
drugs are the problem not marion barry the mayor said i 
urge the media to be fair 
the mayor said he welcomed assistance from federal officials in 
curbing the citys drug problem 
he said he has had productive conversations recently with 
bush administration drug policy coordinator william j bennett who 
is considering giving the city extra federal aid and personnel to 
fight its drug problem 
he also said he would welcome the opportunity to talk with rep 
stan parris rva who said wednesday he plans to introduce 
legislation in the house to have the federal government take control 
of the citys police force

an american airlines jet took off from the wrong 
runway thursday struck several construction barricades and damaged 
the planes underside before landing safely in dallas 
american flight 508 carrying 92 passengers and a crew of six 
from houstons hobby airport arrived on time at dallasfort worth 
international airport where passengers deplaned normally american 
officials said 
airport ground crews found three of 13 wooden barriers destroyed 
in addition to a 4by4foot plywood sign said sam maloney a 
federal aviation administration spokesman in fort worth 
american spokesman ed stewart confirmed that the plane hit the 
sign and a wooden sawhorse adding that the plane sustained damage 
to the bottom of the tail section and the wheel base 
tina ceppi spokeswoman for the houston aviation department 
which operates hobby said barricades mark a runway section closed 
because of construction 
the pilot whose name was not released had been provided with 
recorded information before the takeoff saying the last 2200 feet 
of the runway was closed because of construction maloney said 
the pilot was in washington late thursday afternoon and was 
giving his side of the story to american officials stewart said 
we have to ascertain what happened first before we can say what 
action we will take stewart said 
the faa is continuing its invesigation and no immediate action 
was taken 
the pilot twice had been cleared to take off on a longer runway 
but turned down the wrong one said geraldine cook an faa 
spokeswoman 
shortly after the pilot began taxiing down the runway 
controllers noticed he was on the wrong runway and tried to radio 
him but received no response maloney said 
once an aircraft is cleared for takeoff a pilot can switch radio 
frequencies and that may have been the case with the american 
pilot he said 
during the planes ascent the tower told the pilot he may have 
hit a barricade maloney said the pilot acknowledged that he 
thought he hit it the pilot thought it was safe to continue ms

the white house on thursday played down a us 
warning about the possible hijacking of an american airliner in 
europe saying the bulletin was similar to many other terrorist 
alerts and travelers should be confident that all reasonable 
precautions are being taken 
airports in england west germany italy and belgium stepped up 
security after receiving the warning issued by the federal aviation 
administration no additional precautions were reported in the 
netherlands greece or spain 
the bush administration was clearly unhappy the warning had 
leaked out in a frontpage newspaper story in london transportation 
secretary samuel k skinner called it a potentially serious 
compromise of intelligencegathering activities and ordered an faa 
investigation of the disclosure 
three lebanese palestinians were mentioned by name in the 
warning according to the daily express the bulletin said the three 
may be traveling on passports from bahrain pakistan or north yemen 
the faa confirmed that it had issued a security bulletin to 
airports and carriers march 16 about the possibility of a 
hijacking of a us airliner in western europe 
the warning did not mention any specific airline or airport that 
might be threatened nor did it cite any time frame for the warning 
the faa said 
disputing the daily express accoun us officials emphatically 
denied that the notice had been relayed to us diplomats and 
military personnel abroad while being withheld from the public at 
large as was the case with a warning prior to the bombing of pan 
am flight 103 which killed 270 people on dec 21 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said last weeks 
warning was intended to heighten the already high security 
procedures now in effect and was not designed for public 
distribution he said the alert was directed to authorities who 
can direct responses to the threat 
travelers on us air carriers should be confident that all 
reasonable precautions are being taken to insure that the highest 
level of security exists he said 
on capitol hill rep james oberstar dminn chairman of the 
house aviation subcommittee said the warning had been distributed 
only among intelligence and law enforcement agents so that they 
could pursue further information 
im persuaded there was not a double standard he said 
referring to accusations the government in the past has warned its 
employees about terrorist threats but not alerted the public 
as for the question of is it safe for american people 
traveling yes oberstar said citing beefed up security resulting 
from the warning he spoke with reporters after members of his panel 
received a previously scheduled private threehour briefing on 
aviation security from government and industry officials 
the faa would not reveal what had prompted the alert other than 
to say there had been sensitive information not designed for 
public distribution 
the release of this information by unauthorized persons can be 
counterproductive to the civil aviation communitys efforts to 
provide a totally effective security system the faa said 
skinner said hopefully no one will lose their life over this 
but it is a very serious matter 
army maj dennis pinkham a spokesman for the us european 
command which is in charge of us military forces in europe said 
the command was aware of the warning but did not pass it along to 
military personnel 
discussing the warning at a white house briefing fitzwater said 
my understanding is it is similar to many many similar kinds of 
information and security bulletins that go out and would be in 
fact lower than many because it was not given to any military or 
diplomatic personnel but rather just to security experts at 
aviation airports and airlines 
refusing to divulge the contents of the bulletin fitzwater said 
i cant comment on whats in this bulletin i dont want to 
unnecessarily scare people or to present public information that 
might be harmful in many ways thats the reason its not made 
public in the first place 
he said intelligence agencies routinely collect information about 
the travel of terrorists or people who are on a suspect list some 
of this information like all intelligence information is 
questionable some of it has higher value than others 
unless it has a certain degree of authenticity or believability 
or credibility or whatever he said you cant go out and make 
general warnings to the public so thats the situation were in 
the daily express printed some of the memorandum which read in 
part 
possible 3 lebanese palestinians may try to hijack a us 
airliner in europe possible names jamel hahmud talid muhammed

labor party leader shimon peres backed a 
palestinian entity thursday as a key to peace in the occupied 
lands where hospital officials said soldiers killed a 14yearold 
boy and wounded 18 other people 
he said he would urge prime minister yitzhak shamir leader of 
the conservative likud bloc to accept the peace plan before the 
premier visits the united states next month peres is finance 
minister in the national unity coalition of likud and his 
centerleft party 
newspaper reports said the plan calls for a palestinian state in 
all but name demilitarized and in confederation with jordan and 
israel peres denied recommending a separate state in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip which israel captured in the 1967 war 
arab hospital officials said soldiers in the occupied territories 
shot the boy and wounded 18 other palestinians at least 405 
palestinians have been killed since an uprising began in the west 
bank and gaza more than 15 months ago and 18 israelis also have 
been slain 
the army denied any troopers were in the west bank village at the 
time but said it was investigating a report that civilian israelis 
in the area responded with gunfire when their car was stoned a 
spokesman said he had reports of six gunshot wounds 
also wednesday labor and its rival the rightwing likud bloc 
led by shamir agreed to allocate 194 million to fund jewish 
settlements in the occupied territories 
media reports said likud demanded almost twice that sum but 
peres finance ministry refused 
haaretz a hebrewlanguage daily said the peres peace plan calls 
for a oneyear truce in the occupied lands including a moratorium 
on the uprising 
in essence we are talking about abandoning our control of the 
territories of judea and samaria its clear it would be handed 
over to some form of arab sovereignty said ephraim sneh a labor 
party member who worked on the plan using the biblical names for 
the west bank 
sneh said details have yet to be worked out but the plan has two 
stages with the problems of sovereignty and the link to jordan to 
be addressed in the second stage 
on television thursday peres said we are ready for territorial 
compromise but vigorously denied calling for a palestinian state 
a risky political concept in israel and gave no details 
i have not proposed a palestinian state he said i have 
ruled out the palestinian state i will present my plan to mr 
shamir 
he used the phrases palestinian entity and confederation 
according to the example of benelux in describing his plan 
the haaretz report said peres calls the plan the benelux 
model a reference to the close cooperation between belgium the 
netherlands and luxembourg 
it said the peres plan would create a threestate federation 
involving israel jordan and a palestinian entity that would be 
a nation in all ways except that it would have no army 
israeli troops would withdraw but maintain a presence along the 
strategic jordan river valley 
after an informal truce began direct talks between israel and a 
palestinian delegation elected from the occupied territories would 
open in geneva under international auspices 
representatives of the palestinian diaspora presumably the 
palestine liberation organization would be brought in at a later 
stage haaretz said 
peres said on television thursday the plo has changed you 
cant deny it 
israel still regards the plo as a terrorist organization and 
refuses to deal with it but the united states began contacts in 
december after yasser arafat publicly renounced terrorism and 
recognized israels right to exist the second formal meeting was 
held wednesday 
avraham burg a labor party dove said the plan published in 
haaretz was a rough version of a proposal that has been developed 
further its in the right general direction he said of the 
newspaper report 
soldiers shot six palestinians thursday in the gaza strip and 
wounded 12 in the west bank hospital officials said 
at ousarin village near nablus in the west bank 14yearold 
maher shakid said was shot in the chest and killed according to 
officials of ittihad hospital in nablus 
a military court sentenced four palestinian guerrillas to life 
imprisonment thursday for trying to enter israel from lebanon last 
year the palestinians confessed to the attempt and said they 
belonged to the popular front for the liberation of palestine a 
radical syrianbased faction of the plo

house democrats girding for expected partisan 
warfare following rep newt gingrichs selection as house minority 
whip circulated a letter thursday raising unanswered questions 
about gingrichs activities 
where i come from you dont look for a fight but you dont 
run from one either said rep bill alexander dark if you 
dont fight back you lose 
alexander said democrats needed an organized campaign to combat 
gingrich who rose to prominence within house gop ranks largely on 
the basis of his ethics campaign against speaker jim wright and two 
dozen other prominent democrats 
rep beryl anthony dark chairman of the democratic 
congressional campaign committee sent all house democrats a letter 
thursday listing a summary of some of the unanswered questions 
about gingrichs activities 
gingrichs penchant for slinging mud is surprising since his 
own career is checkered with a string of questionable activities 
anthony said in the letter in light of these developments i 
though it would be useful to familiarize yourself with some examples 
of the gingrich style 
the letter summarized questions raised previously by the dccc 
about an unusual promotional deal for gingrichs book window of 
opportunity about 13000 gingrich received in 1977 to write a 
novel that never was published and about a political action 
committee chaired by gingrich which raised 217868 in directmail 
solicitations for conservative candidates but spent only 900 on 
political campaigns 
reporters repeated telephone calls to gingrichs office seeking 
comment on the letter were not immediately returned gingrich has 
said previously that he has committed no improprieties 
anthony said gingrich has been a bomb thrower for 10 years in 
the house and the fact that he is now being rewarded by his gop 
colleagues means that democrats can use him as ammunition against 
all of them 
thats a gold mine of campaign issues he said 
if gingrich intends to be a successful whip however anthony 
said he might have to change his tactics 
hes been the kind of guy who wants to burn the building down 
and he doesnt care if some of his own members get burned in the 
fire anthony said but in the gop leadership there is the 
potential to defang him 
rep byron dorgan dnd compared gingrich to a famous figure 
of plains gen george armstrong custer 
custer was a hard charger and everybody got excited about him 
too he said that didnt work out so well

the food and drug administration remains 
cautious about the safety accuracy and privacy of home aidstest 
kits as currently proposed fda commissioner frank young told a 
congressional panel thursday 
young told members of house subcommittee on regulation business 
opportunities and energy that caution at this time is prudent 
because of concerns about technical feasibility as well as privacy 
and counseling 
in this disease there is a death sentence given with a 
positive test and without the appropriate interpretation and 
counseling the food and drug administration is apprehensive that 
some individuals might not only have major psychological concerns 
but might do themselves harm young said 
more than a dozen companies indicated interest to the fda last 
year in developing home aidstesting kits all requiring users to 
collect blood samples at home and send them to laboratories for 
testing the results would be supplied by mail or telephone 
the fda has not approved any such hometesting kits for aids and 
has restricted market research on such tests to hospitals clinics 
doctors offices and other traditional healthcare settings 
young said the fda still has concerns about whether test 
suppliers can assure that blood samples can be collected properly 
and remain unchanged by temperature extremes in transit to 
laboratories also he said he questions whether tests used will be 
as accurate as those available used by healthcare practitioners and 
whether results will remain confidential 
the agency will hold a public hearing april 6 to further explore 
the issue he said 
rep ron wyden dore subcommittee chairman said he also has 
concerns about home aidstesting he said he is convinced that in 
the hands of the untrained the unscrupulous and the insensitive 
home aids testing can inflict considerable human damage 
aids advocates share the fdas concerns especially about the 
need for adequate counseling of people who test positive for the 
virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
we are deeply concerned that making a hometest available with 
a relatively high false positive rate might well be irresponsible in 
playing with the emotions of already frightened and concerned 
individuals jeffrey levi executive director of the national gay 
amp lesbian task force told the panel 
he added that testing is only part of the key to controlling 
aids counseling about risk in spreading the disease is also 
integral he said 
testing does not occur in a vacuum it is most effective when 
accompanied by quality counseling counseling that is best provided 
and assured in person he said 
however elliot j millenson of rockville md who founded a 
company that developed an aids hometest said potential benefits of 
such a test far outweigh the potential risks 
he said experience has shown that people can safely obtain a 
small amount of blood for testing and the sample can be safely 
packaged and withstand unusual and adverse shipping conditions 
he also maintained that telephone counseling is as effective as 
inperson counseling and that in fact doctors already provide aids 
test results and results of tests for other fatal diseases such as 
cancer over the phone

for 92 years the city board of estimate has 
wielded immense power over the metropolis giving approval to 
landmarks like rockefeller center the empire state building and the 
world trade center 
but that power has been jeopardized by the us supreme court 
decision declaring the eightmember body unconstitutional under the 
oneperson onevote principle 
borough presidents from each of the citys five boroughs are 
given one vote while the mayor comptroller and city council 
president get two each 
the boards duties including awarding franchises negotiating 
contracts with municipal unions leasing property and making zoning 
and tax abatement decisions 
the board was conceived in 1864 for the sole purpose of raising 
and spending money for a regional police force its modern 
composition came with the consolidation of new york city in 1898

star south africas largestselling daily 
a compromise was reached in a meeting tuesday calling for botha 
to step down after a general election in the second half of 1989

would serve until the next general election and said there would be 
no early election this year 
the deadline for the next election is march 1990 
the mood in the national party is cautious relief and 
optimism governmentrun television reported in an evening 
broadcast 
it said the compromise was reached after senior cabinet members 
played mediating roles 
the star said botha reluctantly agreed to the compromise after 
finally accepting that the natonal party no longer wants him 
something reported to have hurt him deeply 
the newspaper said an announcement about an early election date 
might be made in april a meeting of the nationalist caucus is 
scheduled for april 8 
the television report said an announcement was expected after 
easter weekend

policies but he is widely viewed as more flexible and pragmatic 
than botha

a day after the us supreme court signed a death 
warrant for the citys powerful board of estimate officials were 
unsure thursday whether the unusual governing body would linger be 
reincarnated leave a respectable heir or bequeath confusion upon 
voters 
mayor edward i koch said he believes the board can go about its 
business until a replacement emerges 
based on normal constitutional law and actions by the supreme 
court on prior matters i believe the board of estimate until 
the change occurs is legal he said 
the supreme court ruled that the boards makeup violates the one 
personone vote principle because each of the citys five boroughs 
has one vote on the board although they range in population from 
staten islands 377600 to brooklyns 23 million 
the board of estimate was set up 92 years ago and wields great 
power in new york it decides questions of land use zoning 
franchises and city contracts and shares budgetmaking power with 
the city council the city has a 25 billion budget this year and 
has to adopt a new one by june 30 
peter zimroth the citys chief lawyer said courts usually give 
governments a reasonable period of time to make adjustments in 
such cases so as not to disrupt normal activities 
one possibility is that residents could vote in a referendum for 
a new government structure in november when the city has its next 
major election scheduled 
that scenario could force voters to cast ballots for candidates 
without knowing what powers their offices would attain all the 
positions on the board of estimate mayor city comptroller city 
council president and five borough presidencies are up for 
election 
koch said during a news conference with gov mario cuomo that he 
was confident the city will restructure its government in a way that 
will hold up in court 
its an easier problem to deal with than drugs and aids he 
remarked 
and cuomo said of the court ruling i dont think its a bad 
thing at all 
he said the charter revision commission which was established in 
anticipation of the ruling must be careful in addressing staten 
islands participation in government 
staten island the least typical borough with a higher proportion 
of homeowners and open spaces and always prickly about being 
disregarded risks the most in a revision 
borough president ralph lamberti already has spoken of secession 
if the island is left with only a weak voice in how the city is run 
a spokesman for the governor of new jersey joked thursday that 
staten island is welcome to become part of the garden state 
koch said one way to conform to the supreme court ruling would be 
to keep the board and give the borough presidents votes weighted by 
population but that would not give staten island the say it demands 
richard ravitch former chairman of the charter revision 
commission and now a candidate for mayor said last year he favored 
eliminating the board which blends legislative with executive 
functions 
he suggested giving its budget powers to the city council 
strengthening the role of the borough presidents in setting budget 
priorities and reducing the mayors he would set up a landuse 
review board give zoning authority to the council and have mayoral 
agencies approve contracts 
that would leave the city council as a unicameral legislature and 
the borough presidents functioning more like other county executives 
in the state 
city council majority leader peter vallone said he favors that 
kind of separation of powers he said the courts decision 
reaffirms my confidence that a balanced and fair government will 
soon be in place in new york city 
officials must also take into account that any changes must 
conform to the federal voting rights act by not diluting the voting 
power of minority group members 
gretchen dykstra spokesman for the charter commission said the 
commission had set april 4 for public hearings on ideas for 
reconstruction of the board but that date was picked before the 
court ruling and might change 
she said it was expected that the commission would draw up its 
recommendations in time to put on the ballot as a referendum in 
november

a weeping fawn hall praised former boss oliver 
north thursday as an inspirational tireless and selfless man and 
said their wholesale shredding of irancontra documents was no big 
deal 
alternately crying and spitting back sharp responses miss hall 
twice appeared unable to go on with her testimony at norths trial 
causing impromptu recesses her sympathies throughout were obviously 
with north though she hardly ever looked at him 
its tough when people portray you as a witness for the 
prosecution when you are a witness for the truth she said outside 
the courthouse hopefully the good guy will win 
she called norths firing by thenpresident reagan on nov 25 
1986 unfair i was very upset she recalled when i heard 
about it i was very angry 
miss hall who was norths secretary at the national security 
council for nearly four years admitted that when attorney generals 
investigators were closing in on nov 21 1986 she altered 
documents to soften recorded versions of norths involvement with 
the nicaraguan contras she also said she helped him in what has 
been called a shredelease of american hostages held in lebanon and that 
profits were to be diverted to the nicaraguan contras he said he 
worked out a price sheet for 240 missile parts tacking on a 270 
profit for each 1 cost 
earl testified that he and north made arrangements that if north 
were taken hostage in iran that i was to go into his safe and 
destroy contents of the bottom drawer he was not asked what was 
in the drawer

solidarity leader lech walesa said thursday 
he would rather not run for a seat in polands new parliament but 
he said he would if the people want him to 
he also said his banned independent union movement will look for 
answers in the streets and by strikes if no final agreement on 
reforms is reached at historic talks between the opposition and 
communist leaders 
neither will solidarity tolerate tricks by officials in 
implementing an accord he said 
walesa made the statements at a news conference in his home city 
of gdansk and in a subsequent telephone interview with the 
associated press 
at the talks in warsaw negotiators continued to discuss economic 
and political topics separating the two sides 
walesas comments cast doubt on whether a final agreement could 
be signed april 3 as planned he said he would need about a week to 
study the document which could be hundreds of pages long 
i must familiarize myself with the entire material even if 
it takes more time it will be understood because we must do it 
well walesa said 
a decision to run for the existing parliament or for a newly 
created senate would depend on the wish of the voters he said 
i dont want to be a candidate but there are situations when 
one must do it walesa said later by telephone but i really 
would not like to simply because there are many people better than 
me 
elections with opposition participation are part of the 
farreaching compromise authorities are seeking at the talks in 
exchange for legalization solidarity would agree to elections that 
guarantee in advance that a communistled coalition would get 65 
percent of the existing parliament seats 
but the new senate would be fully democratic with opposition 
candidates running against communistapproved candidates for the 
first time in the east bloc 
although solidarity has said it would support candidates in 
elections to the existing parliament tentatively planned for june 
most union officials have said they would prefer to concentrate on 
union issues 
some solidarity activists also have expressed concern privately 
that the union might not be able to find candidates quickly enough 
to run for the 35 percent of the 460 seats to be open to the 
opposition and for the 100 or so seats contemplated for the new 
senate 
there may be for example a situation when ill have to agree 
to run because other people refuse walesa said in the telephone 
interview but i really dont want to 
solidarity the first independent union in the soviet bloc was 
born in 1980 and banned after martial law was imposed in 1981

the bush administration has asked congress to 
consider a partial lifting of the freeze on aid to haiti sources in 
the state department and on capitol hill said thursday 
the state department is now consulting with congress about the 
timing of such a move in light of recent steps taken by haitis 
military rulers to guarantee free elections said the officials all 
of whom requested anonymity 
the united states suspended 78 million in aid to the government 
of the impoverished caribbean nation in november 1987 to protest a 
massacre that disrupted elections the united states left in place 
about 25 million in aid to private haitian groups for health 
education and other humanitarian projects 
the state departments proposal would give the haitian government 
about 8 million worth of wheat that had been held up by the aid 
suspension said a congressional source the government would be 
allowed to sell the wheat and use the proceeds to create badly 
needed jobs he said 
the sentiment here is to wait a while and see if president 
prosper avril follows through on his promises for elections 
said the source 
were not that far apart from the administration on this its 
a question of timing he added 
avril who assumed power in a september 1988 coup promised last 
month to set up a ninemember electoral council to fix an election 
date and set conditions for the balloting 
a state department source said that if avril follows through on 
his promise and names the commission in the coming days congress 
may agree to reward him with a small amount of that aid

adoptive parents childless couples and people 
abused as children wrote hundreds of letters urging a judge to give 
joel steinberg maximum punishment for beating his illegally adopted 
daughter to death sources said thursday 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said people from 
all over the country wrote to state supreme court justice harold 
rothwax the judge who will sentence steinberg on friday 
when asked to make the letters public the judge said any letters 
received in the case already had been destroyed 
the sources said letters also came from child advocacy groups and 
domestic violence projects including a georgia organization 
responsible for a writing campaign of more than 100 letters 
not one of the letters recommended mercy for steinberg the 
sources said and some demanded the death penalty which new york 
does not have 
steinberg 47 was convicted jan 30 of firstdegree manslaughter 
in the november 1987 beating death of 6yearold lisa 
a disbarred lawyer steinberg got the child at birth from an 
unwed teenager and raised her as his own rather than arranging for 
the babys adoption as he had promised 
steinberg was acquitted of a more serious charge of seconddegree 
murder the maximum sentence he faces is eight and onethird to 25 
years in prison 
if steinberg is sentenced to the maximum he would be eligible 
for parole in less than seven years because he already has been 
jailed for nearly 17 months since his arrest 
steinbergs lawyer perry reich said steinberg will address the 
court before sentencing 
joel wants the judge to assess his humanity to see his sorrow 
at lisas death and to feel he is worthy of redemption reich 
said hes simply going to express himself as a human being

a potentially unfavorable court decision to 
new york citys staten island has the borough threatening to secede 
and new jersey officials joked thursday they would welcome their 
neighbors across the water an awful lot of people think its part 
of new jersey already said carl golden a spokesman for gov 
thomas h kean 
but bob huber a spokesman for borough president ralph j 
lamberti said any talk of secession by new york citys smallest 
borough remains premature if the boroughs nearly 400000 residents 
did leave new york city it would be to form their own county and 
not to join new jersey huber said 
we wouldnt consider new jersey huber said adding that 
lamberti commissioned a study two years ago that showed staten 
island could be a selfsufficient body 
the us supreme court ruled wednesday that new york citys board 
of estimate violated the constitutions oneperson onevote 
principle the court upheld a lower court ruling that required the 
city to develop a plan giving greater voting weight to larger 
boroughs staten island is by far the citys smallest borough 
the board which rules on issues ranging from landuse to sewage 
rates is comprised of the five borough presidents and the mayor 
comptroller and city council president the latter three each have 
two votes 
huber said the borough would await a decision by the charter 
review commission appointed by mayor edward i koch to revise city 
policy after the lower court decision 
do we want a board overwhelmingly made up of people who dont 
live here huber asked that wouldnt be fair 
golden said with a laugh that he did not want new jersey accused 
of pirating an entire borough 
it would be nice to get another member for the congressional 
delegation golden said if they want to join new jersey 
theyre more than welcome 
just across a small body of water from staten island is the 
township of woodbridge a popular place for the new york city 
residents according to mayor joseph demarino many staten islanders 
work in woodbridge and use the large mall there as a place to shop 
but demarino said he doesnt expect the two groups to share the 
same state name any time soon 
i dont think anybodys talking about coming over to new 
jersey he said you know secessions not as easy as it 
sounds

criminals are demanding protection money from new 
profitmaking cooperatives police cant stop them and the workers 
have begun arming themselves pravda reported thursday 
those who operate the semiprivate cooperatives must choose 
between knuckling under or fighting back the communist party 
newspaper said it quoted a police chief as saying the population 
is arming itself 
people are making guns and bombs right at work said the 
chief who was not identified and you know how they explain it 
selfdefense 
the interior ministry acknowledges that new economic 
opportunities and social change introduced by president mikhail s 
gorbachev have brought more crime 
pravda said the murder rate rose 14 percent last year and armed 
robberies increased by more than 40 percent professional criminals 
are multiplying in a renaissance of robber traditions and 
organized crime benefits from the new atmosphere it said 
the newspaper attributed almost 20000 crimes in 198788 to 2607 
organized groups of which 50 acted in deep conspiracy for more 
than three years 
gangs have soupedup cars computers bugging devices and hidden 
video cameras at their disposal while police work with outdated 
equipment and insufficient enthusiasm the article said 
many cooperatives hire policemen away from the force to serve as 
guards pravda declared sometimes tripling their pay and providing 
up to 34 vacation days a year 
organized crime also causes increased corruption in the justice 
system the party paper said 
underground millionaires and policemen robbers and 
prosecutors judges and speculators party workers and godfathers 
often end up in the same boat together at conviction time it said 
pravda criticized the revised criminal code now under 
consideration although the new code would humanize the system the 
paper said it would benefit criminals at the expense of their 
victims 
changes in the code would provide more alternatives to prison 
sentences such as house arrest and community service and reduce 
the number of capital crimes 
according to the pravda report police would not have a way to 
arrest leaders of organized crime rather than those who merely 
follow orders 
it quoted a detective named y myslovsky as saying our hearts 
sank when he and other investigators learned of the new provisions 
cooperatives are open to extortion because framers of current 
laws never dreamed enterprises in a communist state would produce 
enough profit to make the protection racket worthwhile 
although police have formed antiracketeering units and the law 
is being revised while youre all discussing new legislation 
around here im buying a gun pravda quoted a cooperative worker 
as saying the racketeers have driven me crazy and the police 
wont defend me he said 
gorbachev introduced cooperatives to spur individual enterprise 
and help fill gaps in poor staterun services and production of 
consumer goods their prices are not set by the state and many 
cooperatives sell scarce items for high profits on which taxes are 
comparatively low 
they are praised for initiative but sometimes censured for buying 
up goods meant for the general public cooperatives also have been 
accused of developing their own rackets and bribing officials to get 
permits and supplies

legislation aimed at ensuring that logging in 
the northwest would not be interrupted for at least five years even 
if the spotted owl was listed as an endangered species was 
introduced thursday 
rep bob smith rore said the fiveyear period would allow 
time for wildlife biologists to determine whether the owl believed 
to inhabit only ancient forests was really threatened with 
extinction 
there is not enough evidence at this time to say whether the 
owl is endangered smith said at a news conference 
he said the legislation would not prohibit the owl from being 
listed as an endangered species either by the us fish and wildlife 
service or a federal court but would keep such a listing from 
effecting timber sales 
this is the most moderate kind of an answer to a difficult 
situation said smith 
the owl has become the focal point of an increasingly bitter 
debate in the northwest over protecting oldgrowth timber 
environmentalists have sought to have the bird listed under the 
federal endangered species act while the timber industry has 
insisted that such a designation could halt logging in vast areas of 
the northwest and result in the loss of thousands of jobs 
the fish and wildlife service had previsouly refused to list the 
owl for protection but a federal court in seattle has given the 
agency until may 1 to review its decision 
a general accounting office report released last month concluded 
that the agencys decision not to protect the bird was based more on 
politics than on scientific evidence

transportation secretary samuel skinner 
rejected thursday an appeal by the air line pilots association to 
reconsider a decision by former secretary james burnley affecting 
eastern airlines 
skinner said the fact that burnley was negotiating for employment 
with a law firm that represented eastern at the time was not reason 
enough to overturn burnleys refusal to conduct a continuing formal 
fitness investigation of the airline 
the matter arose before the current machinists union strike 
against eastern which the pilots union is supporting the pilots 
were however involved in own contract negotiations with still have 
not been settled 
skinner signed an order that said the union had not presented any 
information that would justify reconsidering burnleys decision in 
december just before his resignation to join the washington law 
firm of shaw pittman potts amp trowbridge 
the department concluded that since the firm had not represented 
eastern in the fitness investigation proceedings there was no 
reason for secretary burnley to have recused himself and therefore 
no reason to reconsider secretary burnleys decision in that case 
the department had said burnley disclosed his negotiations for a 
job with the law firm to the departments ethics office and an 
ethics official told him there would be no ethical or legal problem 
with him deciding the eastern matter

foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze on thursday 
accused pakistan of ignoring its commitment not to interfere in 
afghanistan and said the soviet union will take firm steps to 
protect its citizens in kabul 
in an interview with the official tass news agency shevardnadze 
said moscow signed the geneva accords in april with the united 
states pakistan and afghanistan only because the kremlin believed 
that outside interference mostly from pakistansupported rebels 
would be completely discontinued 
soviet military forces completed their withdrawal feb 15 under 
the unmediated agreement after more than nine years of direct 
involvement in a civil war that began with a communist coup in april 
1978 
shevardnadze said that despite the soviet pullout the civil war 
in afghanistan continues to rage 
in order to understand why one should turn to the geneva 
agreements again and then one will see that the clause on ending 
interference in afghan domestic affairs has been completely ignored 
by pakistan he told tass 
shevardnadze said pakistan had grossly violated the geneva 
agreement by allowing the creation of an interim government on its 
territory known as the alliance of seven 
he said the agreement also specifically prohibits arms being 
delivered to afghan rebels most of the weapons have come from the 
united states via pakistan 
i shall note again that if weapons were delivered not via 
pakistan then speaking from the legal viewpoint there would be no 
violation of the geneva accords shevardnadze said but the 
matter is that practically all the armaments are supplied from 
pakistan 
shevardnadze said the soviet union was fully prepared to 
discontinue arms shipments to afghanistan but we will not agree 
to unilateral steps 
he said fierce fighting was raging outside the city of jalalabad 
but said afghan forces were repelling the rebels 
shevardnadze also said a large number of soviet civilian 
specialists remained in kabul as well as the staff of a large 
embassy any attempts to encroach upon their security will draw a 
most resolute soviet response he said without elaboration

soviet ambassador yuri v dubinin on thursday 
assailed natos plan to modernize its shortrange nuclear missiles 
as an unacceptable impediment to the improvement of eastwest 
relations 
dubinin at a news conference also said he hoped a date would be 
set for the resumption of ussoviet negotiations to reduce 
longrange nuclear missiles when secretary of state james a baker 
iii visits moscow in may 
we are ready dubinin said 
the nato plan to extend the range of us lance missiles is 
running into obstacles even within the ranks of the western 
alliance west german chancellor helmut kohl with support from some 
other allied leaders is seeking a delay 
the united states is determined to go ahead but still has to 
persuade kohlwhose chance for reelection next year may hinge on 
the missile issue in a country where disarmament forces are strong 
congress meanwhile is unlikely to fund the modernization with 
west germany on the fence 
asked about improving the lances dubinin said its 
unacceptable at any rate not for the soviet union but for the 
process we are talking about its just something which is going 
against the mainstream of peaceable development of the world its 
something which goes against the process of disarmament 
dubinin added theres absolutely no need to do it because we 
have begun in europe a historic process of reducing forces 
unilaterally by the soviet union and multilaterally in 
negotiations 
in any event he said the soviet union will not modernize its 
own battlefield nuclear weapons we are strongly in favor of 
beginning negotiations to eliminate this class of weapons too 
apart from the lance missile issue dubinin fielded questions 
about ussoviet relations in a way that reflected a warming trend 
in moscow under president mikhail s gorbachev 
he said the soviet leader probably would see baker when he goes 
to moscow in the first half of may to hold a second meeting with 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
dubinin described bakers first talk with shevardnadze which was 
held march 7 in vienna as a successful one and the beginning 
of a new active period of sovietamerican relations 
ussoviet negotiations to reduce longrange nuclear missiles 
were tentatively scheduled to resume in midfebruary in geneva but 
president bush ordered a postponement and the administration is 
reviewing us policy 
asked if the delay set back prospects for a treaty dubinin said 
the delay is a delay its absolutely clear but we understand the 
new administration needs some time to get things together its 
understandable

rubella has almost vanished in the united states 
since a vaccine was licensed 20 years ago but federal health 
officials said they are concerned over the large proportion of the 
remaining cases that may occur among women of childbearing age 
although the main symptom of rubella also known as german 
measles is a mild rash if it attacks pregnant women it can cause 
serious birth defects 
during the last major rubella epidemic in 196264 there were 
125 million cases reported in the united states including 20000 
babies born with the disease and 11000 fetal deaths 
the us centers for disease control said people 15 and over 
accounted for 582 percent of all us rubella cases from 198587 
the statistics did not indicate how many of those rubella cases 
occurred among women 
there was one case of congenital rubella syndrome reported in 
1988 according to the cdc but three already have been reported

researchers are using radio waves to treat 
patients with uncontrolled rapid heartbeats a method they say is 
safer and less painful than other techniques 
radio wave energy can be applied to the heart in smaller more 
controlled doses than electricity doctors say slowing rather than 
cutting the cardiac electrical connection that causes rapid 
heartbeats allowing certain patients to escape the need for 
pacemakers 
the method destroys offending heart tissue with only 30 to 40 
volts of energy and can be done with local anesthetic researchers 
also said the radio wave technique is safer than an older method of 
electrical shock because it doesnt reset the hearts electrical 
activity or risk burning a hole in the heart 
the research was reported during the american college of 
cardiologys annual meeting which ended thursday

threeyear period in an arizona school district during school hours 
and recorded 8429 injuries seventeen percent of the injuries 
occurred to 1 percent of the children a significantly higher rate

an end to cocaine use during the first three 
months of pregnancy can reduce odds that the baby will suffer 
physical damage but does not appear to reduce the risk of 
neurological problems a study says 
between jan 1 1986 and feb 2 1988 researchers studied 125 
women 52 who used cocaine throughout their pregancy 23 who stopped 
using the drug during the first trimester and 40 with no history or 
evidence of drug use 
many babies born to women in the second group escaped physical 
problems found in those whose mothers used cocaine until delivery 
but babies whose mothers were in either of the cocaineuse groups 
suffered significant neurobehavioral response deficiencies in 
addition to lack of responsiveness and alertness researchers found 
impairments in orientation motor ability and ability to regulate 
behavior

deteriorating weather has forced the argentine 
navy to halt efforts to clean up a fuel oil spill from a ship that 
went aground jan 28 near an american antarctic research station 
a statement released thursday by the argentine embassy said that 
five argentine naval ships that had been participating in 
contamination control work were being withdrawn due to glacier and 
meteorological conditions 
the statement said that oil spilled from the argentine supply 
ship bahia paraiso has been removed from the sea surface and that 
all potential pollutants have been removed from the wrecked ship 
american experts however say about 50000 gallons of fuel oil 
are still aboard the bahia paraiso and national science foundation 
spokesman jack talmadge said that there has never been ship with 
oil in it that withstood an antarctica winter 
were concerned about what might happen over the winter he 
said 
the bahia paraiso lodged on rocks on delaca island near the 
palmer station and dumped about 170000 gallons of diesel and jet 
fuel into the pristine waters nearby an american research camp 
called palmer station is 11 miles away 
experts from the united states and argentina stopped further 
leaks from the vessel and cleaned up much of the oil but the 
argentine navy now is leaving the scene while tons of fuel remain in 
the bahia paraiso tanks 
talmadge said the vessel could quite likely be susceptible to 
shifting by the force of ice and tide through the winter 
the approaching antarctic winter will not halt american efforts 
talmadge said because the nsf icebreaker polar duke is able to 
operate out of palmer station in virtually all seasons 
the argentine statement also claimed that no visible harm to 
the local ecosystem was noticed especially with respect to its 
fauna 
but experts at the national science foundation which operates 
the us research program in the region said that the spill of fuel 
oil from the bahia paraiso did cause some loss of wildlife in the 
area near palmer station and that the eventual impact of the spill 
may not be known for years 
an extra team of american scientists went to palmer station 
earlier this month to conduct new studies on the effects of the fuel 
oil spill they are expected to return in april 
nsf scientists have been monitoring the effects of the spill 
since the ship first went aground and have reported 
among a population of 30000 birds of at least eight species 
fewer than 30 are known to have died directly as a result of 
ingesting the fuel oil however there is indirect evidence of other 
losses

through oilcovered water some penguins now are apparently being 
eaten at sea by giant petrels a longwinged bird this diet 
unusual for petrels is evidence that the oil spill affected 
penguins an nsf statement says 
an entire generation of south polar skuas died in one rookery 
near palmer station the skua is a gulllike bird of prey nsf 
experts said skua parents were apparently affected by the oil spill 
and failed to protect their nestlings from other skuas and other 
predatory birds there are however many skua rookeries in the 
south polar region 
the loss most feared by scientists is that the area around 
palmer station which has been a science outpost for 20 years may 
no longer be suitable for study because of distortions caused by the 
oil spill the usefulness of palmer station for basic research 
of the undisturbed antarctic ecosystem is in question an nsf

prominent women from gloria steinem to martina 
navratilova to geraldine ferraro say they are worried about a 
backlash against hedda nussbaum from those who believe she shares 
the blame for the death of lisa steinberg 
blaming victims will not save their lives says a statement 
they signed along with actresses roseanne barr and colleen dewhurst 
singer judy collins writer joyce carol oates and some 300 others 
organizers planned to present the statement friday when joel 
steinberg is sentenced for firstdegree manslaughter in the death of 
6yearold lisa the girl he raised with his battered companion ms 
nussbaum 
lisa who was illegally obtained at birth by steinberg from an 
unwed teenager was removed comatose from the couples apartment on 
nov 2 1987 and died of a brain injury three days later 
prosecutors originally charged both steinberg and ms nussbaum in 
the death but later dropped charges against the woman when they 
concluded she was too badly battered herself to have saved the 
child ms nussbaum has been hospitalized for physical and mental 
problems for most of the time since lisas death and she became a 
key witness against steinberg at his trial 
were concerned about the rising backlash which says hedda 
nussbaum got away with something said novelist lois gould who 
drafted the statement in the face of controversy over ms nussbaums 
role 
ms magazine carried a a variety of views on the dispute in its 
april edition including an essay by author susan brownmiller who 
said many of us oldwarrior feminists who followed the case from 
the beginning thought that nussbaum should have been standing trial 
as well for reckless endangerment of a child at least 
those who signed the statement argued that whether or not ms 
nussbaum was culpable the controversy could divert attention from 
battered women who genuinely need help 
i got into an argument with a woman defense lawyer and two 
female judges about this even these people who should know better 
dont understand that hedda nussbaum was a victim said ms 
ferraro the former congresswoman and vice presidential candidate 
we dont know how to deal with these women yet said ms 
ferraro who prosecuted both child abusers and wifebeaters when she 
was an assistant district attorney they are all people who have 
been preyed upon and who find themselves in a situation they cannot 
get out of they are generally misunderstood 
the statement says the steinberg case has forced open the door 
between family violence and our conscience as a civilized society 
it calls for help for women to escape family violence methods to 
stop men from beating women and children and acknowledgement of the 
enormous social and economic toll of domestic violence it said 
women and children fleeing violence account for 40 percent of the 
citys homeless 
this letter is done to remind people there are very few escape 
hatches for women who try to flee no funding few services said 
phyllis chesler a psychologist and author 
rather than blame one woman because we may disagree with her 
the letter reaffirms the larger point our duty is to protect 
women and children from being battered and help them escape rather 
than to discuss in what ways is she really to blame ms chesler 
said

guerrillas blew up a bridge on the only 
paved road to jalalabad the government said thursday the bombing 
disrupted supplies to the city the guerrillas chose as their first 
major objective after the soviet withdrawal 
a foreign ministry spokesman said three other roads all unpaved 
and more circuitous remained open to military convoys between kabul 
and the strategic city 75 miles to the east near the khyber pass 
mohammad nabi amani told reporters the bridge near sarobi about 
midway between the capital and jalalabad was destroyed tuesday by 
explosives planted on the span he said the bridge was one of about 
100 on the paved highway 
moslem insurgents based in pakistan and supported by the united 
states launched their offensive around the eastern city march 6 but 
have not succeeded in dislodging government troops 
soviet military forces completed their withdrawal feb 15 under a 
unmediated agreement after more than nine years of direct 
involvement in a civil war that began with a communist coup in april 
1978 
kabuls airport is the terminus for military supplies from the 
soviet union which the kremlinsponsored government says will 
continue arriving until the united states stops supplying the 
guerrillas 
amani said the guerrillas fired 2000 rockets and artillery 
shells at government positions outside jalalabad in the previous 24 
hours 
no government soldiers were killed but five troopers and five 
civilians were wounded he said he claimed 89 guerrillas including 
four local commanders were killed in the same period 
amani repeated his governments claims that pakistani military 
personnel were aiding the insurgents who call themselves 
mujahedeen or holy warriors pakistan afghanistans neighbor to 
the east has denied such involvement 
in moscow foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze accused 
pakistan of ignoring its commitment not to interfere in afghanistan 
he said pakistan had grossly violated the unmediated agreement 
by allowing the rebels to form an interim government on its 
territory he also charged that arms were being delivered to the 
rebels from the united states via pakistan in violation of the 
accord 
shevardnadze noted a large number of soviet civilian specialists 
remained in kabul as well as the staff of a large embassy any 
attempts to encroach upon their security will draw a most resolute 
soviet response he said without elaboration 
in pakistan the afghan news agency operated by the hezbeislami 
rebel group of gulbaddin hekmatyar claimed army outposts north and 
west of the city were captured 
reports on casualties and the progress of fighting around 
jalalabad are impossible to verify from kabul guerrilla 
headquarters in pakistan have reported far lower death tolls for the 
mujahedeen 
the foreign ministry spokesman said soldiers were conducting a 
moppingup operation against insurgents near khakejabbar 15 
miles southeast of the capital on one of the alternate routes to 
jalalabad 
blowing up the bridge could signal a change of mujahedeen tactics 
in the 17dayold battle for jalalabad which illustrates the 
difficulty for guerrillas of direct confrontation with an army that 
has air power and longange missiles 
sovietmade scudb rockets have been fired daily from kabul in 
the direction of jalalabad since the battle bagan according to 
foreign observers and residents of kabul they have a range of at 
least 175 miles 
a truck hauled three scuds tightly wrapped in gray plastic 
through the center of the capital thursday accompanied by two other 
trucks carrying canisters of fuel that must be attached to fire the 
missiles 
the trucks were seen on a major route from the airport where 
soviet ilyushin76 transports land several times a day the huge 
planes can carry 40 tons of cargo 
thousands more afghans have fled to pakistan further swelling a 
refugee population estimated at about 35 million refugee officials 
in peshawar said most were from villages in the jalalabad area not 
from the city 
guerrilla and other sources said the government imposed a 24hour 
curfew on jalalabad to avert an exodus insurgent leaders said they 
were reluctant to attack the city because of the civilian casualties 
it would cause

officials criticized the british press thursday 
for disclosing a secret federal aviation administration warning of a 
potential hijacking in europe but relatives of air terrorism 
victims said passengers have a right to know of such threats 
transportation secretary samuel skinner said release of the 
warning compromises intelligencegathering activities and 
jeopardizes airline passengers safety hopefully no one will lose 
their life over this but it is a very serious matter he said 
skinner ordered the faa and a team of top aides now in london to 
investigate who leaked the warning to british news media 
the daily express in london quoted from a copy of a march 16 faa 
security bulletin which warned of a possible hijacking of a us 
airliner during the upcoming easter weekend 
the faa which acknowledged issuing the bulletin after reports 
about it appeared in the express and other british media said 
the release of this information by unauthorized persons can be 
counterproductive to the civil aviation communitys efforts to 
provide a totally effective security system 
state department spokesman charles redman said it is necessary to 
keep such bulletins secret to protect intelligence sources and 
ultimately the public 
redman and other us officials denied a daily express report 
that it warned government employees against flying in europe during 
the easter weekend 
but several relatives of victims of the dec 21 bombing of pan am 
flight 103 over scotland said they believe the way the government 
handles terrorism bulletins has the effect of warning diplomatic and 
military personnel while keeping other potential passengers 
uninformed about risks 
the relatives in telephone interviews criticized government 
reluctance to provide the public with information about terrorist 
warnings british investigators have concluded that a terrorist bomb 
concealed in a radiocasettee player blew up flight 103 killing all 
259 people aboard and 11 others on the ground in lockerbie scotland 
we dont think they should use the american public as live 
bait said colleen hermann of huntington ny whose brother 
john michael ahern was killed on flight 103 
bert ammerman a spokesman for the relatives of lockerbie 
victims said the group is not calling for general public 
announcements everytime there is a terrorist threat 
but he said until prudent security measures can be taken to 
protect american carriers a number should be set up for travellers 
to call to get information on any threat against a flight they plan 
to take 
i dont think thats going to paralyze the aviation industry 
said ammerman of demarest nj whose brother tom was killed in 
the pan am bombing 
another victims relative paul hodson an albany ny lawyer 
who lost his 16yearold daughter melina said the present security 
system amounts to a selective warning system 
this whole thing gives us a feeling of deja vu he said 
referring to the secret warnings passed around among government and 
aviation officials before the lockerbie explosion 
what happens when this information is kept secret and yet is 
passed around to literally thousands of security people is that it 
is bound to leak out and hurt the credibility of security it then 
tends to sow panic even among those not directly threatened 
hudson said 
tim cole a washington aviation consultant said if all threats 
were made public they might become so commonplace that people would 
simply ignore them with 600 or so threats a year youd be crying 
wolf all the time he said 
officials say all but a handful of threats are hoaxes 
sherry price a consultant at the national victims center in new 
york city which works with victims of violent crimes said fears 
that warnings may disrupt commercial aviation are unfounded 
theyre not giving the american public the credit it 
deserves she said people are still going to go on airplanes 
but i need to have the right to cancel my plans rather than cancel 
my life

two armenian nationlists were sentenced thursday to 
18 months in prison for leading a strike that closed the caucasus 
republics main airport in july the official news agency tass 
reported 
it said a gevoyan and a pogosyan both unemployed were charged 
with inducing unlawful actions that closed zvartnots airport for 
three days 
evidence was given during the twomonth trial that the men in 
civil aviation uniforms urged people at a mass meeting of the 
banned karabakh committee to march on the airport and force the 
staff to strike 
the demonstrators arriving at zvartnots airport blocked the 
approaches to the airport and the buildings of the air terminal 
tass said takeoffs were prevented and the airports functions 
were paralyzed jeopardizing the safety of numerous airliners 
an ilyushin86 airbus carrying 300 people was able to land safely 
only by a lucky chance the agency reported 
according to the evidence the defendants directed the threeday 
demonstration and strike tass said they ignored all the efforts 
of airport authorities of representatives of party and government 
bodies to persuade them to end the blockage of zvartnots airport 
instead of that the demonstrators leaders continued to make 
absurd demands and threatened to take hostages the news agency 
said it is only due to the intervention of forces protecting law 
and order that the dangerous developments were disrupted 
the defendants have been sentenced to the deprivation of 
freedom for 18 months and are to serve the term in a correctional 
labor colony with a general regime 
tass said the sentence cannot be appealed 
the karabakh committee began a campaign in february 1988 to annex 
nagorno karabakh a predominantly armenian enclave in neighboring 
azerbaijan at least 87 people died in ethnic riots and efforts by 
soviet troops to quell violence between the christian armenians and 
the moslem azerbaijanis

police clashed with ethnic albanian 
demonstrators in the province of kosovo on thursday after the local 
legislature approved constitutional changes that will weaken the 
regions autonomy 
police used tear gas and clubs to disperse up to 10000 
stonethrowing protesters in urosevac a town about 15 miles south 
of pristina witnesses and the staterun media reported 
belgrade radio said several police officers and demonstrators 
were injured witnesses said at least 100 demonstrators were 
detained 
about 2000 university students in pristina tried to stage a 
similar protest but riot police forced them back onto their campus 
the ethnic albanians were protesting the adoption of amendments 
designed to give the countrys largest republic of serbia greater 
control over the affairs of the southern province of kosovo most of 
serbias people are christian and slavic and most people in kosovo 
are moslem and ethnic albanian 
the demonstrators in urosevac chanted we will give our lives 
but we will not give up kosovo the state news agency tanjug 
reported 
of 188 deputies at the parliamentary session only 10 voted 
against the constitutional changes and two abstained from the 
voting conducted by a show of hands tanjug said 
about 80 percent of the deputies are ethnic albanians and it 
appeared they voted for the changes in response to pressure from the 
national government 
more than 100000 ethnic albanians demonstrated last november in 
pristina the provinces capital and thousands walked off their 
jobs in february to protest the proposed amendments 
yugoslavias federal presidency last month imposed a partial 
state of emergency in the province by banning all public gatherings 
and issuing compulsory work orders which carry the weight of a 
call to reserve military duty 
at least a dozen prominent ethnic albanians including kosovos 
former communist party leader azem vlasi a bitter political rival 
of serbias party boss slobodan milosevic were arrested in the 
past month on suspicion of instigating protests 
hundreds of police officers including heavily armed riot squads 
with police dogs patrolled pristinas streets during the 
parliamentary session thursday 
about 85 percent of kosovos 18 million residents are ethnic 
albanian a majority has opposed any moved to restrict the wide 
autonomy granted to the region by the 1974 federal constitution 
the constitutional changes allow tighter control by serbia over 
the provinces judiciary and police they also make it unnecessary 
for kosovos parliament to approve amendments to the serbian 
constitution that affect the province 
previously any changes to the serbian constitution had to be 
approved by the legislatures of serbia kosovo and the republics 
other autonomous province vojvodina 
serbian authorities have maintained the constitutional changes 
are necessary to protect kosovos slavic minority which they say is 
harassed and forced to leave the region by ethnic albanians 
ethnic albanians have countered that slavs are emigrating from 
the province because of the regions severe economic problems which 
include a 30 percent unemployment rate 
they also have expressed fears that by taking away kosovos power 
to approve changes to the serbian constitution authorities could 
restrict such rights as the use of the albanian language in official 
matters and education

randall dale adams went home a free man thursday 
meeting his family minutes after a prosecutor announced he will not 
retry the man who was once three days away from execution for the 
1976 killing of a dallas policeman 
ive been standing a twilight zone for the past 12 years 
adams said after hearing the news i was in that twilight zone 
until the door opened thank god it did 
dallas county district attorney john vance said the case was 
dropped because there is not enough evidence to retry adams who has 
served 12 years in prison a judge ordered his release two days ago 
on grounds his first trial was unfair 
its almost impossible to find sufficient credible evidence to 
try a case that is 13 years old vance said 
adams was convicted and sentenced to die in 1977 for the murder 
of dallas police officer robert wood a crime to which another man 
has virtually confessed 
the onetime drifter has unstintingly maintained his innocence 
his case drew national attention after it was portrayed in the movie 
documentary the thin blue line 
vance announced his decision as adams was en route to ohio to 
rejoin his family he is free on a 50000 personal recognizance 
bond 
in columbus ohio adams walked off an airplane and kissed his 
mother mildred adams both broke into tears about 100 friends and 
wellwishers were at the airport to greet him 
youre supposed to have a resurrection around easter mrs 
adams said i guess this is it 
errol morris director of the thin blue line had to battle a 
contingent of reporters and photographers to get close to adams he 
and adams then embraced 
adams who appeared redfaced and grimacing as he got off the 
plane before hearing the news was given an ohio state university 
cap and a lei made of daffodils he then was taken to a private room 
in the airport 
the texas court of criminal appeals in march threw the conviction 
out saying adams hadnt gotten a fair trial because prosecutors 
suppressed evidence and witnesses lied on the stand 
adams who was three days away from execution before his sentence 
was commuted in 1980 to life in prison has repeatedly said hed 
welcome a second trial 
his attorney randy schaffer of houston said vances action 
served the purpose 
i think he adams would probably agree with me that his name 
has been cleared that hes been vindicated in the court 
proceedings schaffer said 
he said he believes the national spotlight on the case probably 
forced vance to drop it but vance defended prosecutors actions 
including a legal fight that temporarily held up adams release 
earlier this week 
the easy route would have been to release mr adams 
immediately however my obligation is not to the media or to play 
the part of the hero my responsibility in every case is to the 
victim his family dallas county citizens and the state of texas 
vance said 
i think mr adams would be the first to admit to you that the 
justice system works if it didnt he would be on death row 
vance said a motion to dismiss the capital murder charge has been 
filed with state district judge larry baraka who initially 
recommended that adams be retried 
pressure to reexamine the case grew after the thin blue line 
raised doubts about the testimony of the states key witness david 
harris 
harris had picked up adams the day of the shooting after adams 
car ran out of gas in the first trial harris said wood had pulled 
over harris car and adams shot the officer 
in the documentary however harris changed his story and in 
december he told baraka that adams did not shoot wood harris 
provided so many details of the crime that the judge said he 
considered harris testimony a virtual confession 
harris is on death row for another slaying but wasnt charged in 
the wood case 
the district attorney previously said his decision on whether to 
retry would hinge on prosecutors ability to find two key witnesses 
a woman investigators had not spoken with in 13 years and a man 
who identified adams but later claimed he had forgotten his 
original testimony 
vance said thursday he doesnt believe harris confessed and he 
doesnt expect him to be tried for the woods killing 
detective j copeland of the dallas police crimes against persons 
division said the case probably will not be reopened most of the 
officers who worked on the 1976 shooting have retired or left the 
force he said 
its just too bad they can let a guy out because somebody makes 
a movie that isnt right copeland said they prosecutors know 
best if they have a triable case or not in this business you have 
to roll with the punches

senior bush administration and japanese 
officials met thursday to discuss the controversial fsx fighter 
after the chief white house spokesman declared that the joint 
production arrangement is not a done deal 
the president still has to make the basic decisions press 
secretary marlin fitzwater said 
president bush had said he wants to proceed with the deal but 
with modifications to help safeguard us technology and to assure 
that american industry has a share in the planes production 
weve pretty much finished our deliberations here inside the 
administration ive made my decision to go forward with certain 
clarifications bush said at that time 
fitzwater announced that japanese officials would be meeting 
later with secretary of state james a baker iii commerce secretary 
robert mosbacher and national security adviser brent scowcroft to 
present their views on revisions being proposed by the 
administration 
the japanese government has called for us approval of the 
original plan negotiated by the reagan administration with as few 
changes as possible 
japanese officials in the meeting at the state department 
included vice minister seiki nishihiro of the japanese defense 
agency and nobuo matsunaga the japanese ambassador to washington 
after the talks matsunaga brushed past reporters to a waiting 
limousine saying only we agreed to continue meeting i have 
nothing else to say 
a state department official who spoke on condition he not be 
identified said the talks woill resume friday 
there is no conclusion but there is no breakdown either he 
said 
the fsx deal is expected to be sent to capitol hill within the 
next few days it could be blocked if both the senate and the house 
pass resolutions of disapproval within 30 days of being formally 
notified of the agreement 
the president however could then veto the congressional action 
with a twothirds majority required to override the veto 
under the agreement signed late last year st louisbased 
general dynamics would join with japans mitsubishi heavy industries 
to codevelop and coproduce the fsx as an advanced version of the 
us f16 fighter 
proponents argue the agreement represents the best deal the 
united states could negotiate in the face of japanese opposition to 
buying f16s directly from this country they say the deal will 
promote exchanges of technology while helping us industry 
critics contend the arrangement amounts to a giveaway of advanced 
technology that japan may use to help propel its civilian aircraft 
industry into headtohead competition with the united states in the 
world market they say tokyo should purchase americanmade planes to 
help offset the 50 billion us trade deficit with japan 
on capitol hill a group of seven house members led by rep mel 
levine dcalif circulated a dear colleague letter saying they 
continue to have serious reservations about the fsx deal 
if the japanese were serious about improving the defense of the 
northern pacific increasing their share of the defense burden and 
reducing their massive trade surplus with the united states they 
would buy these planes directly from us 
instead they are getting us technology on the cheap to 
develop their own aerospace industry an industry which could 
someday become a major competitor of its us counterpart in 
advanced commercial aviation and space launch vehicles the letter 
said 
also signing the letter were reps tony coelho dcalif house 
majority whip sam gibbons dfla chairman of the house ways and 
means subcommittee on trade richard gephardt dmo chairman of 
the house trade and competitiveness taskforce robert t matsui

receiving a us warning of a possible hijacking but others 
reported business as usual on a busy thursday

had been tightened at airports because of the alert but no 
additional precautions were reported in paris amsterdam athens or 
madrid

administration had issued an alert about a possible attempt by 
radical palestinians to hijack a us airliner in europe this 
weekend 
in west germany officials said the interior ministry and us 
government offices were notified of the threat but had issued no 
warnings to the public 
interior ministry spokesman roland bachmeier said bonn 
authorities received a vague warning but declined to give 
details he said his ministry regularly receives indications or 
warnings of planned terrorist attacks and that security officials 
routinely investigate them

was similar to many other terrorist alerts and travelers should be 
confident that all reasonable precautions are being taken 
the alert was disclosed in several london newspapers including 
the daily express which published a photocopy of part of the 
warning it said had been received by international aviation 
security a subsidiary of trans world airlines

the bush administration and congress reached 
agreement thursday on a central america policy statement that would 
renew aid to the usbacked contra rebels and establish the first 
broadly bipartisan approach to the region in years 
there is a deal said an administration official speaking 
only on condition of anonymity 
i think theyve come together said rep david obey dwis 
of the sides that secretary of state james a baker iii has been 
seeking to unite behind a new policy for the past several weeks 
baker and president bush were expected to meet on the agreement 
friday morning then announce the new policy in an appearance with 
congressional leaders 
the statement expresses support for central american peace 
efforts and democratic goals calls for the ultimate reintegration 
of the contras into nicaraguan political life and calls for an end 
to regional hostilities 
while it mentioned no specific figure for continued aid to the 
rebels money was to flow at the current rate of about 4 million a 
month putting the aid package at roughly 40 million 
thursday on capitol hill baker met first with house democrats 
then with house republicans then with senate minority leader bob 
dole rkan the senate was in recess and dole was seeking to reach 
key senators out of town to secure final agreement 
congressional leaders canceled other plans for friday to be able 
to appear at the white house 
meanwhile however contra supporters said they were concerned 
about an audit report detailing alleged killing rape and torture of 
prisoners captured by the contras and they called for changes in 
the rebels political directorate to ensure such abuses do not recur 
the credibility of contra leaders is at stake said one lawmaker 
who supports the rebels speaking on condition of anonymity 
theyve got a lot of housecleaning they have to do 
congressional sources also speaking on condition they not be 
named said there was compelling circumstantial evidence that contra 
director enrique bermudez also the contra military commander had 
sought to cover up abuses or at least to prevent auditors from 
finding out about them 
the audit performed for the agency for international development 
which administers the aid currently flowing to the rebels in their 
honduran camps along the border with nicaragua turned up the 
allegations during interviews late last year with 32 prisoners held 
at contra stockades 
the agreement on the policy statement by a majority of 
congressional democrats and republicans represented a sharp break 
with the recent history of us policy in central america in general 
and nicaragua in particular it was the most consistently 
contentious foreignpolicy subject during president reagans two 
terms in office 
the compromise policy statement would extend nonmilitary aid to 
the antisandinista rebels through feb 28 1990 after nicaraguas 
scheduled national elections the idea is to keep the rebels in 
place along the nicaraguan border until they feel able to safely 
return to their homeland or decide to voluntarily disband 
the current 27 million aid package expires march 31 
i do think the administration is legitimate on this said 
obey a severe skeptic of reagan administration policy toward the 
region 
a key to the progress was insertion of a provision obey proposed 
that will allow any one of four congressional committees dealing 
with foreign affairs to put an end to the aid at the end of 
november should lawmakers decide the bush administration was not 
adequately supporting regional peace efforts 
another provision stipulates that aid will end automatically 
should the contras engage in military attacks or crossborder 
incursions or evidence further human rights violations the package 
also says the aid money can be used for regional relocation of 
the rebels 
obey said our expectation is that this will be in full support 
of the central american presidents who have been seeking to forge 
a regional peace settlement most recently at a february meeting in 
el salvador their agreement there called for establishing a plan by 
midmay to disband the 11000man contra force and for the rebels to 
be reintegrated into nicaragua as political freedoms are 
reestablished 
much of the twopage us policy statement which had been 
stamped secret and kept under close wraps by baker consists of 
broad and general policy pronouncements reaffirming democratic goals 
for the region missing from the document are the kinds of harsh 
denunciations of the sandinistas that characterized reagan 
administration rhetoric 
lawmakers gave credit to baker a relative newcomer to the 
foreignpolicy field for earning their trust by sitting through 
long meetings with them taking a nonideological approach to the 
talks and offering sincere pledges of good faith 
theres no question that he wanted to find the center of 
gravity and rest his policy on it said rep john spratt dsc 
a moderate democrat who has been part of a group of swing voters 
on contra aid in the past he has been trying to build a policy 
based on political reality 
he offered statements that he is going to not only be a party 
to make the agreements and peace accords work but that he 
personally would work against any secret military involvement 
added rep charles stenholm a conservative texas democrat 
as for the audit on alleged torture by the contras it said 
female prisoners between the ages of 15 and 25 reported being 
raped and tortured by nicaraguan resistance officials at the 
time of their detention so they would confess to being 
infiltrators 
male prisoners detained on suspicion of infiltration or sabotage 
and spying also contended they had been tortured when they were 
picked up and imprisoned in the log huts and barbedwire enclosures 
and one prisoner was killed during interrogation 
contra spokesman bosco matamoros said a rebel tribunal was 
prosecuting at least one and as many as four suspects in the case 
and would mete out appropriate punishment we think it is tragic 
lamentable he said

prime minister bob hawke said thursday 
he will not call elections early as the opposition and some others 
have predicted 
i am ruling out a july election he said in a radio interview 
hawke has said he would let the government run its threeyear 
term until may 1990 but critics said his tearful admission on 
television tuesday that he had cheated on his wife of 33 years may 
have been a bid for sympathy and votes 
the 59yearold labor party leader has won an unprecedented three 
terms as prime minister and in the past has called elections early 
despite asserting he would not 
john howard leader of the opposition liberal party suggested 
last weekend that hawke might call elections in july 10 months 
early 
in the radio interview his first public comment since the 
television confession hawke said the people that meet me are as 
enthusiastic as theyve ever been 
his approval rating has fallen to 48 percent however and a poll 
published wednesday indicated the labor party would have lost if 
national elections had been held earlier this month 
the tabloid daily mirror of sydney speculated that the promise of 
large tax reductions beginning july 1 indicate an election is coming 
political tacticians on both sides agree boosting the average 
pay packet by at least 30 25 us a week will be electorally 
advantageous it said 
hawke is a former trade union leader who once was a heavy 
drinker his public admission of infidelity and his promise to stay 
faithful were unexpected 
barry cassidy his press secretary tried to counter the talk of 
electioneering and clive robertson who interviewed hawke on 
television said he thought the remarks were made off the cuff

a postal strike that has held up millions of 
letters from tax forms to love notes entered its 50th day thursday 
but officials said it could end next week 
for two months i have not received the check that my son sent 
me from the united states i am living on loans i dont know 
what else to do said an elderly man waiting outside limas 
central post office 
he and dozens of others lined up in hopes that their mail somehow 
got through 
jorge perez national mail director told the associated press 
that workers tentatively agreed to end their strike monday but the 
national federation of postal workers had not publicly agreed to a 
settlement 
courier services such as dhl worldwide express said business has 
surged since the strike began some people have gone into business 
for themselves by placing newspaper ads offering to carry letters 
for mailing in miami for a 2 to 3 charge 
postal officials in lima said there has been no home delivery 
since the citys 570 letter carriers struck a small number of other 
postal workers remain on the job but the mail flow especially 
arriving letters has been reduced dramatically 
still officials said more than 10 million letters are piling up 
in post offices in the city four storerooms in the central office 
are filled to the ceiling with swollen mail pouches 
the postal workers union struck feb 2 for higher wages to 
counter inflation which hit 110 percent during the first two months 
of this year 
the government decreed a 30 percent wage increase for public 
employees earlier this month but the union said the raise was 
insufficient and continued the strike 
eugenio medina a 25year postal veteran said his current salary 
equivalent to about 31 a month is barely enough to change the 
soles of my shoes 
the inflation has combined with a 9 percent shrinkage of perus 
economy last year to plunge the nation into its worst recession of 
the century 
there have been dozens of strikes including walkouts by 
telephone workers bank employees social security personnel and 
limas morgue staff mine workers announced a tentative strike for 
monday 
the government has argued that the wage increases demanded by 
workers will only cause higher inflation and do little to boost 
their spending power 
analysts say the weak economy and a relentless eightyear 
insurgency by leftist guerrillas have undermined government 
stability 
president alan garcia began his fiveyear term in july 1985 his 
centerleft government cut inflation and sparked two years of growth 
in 1986 and 1987 by using government dollar reserves to subsidize 
imports of food and consumer and industrial goods 
the economy began to falter late in 1987 when the reserves were 
gone and the government continued its program despite a growing 
budget deficit considered the major cause of inflation

americas affluent households are becoming 
richer while the poor are drifting ever deeper into poverty says a 
federal report that compared family incomes from 1973 through 1987 
according to the study released this week by the house ways and 
means committee the wealthiest 20 percent of the nations 
households saw on average a 12 percent increase in income over the 
15year period from 60299 to 67416 
at the same time the poorest fifth experienced an 8 percent 
drop from 5507 to 5107 
this widening disparity between rich and poor particularly for 
families with children is very disheartening said rep thomas 
downey dny and the chairman of the subcommittee on human 
resources these families are not even standing still they are 
losing ground 
the biggest reason for the poor becoming poorer the report says 
was cuts in welfare programs aid to families with dependent 
children was reduced over 30 percent during the period food stamp 
benefits and other social programs also were cut 
an economist for the committee who preferred not to be quoted by 
name said statistics also show that more jobs paid povertylevel 
wages in 1987 than in 1979 midway through the survey period 
he also pointed out that more families consist of neverwed 
mothers and their children 
while the total number of americans under 18 years of age 
decreased by about 800000 from 1960 to 1987 from 637 million to 
629 million the number living with a nevermarried mother grew 
from 243000 to 42 million 
statistics also show that after adjusting for inflation 80 
percent of all single workingmothers earned less in 1987 than in 
1979 
in families with both a mother and father raising children 
income among the poorest dropped 113 percent from 1973 to 1987 
from 14038 annually to 12796 the report said 
the good news in the report is for the elderly who married or 
not saw their incomes rise 20 percent to 30 percent on average 
from 1973 to 1987 
these increases were explained by rising social security benefits 
and the fact that a greater portion of the elderly population 
collected pensions in 1987 than in 1973 the report said 
the years 1973 1979 and 1987 were used in calculating incomes 
for the study background material and data on programs within the 
jurisdiction of the committee on ways and means because they were 
peak years within economic cycles

two hundred antiabortion activists waving 
pictures of aborted fetuses were arrested as they blockaded a health 
clinic thursday in the first of a series of holy week protests that 
have put police on alert 
the arrests of the protesters and their 29yearold leader 
randall terry who was carried away in a fetal position brought 
cheers and applause from 150 prochoice advocates outside the clinic 
20 miles east of los angeles 
the antiabortion protesters organized by operation rescue many 
from out of state clutched rosary beads sang hymns and prayed as 
they were arrested by police at the family planning associates 
medical clinic in suburban cypress 
counterdemonstrators chanted not the church not the state 
women will decide our fate and hoisted freedom of choice and 
keep abortion legal signs 
the prochoice people began gathering at 715 am to counter 
what new yorkbased operation rescue billed as its biggest 
antiabortion protest since undertaking blockades of clinics that 
perform abortions two years ago 
i just think somebody has got to do this this is too big to 
ignore we need to do something for our voices to be heard said 
sue otti one of those who tried to block operation rescue members 
southern california was targeted for the preeaster national 
week of rescue organizers said because of its high abortion rate 
and many clinics 
the 400 antiabortionists participating in the cypress protest 
sang the battle hymn of the republic and jesus loves the 
little children 
the antiabortion advocates refused comment terry who had 
displayed what he said was an aborted 19weekold fetus in a small 
white coffin at a wednesday news conference said he wouldnt make a 
statement until the media shows pictures of aborted fetuses which 
the activists usually display on posters 
we do have a certain sense that media are not being fair with 
this issue because a lot of the media has not explained adequately 
the moral dilemma of equating a womans right to have an abortion 
to a fetus right to live said lou sheldon of traditional values a 
group representing 6000 churches 
the arrested were booked for investigation of failing to 
disperse a misdemeanor under terrys order they went limp during 
arrests requiring four police officers to drag each one to a bus 
that took them to cypress city hall 
at one point the prochoice advocates tried to block 
antiabortion protesters who crawled to the clinic on hands and 
knees to replace comrades who had been arrested 
later the police used prochoice advocates to help them escort 
about 25 workers and abortion patients into the clinic as operation 
rescue members shouted to one teenage girl entering reconsider 
keep your baby 
calls to the clinic were referred to a los angeles office where 
a secretary said there would be no comment from management however 
antiabortion activists said the clinics owner was dr edward c 
allred a frequent target because he owns a number of clinics in the 
area 
los angeles officials who had expected protests by 2500 people 
were on alert in a city command center four floors under city hall 
police fire and sheriffs officials kept tabs on activity at 
clinics throughout los angeles county including the her medical 
clinic near downtown where 50 prochoice advocates gathered 
operation rescue members had vowed to risk arrest and defy a 
federal court order obtained by the aclu that forbid protesters from 
blocking entrances or gathering within 15 feet of the clinic 
in suburban inglewood police expecting protests there set up 
hollywood park race track as a temporary jail site but it wasnt 
needed 
the operation rescue protest was supported by archbishop roger 
mahony head of the roman catholic archdiocese of los angeles 
prochoice groups gathered as the coalition for safe and legal 
abortion included the american civil liberties union of southern 
california the california abortion rights action league the 
national organization for women and hollywood celebrities including 
christina pickles of st elsewhere who attended the cypress 
rally 
blockades were expected to continue through saturday prochoice 
advocates vowed area clinics would remain open 
the national operation rescue organization began its blockades 
outside womens clinics in 1987 and since then more than 21000 of 
its antiabortion protesters have been arrested nationwide

spets spets spets spets boris n yeltsin 
rasped at a gathering of 1000 workers using russian slang to 
criticize the network supplying special food consumer goods cars 
and drivers to communist party officials 
his voice cracking from overuse the former communist party boss 
of moscow demanded the privileges be eliminated all of them have 
to go yeltsin said 
the workers applauded 
days before soviets vote in the first multicandidate elections 
yeltsin has become a lightning rod for people resentful of plenty 
for a privileged few and empty store shelves for the rest 
the election is sunday and yeltsin is running against yevgeny 
brakov director of the zil plant that manufactures the ultimate 
symbol of power and privilege the shiny black zil limousine 
yeltsin received a warm welcome when he criticized official 
privileges at brakovs plant tuesday in his drive to capture in a 
popular election a seat representing all of moscow the word 
spets is a short form of the russian word for special as in 
special privilege 
olga ultiova who joined a proyeltsin demonstration in downtown 
moscow on wednesday praised him as the only one in 70 years of 
soviet power who did not take the privileges offered by his 
position 
yeltsin rallies speeches and campaign posters are all over the 
soviet capital the campaigning is an unprecedented sign of 
political activity after years when soviets dutifully went to the 
polls to mark their ballots for the only choice available the 
candidate approved by party officials 
the burly 58yearold siberia native has become an issue himself 
for or against it is yeltsin who voters are discussing 
for me comrade yeltsin is a real national hero n barinov 
a disabled world war ii veteran wrote to the vechernaya moskva 
newspaper 
but in a letter printed just above it retiree i pidevich wrote 
that a cult of personality already has begun to form around him 
his personality is already covered by something that doesnt 
correspond to reality an unrealistic halo the basis of a cult 
those are charged words in the soviet union for more than 30 
years cult of personality is the term by which soviets have 
referred to stalins reign of terror 
it was yeltsins criticism of the party and warning that a cult 
was developing around president mikhail s gorbachev that got him 
fired as moscow party chief in november 1987 
he charged into moscow in late 1985 from the industrial city of 
sverdlovsk as gorbachevs choice to take over from the corrupt city 
administration of viktor grishin he won admirers for his energetic 
attacks on bureaucracy and food shortages and was among the 
strongest supporters of gorbachevs policy of glasnost or 
greater openness 
after his firing yeltsin went back to his original profession 
construction and was given a job as the first deputy chairman of 
the state construction committee 
that job has the status of a government minister but nowhere 
near the prestige yeltsin arrived at the zil plant in a black 
chaika a limousine but a step below the status of the factorys 
zil he admits to accepting special health services and a country 
home but says he turned down special food supplies access to other 
special stores and services 
yeltsin is no more popular now with the party hierarchy than he 
was when he was accused of mistakes in his work as moscow party 
chief and being overly ambitious but a yeltsin victory would be 
proof that under gorbachev the party can tolerate diverse opinions 
in an interview thursday with the british broadcasting corp 
yeltsin said authorities had been trying to restrict his access to 
the public during the campaign 
asked where the obstruction was coming from yeltsin said 
first of all from the moscow city authorities but i think it has 
the agreement perhaps not the agreement but at least the 
knowledge of the very top levels 
it is clear that they dont want me to get elected yeltsin 
said they get together and they say were not going to let 
yeltsin through i suppose its because im an awkward customer 
they dont know how to deal with me 
the maverick communist says he recognizes gorbachev as the soviet 
leader and does not intend to challenge him 
from the viewpoint of the strategy of external politics i 
fully support him yeltsin said in february from the viewpoint 
of the strategy of internal politics fully from the viewpoint of 
tactics i have my own opinion 
yeltsin says that is because the reforms havent gone far enough 
you may think this is a utopia i dont consider it utopia 
he told the voters

fbi agents who arrested an excabinet minister of 
ferdinand marcos have warrants to arrest five other exaides to the 
ousted philippines leader but arent expecting them to visit a 
federal agent said thursday 
a list prepared by marcos aides for security guards at st 
francis medical center showed that 11 former cabinet members were 
expected to visit the ailing marcos who has been hospitalized since 
jan 15 with heart and lung ailments 
after what happened yesterday we dont have any information 
that theyre still coming said ralph girardi assistant fbi 
agentincharge in honolulu we dont have any absolute word that 
theyre not but were really not expecting them anymore 
marcos aides said the former ministers trips may be canceled 
the arrested aide jaime laya who was head of the philippines 
central bank and later minister of education was taken into custody 
on a material witness warrant wednesday at honolulu international 
airport he was ordered to appear may 8 in us district court in 
new york 
girardi said material witness arrest warrants or subpoenas were 
also issued for at least five others including five of the six 
former cabinet ministers scheduled to arrive in honolulu thursday or 
friday 
those who had been expected to visit marcos were cea virata 
former prime minister and finance minister manual alba former 
budget director jesus azurin former health minister placido mapa 
jr former secretary general and geronimo velasco former energy 
minister girardi said 
the only scheduled guest who was not on the fbis list was ted 
pena former director of natural resources girardi said 
we may have just overlooked him he said 
marcos spokesman gemmo trinidad said jose rono former minister 
of local governments visited marcos thursday but us authorities 
didnt approach him 
rono came from los angeles trinidad said and they probably 
didnt know he was coming so they didnt get him 
everyone who cleared their trip with philippine president 
corazon aquino was told sure go ahead then when they get here 
theyre greeted by the fbi trinidad said it seems like there 
is an intimate cooperation between the two governments when mrs 
aquino has said her government wouldnt interfere in the us 
matters 
meanwhile former philippine first lady imelda marcos called laya 
a poor guy who doesnt know anything about our business 
this is really something to happen in the united states the 
land of democracy mrs marcos told the honolulu starbulletin 
he was only coming here to pay his respects to a dying man 
president marcos relationship with him was always very official 
how very sad that a dying man can no longer have visitors 
she said 
laya paid a 10000 cash deposit on 100000 bail wednesday and 
was forced to surrender his passport he was released pending a 
second bail hearing friday to decide whether he can leave the united 
states before his scheduled new york appearance 
assistant us attorney charles labella lead prosecutor in the 
marcos case said laya would not necessarily be held until may 8 
hes important to the governments case and we want to make 
sure hes here to testify at the governments main case labella 
said its calculated to make sure theres sufficient bail to 
ensure his appearance at trial 
laya was director of marcos budget office in the mid1970s and 
was later named central bank governor he was forced to resign from 
the central bank in 1984 after the discovery of an overstatement of 
600 million in the countrys foreign exchange reserves 
despite criticism marcos then appointed laya minister of 
education a post he held until marcos was ousted in 1986 
us authorities said laya earlier refused to talk to federal 
prosecutors in new york and manila 
marcos accused of stealing more than 100 million from his 
homeland and stashing much of it in the united states remained in 
guarded condition thursday at st francis 
although mrs marcos pleaded innocent to the charges and was 
freed on 5 million bail her husbands ill health has prevented his 
arraignment 
four other visiting former aides blas ople former minister of 
labor estelito mendoza former minster of justice conrado 
estrella former minister of agrarian reform and sylvia montes 
former minister of social services have already received subpoenas 
and were ordered to appear in court with layas

randall dale adams newly freed from the 
charges that nearly led to his execution arrived home thursday to 
tears and hugs from family members and friends who had waited more 
than a decade for his release 
youre supposed to have a resurrection around easter adams 
mother mildred said shortly after embracing her son as he stepped 
off the plane at port columbus international airport i guess this 
is it 
adams arrived in his hometown just as the dallas county texas 
district attorney announced adams would not be retried for the 1976 
slaying of a dallas policeman 
told of the news as he arrived adams remained skeptical 
ill wait until i hear it from my attorney im not supposed to 
talk about the case adams told reporters 
later he said ive been standing in a twilight zone for the 
past 12 years i was in that twilight zone until the door 
opened thank god it did 
adams was convicted and sentenced to die in 1977 for the murder 
of dallas police officer robert wood a crime to which another man 
has virtually confessed adams was three days away from exection 
before his sentence was commuted in 1980 to life in prison 
the case came under scrutiny in the documentary the thin blue 
line which questioned the testimony of the states key witness 
david harris earlier this week adams was released from prison in 
texas on grounds his first trial was unfair 
as he arrived in columbus adams embraced his mother first and 
both broke into tears errol morris director of the thin blue 
line had to battle a contingent of reporters and photographers to 
get close to adams he and adams then embraced 
about 100 supporters many of them wearing yellow lapel ribbons 
looked on among them was tressa lucas a family friend 
it feels great ms lucas said its the best ive felt in 
40 years almost his mother and i are real good friends and we 
just stuck by each other shes just really had a hard time 
i told her all along that the lord would have him released 
mayor dana rinehart joined the merrymakers offering a job to 
adams who was unemployed before his arrest in dallas rinehart said 
he had no specific job in mind but would work that out with adams 
adams told rinehart jokingly i didnt really want to be 
mayor 
asked if he expected such a reception adams said i couldnt 
have dreamed this i knew i would be home but not this way 
adams who appeared redfaced and said he did not feel well after 
he got off the plane was given an ohio state university cap and a 
lei made of daffodils 
a few moments later he held a news conference at the airport as 
he walked from the terminal gate toward the area where the news 
conference was to be held adams mother and his sister nancy 
stood on either side of him and appeared to be holding him up he 
was taken to a private room in the airport and appeared fully 
recovered when he began speaking to reporters 
while adams was being reunited with his family here district 
attorney john vance announced in dallas that a motion had been filed 
with state district judge larry baraka to dismiss the capital murder 
charge against adams 
the texas court of criminal appeals in march set aside the 
conviction saying adams hadnt gotten a fair trial because 
prosecutors suppressed evidence and witnesses lied on the stand

the foreign relations department announced 
wednesday it has no agreement with the united states allowing us 
immigration officials to be based in mexico 
the us immigration and naturalization service recently posted 
teams of agents in mexico to monitor the routes of central americans 
passing through the country on their way to the united states 
mostly to southern texas 
the operation which began feb 21 and has been canceled came 
under criticism in mexico mexican newspapers called it outrageous 
intrusion on mexican sovereignty 
the ins was quoted as saying its patrols were carried out with 
the cooperation of the mexican government 
the foreign relations department in a dispatch sent to news 
agencies wednesday afternoon said there is no diplomatic accord 
between mexico and the united states that establishes the 
collaboration of the mexican police and the ins to avoid the flow of 
undocumented immigrants to the united states 
the ins agents traveling through mexico filed their daily 
reports to washington from the us embassy in mexico city news 
reports said 
the ins has denied that the operation was undercover but 
canceled it anyway 
central americans have been emigrating to the united states in 
everincreasing numbers us officials say some officials estimate 
that 100000 central americans will try to enter the united states 
this year 
on feb 21 the us government clamped down on the flow of 
aliens asking for asylum in the united states by demanding proof of 
persecution since then the overwhelming number of asylum cases in 
south texas have been denied and the number of people seeking 
amnesty has dropped

an anticrime group blew up a van wednesday to 
dramatize the bombing of a vehicle driven by the wife of a navy 
captain and authorities said the reenactment will be shown on local 
television to draw out witnesses 
the videotaped bombing is part of the investigation into a march 
10 blast that destroyed a van driven by sharon rogers wife of uss 
vincennes capt will c rogers iii 
a van similar to the one driven by mrs rogers was taken to a 
deserted area near an airstrip and rigged for explosion and fire by 
fire department bomb experts 
the reenactment is intended to trigger something in the mind of 
someone who may have seen something that day or in mrs rogers 
neighborhood leading up to the time of the bombing said molly 
wilson cartmill executive director of the san diego chapter of 
crime stoppers 
the national nonprofit organization which staged the 
reenactment in cooperation with local and federal authorities 
operates an anonymous tip hot line and raises reward money for those 
who help authorities solve crimes 
on tuesday mrs rogers was interviewed on videotape at san diego 
police headquarters for the crime stoppers segment on the attack 
the tape will be distributed to local television stations monday 
my understanding is she was an excellent speaker said 
cartmill she did really well she talks a lot about that morning 
the explosion itself and she makes a plea for information from 
the public 
mrs rogers escaped injury in the explosion which occured when 
she was stopped at an intersection near the la jolla area of san 
diego 
authorities are investigating if the attack was terrorist 
retaliation for the vincennes mistaken destruction of an iranian 
jetliner in the persian gulf last july all 290 aboard were killed 
a total of 27000 is being offered for information in the case 
25000 from an anonymous san diego developer 1000 from crime 
stoppers and 1000 from the vincennes crew 
the videotape is being created with the cooperation of the fbi 
the lead agency in the investigation as well as naval investigative 
services and local authorities cartmill said 
on tuesday the rogerses made their first public statement since 
the bombing sending out a letter that calls on the nation to resist 
bowing to terrorism 
the image of a burning van in the middle of a street of our 
community must not become a symbol of fear and unreasoned 
reaction they said 
mrs rogers reportedly is resentful over the loss of her teaching 
job at la jolla country day school following the bombing 
although the school has maintained that her leaving was a mutual 
decision sources told the los angeles times that mrs rogers was 
fired after the possibility of terrorism was raised 
jim stewart the schools development director said officials 
are standing by their earlier statement that mrs rogers and school 
officials decided she should leave her fourthgrade teaching 
position to ensure the safety of the children 
stewart also said the school will pay mrs rogers her full salary 
through august he declined to say how much that is

oscar selection has come under scrutiny as film 
studios go to new lengths to pull votes out of the academy of motion 
picture arts and sciences 
and with the flood of oscar vote enticements from free coffee 
mugs to complimentary buffet dinners academy members are 
acknowledging that some oscar voting is done by committee in 
violation of the rules secretaries spouses and friends several 
academy members say are marking ballots in what is supposed to be 
the entertainment industrys most esteemed awards competition 
its like a local election of judges said academy member 
harry clein who said hes witnessed team voting a lot of people 
dont know who the candidates are so they take a look at whos 
around them and see what the consensus is 
as far as elections go its not bad but ive never been 
through an election in argentina 
dan lyle who oversees the oscar balloting for the accounting 
firm price waterhouse inc said that there is no guarantee that 
academy members have actually filled out their own ballots 
all we know is that a properly numbered ballot has been 
returned he said members are on the honor system to fill out 
the ballot themselves 
more than 4600 members were given ballots this year for the 61st 
annual academy awards which will be telecast on march 29 from the 
shrine auditorium in los angeles academy members vote on their area 
of specialty the academys actors branch for example is the only 
group to select nominees in the four acting categories 
since the voting is done secretly members do not sign their 
ballots the ballots authenticity is ensured solely by a numeric 
control number lyle said ballots are invalidated only if there is 
more than one vote in a given category and only the votes in that 
specific category are not tallied he said 
nominations for acting directing art direction and all 
specialized categories are handled by select branches and committees 
composed of academy members 
all voting members of the academy can participate in the best 
picture nominations and may vote for the final awards in all 
categories winners for best documentary feature best animated 
short film and best liveaction short film are chosen by only those 
members who have seen all the nominees 
academy constituent julian blaustein said that most of his 
colleagues take the voting very seriously i dont even vote in a 
category if im not familiar with the pictures in that category 
and ive never told someone to vote for a film even when ive 
done some of them 
meanwhile other oscar voting rules are perhaps being broken 
speculates veteran academy member millard kaufman although youre 
asked to vote in the nominations for five pictures i think a lot of 
people figure out that they have a better chance if they just vote 
for their own picture and leave the other four blank he said 
given the tremendous impact both an oscar nomination and an oscar 
victory have on a films fortunes its not entirely surprising that 
a certain degree of artifice might surround the oscars 
the last emperor took in 189 million close to half the 
films gross after it won last years best picture trophy more 
than 70 percent of the revenues generated by 1986s best picture 
platoon came after the film was nominated on average a best 
picture award is worth about 20 million these days 
a 500000 oscar promotional campaign mounted by a studio 
therefore can be a good investment in the case of this years 
awards a flurry of academyoriented newspaper advertisements 
banquets complimentary gifts and photo mailings tied to five late 
releases appears to have been remarkably successful 
this year all best picture nominees and the large majority of 
top acting nominees came from movies released in december the 
accidental tourist dangerous liaisons rain man and 
working girl were all released after dec 16 
while these five movies might be good the nearly complete 
exclusion of films from the rest of the year has highlighted the 
studios mastery of oscar marketing 
i think the academy awards are crap said terry gilliam 
director of brazil and the current the adventures of baron 
munchausen 
its about selling films is all its about he said its 
one more way of flogging some films when brazil got nominated in 
1986 they asked me to be a member of the academy and i wouldnt 
join i just dont want to be a part of that at all 
and at least one prominent academy member director carl reiner 
says that the manipulation of oscar voters has reached new depths 
reiner said that universal studios allout effort to bag votes for 
sigourney weaver a best actress nominee for gorillas in the 
mist could lead him to vote against the film 
i have in my house more color reproductions of sigourney weaver 
and a beautiful gorilla than i need reiner said of promotional 
material sent to his home weve got to tell the academy to stop 
this advertising im getting turned off on the pictures i like

retirements tranquility seen by many as a 
reward after the responsibilities of childrearing is coming to a 
jarring end for a growing number whose children want to move back in 
and have aids 
some parents find out for the first time their child is gay and 
at the same time he also has aids this is a real blow said one 
56yearold woman whose son was diagnosed two years ago with aids 
she asked that her name not be used because her son doesnt want his 
identity known parents always think they should die first before 
their children 
and aids can split families she added some members of the 
family accept others reject him that makes it worse for everybody 
and you lose friends some churches even reject you 
in addition said roger lane of the health crisis network in 
miami the 50000 to 120000 costs of care for aids patients put 
an extra burden on the parents particularly if they are elderly and 
have limited finances 
increasingly social workers and aids help network officials say 
aids victims are coming to florida some come from the north because 
warm weather helps protect them from the pneumonia and flu they are 
susceptible to others come from small states for better health care 
and others have parents here 
my parents have been great said a 41yearold aids patient 
who moved from colorado to palm beach county five months ago the 
clinic in palm beach county is really pretty good certainly the 
weather is great 
state officials have no firm data on aids migrants but some 
clinics estimate that 10 percent to 15 percent of aids patients came 
to florida after being diagnosed the number of reported cases 
which officials said would not include some victims diagnosed 
elsewhere has tripled since january 1987 to 6856 putting florida 
third behind new york and california 
we dont turn patients away said jim cobb administrator of 
the state aids clinic in palm beach county but we cant be the 
front doorstep for the country we dont want to resemble the statue 
of liberty 
as education about acquired immune deficiency syndrome has 
improved and when relatives accept that the deadly virus isnt 
contracted by casual contact instances of family rejection are 
decreasing lane said think about being at the terminal stage of 
your life and you have been rejected by the ones you feel close to 
and you feel isolated from your relatives 
the scariest thing for a young person is to be alone said 
mary meeker who through catholic church volunteer activities now 
works with the pasco aids support community and cares for two aids 
victims as a volunteer 
i found that gays are the first ones to turn and run when they 
find out you have aids said a 26yearold hudson man who was 
diagnosed in october and asked not to be identified to protect his 
lover but my family has been very supportive im glad theyre 
there 
in small towns like hudson 30 miles north of tampa on the gulf 
coast news that someone is infected with aids spreads quickly and 
reaction can be quick 
the hernandopasco hospice dedicated to helping terminal 
patients die with loving care at home in october 1987 started a 
pasco support group 
participants have painful memories a son whose parents changed 
the locks a youth whose brotherinlaw told him to hurry up and die 
so he wouldnt burden the family a woman whose boss made her get 
tested after he learned her son had aids then transferred her from 
a cafeteria job despite a negative test result 
the group has grown from four to at least 36 members and spawned 
two other groups in pasco county where 44 percent of the 260000 
residents are over 55 
we have so many elderly people here so many parents in one 
place that were seeing aids patients from other cities coming here 
to die with their parents said peter pavich a support group 
member who has been diagnosed with human immune deficiency virus 
hiv which causes aids 
pavich said the group has helped him understand rejection by his 
family its really unfair its supposed to be their golden 
years and everythings going great and then theyre hit with this 
brick wall and everything changes 
the hospice helped the 26yearold hudson man who feared he 
would die in a hospital in october as pneumonia worsened his weight 
dropped to 95 pounds and doctors refused to release him unless he 
could supply his oxygen medicine and other needs hes now up to 
145 pounds and talks with determined optimism 
i try not to think about it i know eventually its going to 
happen but i live day to day and try to make every day the best 
possible he said 
in this county which is typical of rural counties being 
discovered by developers a relatively small influx of aids victims 
quickly strains services 
there are so many things we need in this area we need food 
medical attention outpatient care dental treatment said eva 
sylvester a hospice services coordinator who recently called seven 
dentists before finding one who would care for an aids patient we 
get frustrated we get angry what we need is more information and 
more education

portugal is trying to win the friendship 
of the former african colonies where it fought bitter wars just 15 
years ago 
prime minister anibal cavaco silvas recent visit to 
guineabissau portugals former west african colony where the fight 
for independence was the fiercest was the latest in a series of 
journeys that included the atlantic island nations of cape verde and 
sao tome e principe and is likely to continue with mozambique in 
southeast africa later this year 
a package of nine accords signed in bissau including an 
agreement to create the framework of an escudo zone is seen as an 
effort to regain influence in africa and improve portugals 
diplomatic standing worldwide the escudo is portugals currency 
a string of leftleaning governments that followed the portuguese 
military coup april 25 1974 never seemed able to get close to the 
thenmarxist revolutionary governments in the five african countries 
where portuguese is still the official language 
the five nations known by the portuguese acronym palops for 
portuguesespeaking african countries are angola cape verde 
guineabissau mozambique and sao tome e principe they embarked on 
a marxistinspired path of development via industrialization and 
centralized economies after gaining independence in the mid1970s 
according to adelino torres lecturer on africa at lisbons 
higher institute for economics it was always a question of 
values with portugals socialist governments 
if african governments werent democratic enough there was 
no deal it was an obstacle to cooperation 
torres said cavaco silva a centerright social democrat cavaco 
silva puts business first 
the reinforcement of our relations with the palops is a 
priority of this government says jose durao barroso secretary of 
state for foreign affairs and cooperation who is regarded as the 
driving force behind portugals african policy 
since the social democrats under cavaco silva won portugals 
first absolute parliamentary majority in july 1987 portugal has 
signed 78 cooperation accords with its former african colonies 
in the beginning these involved agreements on sports education 
farming and health but recent agreements include military accords 
with all palops countries except angola which remains locked in 
civil war 
nevertheless portugal will become the first western nation to 
have a military attache in luanda angolas capital following a 
recent exchange agreement 
the decision to guarantee the convertibility of guineabissaus 
peso currency by linking it to portugals escudo was a major 
qualitative step in cooperation durao barroso said 
sao tome and cape verde are likely to be interested in a similar 
accord mozambiques membership in an escudo zone is expected to be 
discussed before the end of the year 
up to now portugals drive for closer links with the africans 
has concentrated mostly on the three smallest countries 
because cape verde sao tome e principe and guineabissau lack 
the size and potential wealth of angola and mozambique they have 
retained close trading links with portugal 
the view in lisbon is that increased influence in mozambique and 
angola would lend portugal greater political weight in the 
international arena 
foreign minister joao de deus pinheiro has been drumming up 
international support for a projected 600 millioneconomic 
assistance plan for angola once fighting ends between the marxist 
government in luanda and usbacked rebels of unita the national 
union for the total independence of angola 
portugal has pledged 50 million toward the rehabilitation of the 
strategic eastwest benguela railway that before independence 
provided a vital route for exports from nearby zaire and zambia to 
the atlantic 
but competition for influence in angola potentially one of 
subsaharan africas richest nations is growing 
brazil itself a former portuguese territory has already granted 
luanda a 12 billioncredit to be repaid in angolan oil 
italy france spain and other european economic community 
nations are looking to increase trade with angola a country 
portugal regarded as the jewel in its colonial crown 
as the poorest member of the 12nation eec portugal cannot 
compete on economic terms with its european neighbors but durao 
barroso says the portuguese should cash in on a competitive 
advantage of experience and adaptability 
the portuguese have a good understanding of africa and africans 
and we cost less he said its usually cheaper to employ a 
portuguese teacher say than one from a richer country

amid the rock em sock em yocks of saturday 
night viewers will soon have a saner alternative when a kinder kind 
of talkshow host dennis wholey returns to pbs with latenight 
america 
i guess you could say were going to be the saturday 
alternative to wrestling and the church lady wholey said 
referring to the popular character on nbcs saturday night live 
wholeys twohour weekly talk show will feature instudio guests 
newsmakers authors and celebrities responding to telephone 
queries and comments it premieres saturday on about 100 public 
television stations nationwide 
wholey a former detroit radio talkshow host was host of the 
critically praised latenight america on pbs from 1982 until he 
ended the run in 1985 
i made a decision to leave because i wanted to take a look at 
my own background he said in a telephone interview from 
washington where the show will originate i grew up in an 
alcoholic home and as a recovering alcoholic myself i just wanted 
to get out of the public eye 
wholey went through private therapy started some adult children 
of alcoholics groups and wrote books the courage of change 
personal conversations about alcoholism are you happy and 
the most recent becoming your own parent the solution for adult 
children of alcoholics 
after all that he said i felt very good and all of a sudden 
it came time to go back on the air again 
part of the talk show will revolve around selfhelp issues but 
mostly it will be a discussion of an eclectic collection of subjects 
for instance upcoming topics include gun control and the academy 
awards 
viewers who flee the confrontational styles of many current talk 
shows can relax with wholey 
i think that people trust me he said i dont think that 
television is church i make mistakes i probably mispronounce 
words im up there im one of them and i think the audience 
perceives that im part of who they are

in abcs new men four highschool buddies a surgeon a 
lawyer a newspaper columnist and a cop now in their 30s still 
meet weekly over poker to crack wise just like a million guys in 
america 
despite the unlikely premise men set in baltimore and 
filmed in toronto comes darn close to succeeding thanks mainly to 
the fine cast ted wass soap saul rubinek ving rhames and 
tom obrien 
it premieres saturday 
the look of the show directed by peter werner will contribute 
to the already unavoidable comparison to thirtysomething 
men isnt thirtysomething even though it is about 30ish 
folks who spend a lot of time trying to figure out why theyre not 
happy its not nearly as wellwritten 
rubinek the only canadian among the regulars plays paul a 
columnist for the baltimore sun who rhapsodizes about his exwife 
before finding out she plans not to get back with him but to marry 
an investment banker who saves pauls ego by turning out to be bald 
wass is surgeon steven who spends most of his time picking up 
new women then finding something wrong with them and dumping them 
before things get serious rhames is lawyer charlie the black 
member of group and its resident welladjusted family man 
obrien is danny a quicktempered young cop whose older brother 
tom also a cop was a founding member of the group 
in the pilot tom is killed chasing down a pursesnatcher in an 
incongruously violent sequence his death prompts soulsearching 
among the others too often the pilot wanders into sentimentality 
when it isnt being awfully convenient 
steven is the surgeon who operates on tom what are there four 
people in all of baltimore paul works at a newspaper but doesnt 
seem to write anything would jimmy breslin not write about the 
death of a cop who was one of his best friends 
after toms funeral paul goes off to the old highschool 
football field steven shows up there too just by chance the two 
run across the field reliving that touchdown run that won the big 
game 
steven chides that the gamewinner occurred only once once 
was immortal declares paul once gives me bragging rights 
forever 
so its been lifted from innumerable buddy movies its still a 
nice scene 
by the end of the episode danny has won his place in the group 
and were back at the poker table 
men is worth dealing in at least for a few hands

the first of a fivepart public tv series on us 
education is called the education race an unfortunate title 
for an otherwise superb eyeopening program 
learning these days is too often spoken of as a race rather than 
a lifelong habit current fashion has it that american children are 
in some sort of global education contest from birth and they are 
losing this race to the japanese the koreans and just about 
everyone else 
this perception seems more curmudgeonly than constructive if 
were losing economic ground to the japanese its a bit heartless 
to put that failure on the shoulders of kindergartners 
fortunately despite its title the first hour of the pbs series 
learning in america sidesteps that trap the series premiering 
tonight and airing weekly is the product of more than 1000 
interviews in 21 states europe and japan and all that reporting 
shows 
the first part narrated by roger mudd is extraordinary 
television for its depth and sophistication 
the pbs correspondents behind the series paul solman john 
merrow and charlayne huntergault include the right balance of 
experts to paint an incisive and sobering view of american 
classrooms 
david kearns chairman of xerox corp says schools need complete 
restructuring if they are to produce tomorrows workers jonathan 
kozol an authority on illiteracy says the biggest corporate 
gift a company could give a school would be for executives to 
send their children to the local public school not private 
academies 
a generation ago mudd says america asked can johnny read now 
its can johnny think can johnny compute 
he takes us to classrooms in a high school in fremont calif 
and one in yokohama japan in japan students go through exam 
hell to see who goes on to college and career success they spend 
240 days a year in school americans spend 180 
but we learn japanese youngsters rarely feel neglected or 
alienated there is no time and little inclination for sex or drugs 
their parents sacrifice they expect hard work from their children 
but they dont saddle them with household chores or afterschool jobs 
in such a small country parents cant leave a legacy of land to 
their children learning is the birthright and they do indeed learn 
it couldnt be more different in america teens are said to 
display a cool indifference to hard work 
parents see themselves as busy surviving so schools wind up with 
much of the parenting role 
noncollegebound japanese youngsters go to vocational schools 
like many americans but in japan they learn on sophisticated 
hightech equipment and have a full load of academic courses nearly 
all get jobs eventually 
in america vocational students learn to repair cars instead of 
academics they get mickeymouse courses in cooking or how to 
balance checkbooks many wind up in junior college where they learn 
what they should have mastered in high school 
this failure to educate amounts to a hidden tax on us 
industry which winds up spending thousands of dollars educating 
workers in basic skills 
in a particularly informative sequence us youngsters display 
their dismaying ignorance of the skills needed to succeed in the job 
market students think they can always get a factory job no 
matter how little they know the reality is that even entrylevel 
jobs now require computer and thinking skills 
the program reveals that some 350 us companies have set up 
operations in ireland where an eager and educated workforce is more 
than happy to settle into jobs that us youngsters are thumbing 
their noses at 
new york life insurance co sends health claim forms to ireland 
to be processed by workers who are not afraid of work and who have 
the math skills that many us high school graduates lack 
finally the program takes a look at south carolina perhaps the 
closest thing america has to an educational miracle the state 
passed a sweeping education reform package in 1984 that has helped 
raise test scores and lure whites back to public schools 
the program correctly indicates that south carolina is a national 
model for bringing business into partnership with schools it omits 
however the more questionable features of that states reform 
efforts particularly the incredible volume of statemandated tests 
heaped on students 
such nits aside this first hour of learning in america 
augurs well for the remaining four upstairsdownstairs private 
vs public schools teach your children concern about 
curricula wanted a million teachers getting and keeping good 
teachers paying the freight the future and cost of 
education in america

no tax increase why thats like saying the sun 
wont set or the tide wont rise or that your pay stub next year 
wont read any differently than it does right now 
its against nature in this instance human or political no 
matter what the promise was by president bush the president may not 
be reneging but there will indeed be a tax increase this year 
amounting to nearly 147 billion 
anyone checking out a pay stub already is aware of some of that 
increase because an additional 361 billion income tax bill and 
billions more in social security tax increases went into effect 
automatically with the new year 
the riddle has a simple if painful explanation since the big tax 
cut in 1981 congress has enacted 13 separate tax bills the 
additions to the tax load began in the very next year and continued 
right through 1988 
provisions in those bills kick in automatically that is says 
the tax foundation which supplied these numbers taxes grow without 
any new tax action the reason being that increases are already 
here 
the situation has many lessons among them 
when it comes to taxes congress can dictate policy for a 
president who at the time hadnt even announced his candidacy 
congress giveth and congress taketh away it giveth 
dramatically it taketh quickly and when possible quietly 
for example the biggest tax increase of the 1980s the tax 
equity and fiscal responsibility act was passed in 1982 one year 
after the biggest tax cut of the 1980s the economic recovery tax 
act in 1981 
united states tax policy is inconsistent changing every year 
but the biggest most important and most painful lesson is that 
there seems to be no way of avoiding tax increases even when the 
most powerful political figure in the nation gives his promise 
the washingtonbased research foundation whose nonprofit and 
nonpartisan designation confers certain taxexemptions calculates 
that tefra the 1982 tax increase will by itself raise taxes 
557 billion this year 
moving right along the 1984 deficit reduction act defra likely 
will raise another 277 billion more this year than last 16 
billion of it through individual income taxes and the rest from 
corporations 
the revenue act of 1987 enacted in an effort to avoid any 
electionyear tax manipulation managed to do something of that very 
sort last year it yielded 86 billion this year it will cost 
taxpayers about 14 billion 
unlike income tax increases which are broadly based some 
increases scheduled for this year affect only certain groups the 
medicare catastrophic coverage act passed last july 1 will impact 
senior citizens mainly especially those in higherincome brackets 
says the foundation the estimated mcca revenue increase for 
1989 is only 600 million but after 1989 the revenue take will 
average around 7 billion a year just from the elderly 
in other words while the impact of that measure will be felt 
mildly this year it will provoke cries of pain thereafter 
it is the kind of reaction that might make congress consider 
still another version of tax policy

a few feet from the spot where a 
young bob dylan once performed for an indifferent audience lena 
spencer makes her bed 
in the same room where don mclean played while his american 
pie was climbing the charts lenas 14yearold white persian cat 
sasha pads across the wooden floor worn smooth by the tapping feet 
of a generation of folk music fans 
this is caffe lena regarded as the nations oldest continually 
run coffeehouse it is the place where lena spencer has made her 
livelihood for 29 years and her home for the past two 
here one floor above a french bistro a vacant violin shop and 
hatties chicken shack 20 small tables and 80 chairs fill an 
lshaped brickwalled room a small stage microphone stand and an 
upright piano take up most of one corner 
lena has been forced out of her last three apartments by new 
landlords intent on renovations and higher rents i finally said 
what the heck and set up a room in the back 
failing eyesight and heart ailments have slowed her over the 
years and her friends fret over the fact that she lives alone with 
only sasha for company but lena who turned 66 on jan 4 feels an 
attachment to the caffe that most people reserve for old friends 
the caffe is my whole existence the beall and endall of my 
life she said my life began almost in 1960 
caffe lena has seen such folk stars as dylan mclean pete 
seeger david bromberg loudon wainwright iii arlo guthrie and 
ramblin jack elliot sidekick of the late woody guthrie arlos 
father 
veterans of the folk circuit such as u utah phillips tom 
paxton and dave van ronk return year after year drawn by caffe 
lenas informal setting appreciative audiences and lenas own 
indomitable spirit others such as tom rush rick danko tom chapin 
and john phillips play lenas to boost solo careers 
and then there are the young musicians the ones who saw the folk 
venues dwindling but found an audience at lenas the roches aztec 
twostep rory block christine lavin tony bird mississippi 
bluesmen gospel singers jazz players actors playwrights and 
poets have all found an outlet at caffe lena where they dont have 
to compete with televisions or video games and lena has never had a 
liquor license coffee tea and baked goods are served along with 
the music for a cover charge of 5 to 15 
running caffe lena has not been easy lena as she likes to be 
called still takes reservations over the phone herself books all 
acts does her own publicity work and deals with bills and creditors 
though a tight group of friends and supporters distributes her 
posters around town serves as waitresses and cooks on performance 
nights and works the lights and the sound system the tough times 
get more difficult as the years progress 
i get through those periods lena said i just grit my 
teeth and say damn it im going to continue and she puts 
everything she has into the coffeehouse 
keeping caffe lena open has meant many sacrifices including her 
marriage her husband bill left her in the early 60s when he 
wanted to move on and she didnt she doesnt own a car and depends 
on taxis and friends for transportation money is tight a 32 
residual check for a bit part in the movie ironweed seems like a 
windfall 
part of the blame for her situation lies with lena since its 
first day her coffeehouse has primarily served as a place where 
young musicians come to develop their skills 
she insists that young people have a forum a stage on which to 
build an audience says al mckenney a folk music festival 
coordinator its a brave some say foolish policy but a good 
one 
many of the regular performers at lenas are musicians who have 
been coming back for 10 or 20 years or more they eventually become 
part of her family folksinger scott alarik remembers lenas 
apartments always being filled with stray cats and folksingers 
and she always insists on paying people as much as she can 
which for lena means more than she should he said 
caffe lena was once the favorite haunt of students at skidmore 
college a liberal arts school formerly located up the street from 
the coffeehouse the colleges relocation to the outskirts of town 
in the early 70s was followed by a decline in folks popularity 
and caffe lena suffered 
the really good years were the 60s and early 70s lena 
said people would come to the caffe no matter who was performing 
they could trust my judgment 
but the students perhaps inspired by the music of such new folk 
artists as tracy chapman are returning the caffe is attracting 
more and more students who are too young to get into saratogas 
bars and lenas still holds a special place on the folk circuit 
people still want to play lenas said alarik a boston 
musician who first performed at the coffeehouse a decade ago its 
still as good as it gets for folk music for getting right up close 
and friendly i dont think it gets any better than lenas 
van ronk has been playing lenas since the beginning at that 
point i dont think anyone envisioned themselves going on for 29 
years he said 
it was a call from van ronks wife terri thal to lena that got 
dylan a gig in saratoga one of the few coffeehouses he in which he 
performed before going on to concerts but when dylan took the stage 
at caffe lena the audience was more interested in their own 
conversations than the music 
nobody would listen to him van ronk said bill spencer 
climbed up on the stage and balled the audience out he said 
theres something important going on here bobby said it didnt 
work everyone kept on talking he was quite upset 
lena had a backstage pass for dylans concert last summer at 
saratoga performing arts center she said they chatted and dylan 
like he had 28 years before fretted about that nights performance 
if anything shes realistic about her place in his career 
i dont credit myself with discovering any talent lena said 
i credit myself with providing a place to perform early in a 
career 
i guess ive been doing the right thing im still here

now englands second largest city 
birmingham has been around for at least 900 years but this year it 
is celebrating a centennial and a new beginning 
it is marking its recovery from a severe recession and hopes 
people will forget what they thought about it before and take note 
of whats good about it now 
it was in 1889 that queen victoria who had her own misgivings 
about the place granted birmingham its city charter thats the 
reason for the centennial but it is using the occasion to bury a 
recession that wiped out more than 200000 jobs and ravaged its 
traditional metals industry 
the city of 105 million 100 miles northwest of london is 
hoping the yearlong celebration with more than 600 individual 
events also will clear away its image as a cultural wasteland and 
sterile concrete jungle 
birminghambashing is as old as the city itself 
history books tell of victoria drawing the shades of her royal 
carriage to block out its industrial soot gloom and grime when she 
came here on her travels through the english midlands 
in her 1816 novel emma jane austen wrote one has no great 
hopes for birmingham i always say there is something direful in the 
sound 
manufacturing used to be a very dirty industry explained 
andrew fretter city halls principal marketing officer its not 
anymore people havent yet adjusted to that new situation 
birmingham has been a trading center for centuries although the 
domesday book of 1086 rated it one of the poorest in warwickshire 
county 
it prospered during the 16th century as a finishing center and 
marketing outlet for basic metal goods from the surrounding area and 
is acknowledged to have been the birthplace of the industrial 
revolution long before it became a city 
as englands workshop birmingham attracted a rich diversity of 
immigrants primarily from britains farflung empire until the 
recession struck in 1979 it hit hard fretter said vast 
swathes in the city of birmingham were left totally derelict 
the shakeout of the birmingham economy was catastrophic to say 
the least said albert bore chairman of the economic development 
committee of the labor partycontrolled city council 
birminghams recovery was spurred by the councils sponsorship of 
several megaprojects including a modern science park and the 
215million international convention center scheduled to open in 
1991 
it also spent the equivalent of 25 million on a bid to be the 
host of the 1992 summer olympics the bid failed spain won out 
but it signified the new confidence of a city that only two years 
ago came dead last in a survey of the quality of life in 38 british 
cities 
besides its traditional prides and joys more canals than venice 
in italy europes largest public library a rating as having the 
best tap water of any big city in the world even if it is piped 
from wales birmingham is scheduling 25 billion for development 
manufacturing production has outstripped the previous record set 
in 1979 80 percent of manufacturers are working at more than 90 
percent capacity and unemployment has fallen to 75 percent from 
1982s peak of 168 percent 
herbert austin set up his automobile works in the citys 
longbridge district in 1905 and pioneered the popular austin 7 
today birmingham holds britains only streetcircuit car race the 
annual super prix and the auto industry is once again the citys 
largest employer home to the rover groups modern robotic car plant 
and the austin morris division of the british leyland motor corp 
business travel to the city streamlined by a modern 
international airport has helped create 73000 jobs and has made 
birmingham the fifth most visited city in england visitors spent 
the equivalent of 635 million here in 1987 
brummies as birminghams residents are known concede they 
now must pay attention to how their city looks as well as how it 
works 
in the 1960s most of the citys victorian heart was torn out and 
replaced by featureless concrete and mirror glass buildings 
surrounded some say strangled by a beltway 
its architectural style is still symbolized by two of its best 
known landmarks the bull ring a covered shopping complex soon to 
be replaced by a 688million continental style arcade and 
spaghetti junction a vast crisscrossing of roads cloverleafs and 
overpasses 
the planners ripped the city apart in the 50s and 60s bore 
said the drive to clear the slums and to provide for the age of 
the motor car lacked the sensitivity the planning community now 
has 
the city has an eclectic mixture of performing arts ub40 the 
acclaimed multiracial rock group comes from birmingham spitting 
images the wickedly satirical puppet show is produced here and 
simon rattle the wunderkind of british conductors has led the 
birmingham symphony orchestra since he was 25 years old 
in a recent coup the city council lured the sadlers wells royal 
ballet from london with a 103million financing offer the 
traveling section of the royal ballet will move into the 1950seat 
hippodrome in august 1990

nahid samir went to college and earned an 
engineering degree today shes a housekeepernanny 
mohamed studied business administration at cairo university he 
drives a taxi 
theyre lucky they have jobs 
other college graduates roughly a million by one official 
estimate cant find any work at all a situation that is 
potentially explosive 
egyptian universities turn out 100000 graduates a year many 
find their dreams brutally shattered by a twin headaches in this 
overpopulated country of 54 million unemployment and 
underemployment 
official estimates put egypts jobless rate at around 10 percent 
but another 10 percent are in jobs supplied to graduates under a 
30yearold government policy that pays almost nothing in wages but 
requires little more of the jobholder than signing a work register 
it is a high percentage without doubt said mokhtar 
abdelhamid of the governing national democratic party head of the 
labor committee in the peoples assembly the national parliament 
we are a developing nation and need the efforts of every person 
this high percentage can affect development 
for the first time president hosni mubaraks government is 
ringing the alarm bell and testing a variety of remedies 
we do not need more people mubarak said in a recent speech 
what we need is better planning and development of the educational 
system and connecting it to the needs of development 
we hope the government will be able to open new fields for 
graduates so we can destroy this unemployment phenomenon 
proposed solutions include smallbusiness loans for graduates or 
selling them cheap desert land for agricultural reclamation opening 
retraining centers also has been suggested in hopes of turning 
unemployed graduates into skilled tradesmen who are much in demand 
the employment problem is the result of several factors very 
important is the mushrooming population increasing by a million 
every nine months also the world oil glut that hit the economies 
of the persian gulf countries brought home to egypts labor pool 
hundreds of thousands of egyptians whose jobs abroad had disappeared 
part of the problem lies with two policies left over from gamal 
abdel nassers socialist egypt of the 1950s and 1960s free higher 
education which has created a surplus of university graduates and a 
shortage of skilled laborers and the promise of a job to any 
graduate who cant find one in private business 
by january 1989 the government was looking to find jobs for 
people who graduated in june 1983 
egypts economy is stagnant encumbered by a 44billion foreign 
debt and high inflation 
the peoples assembly has been discussing unemployment and 
mubarak himself is meeting with senior politicians in search of a 
solution 
lots of things combined and led to this unemployment problem 
the assemblys abdelhamid said he enumerated the main ones as 
population growth the large number of graduates the lack of money 
for building new factories to create jobs and the return of the 
workers from the persian gulf oil fields 
there has to be a study to know what the egyptian market needs 
and then we should set education policies accordingly 
abdelhamid said there also has to be more work on institutes or 
junior colleges to teach certain skills that are needed like 
carpentry and plumbing 
the engineers union says 20000 new engineers are looking for 
jobs fewer new doctors than that are out of work but a physicians 
starting salary in a government hospital is 60 pounds 25 a month 
and with the present rate of population growth 6 million new 
jobseekers will enter the market in the next decade

american education is laid bare in a landmark 
television series virtually certain to leave viewers unsettled and 
embarrassed 
learning in america starting monday night on pbs is a 
fivepart multimillion dollar look at whats happening in the 
nations classrooms featuring roger mudd and three correspondents 
from the macneillehrer newshour 
the portrait is always revealing sometimes chilling 
i dont want to graduate to tell you the truth its just fun 
i like it says a california high school senior interested mainly 
in sports 
i think its my senior year and im going to relax says his 
friend explaining why hes taking nutrition and lifestyle courses 
instead of the math he needs to become a computer repairman 
and from denver high school teacher martha nagel this is a job 
that breaks your heart every day 
the makers of learning in america roved from california to 
east harlem from ireland to japan to paint a broad television 
canvas unusual in the farflung locally controlled education field 
the reason education doesnt get covered well on tv is that 
its so decentralized finding out about whats going on is very 
timeconsuming said joe quinlan executive producer of the series 
chrysler corp put up nearly 4 million for the series equally 
divided between production and promotion and had nothing to do with 
content a number of other companies were also interested in 
financing the project quinlan said 
thats one indicator of the anxiety levels of american 
business he said american business is in shock right now 
about the state of the education system 
a shocker in the first section of the series is the revelation 
that new york life of freehold nj is shipping thousands of 
medical claims to a rural irish town to be processed a personnel 
officer of the company said she cant find enough competent 
motivated high school graduates close to home to fill her workforce 
mudd who taught for a year at a private boys school before going 
into journalism said in an interview that the two students drifting 
through high school are probably generally typical of that big 
group of kids between the gifted and the slow the top and the 
bottom get all the attention its the middle group thats 
worrisome 
mudd noted the boys plans to attend a free openadmissions 
junior college and remarked in one year theyll try to learn the 
stuff they didnt learn because theyd been playing for four years 
and of course the taxpayers will have to foot that bill 
in fairness to the boys the series notes that us schools dont 
have clear goals and expectations for middlerange students this is 
contrasted with japan where all students are expected to be 
serious disciplined and solidly prepared for their futures 
another key point is that japanese parents are totally involved 
in their childrens education while us parents are more likely to 
be locked in a consuming struggle for economic survival 
the main thing i noticed in making the series was how fast 
the american family has changed and how far we all are behind in 
responding to that not just the schools but the whole society 
quinlan said he cited women in the workplace divorce rates and 
singleparent families latchkey kids and students working 30 hours 
a week after school it really hit home were not in kansas 
anymore toto quinlan said 
the most disturbing parts of the series examine inequities in 
american schools and problems in the teaching profession nagel is 
shown trying to call her gynecologist from a public phone a 23year 
veteran doesnt have his own classroom an incompetent teacher is 
fired and then hired within hours by another principal who never 
bothered to call for a reference 
mudd said he came away from the series agitated but not 
depressed because enough places are in fact doing something and 
doing it well but correspondent john merrow a former teacher who 
holds a harvard phd in education said the successful formulas at 
such schools most often are ignored elsewhere 
all these terrific things that happen they are not copied 
merrow said in an interview there are some very hopeful signs 
the question is is progress being made at a fast enough rate to 
keep us from going into the dumpster

maybe its the immaculate rows of 
discounted shampoo and paper towels or the doorside handpumping 
people greeters who make visitors feel like theyve entered a 
sprawling momandpop corner store 
if the 97000square foot waxahachie walmart is any indication 
of the discount chains operations in 26 states its not hard to 
see why walmart stores inc has staked a claim as the countrys 
dominant retailer pleasing customers and sending nervous ripples 
into the boardrooms of competitors 
as for walmart becoming a household word we never think about 
things like that david glass president and chief operating 
officer said in a telephone interview from company headquarters in 
bentonville ark what we want is for customers in our territories 
to think of us fondly 
local shopkeepers as well as giants like sears roebuck and co 
are watching walmarts spurt like weeds and wondering whether some 
of their business could be choked by a rival that religiously 
pursues its corporate strategy with the fervor of a rural evangelist 
walmart took root when sam walton and his brother bud founded 
the first walmart discount city in rogers ark in 1962 
under sam walton the company expanded in the 1970s and 1980s 
making his family worth billions and vaulting walmart to the 
thirdbiggest us retailer behind no1 sears and secondranked k 
mart corp 
at 70 sam walton remains involved he has retained the title of 
chairman although the companys daytoday operations are handled by 
glass 53 
a visitor to a walmart immediately senses workers are aiming to 
foster a friendly image as though trying to preserve the charm 
historically associated with the neighborhood shops that many retail 
chains now threaten 
when customers step inside an official greeter sometimes in the 
form of a handclasping retiree ushers them in offering advice or 
just a howdoyoudo 
regular walmart stores attempt to provide onestop shopping for 
consumers stocking basic neccesities ranging from shoes and clothes 
to televisions and outdoor grills 
three walmart supercenters and three hypermarts marketing 
experiments that are attracting hordes of customers offer a wider 
array of merchandise such as full grocery lines 
within the walmart in waxahachie a community about 25 miles 
south of dallas everything appears tidy with merchandise in its 
proper place typical of walmarts elsewhere 
workers known as associates in the corporate patois patrol 
the floor retrieving hangers unwanted items and the clutter that 
bargainhunters sometimes leave behind 
one of waxahachies assistant managers millie wall says 
walmart encourages associates to be helpful it might be beyond 
what other discount stores do but i dont think its beyond 
walmart she says 
what really draws customers though is price 
you can find the same stuff at walmart that you can find at 
other stores but cheaper says walmart regular cheryl starks 
while lunching with three of her four children at a mcdonalds near 
the walmart in the east texas town of gilmer the clothes we have 
on came from walmart the shoes we have on came from walmart 
in the walmart she frequents a 16 ounce bottle of suave balsam 
and protein shampoo was selling for 108 while the supermarket a 
few doors away in the same mall offered the same for 169 four 
rolls of charmin toilet tissue went for 96 cents in walmart vs 
145 at the supermarket bounty designer kitchen towels were 78 
cents in walmart and 107 in the store nearby 
walmarts flagwaving patriotism also seems to have struck a 
responsive chord in the small towns and cities in the heartland 
where the chain has multiplied anecdotal evidence suggests the 
company has won customers through publicity programs such as its 
buy american pitch 
if theres one big criticism its that local merchants 
especially small shops that cant buy in the volume that allows 
walmart to keep prices low get blown away when walmarts move in 
kenneth e stone an economics professor at iowa state 
university looked into the impact of walmarts after chambers of 
commerce and business people expressed concern about the 
consequences of new walmarts in their areas 
stones conclusions were mixed retail trade will expand 
boosting business for some local merchants but causing others to 
lose sales he found 
the bottom line stones study shows is that a strategy should 
be developed for existing merchants so that they may better 
coexist in a walmart environment 
glass concedes walmarts can make big economic waves he says 
some businesses may flee from their competitive might but overall 
the chain tends to benefit areas by drawing customers to many stores 
in the aggregate i would argue that we have a good impact on a 
community by making it a trade center a place where people come to 
shop he says 
wall streeters praise walmart especially the chains 
application of computer technology to most routine retailing tasks 
including inventory control 
the past decade is the best evidence of walmarts phenomenal 
growth as of jan 31 the company ran 1259 walmart stores 105 
sams wholesale clubs outlets for shoppers buying in bulk and 
about two dozen other retail operations at the start of 1979 
walmart ran 276 stores 
this year the company plans to open 155 walmarts and 20 
wholesale clubs the opening of new stores has helped maintain 
momentum in sales growth which was 29 percent in 1988 when sales 
rose to 2065 billion from 1596 billion 
earnings last year totaled 837 million or 148 a share vs 
628 million or 111 a share a year earlier 
the companys ambitious plans have expanded to the concept of 
supercenters and hypermarts which are huge megamerchandizing 
emporia with everything from groceries to computer software under 
one roof 
judging from walmarts stock market performance the company has 
faithful followers one analyst estimates the price of a walmart 
share will rise to 49 this year from about 32 recently 
on the cost side the corporation is known for dealing shrewdly 
with suppliers for the best possible price its operating expenses 
as a proportion of sales are the lowest industrywide 
in a recent report on the company walter f loeb of morgan 
stanley amp co had nothing bad to say 
the customer is key to the success of walmart management is 
insisting that every customer be treated as a guest in walmart 
stores loeb wrote 
this unique attitude is producing a strong response from 
consumers since service with a smile is often a forgotten commodity 
in retailing

in the walmart parking lot a car radio 
plays a country ballad about a relaxed porch swing state of 
mind outside the stores entrance a vendor sells corn dogs and 
cold soda 
nearby a woman gently coaxes her young daughter into getting off 
the small merrygoround two rides are enough she says mommys 
got to go shopping now 
reluctantly the little girl dismounts and tags along into the 
store her pout gives way to a grin as a smiling woman greets the 
child with a hi honey while fixing a happyface sticker on her 
hand 
anyone entering the walmart in this east texas town and 
walmarts elsewhere encounters such a person the people greeters 
welcome shoppers give advice on where to find things and mark 
merchandise carried in for returns or exchanges 
on the way out of some walmarts exit greeters thank people for 
coming while keeping an eye out for receipts to make sure people 
arent shoplifting 
the peoplegreeting practice is one of many ingredients in 
walmart stores incs highly successful retailing recipe 
staffing entrances and exits is not unheard of at other 
retailers particularly at discounters that have heavy traffic what 
sets walmarts appart is the way they handle the task 
customers in some highvolume stores feel bullied by employees 
demanding that they reveal the contents of parcels for instance 
not in walmarts 
walmart associates the term the company has substituted for 
employees give the impression that the security element of 
peoplegreeting is secondary to acting like a friendly host or 
hostess they appear to genuinely enjoy passing the time with 
patrons 
i get to see everybody who comes to walmart and everybody in 
upshur county comes to walmart sooner or later says peggy smith 
while on duty at the entrance of the gilmer walmart 
smith a 39yearold gilmer resident who won an award for being 
the most courteous employee in the county in february speaks 
proudly about working at walmart 
shes grateful to have the job other people living in the area 
of gilmer a town of an estimated 6500 people about 120 miles east 
of dallas and the upshur county seat are less fortunate due to deep 
staff cuts at a local steel mill and the prolonged slump in the 
states oil industry 
walmart store managers say not all associates are suited for 
peoplegreeting duty besides friendliness and maturity useful 
personality traits are patience and perhaps a touch of 
inquisitiveness some say 
retirees supplementing their fixed incomes are frequently found 
doing stints on walmarts hospitality patrol 
one of them 68yearold jack butler says being a people greeter 
at the walmart in duncanville texas fits his needs fine after 
20 years working in the warehouse of a tractor company he enjoys 
less physicallydemanding work 
deploying someone at walmart doors originated with one of the 
hourly associates sam walton company founder and chairman liked 
the suggestion and it became a companywide practice

the store manager of the walmart in this 
community on the outskirts of dallas tells a story that gives an 
insight into the man considered responsible for a retailing 
phenomenon 
manager don bost remembers one day last summer when a secretary 
telephoned from walmart stores incs corporate headquarters in 
bentonville ark chairman sam walton was about to land at a nearby 
airport and the secretary asked if someone could fetch him and bring 
him to the de soto store 
paying unexpected calls on stores is one way walton has kept in 
close touch with everyday goingson his example is followed by 
other walmart executives and most make a point of spending a lot of 
time in the field 
says ed nagy district manager for 9 stores in the dallas 
metropolitan area its not like uhoh someones coming 
because theyre always out 
by all accounts sam waltons personality permeates operations 
throughout the company 
everyone from walmart president and chief operating officer 
david glass down to an hourly store worker can readily quote the 
gospel according to sam as he is called 
to paraphrase sams primary rules of retailing rule no1 is 
the customer is always right rule no2 says just in case the 
customers wrong revert to rule no1 
if the principles sound oldfashioned and homespun they are 
because thats the way sam is people who know him say 
he shuns the limelight that his companys success has shed on him 
and has decided to refuse almost all press requests for interviews 
hes happy to chat with folks in his stores though 
he also regularly reminds walmart associates that 
hospitality to customers is crucial he preaches it in person or via 
hightech satellite hookup with his stores 
walmart employees became known as associates under a company 
effort to prove it cared about employees partly to thwart a union 
organizing effort in the late 1960s 
one of the most sensitive subjects for walton is the fortune hes 
amassed 
a close associate says sam would probably give anything not 
to be named on fortune magazines list of the countrys wealthiest 
people the magazine has estimated that his immediate familys stake 
in walmart stock is worth about 68 billion 
sam walton is more interested in his backhand than he is in his 
bank account says don shinkle walmart spokesman 
samuel moore walton turns 71 on march 29 he was born in 
kingfisher okla and grew up as the son of a farmmortgage banker 
he graduated from the university of missouri with an economics 
degree in 1940 and joined jc penney co as a management trainee in 
des moines iowa after serving three years in the army he went to 
arkansas and opened a ben franklin fiveanddime store eventually 
becoming the companys biggest franchisee 
the seeds of the walmart empire were sown when sam and his 
brother james l or bud opened the first walmart discount city in 
1962 the rest will probably earn an entry in the history of us 
retail trade 
bud is a senior vice president and board member of walmart 
three of the four grown children sam and his wife helen had are 
involved with the company in various capacities 
sam hasnt slowed much enjoying hunting and tennis as much as 
ever and is said not to suffer after effects from a bout with 
leukemia now in remission he spends less time in the office since 
handing over most responsiblities to david glass sam is still 
chairman of the board 
glass doesnt hesitate when asked if walmart can flourish 
without sam the answer is an emphatic yes because he says we 
have great people the walton family will always be involved he 
adds 
commenting on the future glass says well be judged on what 
we produce today tomorrow what weve done in the past wont 
matter

in 1848 richard wagner had just completed the 
scoring for lohengrin when the idea for a work on the nibelung 
dwarfs who owned a magic ring and a horde of gold began to 
crystallize 
twentyeight years later he put the final touches on the score 
of der ring des nibelungen the ring of the nibelungen it 
was a staggering accomplishment at the time and remains so today 
two major companies are about to meet the most difficult 
challenge in the world of opera producing wagners ring 17 hours 
of music originally intended by wagner to be performed over four 
days 
the metropolitan opera will perform the entire epic about love 
and greed and gods and goddesses three times in the next few weeks 
the first time it has presented it in so short a span in 90 years 
the berlin opera is bringing its version to washingtons kennedy 
center in june 
wagner deliberately made his ring inaccessible to most theaters 
of the day and he created an opera house in bayreuth germany in 
1876 to show the work 
i no longer gave a thought to the dresden or any other court 
theater in the world my sole preoccupation was to produce something 
that should free me once and for all from this irrational 
subservience the composer wrote in his autobiography 
few opera companies perform the four works das rheingold 
die walkure siegfried and gotterdammerung in four 
days usually the operas are seen singularly or if produced as a 
ring cycle are stretched out over weeks or months 
clearly wagner knew what he was doing said speight jenkins 
general director of the seattle opera for the sake of the power 
of it it needs to go the way it was meant to go 
seattle started an annual ring cycle in 1975 it isnt performing 
it this year because of the other two productions 
both productions are selling out as wagner buffs from around the 
world scramble to attend one or both at the met tickets for all 
four operas range from 60 to 620 tickets at the kennedy center 
range from 120 to 380 the first cycle in washington is june 2 
the first met cycle starts april 1 all will be broadcast live on 
radio 
the mets new production is the most traditional in the world 
the rocky mountain top where brunnhilde surrounded by a circle of 
fire is put into a deep sleep by her father wotan resembles a 
craggy peak but the production departs from the very earliest 
traditional stagings by eliminating her horse and not having the 
valkyries actually fly 
berlins ring new in 1985 is set in a futuristic tunnel 
designed by peter sykora it was staged by gotz friedrich costumes 
are contemporary with punk underpinnings in das rheingold for 
example alberich is clothed in a diving suit with air hoses and 
brunnhilde wears black leather and leather boots in the later operas 
its very modern it is hot especially with the lighting of 
the stage but it looks quite snazzy said dame gwyneth jones who 
sang brunnhilde for berlin in japan last fall 
it shows the personal psychological relationships between the 
persons in the ring it is a human ring its not political at 
all said jesus lopezcobos general director of the berlin opera 
the idea is that every end is a new beginning at the beginning 
of the ring you see a vision from the very end and at the very end 
you see once more the first picture of rheingold it is life 
going over and over 
at bayreuth in 1976 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the 
opera house wagner built pierre boulez conducted and patrice 
chereau staged the first ring ever taped for television the chereau 
ring is a comment on corruption brought by industrialization 
instead of three mermaids swimming around rheingold starts with 
three prostitutes near a hydroelectric dam 
in the seattle production wotan is a stage director whose actors 
get out of hand its the only untraditional cycle in america 
seattles jenkins said we try to be as mythic as possible i 
think we follow very faithfully the words of the text and pay no 
attention to the stage instructions of wagner the san francisco 
opera is the only other american company performing a ring 
in 1985 when it was new seattles unconventional ring caused 
fistfights at cocktail parties by 1987 it was accepted and sold 
out 
jenkins likes innovative approaches to staging the ring so 
does lopezcobos whos conducting the first cycle in washington 
sometimes they go too far lopezcobos said i prefer to 
take the risk you are sometimes inspired by new and interesting 
concepts on the stage 
dame gwyneth will sing brunnhilde in the mets third cycle next 
fall shell sing in a ring at the san francisco opera and in a new 
die walkure at covent garden the welsh soprano has sung in a 
lot of rings including the televised bayreuth cycle 
one problem with the ring in the latter half of this century has 
been that hitler liked it and considered it a glorification of a 
master race throughout its history its story has been the subject 
of differing and often bizarre interpretations the music though 
is another matter 
in 1969 milton cross the late commentator on the mets saturday 
afternoon radio broadcasts wrote that the musics greatness and 
majesty present the conflicts tenderness grandeur heroism 
passion and a tragedy that stirs us to the depths of our beings 
wagners grandson wieland wagner made a fresh start at bayreuth 
in 1951 the first postwar ring with an almost barren stage he 
stressed symbolism thereby triggering the interpretive productions 
which have followed 
both the mets and berlins current rings replaced productions 
based on wieland wagners at the met in 1975 the stage showed a 
ring shape a giant tilted flat doughnut with singers in 
costumes resembling dark choir robes the lighting mainly dark 
blue set the psychological moods 
the shortest amount of time in which one could attend all four 
operas in that 1975 met ring production was six weeks 
the met chose a traditional ring said artistic administrator 
jonathan friend because its audience prefers it if you make a 
mistake with the ring it is a very expensive mistake the more 
stylized a production is the more difficult to get a larger 
proportion of our public to accept it 
in some of the stylized productions the text and music are at 
a complete opposite to what youre seeing on stage some would 
rather see something unusual here we would rather go the other 
way 
james levine who conducts the mets ring chose otto schenk to 
create the production and suggested gunther schneidersiemssen as 
set designer 
we knew schenk would do something that was naturalistic 
romantic and warm without any particularly strong external idea 
pushed onto the opera friend said 
new york cast members include toni kraemer and william johns as 
siegfried jessye norman as sieglinde gary lakes as siegmund 
christa ludwig as fricka and waltraute and matti salminen as hagen 
the two brunnhildes in washington will be ute vinzing and anne 
evans rene kollo will sing siegfried and peter hofmann will sing 
siegmund wotan will be robert hale and simon estes singing a cycle 
each

it was intramural politics an election settled 
by a bare majority of a chronic minority 
but the leadership choice house republicans made last wednesday 
may change the way both parties do business in congress and could 
put a crimp in president bushs newlook bipartisanship 
the house gop judgment seems to be that if they cant make laws 
at least they can make noise 
rep newt gingrich of georgia newly elected as the assistant 
republican leader of the house clearly intends to do just that 
gingrich loudly conservative said he will build a more aggressive 
activist party 
that is not the traditional task of the party whip a job title 
that traces to parliament and was around before congress was the 
whips task is to line up votes count heads try to make sure his 
partys supporters are on hand when the roll is called 
the best of them deal in the favors and compromises that oil any 
legislative machinery its a doubly difficult assignment when 
undertaken for the programs of a republican administration in an 
overwhelmingly democratic house 
but compromise is not gingrichs style and he says the party 
wanted a new job description when he was chosen whip 87 to 85 over 
rep edward madigan of illinois he also says that his primary 
assignment is to work for house republicans not necessarily for 
president bush 
indeed rep robert michel of illinois the minority leader said 
after gingrich was chosen that he may have to take on some of the 
votecounting and other duties that normally go to the whip 
michels new deputy has no practice in those assignments 
gingrich and his conservative allies argue that the way toward a 
republican resurgence in the house is confrontation not compromise 
they say that house gop leaders have been too tractable and too 
anxious to get along with the democratic majority 
by now it seems a permanent majority especially to frustrated 
political warriors like gingrich republicans havent controlled the 
house in 34 years going on 35 the house lineup now 258 
democrats 174 republicans with three seats vacant is determined 
in 435 separate elections every other year national issues trends 
and tickets affect those contests state and regional issues 
personalities and above all incumbency affect them too 
the gingrich game plan is based on the theory that the national 
side of that political equation can become the base for a republican 
revival thats in tune with the aggressive outlook of new leaders 
at the republican national committee and the partys congressional 
campaign committee 
it carries risks controlling congress democrats also control 
many of the perks projects and federal favors that members of 
congress seek for their districts and their constituents those are 
vital ingredients in the local side of a campaign for congress they 
can be punishing weapons a house member needs to be able to 
deliver for the voters back home 
former speaker of the house thomas p oneill jr an old 
gingrich foe always counseled that all politics is local gingrich 
and company are on the opposite track contending that the house can 
be won back on the strength of national republican issues 
the proof if there is any will be a long time coming with an 
84seat democratic margin which actually widened by three seats 
while republicans were winning the presidency in 1988 the white 
house party usually loses house seats in offyear elections like 
those coming in 1990 
time and again during their minority decades house republicans 
have looked to new leaders to change their lot rep charles a 
halleck of indiana ousted rep joseph w martin jr as minority 
leader in 1959 saying he offered new vigorous leadership six 
years later in another uprising rep gerald r ford of michigan 
was elected leader saying the party wanted new leadership a new 
image and positive programs to counter the democrats when michel 
was promoted from whip to leader in 1980 he said were going to 
take the offensive 
now gingrich says hell do all that and more from the no 2 job 
although he obviously has his eye on the leadership

loan crisis congressional auditors said 
the general accounting office told the house judiciary 
committees criminal justice subcommittee wednesday it had examined 
26 insolvent thrift insitutions in eight states and found evidence 
of fraud or abusive insider dealing in each 
while the survey was skewed to sampls with the worst problems the 
26 represented 60 percent of total losses sustained by the 
governments insurance fund from 1985 through 1987 the pattern of 
fraud and abuse among all failed thrifts clearly is pervasive

when the producer price index showed a big 
increase the other day it was as if a million americans had shouted 
fire 
among those millions were investors whose nervous systems had 
been imprinted by years of inflation fears believing inflation is 
ruinous for stocks they nearly proved the thesis knocking the 
averages for a loop 
economists many of whom had been waiting at least two years for 
the inflation event having prematurely forecast its onset took 
bows and sent overnight letters to their clients saying i told 
you so 
the media joined in the excitement dutifully finding experts 
who could identify the causes of the inflation problem and explain 
what damage might be expected that is a recession rising 
unemployment and the like 
then the consumer price index was released 
the numbers in this report were much lower or as some headlines 
stated more modest than the bawdy producer prices the 
president said he was encouraged an economist declared the 
inflation numbers had returned to sanity 
the departure from sanity was of course not in the brainless 
numbers but in the interpretation by humans and what that 
interpretation showed is that when you expect inflation almost any 
sign is an inflation sign 
americans have been under great stress for at least two years 
now reminded almost daily that an expansion that lasts 77 months 
as this one has is destined to be consumed at almost any time by 
the fires of inflation 
the explanations 
you cannot work your production facilities at the very high rate 
of 85 percent of capacity without adding to prices because 
increasingly you are bringing onto line the least efficient plants 
and equipment 
and you cannot drop the jobless rate to near 5 percent without 
dipping into a labor pool of inexperienced and inefficient and 
therefore costly and unproductive workers moreover with labor in 
short supply wages must rise 
is that so it might be it might not 
so many inflationrecession theories have been expounded that one 
has to question them all most of them can be logically presented 
many of them have merit but a good many of them also leave 
something unexplained 
if the most popular explanation is correct the one that says 
inflation is growing because of stress on job markets and plant 
capacity how do you explain the japanese experience 
japans unemployment rate is about half the american rate which 
is somewhere just above 5 percent a year and japans capacity 
utilization rate is only a couple of percentage points below the 
us rate 
in addition its money supply growth rate often has exceeded the 
us money growth rate the high level of which also has been named 
as a factor in inflation and its budget deficit has sometimes been 
worse than americas 
those four factors high plant utilization low jobless rate 
fast money supply growth and big budget deficits are probably the 
four most popular explanations for present and future inflation 
many of the economists who use these factors to explain us 
inflation and who forecast a recession for americans this year 
have little to say of the japanese anomaly it is it seems another 
impenetrable oriental mystery 
it is true that the japanese have a high savings rate and that 
those savings help finance larger and more efficient production and 
that the japanese are hard workers but there is more to it than 
that 
the explanation could be the most beneficial japanese import of 
all better than cars cameras tvs vcrs and computers

the government said it will try gaf corp and a 
top executive for a third time on stock fraud charges despite a 
mistrial that defense lawyers called a major setback in the pursuit 
of wall street corruption 
we still have a great deal of faith in our evidence in this 
case us attorney benito romano said wednesday after a federal 
judge declared her second mistrial its appropriate to try the 
case again 
the gaf case was the first criminal trial stemming from the 
insider trading scandals of the mid1980s and considered a critical 
test of information supplied by jailed stock speculator ivan f 
boesky 
after 12 days and more than 90 hours of deliberations the jury 
of nine women and three men in federal court in manhattan said they 
were hopelessly deadlocked in a threeway split and us district 
judge mary johnson lowe declared the mistrial 
on jan 10 lowe declared a mistrial after determining prosecutors 
unintentionally withheld an experts report that a key piece of 
evidence had been altered 
gaf two subsidiaries and vice chairman james t sherwin were 
indicted last july for allegedly trying to boost union carbide 
corps stock price in 1986 shortly before selling a large block of 
carbide shares they also were charged with securities fraud wire 
fraud and conspiracy 
gaf is a wayne njbased chemical and building materials 
manufacturer with operations worldwide its chairman samuel j 
heyman was named by prosecutors as an unindicted coconspirator in 
the case 
sherwin 55 of princeton nj hugged his wife as the mistrial 
was announced sweating profusely he told reporters outside the 
courtroom my family and i are all just completely exhausted 
the government had made gaf its leadoff case in a series of 
trials scheduled for this year that hinge on the confessions and 
testimony of wall street figures who already have admitted 
securities law violations 
defense lawyers said they would fight any move by the government 
to retry the case 
if a jury cannot agree despite 12 days of patient deliberations 
i believe its a waste of resources to continue to try this case 
lead gaf attorney arthur t liman said 
wall street securities fraud lawyer stanley arkin said the 
mistrial indicated the government was failing in its attempt to 
bring criminal charges in what should be civil cases 
i dont think this case demonstrated any harm he said it 
never seemed to me like a criminal case and i dont think it is 
romano denied that the mistrial marked a defeat for the manhattan 
us attorneys office which has brought charges in more than 50 
securities fraud cases since 1983 
all prior criminal frauds including pending charges against the 
investment firm drexel burnham lambert inc were settled through 
plea bargains drexel agreed in december to settle securities fraud 
charges unrelated to the gaf case by pleading guilty to six felonies 
and paying a record 650 million 
in a separate development the government on wednesday obtained 
its first conviction in a drexelrelated case as a jury convicted 
former drexel assistant trader lisa jones of perjury and obstruction 
of justice 
the governments case against gaf was based largely on the 
testimony of los angeles broker boyd l jefferies an admitted felon 
expected to play a key role in other securities fraud cases as part 
of a plea arrangement with the government 
the purpose of the alleged stock manipulation was to maximize 
gafs profits from the planned sale of a large block of union 
carbide stock after a failed takeover of the much larger chemical 
concern earlier in 1986 
defense lawyers branded jefferies a crook who had schemed 
illegally with boesky who paid 100 million to settle insider 
trading charges in late 1986 boesky fingered jefferies 58 who 
last year agreed to plead guilty to two securities law violations 
jefferies testimony is seen as crucial to separate 
boeskyderived cases against speculator salim b lewis and takeover 
specialist paul bilzerian 
on the ninth day of deliberations the jury reported an 111 
split but resumed discussions after the judge asked them to 
reconsider their positions in the interests of reaching a verdict 
it was not known whether the lone juror was for acquittal or 
conviction but some jurors clearly changed their minds leading to 
the threeway deadlock 
gaf and the two subsidiaries faced maximum fines totaling 12 
million or 500000 on each of eight counts against each of the 
three sherwin faced 40 years in prison and a fine of up to 2 
million

the perjury conviction of a young assistant bond 
trader at drexel burnham lambert inc will help the governments 
ongoing investigation of the powerful wall street investment firm 
prosecutors said 
a federal jury found lisa jones 26 guilty of perjury and 
obstruction of justice wednesday in a case with links to the 
governments most prominent target multimillionaire drexel bond 
financier michael milken 
jones a onetime runaway who climbed to a 100000ayear job at 
the giant brokerage firm faces a total of 35 years in jail and a 
maximum fine of 175 million sentencing was set for may 22 
it was the first trial of a drexel employee after more than two 
years of investigations 
defense lawyers alleged that the government overzealously 
prosecuted jones who was charged with lying to a federal grand jury 
about alleged shady stock deals involving drexel and 
princetonnewport lp a nowdefunct new jersey securities firm whose 
partners face racketeering charges 
jones who made 117000 last year and still is on drexels 
payroll worked for former drexel trader bruce lee newberg one of 
the princetonnewport defendants who in turn reported directly to 
milken milken has been informed by the government to expect to be 
indicted on fraud and racketeering charges 
us attorney benito romano said the jones conviction which did 
not involved securities law violations would nonetheless help 
future cases i think perjury convictions help all law enforcement 
investigations he said 
i think this case is a tragedy because this defendant didnt 
or couldnt understand what was required of her and could have 
avoided this but didnt romano added 
defense lawyer brian oneill said he would appeal the verdict he 
equated jones to a little person run down by a truck 
during the trial jones broke down repeatedly on the stand as she 
was grilled about her life and the grand jury testimony on her work 
as an assistant trader at drexels beverly hills calif 
highyield junk bond department her job included placing orders and 
writing up trading tickets 
to help prove their case prosecutors showed jones lied about her 
age marital status birthplace and education 
jones told a federal grand jury in january 1988 she didnt recall 
any discussions about stock parking when one investor buys 
stock for another to conceal its true ownership in her contacts 
with princetonnewport 
parking isnt illegal but the government is seeking to 
demonstrate that such deals violate securities laws if conducted 
with fraud in mind 
prosecutors showed jones handled transactions in which 
princetonnewport sold securities to drexel and repurchased them at 
a prearranged price 31 days later they claim the deals were 
designed so princetonnewport could retain ownership while claiming 
losses for tax purposes 
the governments star witness in the jones trial william ward 
hale a former junior trader at princetonnewport testified that he 
and jones parked stocks in 1985 and knew it was illegal 
the link is considered important hale is expected to testify 
against princetonnewport and possibly milken about the questionable 
trades 
jones lawyer maintained she didnt know what parking was 
couldnt remember every trade she executed during eight years at 
drexel and was bullied by government investigators who knocked on 
her door in late 1987 in connection with the princetonnewport probe 
princetonnewport defense attorneys said they doubt the jones 
case will have any direct impact on their trial set for june 5 
other than showcasing hale as a witness 
they also chastised the government for its treatment of jones 
who they said revealed little that would would help make 
racketeering charges stick 
for all practical purposes her credibility has been so 
destroyed that it is unlikely she will ever be used as a witness by 
either side said ted wells who represents princetonnewport 
partner james s regan she is a tragic figure caught in the 
middle 
the jones case has no direct bearing on the governments 
settlement with drexel over complaints stemming from information 
supplied by nowimprisoned speculator ivan boesky the firm agreed 
to pay 650 million and plead guilty to six felonies to settle 
criminal fraud charges 
drexel spokesman steven anreder said the firm had not decided 
whether jones will be fired she was on a paid leave of absence from 
drexel which paid her legal fees

eyes not instruments are the best detectors of 
airplane structural problems according to members of a task force 
trying to determine how to ensure the safety of the nations aging 
aircraft fleet 
the most important thing you can do today is to be around an 
airplane and be alert said ben cosgrove engineering vice 
president of boeing co whose planes have been involved in some 
widely publicized incidents involving structural failure 
eighty percent of all damage is found by eyeballs he said 
cosgrove and other members of the task force formed by the air 
transport association spoke wednesday at an aircraft maintenance and 
ground support trade show in dallas 
the task force was formed last year after a section of fuselage 
ripped off a 19yearold aloha airlines boeing 737 over hawaii a 
flight attendant was killed and 61 people were injured in the 
incident which focused public attention on the increasing age of 
the nations airplanes 
there have been several other highly publicized incidents 
recently the most serious also occuring over hawaii and involving a 
boeing plane 
last month a section of the fuselage of a united airlines boeing 
747 tore off just after the plane left hawaii nine people died when 
they were sucked out of the airliner 
current economic and market conditions have resulted in the use 
of airplanes beyond their original economic design goal said 
clyde kizer engineering and maintenance vice president of the air 
transport association 
while the public has become aware of the age of the planes 
estimated to average 127 years the united executive who chaired 
the task force said age alone has little to do with an airplanes 
airworthiness 
the number of flights the environment in which the planes 
operate and the attention paid to regular maintenance are more 
important factors said bob doll uniteds vice president for 
technical services 
i dont see why there would be a limit to the operational age 
of an aircraft providing it is properly maintained he said 
boeings cosgrove said the company has inspected 20yearold 
aircraft that look as if they just rolled off the assembly line and 
other much younger aircraft in much worse shape 
its really down to the guts of an airlines organization 
cosgrove said inspection and maintainence of an aircraft whether 
it is one year or 20 years old is important 
whether closer visual inspection would have averted the aloha 
disaster is unclear indicated joseph trippe nall the national 
transportation safety board member who is leading the investigation 
nall in a separate speech wednesday said investigators found 
stress fractures around screw holes near the damaged area of the 
boeings fuselage 
as a result the ntsb although not ready to release its full 
findings already has recommended some screw holes be redesigned on 
the 737s to change their stress point 
nall said the ntsbs aloha findings likely will be released may 9 
when the board has its next regular meeting 
meanwhile doll said the task force was concerned about the 
varied levels of maintenance practices it found throughout the 
industry 
although he defended uniteds inspectors doll said the task 
force was working on how to raise expertise industrywide 
doll balked at one questioners suggestion that it would be 
better to replace old aircraft rather than update them 
if we pay 130 million for a new plane every time the 
ashtrays get dirty youre not going to be able to afford the 
ticket he said 
industry experts estimate that only about 15 jetliners have been 
scrapped voluntarily by the airlines during the last decade 
in the meantime airlines are rapidly buying planes but doll 
noted that most of the planes are being used for expansion and not 
replacement of older aircraft 
the ntsbs nall stressed that training and following regulations 
are the best ways to keep airplanes safe

boeing co which has spent much of its time 
lately fielding questions about aircraft quality has plenty of good 
news for a change two major new aircraft orders and prospects of 
record employment 
american airlines announced in new york wednesday it was ordering 
35 boeing jetliners along with up to 150 fokker100 shorthaul 
jets boeings share of that order is worth an estimated 18 
billion to 21 billion 
meanwhile boeing canadas de havilland division said it received 
its largest order ever a 425 million deal from gpa jetprop ltd 
for 38 dash 8 series 300 turboprop planes 
and tuesday boeing said it planned to add 2300 employees in the 
first half of 1989 with midyear employment in washington state 
reaching a companyrecord 102000 
boeing currently employs 99700 people in the state and 155000 
worldwide 
the company has endured a rash of bad news recently including 
reports of miswiring in some jets delays in its new 747400 jumbo 
jet questions about the safety of older aircraft and a series of 
crashes and mishaps involving boeing aircraft 
but the tone at boeing commercial airplanes was distinctively 
upbeat wednesday 
i think that would be fair to say chuckled spokesman craig 
martin when asked if the company was heartened by the american order 
so far this year boeing has announced orders for 102 jetliners 
worth more than 82 billion if that pace continued through 1989 
boeing could set a record for order value for the fifth straight 
year breaking last years mark of 297 billion boeing had orders 
for 636 jets in 1988 an industry record 
american ordered 25 boeing 757200s and 10 767300er aircraft 
bringing americans total orders of those aircraft to 85 firm and 85 
options 
martin said a midsized 757 sells for 46 million to 52 million 
depending on configuration while the widebody extendedrange 
767300er is priced at 72 million to 78 million at those prices 
the boeing share of americans order would be worth between 187 
billion and 208 billion 
americans been a good customer they are a good customer 
martin said to see them buying what we call the 757767 family is 
very encouraging its another indication that last years surge in 
757 sales will continue 
last may 26 american ordered 50 757s valued at about 2 
billion and took options on 50 more the next day united airlines 
ordered 30 of the planes worth about 13 billion and optioned the 
same number those orders were seen as a strong vote of confidence 
for the 757 a fuelefficient quiet aircraft that had been a slow 
seller since its introduction in the early 1980s 
to date boeing has announced orders for 447 757s and 372 767s 
gpa jetprop a partnership between gpa group ltd of shannon 
ireland and pwa corp of calgary alberta is a major lessor of 
turboprop aircraft tom appleton de havilland vice president for 
marketing and sales said its order is probably the largest ever for 
a single model of turboprop airliner 
this order transforms us to a central role in the turboprop 
acquisition business said naill greene gpa jetprop managing 
director we have gone from being a boutique to being a department 
store 
the twinengine dash 8 series 300 carries 50 to 56 passengers and 
is used primarily on commuter routes 
with gpa jetprops order de havilland has firm orders and 
options for 86 of the aircraft valued at more than 1 billion for 
the entire dash 8 family de havilland now has orders and options 
for 297 aircraft from 34 customers 
gpa jetprop earlier ordered nine dash 8 series 100 aircraft 
which carry 37 to 40 passengers and took options on another five 
boeing has been hiring about 900 workers per month with 
employment expected to level off by mid1989 most of the new hires 
will be at boeings everett wash widebody jet plant where the 
company is hustling to get deliveries of the 747400 back on 
schedule company spokesman paul binder said 
in 1988 boeings total employment rose by nearly 11000 or 77 
percent to 153000 the company is predicting job growth will be at 
about 5 percent this year 
its slowing somewhat but if you look at the level of economic 
activity generated by boeing right now its just extraordinary

a federal appeals court has upheld a preliminary 
injunction blocking minorco sas 57 billion hostile bid for 
consolidated gold fields plc on antitrust grounds 
a threejudge panel of the 2nd us circuit court of appeals also 
said wednesday minorcos bid should be sent back to a lower court 
for consideration of whether it violates us securities laws 
minorco which is largely controlled by two south african 
corporations anglo american corp of south africa and de beers 
consolidated mines ltd launched its bid for gold fields a british 
firm last fall minorco a luxembourg corporation already held 
nearly 30 percent of gold fields stock 
gold fields has resisted the bid in britain and also filed an 
antitrust action here 
minorco is the largest producer of gold in the noncommunist 
world accounting for 203 percent of all gold production in the 
western world according to court papers 
gold fields meanwhile has significant gold mining holdings in 
south africa australia and the united states including 90 percent 
of newmont gold the largest gold producer in the country 
gold fields accounts for 12 percent of the western worlds gold 
production making it the secondlargest gold producer in the 
noncommunist world according to court papers 
the companys newmont subsidiary claimed that because it costs 
less to mine and produce gold in south africa than in america 
minorco eventually would shut down us operations if the takeover 
was accomplished 
newmonts claim is that its ability to compete in the 
marketplace will be reduced by anticompetitive influence exercised 
from inside its own boardroom if the minorco bid succeeded wrote 
circuit judge jon o newman in the 2nd circuits 25page opinion 
newmonts threatened injury is precisely the type that the 
antitrust laws were designed to protect against the court said in 
a 2to1 decision upholding an injunction imposed by us district 
judge michael mukasey 
late last year mukasey issued a preliminary injunction 
preventing minorco anglo american and debeers from proceeding with 
their tender offer until the antitrust issue was resolved in the 
courts 
just before mukaseys ruling the minorco bid was referred to 
britains monopolies and mergers commission for investigation of 
possible anticompetitive consequences in the united kingdom on such 
strategic metals as titanium and zircon 
british law prohibited further action on the takeover bid until 
feb 2 when the commission found that the acquisition of gold fields 
would not operate against the british public interest the 2nd 
circuit opinion noted 
with that ruling mukaseys injunction remained the only legal 
obstacle to minorcos offer minorco said it would nopt buy any new 
shares unless the injunction was lifted or modified 
in seeking the injunction gold fields also claimed minorco 
violated the antifraud provisions of us securities laws for 
allegedly making and false and misleading statements about how much 
control south african corporations and individuals have over it 
gold fields claimed the oppenheimer family of south africa 
indirectly controls minorco anglo american and debeers and that the 
stigma of south africas apartheid racial policy could make it 
difficult to conduct business in some countries 
the appeals court sent the case back to us district court for 
further consideration of the fraud issue 
in his decision mukasey claimed he lacked jurisdiction in 
rejecting a gold fields claim that its us investors entitled the 
concern to sue in us courts alleging violations of federal 
securities law 
about 25 percent of gold fields outstanding shares are held by 
us citizens 
but the 2nd circuit panel said the tender offer had sufficient 
effects within the united states to warrant application of american 
securities laws

alarmed by slumping prices from the alar 
scare and dazzled by skyrocketing prices for chemicalfree fruit 
many washington apple growers are rushing into experiments with 
organic farming 
the interest is motivated more by economics primarily the 300 
percent higher prices for organic apples than philosophy 
ive had more calls in the past two or three weeks about 
growing fruit organically than in the past three years said 
brooke peterson the washington state university tree fruit 
extension agent for yakima county 
organic growing in the past was a philosophical question 
peterson said today its economic there are higher prices for 
it 
washington produces half the nations apples and the 5000 
growers of the 312 million crop are unlikely to switch more than a 
small percentage of the orchards to chemicalfree growing 
but rising consumer interest is creating a niche market many want 
to tap 
at meetings in the apple belt communities of okanogan wenatchee 
and yakima this week pacific fruit growerspackers inc will 
discuss organic techniques with hundreds of growers 
i think that organic farming is essentially another apple 
variety for us said greg mcpherson an assistant general manager 
for pacific fruit and also a grower theres definitely a market 
in the wake of the nationwide alar scare prices for organically 
grown washington apples have doubled to 48 per box prices for the 
top grade of commercially grown red delicious apples in contrast 
slumped another 1 this week to between 11 and 12 per 42pound 
box barely above the breakeven point and 2 to 3 less than before 
the alar scare 
diane dempster of charlies produce in seattle which markets 
organic fruit said the gap between organic and standard apples is 
not usually so great 
normally its 20 to 50 percent higher for organic she said 
its partly the alar scare and a real increased demand 
organic growing has received a lot of attention in recent weeks 
after a natural resources defense council report on pesticides in 
childrens food said eating apples treated with alar increased 
cancer risks in children 
the industry disputes the findings and the federal government has 
reassured consumers that apples are safe to eat 
but a louis harris poll released this week found that 842 
percent of those surveyed would choose organically grown food if 
given a choice 
washington minnesota and texas are the only states that have 
organic certification programs where farmers attest they have not 
used synthetic fertilizers or pesticides 
only about 20 of the states 5000 apple growers are currently 
certified as organic growers according to miles mcevoy of the state 
department of agriculture 
and a recent survey in seattle found that only 1 percent of the 
produce is organically grown he said 
to be certified in washington a grower must not have used 
artificial chemicals for two years he said 
were seeing a lot of apple growers interested said mcevoy 
who runs the certification program 
however many growers contend it is impossible for the entire 
applegrowing industry to switch to organic techniques 
a major reason is that the codling moth would devastate virtually 
the entire crop infesting it with worms peterson said 
but washington growers are considering experimenting with a 
variety of techniques 
mcpherson said he plans to hide 12 acres of organicallygrown 
apples in the middle of his orchards surrounded by 48 acres of 
chemicallytreated apples 
the pests normally stop at the first available tree to lay their 
eggs and he hopes that surrounding the vulnerable chemicalfree 
trees with a ring of sprayed trees will keep the moth away 
there are other techniques being developed to handle the codling 
moth without artificial chemicals mcevoy said 
but he added apples are by far the hardest thing to grow 
organically in the state

a houston bank holding company that was saved with 
the help of federal regulators last year is now bidding to acquire 
troubled mcorp a newspaper reported today 
the dallas morning news quoting anonymous industry sources said 
first city bancorporation of texas inc chairman a robert abbout 
has approached federal regulators about bidding to acquire 
dallasbased mcorp 
abboud is working on a bid with the new york investment firm 
donaldson lufkin amp jenrette inc which helped raise the 500 
million last april that allowed him take over houstonbased first 
city that deal included 1 billion in fdic aid 
donaldson lufkin officials could not be reached for comment 
wednesday a first city spokesman told the news he could neither 
confirm nor deny any interest in mcorp by abboud 
combining first city with 11 billion in assets and mcorp an 
188 billion institution would raise a host of issues for the 
government particularly because of terms of the previous deal with 
first city 
that transaction gives the fdic a stake in the companys ability 
to collect on its bad loans the fdic will recoup some of its 
investment based on the collections on soured loans made under the 
previous first city management 
a number of observers speculated that abboud would consider a bid 
for mcorp only if federal regulators first declared the companys 
banks insolvent avoiding the process he endured in taking over 
first city 
mcorps most troubled banks include mbank dallas and mbank 
houston two of its largest susidiaries the federal deposit 
insurance corp reported that nearly a third of mcorps banks had 
exhausted their equity capital by the end of 1988 leaving them 
virtually insolvent and opening the door for regulators to seize 
assets 
fdic figures show that seven mbanks around texas including four 
of the companys seven largest banks reported negative equity 
exhausting shareholder funds at the end of 1988 representing 
118 billion of mcorps 188 billion asset base 
mcorps chairman gene h bishop has indicated he wants the 
company to remain independent he said last october that the company 
could raise new capital to combine with fdic aid which analysts 
have estimated would exceed 1 billion 
the government said in november that it would consider 
managements proposal while seeking other bids few suitors have 
surfaced partly because of complications that might arise in trying 
to buy the companys banks without the cooperation of bishop 
mcorps management also has retained about 400 million in cash 
and other assets in the holding company bishop has indicated that 
money may be available for helping the companys banks only as part 
of a managementblessed reorganization

the united states largest building contractor said 
thursday it isnt strongly interested in the japanese market 
despite receiving one of the first private contracts to go to a us 
firm since an agreement to open japans construction market was 
reached last may 
the turner corp signed a contract thursday to team up with 
kumagai gumi one of japans biggest construction firms in an 112 
billion yen the equivalent of about 85 million construction 
project in tokyo for japans shuwa corp 
shuwa one of the largest japanese holders of american real 
estate owns 37 buildings in the united states including atlantic 
richfield plaza in los angeles and the abc building in new york 
the companies said turners portion of the joint venture would be 
10 percent kumagai gumi and turner agreed last summer to cooperate 
in construction projects in the two countries and are jointly 
involved in three projects in new york 
us commerce secretary robert mosbacher welcomed thursdays 
contract as a fine example of private japanese industry honoring 
the spirit of last mays bilateral construction agreement in which 
japan agreed to give us companies access to a range of public 
works projects 
most significant is that this privatesector project is outside 
of that accord but reflects most clearly our goal that american 
companies be given the opportunity to introduce their expertise and 
experience to all sectors of the japanese market mosbacher said 
in a statement 
i want to make a small contribution to alleviating trade 
friction shuwa president shigeru kobayashi told a news conference 
after the signing instead of arguing and negotiating the two 
sides should promote more joint activities 
us officials have charged that japanese bidding practices and 
other industry customs have blocked foreign entry into the japanese 
construction market japanese builders have denied that foreigners 
are excluded and say us construction firms showed little interest 
in japan before the bilateral pact 
i dont think the customs would prevent us turner senior 
vice president ralph beck said after the contract signing from 
our perspective the japanese government and certainly shuwa have 
been providing the opportunities 
beck said his company was more interested in increasing its 
business in the united states and other countries through the shuwa 
venture than in increasing its access to the japanese market 
it doesnt make a lot of sense to beat your head against the 
wall unless theres something that you can bring to the table 
thats different than what the very capable industry can deliver 
over here he said 
the worlds a very big place and at the moment there are 
more than enough opportunities in the world with better prospects 
where we can bring something to the table 
beck discounted what he described as paranoia in the united 
states about an erosion of market share for us contractors 
resulting from the arrival of japanese developers 
the japanese have brought building opportunities to the united 
states which probably wouldnt have been there because there wasnt 
anybody to invest in those projects he said 
earlier this month tishman realty and construction co inc 
announced it was forming a joint venture with japans aoki corp to 
build a luxury hotel in osaka in what it said was the first private 
construction agreement by a us company following the bilateral 
pact

britains annual inflation rate jumped to an 
unexpectedly high 78 percent in february from 75 percent the 
previous month largely because of rising mortgage rates the 
government said thursday 
the higher mortgage rates stem from the governments drive to 
push up interest rates as a way of fighting britains resurgent 
inflation which prime minister margaret thatcher repeatedly has 
said is her top economic priority 
excluding mortgage payments the annual rate of inflation stood 
at 57 percent said norman fowler secretary of the department of 
employment 
the annual rate was above the 77 percent rate the markets had 
been expecting and fueled speculation that interest rates might be 
hoisted even higher than their current 13percent level 
the pound held steady on the news but share prices surprisingly 
gained as investors took the report in stride ahead of the long 
easter holiday weekend the financial timesstock exchange 100share 
index which had been down 64 points before the report was down 
27 points or 01 percent at 20459 afterward 
the reaction was very muted said one london trader for 
some people maybe the figures werent as scary as they thought 
chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson warned during his fiscal 
budget speech earlier this month that he expected britains annual 
inflation rate to peak at around 8 percent in the middle of year 
and that he expected the underlying rate excluding mortgage rates 
to peak at 55 percent a level it surpassed with the latest report 
the chancellor already has some egg on his face said kevin 
gardiner economist at the london investment firm warburg 
securities the market was a little bit disappointed by the 
figures 
lawson also said he expects the annual inflation rate to decline 
to 55 percent by the fourth quarter of 1989 and to 45 percent by 
the second quarter of 1990 
higher interest rates which are affecting inflation in the 
short term will help bring the rate down in the longer term 
fowler the employment secretary said indeed retail sales have 
eased off and the recent figures show the underlying trend to be 
broadly flat since autumn 
the commercial banks base lending rate has risen to its current 
13 percent from 75 percent last summer 
the department said retail prices rose 07 percent in february 
from january 
it said its retail price index stood at 1118 in february 1110 
in january and 1037 in february 1988 the index uses a 1987 base of 
100 
the department also blamed the higher prices on clothing shoes 
and household goods following january sales gasoline prices also 
were up it said

the us economy grew at a moderate annual rate 
of 24 percent in the final three months of last year even better 
than previously believed the government said today 
but the commerce department said the increase in the gross 
national product the broadest measure of economic health was 
accompanied by a pickup in inflation reflecting higher food costs 
and rising import prices 
the 24 percent increase represented an upward revision from last 
month when the government estimated that the gnp had grown at an 
annual rate of just 2 percent in the octoberdecember quarter 
the economys momentum would have been an even stronger 35 
percent except for the lingering effects of last summers drought 
which subtracted more than 1 percentage point from growth 
however the strong growth propelled by high consumer demand 
has economists and the federal reserve board worried given the 
tight labor markets and high factory operating rates 
the fed last month embarked on a renewed drive to push interest 
rates higher in an effort to dampen demand and cool off growing 
inflationary pressures 
but the bush administration and some private economists have 
complained that the fed may be in danger of overdoing that effort 
and end up pushing the country into a recession 
despite some alarming reports on inflation in january and 
february that sent the stock market plunging many analysts believe 
that growth is slowing and the central bank does not need to do more 
in its antiinflation efforts 
first word on the gnp performance for the first three months of 
1989 will be released in april 
an inflation index tied to the gnp rose at a sharp annual rate of 
53 percent in the octoberdecember quarter up from a 47 percent 
rate of increase in the third quarter 
since the index known as the gnp deflator has been rising at 
annual rate of 38 percent or less for the past three years 
analysts said the uptick over the 5 percent mark indicated that 
inflationary pressures have increased 
in a look at how us businesses performed the commerce 
department said corporate profits after taxes shot up 146 percent 
in 1988 aided by a 28 percent rise in the fourth quarter the 
annual increase was the best performance for corporate profits since 
a huge 224 percent jump in 1983 the year after the end of the 
steep 198182 recession 
the upward revision in the gnp for the fourth quarter made growth 
for the entire year look slightly better the government said the 
gnp rose 39 percent in 1988 the best performance since a 68 
percent increase in 1984 the yearly gnp increase had been put at 
38 percent earlier 
the 24 percent gnp growth in the fourth quarter followed a 25 
percent rise in the julyseptember quarter 
while it was the slowest advance since a 14 percent rise in the 
fourth quarter of 1986 analysts said the pace was still too strong 
because the overall rate was held back by the drought 
the government has said it expects growth in the first quarter of 
1989 will be boosted by 25 percentage points reflecting a bounce 
back from the drought 
the upward revision for the fourth quarter reflected higher 
government spending than previously estimated and a smaller decline 
in business investment 
the positive factors were offset somewhat by a larger trade 
deficit the government said the gap between imports and exports 
shot up at an annual rate of 115 billion in the fourth quarter 
the sharpest widening of the trade imbalance since the third quarter 
of 1986 
while exports climbed by 65 percent this improvement was 
swamped by a 135 percent rise in imports many analysts are fearful 
that the improvement in the trade deficit which contributed almost 
half of total growth last year in the economy has stalled out 
these analysts predict that the combination of a worsening trade 
picture and the credittightening by the fed will translate into 
much more sluggish growth this year 
that possibility has the administration worried because president 
bush is counting on economic growth remaining robust as a way of 
lowering the budget deficit without resorting to a tax increase 
the administrations economic forecast upon which it based its 
assumption that the budget deficit would decline below 100 billion 
next year called for the gnp to expand at a healthy clip of 32 
percent 
however private economists even those who think the country can 
escape without a recession are much more pessimistic 
the latest consensus forecast from blue chip economic indicators 
a financial newsletter which surveys 50 top economists each month 
puts growth for 1989 at 27 percent based on a belief that consumer 
spending business investment and us exports will all show less 
strength than in 1988 
many analysts believe there is plenty of evidence that the 
slowdown is already occurring in weaker consumer spending and slower 
business investment 
on wednesday the government reported that orders to us 
factories for big ticket durable goods declined for a second 
straight month in february the first backtoback monthly declines 
in three years 
jerry jasinowski chief economist of the national association of 
manufacturers said the decline in factory orders provided solid 
evidence that the economy is slowing down 
david wyss an economist with data resources inc of lexington 
mass said he believed the slowdown would not snowball into an 
outright recession even though he said the worsethanexpected 
inflation reports so far this year did increase the possibility of a 
slump

a judge in delaware has ruled that an offer 
from tyson foods inc of springdale to buy out the holly farms corp 
of memphis tenn is better than a rival offer from conagra of 
omaha neb 
but vice chancellor maurice hartnetts 29page decision wednesday 
left it up to holly farms stockholders to choose between the tyson 
and conagra offers hartnett said shareholders would probably reject 
the proposed merger agreement from conagra 
today holly farms announced that its board had decided to reject 
tysons offer of 6350 per share and to recommend that stockholders 
not tender their shares pursuant to that offer the board met 
wednesday 
last week tyson increased its offer to acquire holly farms stock 
from 60 a share to 6350 a share in a deal worth about 118 
billion conagra has offered a stock swap deal worth between 109 
billion and 117 billion but don tyson chairman and chief 
executive officer of tyson says his companys offer is worth much 
more 
hartnetts ruling came in a suit by tyson asking that the judge 
stop a scheduled april 14 vote by holly farms shareholders on the 
merger the judge allowed the vote to proceed 
should shareholders approve the merger hartnett said he wouldnt 
allow the agreement to go through until he makes a decision on a 
socalled crown jewel lockup provision worked into the merger 
the provision would give conagra an option to buy prime assets 
from holly farms if the merger fell through the provision is 
intended to make an acquisition by tyson diffcult 
hartnett said the provision was tainted and probably 
unenforceable 
the holly farms board said in a news release today that by 
continuuing to condition its tender offer on the invalidity of the 
lockup agreement tyson had failed to provide the board with the 
necessary assurance that tyson would complete an acquisition of 
holly farms on a timely basis if at all 
unless and until tyson removes from its tender offer the asset 
option condition a holly farms spokesman said in the release 
holly farms stockholders can have no assurance that tysons 
6350 price represents deliverable value for this reason 
conagras merger agreement still represents in the boards view 
the best alternative for our stockholders 
tyson foods has hired a new york firm to help it sway holly farms 
stockholders in its direction but the board of holly farms which 
has said it prefers the offer from conagra has also hired a new 
york firm in an effort to keep its stockholders in the conagra camp 
the management of holly farms needs twothirds of its 
shareholders of record to vote april 14 to approved its merger with 
conagra

officials of two of the three unions at eastern 
airlines including the striking machinists are among the members 
of a committee representing unsecured creditors of the crippled 
carrier 
harold jones the federal trustee supervising administration of 
easterns bankruptcy reorganization appointed the 15member 
committee wednesday to represent the unsecured creditors and 
included officials of the machinists and the air line pilots 
association 
the transport workers union which represents flight attendants 
at eastern was not included however the creditors panel does 
include a representative of nonunion employees most of whom were 
laid off a few days after the machinists walkout began and are 
demanding back pay 
in tallahassee fla a federal appeals court today was scheduled 
to hear an eastern request to force pilots to cross machinists 
picket lines and go back to work 
the machinists struck the airline on march 4 after 17 months of 
wrangling with management over a contract the pilots support for 
the walkout virtually grounded eastern and forced it to file for 
protection from its creditors under chapter 11 of the federal 
bankruptcy laws on march 9 
the eastern pilots are owed more than 500 million in back pay 
and other claims said ron cole a spokesman in miami for the pilots 
union 
flight attendants also honored the machinists picket lines 
the creditors committee has the right to review any 
reorganization plan proposed by eastern and can propose its own plan 
to the bankruptcy judge 
jones told a gathering of around 400 creditor representatives 
financial analysts and reporters the role of the creditors panel is 
far more expansive than his 
eastern says it has 59 billion in assets and 45 billion in 
liabilities unsecured creditors such as ticketholders and travel 
agents are the most likely to lose money in a bankruptcy 
reorganization because they have no collateral or security from 
the debtor in case of default 
the airlines secured creditors mainly bondholders met with 
eastern president phil bakes on tuesday 
easterns liabilities include 169 billion in longterm debt 
736 million in capital lease obligations and 165 million in unused 
tickets issued to passengers harvey miller one of easterns 
bankruptcy attorneys told the creditors meeting 
the objective of chapter 11 is to rebuild eastern said 
miller a partner in the law firm weil gotschal manges it is 
easterns plan to resuscitate the airline and build back its flight 
schedule 
the embattled airline recently started advertising for new pilots 
in newspapers only about 200 of the 3600 or so pilots at eastern 
have crossed machinist picket lines to fly 
eastern is operating only a fraction of the flights in its normal 
schedule except for nearly normal service on its northeast air 
shuttle and to latin america 
miller said 167 planes out of easterns fleet of 254 aircraft are 
currently inactive parked on airport runways in miami atlanta 
orlando fla and new york 
in addition to the international association of machinists and 
the alpa the other members of the unsecured creditors committee 
are as follows where available the amount owed them by eastern is 
included 
aircraft manufacturer airbus industrie 9594 million general 
electric co 7547 million citicorp united states trust co of 
new york 5874 million boeing co 5398 million united 
technologies credit corp 2230 million ibj schroder bank and 
trust co 1956 million american national bank amp trust co 
1276 million rollsroyce credit corp 589 million marriott 
corp 105 million atampt communications 800876 rohr aero 
services and mary grace shore representing nonunion employees of 
eastern 
ms shore is an elected representative of a nonunion group 
called peace or positive employee action committee at eastern 
which union officials allege is sponsored by eastern management 
i think its quite insulting that every employee group at 
eastern is on the creditors committee except the flight 
attendants said mary jane barry president of a transport workers 
union local representing eastern flight attendants its really a 
slap in the face 
she asserted that ms shore is really a representative of eastern 
management rather than the airlines employees 
that group peace is nothing but a unionbusting group of 
people ms barry said today in a telephone interview from miami

white house and congressional budget 
negotiators reported today that their talks have been cordial and 
constructive but that they were still some distance from reaching 
a spending compromise 
what is most important is the clear understanding of every 
member of the negotiating group of the need for an effective budget 
agreement the bargainers said in a letter to president bush and 
house and senate leaders 
the closeddoor sessions aimed at producing a fiscal 1990 
spending plan were put on hold wednesday because of congress 
easter recess and are scheduled to resume april 3 
our meetings have been both cordial and constructive the 
letter said a number of budget options have been discussed we 
intend to continue to negotiate on the basis of these and other 
options in an effort to reach a compromise 
it is our hope that we will achieve a compromise on the broad 
outlines of a resolution that can serve as the basis for 
congressional action within the next few weeks it said 
sen james sasser dtenn chairman of the senate budget 
committee said that because we havent reached agreement today 
doesnt mean we dont have a good chance of reaching one down the 
road 
earlier this month sasser and his house counterpart rep leon 
panetta dcalif had promised to report to democratic leaders 
today on the progress of the talks 
the two democrats however warned that unless an agreement is 
reached with the white house in early april they will write their 
own budget and attempt to move it through congress 
i think were either going to have an agreement by the middle 
of april or know we cant have an agreement sasser said 
sasser said his panel will begin writing its own spending plan if 
the talks fail to produce a deal within the first two weeks of april 
panetta was even more demanding saying that for his panel to 
meet its deadlines he believes the talks will have to produce a 
package within the first week in april 
under the grammrudman deficit reduction law congress is 
supposed to complete its budget resolution by april 15 later 
legislation is needed to provide the actual spending for programs 
so far the main players in the talks have been ranking democrats 
and republicans on both chambers budget committees and white house 
budget director richard darman 
administration officials have met intermittently with 
congressional budget writers ever since president bush introduced 
his 116 trillion spending plan on feb 9 
in its effort to reach the grammrudman requirement of a deficit 
of no more than 100 billion bushs proposal contained 14 billion 
in new revenues 
the white house refuses to characterize them as new taxes bush 
pledged during his presidential campaign to oppose tax hikes 
the limitation were struggling with is the political 
limitation on revenues and that continues to haunt these 
discussions panetta said 
democrats have complained that bushs budget relies too heavily 
on domestic cuts for its savings and have proposed an alternative 
that would reach half the deficit reduction goal with additional 
revenue onefourth through military cuts and onefourth with 
domestic reductions 
but sasser said that so far in the talks darman has merely 
restated the bush budget perhaps with minor differences

the de beers diamond cartel of south africa citing 
strong demand says it is increasing prices for rough gemstones an 
average 155 percent 
the price increase for a broad range of uncut diamonds announced 
tuesday is effective next week it follows a 135 percent increase 
last may and a 10 percent increase in september 1987 
de beers consolidated mines ltd which is based in johannesburg 
controls 80 percent of the worlds rough diamond market through its 
londonbased marketing arm central selling organization 
it does not disclose what the prices are 
the cartel only sets prices for rough diamonds which it doesnt 
disclose and operates a pipeline of diamonds from its mines in 
south africa and australia to dealers and cutters in the worlds 
major diamond cutting centers antwerp bombay new york and tel 
aviv 
it holds about 10 sights or sales for international 
diamond dealers a year with the next one scheduled for next week 
we are responding to prevailing conditions in the market it 
was marketled spokesman richard dickson said thursday about the 
price increase 
demand for rough diamonds of two carats and less is especially 
strong he said 
the industry is anticipating another good year in 1989 from 
retail diamond and jewelry sales dickson said 
the generally weaker dollar has helped sales because diamonds are 
priced in dollars and holders of japanese yen and european 
currencies get more for their money 
in addition sales should improve in japan after april 1 when a 
15 percent tax in britain on luxury items costing about 300 or more 
is replaced with a flat 3 percent sales tax on all items dickson 
said 
the markets in israel and india are particularly strong with 
good advances also in new york and belgium he said 
we are bringing rough prices up in line with those prices of 
polished diamonds that are prevailing within the diamond cutting 
centers he said 
the organization had record sales of 42 billion in 1988 up 37 
percent from 308 billion in 1987 the previous record 
most of the worlds diamonds are industrial diamonds used 
primarily in drilling between 10 percent and 20 percent are gems

arthur l liman a gangly disheveled man with a 
noo yawk accent probably is best known for picking apart oliver 
north on national television as captive nation watched 
oliver north isnt it a fact liman prefaced each 
question to the deposed marine lieutenant colonel during the 
congressional irancontra hearings that made limans baggy face and 
halfmoon ears a household image 
his simple direct persistent style pierced the veil around the 
man president reagan called a national hero and earned liman an 
outsider in washington the admiration of fellow democrats and 
republicans alike as well as bags of hate mail 
it was like shakespeare said sen warren rudman the new 
hampshire republican who was vice chairman of the senate committee 
liman served as general counsel two years ago the guy is good 
the guy is back in his native new york returned to the highest 
and highestpaid echelons of the citys legal community and to the 
almost notorietyfree existence he prefers after a summer when every 
washington cabbie knew him by name 
limans career has taken him from investigating the attica prison 
riots to defending the likes of john zaccaro and robert vesco to 
boardroom negotiating at cbs to grilling oliver north 
at 56 liman declines specialties though he is considered a 
brilliant trial attorney and the citys most prominent securities 
fraud lawyer in a decade permeated with wall street crime 
liman most recently was lead defense attorney in a major stock 
manipulation case against gaf corp he also represents michael 
milken the drexel burnham lambert incs financier who expects to 
be indicted for fraud and racketeering 
i am not a specialist in criminal securities fraud cases 
liman said in an interview during the exhausting 12day 
deliberations in the gaf case which ended march 22 in a second 
mistrial ive always believed that a trial lawyer should be able 
to try any kind of case i have avoided narrow specialization 
a sampling of limans clients over the last few years 
demonstrates the versatility his peers respect 
on the corporate side he represented pennzoil co against texaco 
inc in 1985 and even delivered testimony on the witness stand that 
helped send texaco into bankruptcy court time inc and warner 
communications inc are clients the two not coincidentally just 
announced a massive merger 
in 1986 liman negotiated a handshake between clients laurence 
tisch and william paley that led to the ouster of cbs incs chief 
executive officer thomas wyman 
in the public domain liman supervised richard nixons disbarment 
and probed allegations of wrongdoing in new york citys medical 
examiners office 
his clients arent all saints in addition to milken and insider 
trader dennis levine liman has represented zaccaro the real estate 
mogul and husband of former vice presidential candidate geraldine 
ferraro and vesco the fugitive businessman 
hes negotiating this case now and he could be negotitating a 
takeover deal tomorrow said robert fiske a new york lawyer and 
former us attorney who has known liman 20 years hes extremely 
versatile he handles an enormous variety of cases 
born in queens liman joined the new york law firm of paul weiss 
rifkind wharton amp garrison in 1957 after finishing first in his 
class at yale law school but he cut his teeth on whitecollar crime 
during a 2year stay at the us attorneys office in manhattan 
under robert morgenthau starting in 1961 
i had never worked on a securities case because there really 
werent any liman said we were breaking new ground 
he recalled himself as the office garbage pail taking small 
cases colleagues shunned liman once won a conviction of a bartender 
for diluting liquor but got just a 1 fine the irish judge had a 
bartender father 
in 1971 morgenthau appointed liman who had since returned to 
paul weiss as special prosecutor to investigate the attica prison 
riots in upstate new york it was the first probe inside a prison 
and limans team interviewed every inmate his report was nominated 
for a national book award 
the attica hearings were televised but liman said they formed an 
almost polar contrast to the turbulent and politically charged 
irancontra proceedings during which liman received at least two 
serious threats for his perceived attacks on north 
i knew the hearings were going to be televised but it never 
occurred to me they would become such an object of media 
attention he said nor did i really anticipate there was going 
to be this wholesale stripping away of my privacy 
all of a sudden we were receiving 100000 hate letters and a 
few fan letters whenever somebody is very public in this 
country it brings out the crazies 
with north now on trial in washington liman recalls the hearings 
as an exercise in unearthing evidence not bringing anyone to 
justice the philosophy of the mission he said quoting the late 
supreme court justice louis d brandeis was that sunlight is the 
best disinfectant in a democracy 
there are some events in american history where its most 
important for the american people to understand how it happened and 
why it happened liman said 
when i went down to washington on the job there was a rumor a 
day on what happened what people forget is these hearings dispelled 
so much of that if we werent able to find out everything that 
happened we were able to find out much and let the american people 
judge 
i told the committee when i took the job that i could never 
determine for them what the real truth was because too many 
documents had been shredded and wed have to rely on credibility 
liman talks to judges and juries and oliver norths in the same 
paced deferential justfolks manner facing the bench hands in 
his pockets he exposes drooping shirttails behind a tapered suit 
i think juries dont go for the dramatic he said i think 
they see the things and decide for themselves 
liman also is notoriously absentmindend he has appeared in court 
in mismatched suits one oftrepeated story has liman asking his 
secretary to call a client when she reported the man had died of a 
heart attack liman replied just have him call me when he gets 
in 
said rudman what is deceptive is arthur liman speaks like the 
guy next door but what is driving the verbiage is a computer in his 
head even oliver north came away with great respect for arthur 
liman he was fair he never took a cheap shot at anybody in those 
hearings 
i dont know what life holds for arthur maybe someday therell 
be a democratic president if there is i hope arthur liman ends up 
in government

consolidated gold fields plc shares plummeted 
thursday on speculation that a us court ruling would block minorco 
sas hostile takeover attempt for the british mining giant for at 
least a year 
the attempted buyout valued at about 55 billion is britains 
biggest ever 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals in new york late wednesday 
upheld a lower courts preliminary injunction barring the south 
africancontrolled minorco from buying more than 30 percent of 
shares in gold fields which has both us interests and american 
shareholders 
minorco which is controlled by the gold and diamond mining 
giants anglo american corp and de beers consolidated mines ltd 
already owns 296 percent of its target 
the appeals court said the proposed takeover likely would violate 
us antitrust laws the court also ruled that the minorco bid 
should go back to a lower court for consideration of whether it 
violates us securities laws 
the court noted that minorco through its various holdings is 
the largest producer of gold in the noncommunist world accounting 
for 203 percent of all gold production in the western world 
while gold fields a british firm is the free worlds 
secondlargest gold concern 
luxembourgbased minorco now can either appeal the latest ruling 
to the us supreme court or take the case back to the lower court 
for a trial on the antitrust issues 
but analysts said they saw little chance the us litigation 
could be resolved within the time limit allowed for the bid under 
british takeover rules 
minorco said it was disappointed with the ruling and said it was 
reviewing the courts opinion with its advisers and studying the 
options available to it 
gold fields shares dropped the equivalent of 315 a share to 
close at 2150 in active trading on londons stock exchange 
minorco rose 29 cents to 1290 a share 
gold fields chairman rudolph agnew called the ruling good news 
but said the implications for the outcome of the bid arent yet 
clear 
under british takeover regulations minorco cant extend its bid 
beyond april 26 and must control more than 50 percent of gold 
fields outstanding shares by then 
minorco then would have until may 17 to satisfy or waive all 
outstanding conditions on the bid which offered one new minorco 
share plus 3526 in cash for every two gold fields shares one of 
these conditions is resolution of the us litigation which could 
continue for weeks months or years 
what has happened is very bad news for people who were hoping 
for more money out of the gold fields issue said christopher 
spreckley an analyst at clalexanders laing and cruickshank time 
is just not on minorcos side unless legal miracles start happening 
in the united states i think this bid is bordering on dead 
minorcos only incentive to sweeten its offer would be if it 
thought it could persuade consolidated gold fields to accept a 
friendly buyout and drop the us litigation said jeff summers an 
analyst with the london investment firm hoare govett ltd 
but its very unlikely that minorco would raise the bid 
summers said mr rudolph agnew and his board do seem to be 
determined to stay independent given some of the vitriolic remarks 
which have passed between the two campsi will be very surprised 
if gold fields would be willing to consider an offer from minorco 
there was some speculation minorco might persuade the panel on 
takeovers and mergers to extend the time period within which it must 
complete the bid until the us court case is resolved 
minorco also could clear up the litigation and make a new offer 
for gold fields sometime after february when the british takeover 
regulations would permit it to launch another bid the analysts said 
angloamerican and minorco have spent many years planning their 
attempt on gold fields and i again would be surprised if they walked 
away from it purely because of a us court ruling summers said 
i think minorco might be willing to take a very longterm view

corporations aftertax profits shot up 146 
percent in 1988 the best showing in five years the government said 
thursday in another report cited as evidence of last years strong 
economic picture 
the commerce department said aftertax profits rose to 1638 
billion last year following a 101 percent gain in 1987 last years 
advance was the biggest since a 224 percent postrecession jump in 
1983 
aftertax profits were up 28 percent in the final three months 
of 1988 to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1739 billion

for 1989 is not as bright as it was last year 
at this stage in the business expansion profits are going to 
lose momentum said economist allen sinai of the boston co 1988 
was a terrific year for the economy and for corporate profits 
profits did extremely well because of good sales and low costs but 
were past the best times in profits 
he projected that aftertax profits this year would increase by 5 
percent to 6 percent and could then decline in 1990

american suzuki motor corp said today it has 
agreed to put safety warnings in advertising for its 
fourwheeldrive samurai to settle a dispute with the attorneys 
general of seven states 
the company said the messages which warn against abrupt 
maneuvers in the socalled sport utility vehicles are to be 
included in all ads and promotional material 
the dispute with the top law enforcement officials of california 
massachusetts minnesota missouri new york texas and washington 
stems from a controversy that erupted in june over a consumer 
groups allegation the sporty cars were likely to roll over 
the attorneys general had accused the company of violating laws 
against false and deceptive advertising 
suzuki has heatedly disputed the allegations by consumers union 
the publisher of consumer reports magazine and the national highway 
traffic safety administration in september denied a petition to 
order a safety recall 
the agreement requires the japanese carmaker to include in its 
ads the following statement this vehicle handles differently from 
ordinary passenger cars federal law cautions to avoid sharp turns 
and abrupt maneuvers always wear your seat belt for specific 
details please read your owners manual 
the company also agreed to reimburse the states 200000 for 
legal costs 
american suzuki the us arm of the japanese automaker noted 
the company hadnt acknowledged any safety problems with the cars 
for suzuki and samurai owners this agreement with the 
attorneys general is the final chapter in a long story of false 
allegations about the samurai n douglas mazza the companys 
vice president and general manager said in a news release from 
american suzukis brea calif offices 
consumers union tests found that because of its short wheelbase 
and high center of gravity the samurai is dangerously prone to roll 
over under what the consumer group maintained are normal driving 
conditions 
suzuki officials have said the car classified for import as a 
sport utility vehicle handles no differently than other 
fourwheeldrive cars made in the united states and elsewhere

advanced slightly

rain in parts of the midwest late in the weekend or early next week 
which could reduce lingering dryness from last summers drought 
perceptions that newly harvested brazilian soybeans are about to 
come onto the world market added to the selling pressure

for diminished chances of rain in the central plains but finished 
with slight gains as traders evened up their positions ahead of the 
long weekend

a second mistrial in a key stock manipulation 
case and the perjury conviction of a young bond trading assistant 
highlight problems the government has when it takes wall street 
crime cases to court defense lawyers said thursday 
the whitecollar corruption probes that started with dennis 
levine in 1986 led to ivan boesky and targeted michael milken 
yielded their first criminal conviction wednesday with the guilty 
verdict against 26yearold lisa jones 
less than 30 minutes later in the same courthouse a federal 
judge declared another mistrial in the gaf corp stock manipulation 
case after the jury said it was deadlocked after 12 days of 
deliberations 
the outcome of the two trials left defense lawyers unimpressed 
with the governments trumpeted efforts to bring wall street 
criminal charges to court 
in the jones case attorneys said the government may have 
overzealously pursued a defendant who was by all accounts a minor 
figure in the alleged scandal and with gaf the government was 
unable to convince a jury of its case 
in a day where you have all this wall street bashing a jury 
was unable to decide after two weeks and that means to me they 
didnt have what evidence goes with a criminal case harm 
malevolence evil intent securities fraud lawyer stanley s arkin 
said 
until now cases derived from the insider trading scandals of the 
mid1980s were settled through government plea bargains or as civil 
claims by the securities and exchange commission 
at least half a dozen criminal trials are scheduled for later 
this year they will test the confessions of boesky the 
nowimprisoned arbitrager and other financial figures who have 
cooperated with the government in exchange for leniency 
prosecutors based much of the gaf case which ended in a january 
mistrial after the government unintentionally withheld evidence on 
testimony by los angeles broker and admitted felon boyd l 
jefferies he said gaf asked him to illegally manipulate the price 
of union carbide corp stock 
many attorneys expected the trial to turn simply on whether 
jurors believed jefferies but during deliberations the panel asked 
for charts and graphs and reheard testimony involving the 
oftenconfusing intricacies of stock trading 
the gaf case also was seen as problematic because none of the 
accused made any money from the alleged deals 
what it proves is the jury element is an important distinction 
between civil and criminal cases said paul fischer a former sec 
lawyer now in private practice you just never know about a jury 
whether theyll understand the case what theyll focus on in making 
a decision 
said arkin i think whenever they try cases where nobody got 
hurt and they are hypertechnical cases prosecutors ought to 
rethink it 
under former us attorney rudolph giuliani the government 
brought charges in more than 50 securities fraud cases starting in 
1983 and made fraud prosecution a priority increasing the 
complement of investigators to about 20 a handful of earlier 
insider tradingrelated cases did go to trial including the 1986 
conviction of former wall street journal reporter r foster winans 
but gaf was the headline case spun off from boesky 
us attorney benito romano said after the verdict the government 
intends to bring the case again and attributed the second mistrial 
to the vagaries of juries 
some defense lawyers agreed 
i dont think that means either the government can or cant win 
an insider trading case it means that in this case nobody won so 
far said michael feldberg a prosecutor under giuliani from 
198184 
the gaf jury which was sequestered march 10 issued a statement 
through us district judge mary johnson lowe saying it would not 
comment on deliberations 
in the lisa jones trial defense lawyers harshly criticized the 
governments tactics accusing prosecutors of badgering her 
misleading the jury and raising red herrings about stock deals that 
jones may not have understood 
jones was convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice for 
lying to a federal grand jury in 1987 during an investigation of 
possibly illegal stock purchases by drexel burnham lambert inc for 
nowdefunct princetonnewport securities lp 
jones worked for bruce lee newberg a former drexel trader who 
faces a june trial on racketeering charges along with five 
princetonnewport partners newberg reported directly to milken who 
is expected to be indicted for fraud and racketeering 
lawyers portrayed the prosecution of jones a onetime runaway 
who rose to a 117000ayear position at drexel as overzealous 
they claim she was treated harshly on the stand she broke down 
repeatedly as a message to potential future witnesses

steve jobs next inc in an abrupt switch 
in marketing tactics next week will announce plans to sell its 
scholars workstation through the nations top retailer of 
desktop computers to business industry sources said thursday 
nexts deal with businessland inc which has 112 outlets 
nationwide would give jobs palo altobased company greater 
visibility speed up development of software for its workstations 
and deal a blow to rival sun microsystems inc analysts said 
jobs who called a news conference for march 30 to make a major 
business announcement said last fall next would initially sell 
its workstations exclusively to educators and students at a 
discounted price of 6500 and would not venture immediately into 
the business market 
that was always a smokescreen said bruce lupatkin analyst 
for hambrecht amp quist inc in san francisco anybody who is awake 
would realize you couldnt build a big business in workstations and 
avoid selling to the corporate and technical market 
the worldwide market for general purpose and technical 
workstations highpowered desktop computers that range from about 
8000 to 80000 is estimated at 4 billion to 5 billion and is 
growing rapidly the retail price of the next computer system 
according to industry sources will range from 10000 to 12000 
nexts workstation a sleek black magnesiumboxed computer 
which features a magnetooptical disk drive that can hold about 
200000 typewritten pages of information is jobs first product 
since his ouster as chairman of apple computer inc in 1985 
sun microsystems headquartered in mountain view calif is the 
leading maker of unix workstations for engineers and technical users 
and has been negotiating with businessland and other resellers 
sun is out in the cold as far as businessland is concerned 
lupatkin said this is a step in the right direction for next but 
i dont think it means they have arrived and will replace the 
leaders 
businessland which declined comment on the deal also is 
expected to announce it will carry new versions of ibms rt pc 
technical workstations that can use nexts software 
every workstation manufacturer is jockeying for market 
position jobs said in a letter announcing the news conference 
next believes that several nontechnical factors will play key 
roles in determining who wins 
jobs said next has been shipping its computers for almost three 
months and noted that several customers and key software developers 
would join in the announcement next week 
jobs declined to confirm the deal with businessland or name the 
software firms but sources said he would announce development of 
spreadsheets word processors and database programs by lotus 
development corp ashtontate corp and apples claris corp 
initially next is expected to market its workstations through 
businessland for scientific and engineering jobs because it already 
has some software for those uses software for business will take 
longer to develop 
the switch from a focus on the education market to the business 
and technical market however may backfire on next said stewart 
alsop publisher of pc letter 
you cant run around for three years saying one thing and then 
change it overnight he said and educators who until now have 
been nexts top priority are very sensitive to how they rank in the 
eyes of their suppliers 
some analysts wonder whether next which has about 250 employees 
is ready to meet the demands of selling the computer in the retail 
market 
alsop said selling retail would be fundamentally a mistake 
for next noting that its computer was not designed for business use 
and is not compatible with existing standard products 
he added though that the computer industry is in a state of 
confusion particularly in the market for machines such as nexts 
that use versions of atampts unix operating system 
next has an opportunity to walk into the unix market and set 
the standard alsop said

the store manager of the walmart in this 
community on the outskirts of dallas tells a story that gives an 
insight into the man considered responsible for a retailing 
phenomenon 
manager don bost remembers one day last summer when a secretary 
telephoned from walmart stores incs corporate headquarters in 
bentonville ark chairman sam walton was about to land at a nearby 
airport and the secretary asked if someone could fetch him and bring 
him to the de soto store 
paying unexpected calls on stores is one way walton has kept in 
close touch with everyday goingson his example is followed by 
other walmart executives and most make a point of spending a lot of 
time in the field 
says ed nagy district manager for 9 stores in the dallas 
metropolitan area its not like uhoh someones coming 
because theyre always out 
by all accounts sam waltons personality permeates operations 
throughout the company 
everyone from walmart president and chief operating officer 
david glass down to an hourly store worker can readily quote the 
gospel according to sam as he is called 
to paraphrase sams primary rules of retailing rule no1 is 
the customer is always right rule no2 says just in case the 
customers wrong revert to rule no1 
if the principles sound oldfashioned and homespun they are 
because thats the way sam is people who know him say 
he shuns the limlight that his companys success has shed on him 
and has decided to refuse almost all press requests for interviews 
hes happy to chat with folks in his stores though 
he also regularly reminds walmart associates that 
hospitality to customers is crucial he preaches it in person or via 
hightech satellite hookup with his stores 
walmart employees became known as associates under a company 
effort to prove it cared about employees partly to thwart a union 
organizing effort in the late 1960s 
one of the most sensitive subjects for him is the fortune hes 
amassed a close associate says sam would probably give anything 
not to be named on fortune magazines list of the countrys 
wealthiest people the magazine has estimated that his immediate 
familys stake in walmart stock is worth about 68 billion 
sam walton is more interested in his backhand than he is in his 
bank account says don shinkle walmart spokesman 
samuel moore walton turns 71 on march 29 he was born in 
kingfisher okla and grew up as the son of a farmmortgage banker 
he graduated the university of missouri with an economics degree 
in 1940 and joined jc penney co as a management trainee in des 
moines iowa after serving three years in the army he went to 
arkansas and opened a ben franklin fiveanddime store eventually 
becoming the companys biggest franchisee 
the seeds of the walmart empire were sown when sam and his 
brother james l or bud opened the first walmart discount city in 
1962 the rest will probably earn an entry in the history of us 
retail trade 
bud is a senior vice president and board member of walmart 
three of the four grown children sam and his wife helen had are 
involved with the company in various capacities 
sam hasnt slowed much enjoying hunting and tennis as much as 
ever and is said not to suffer after effects from a bout with 
leukemia now in remission he spends less time in the office since 
handing over most responsiblities to david glass sam is still 
chairman of the board 
glass doesnt hesitate when asked if walmart can flourish 
without sam the answer is an emphatic yes because we have great 
people he says the walton family will always be involved he 
adds 
commenting on the future glass says well be judged on what 
we produce today tomorrow what weve done in the past wont 
matter

the 1989 volkswagen jetta carat offers admirable german handling 
in a small package and at a competitive price 
here is a stable stalwart car that takes road curves with little 
sway here is a vehicle that zips along well and takes both city and 
highway driving in stride here is a compact auto with a spacious 
trunk and comfortable seats where the driver doesnt have to feel as 
if he or she is sitting low inside the car 
vw first brought the jetta to the united states in 1980 and 
although sales have fallen from their 1986 peak of 93000 the jetta 
continues to be vws best seller in the united states last years 
sales remained about flat with 1987s 65000 level said company 
spokesman jay amestoy 
the 1986 peak came after the jetta was redesigned with new 
engine suspension and chassis systems 
thankfully for todays buyers the 1989 vw jetta retains the fine 
characteristics of its predecessors even if it hasnt made the 
change outside to the fancier more aerodynamic body styling of some 
of the competitors honda accord mazda 626 
todays jetta line includes a base twodoor model which starts 
at 9690 the upscale carat and the performance gli 16valve 
version 
the test jetta carat pronounced with the accent on the last 
syllable not like the vegetable was wonderfully stable at high 
speeds the 18liter fourcylinder engine was mated with a 
fivespeed automatic transmission to produce 105 horsepower at 5400 
rpm 
the car cruised the highway well and seemed just as at home in 
citydriving maneuvers the two front seats had nifty height 
adjusters that helped position me so i could easily have a clear 
view over the front of the car a position i cant always find in 
other autos 
lots of equipment came standard including rear headrests power 
windows mirrors and antenna amfm stereo with cassette player and 
six speakers and a computer that figured fuel economy average 
driving speed etc 
the only option on the test car was the 395 manual sunroof and 
that really wasnt necessary since the car also had 
factoryinstalled air conditioning 
however vw is offering in 1989 for the first time antilock 
brakes 995 and while the test auto didnt have them they might 
be worth a good look given their remarkable ability to help 
maintain vehicle control 
the jettas trunk is one of the largest in its class with 166 
cubic feet of storage space the sturdy backing under the carats 
carpet make the trunk one of the easiest to keep neat theres no 
sliding or bunching of the carpet 
the jetta is built for five passengers but it could be pretty 
uncomfortable with three adults in the back seat the seats are 
sturdy for sure but there could be a tight squeeze and whoever has 
to sit in the middle will be sitting high up on a hard spot legroom 
also could be cramped 
my only other note was the difficulty i had at times in putting 
the car in the right gear the floor console for the automatic 
transmission had raised white letters for the gears but sometimes 
it was tough to tell if i was in neutral or drive drive or second 
that problem disappeared at night when the letters would light up as 
the car was put in gear 
jetta buyers are young with median age of 30 and median income 
of 43700 nearly half are male and 53 percent are married the 
vast majority have at least some college education and 61 percent 
are in upper white collar jobs amestoy said main purchase reasons 
include value for the money ease of handling and reliability and 
durability the company said 
consumer reports magazine says 198386 model jettas ranked better 
than average in owner reports of trouble

at 2015 a barrel 
andrew lebow a senior broker and analyst at edampf man 
international futures inc said rising gasoline prices lifted the 
entire energy market 
gasoline buying was triggered by news reports that the epa was 
likely to approve pending applications seeking to lessen 
pollutioncausing emissions from gasoline sold in northeastern 
states to cut smog in the region he said 
energy market analysts say the restrictions will make the 
refining process more costly and complicated and could lead to 
temporary shortages as refiners in the northeast make alterations to 
accomodate tighter rules 
speculation about how the proposed rules will affect gasoline 
supplies is expected to dominate the gasoline pits in the near 
future 
next weeks going to be very critical for the gasoline 
market lebow saidtheres potential for very explosive movement

preciousmetal values generally move in the opposite direction 
from the dollar so when the dollar began gaining strength against

the american suzuki motor corp has agreed to pay 
200000 to seven states and to include in future advertisements a 
warning that its samurai sport vehicle may roll over if turned too 
sharply 
the agreement announced thursday settles lawsuits filed by new 
york california massachusetts minnesota missouri texas and 
washington accusing the car manufacturer the us arm of japanese 
automaker suzuki of false and deceptive advertising it was 
effective tuesday 
american suzuki based in brea calif entered the agreement 
without admitting any guilt or safety problems the 200000 is to 
cover the states costs in preparing the cases 
the states began investigating the samurais safety last june 
after consumer reports magazine gave the popular fourwheeldrive 
sport utility vehicle its first not acceptable rating in 10 
years 
consumers union publisher of consumer reports said the 8500 
samurai is too short too narrow too light and its center of 
gravity is too high to be safe it was the first car of 349 tested 
in the last decade to roll over during a routine accidentavoidance 
test in which cars are made to swerve to avoid an obstacle in the 
road the group reported 
this agreement strongly affirms that the samurai is a safe 
vehicle and strongly supports the federal government decision that 
there is no reason to investigate the safety of the samurai n 
douglas mazza american suzukis vice president said in a statement 
consumers union of mount vernon had asked the national highway 
traffic safety administration to recall the more than 150000 
japanesebuilt samurais sold in this country since its introduction 
in november 1985 
the agency denied the recall petition in september saying the 
samurai had a rollover rate within the range of most other light 
utility vehicles it also said most rollovers were influenced by 
drinking low ambient light and lack or driver familiarity with 
either the vehicle or the road 
new york attorney general robert abrams said thursday that the 
states took action because the federal government has once again 
failed to act to protect the consumers of this country 
samurai print ads now must include the following statement 
this vehicle handles differently from ordinary passenger cars 
federal law cautions to avoid sharp turns and abrupt maneuvers which 
can cause vehicles of this type to roll over always wear your 
seatbelt for specific details please read your owners manual 
a shorter version of the statement is required for television and 
radio ads abrams said 
abrams said his investigation indicated previous suzuki ads 
deceived the public by promoting the samurai as a safe fun 
passenger vehicle while knowing itcan present considerable 
dangers to young inexperienced firsttime purchasers who were 
suzukis target buyers 
suzuki contended its advertising did not violate state laws but 
decided to agree to a settlement to avoid possible legal action by 
the states 
for suzuki and samurai owners this agreement with the 
attorneys general is the final chapter in a long story of false 
allegations about the samurai mazza said

its a sobering time for the north sea 
oil industry 
although business is good again after a deep slump experts say 
relatively weak oil prices and the piper alpha oil rig disaster last 
july have forced underwater drillers to change the way they do 
business 
once concerned about producing oil quickly the industry now is 
more worried about restraining costs and that has meant many lost 
jobs experts said 
the rig disaster a fire that killed 167 men halted a 
considerable amount of production 300000 barrels a day for about 
six months and increased safety concerns 
the industry has attracted many competitors with its 22 percent 
success rate in finding oil despite the technological problems 
associated with underwater drilling 
the rivalry has squeezed profits and encouraged takeovers 
leaving a smaller number of companies the most notable takeover was 
british petroleum co plcs 44 billion acquisition of britoil plc 
early last year 
adding to concerns is an awareness that the oil wont last 
forever and norways sector of the north sea is expected to surpass 
british production in a few years 
some companies have moved to protect themselves by getting more 
heavily into gas exploration and production selling their expertise 
abroad and broadening into defense and other nonoil areas 
its a different business were in said ian wood head of 
john wood group plc a scottish oilservices company 
the superboom is gone the 8687 downturn was a watershed 
the emphasis now is on cost 
britain is the noncommunist worlds sixth largest oil producer 
after saudi arabia the united states mexico iran and iraq 
figures compiled by the royal bank of scotland show 
thirtysix fields produced about 241 million barrels a day last 
year down 75 percent from the 1985 peak of 259 million barrels a 
day 
production is expected to decline to 222 million barrels a day 
this year 2 million by 1995 and expire in 30 to 50 years north 
sea oil was first produced in significant amounts in 1976 
it is scotlands largest single industry with 54000 workers 
down 18 percent from 1985 but 6 percent higher than during the 
slump the bank said 
currently i think business is very very good said derek 
marnoch chief executive of the aberdeen chamber of commerce 
oil prices plummeted from 30 a barrel to 10 a barrel in early 
1986 and have recovered to about 19 
the oil price shock came as quite a devastating blow in the 
industry said james walker an economist at the royal bank of 
scotland since then companies have moved on to a new expectation 
about oil prices and the potential of the north sea and have acted 
accordingly 
recently the organization of petroleum exporting countries has 
curbed production to bolster prices and independent producing 
countries have announced they are trimming exports 
britain belongs neither to opec nor the independent group but 
north sea oil production is vulnerable to opecs erratic behavior 
the north sea oil industry has cut costs by reducing manpower 
upgrading technology and undertaking smaller projects walker said 
still its more expensive to produce oil in the poor north sea 
conditions 3 to 15 a barrel vs less than 1 a barrel in the 
middle east walker said 
despite declining production and weak prices experts said oil 
exploration remains healthy 
industry enthusiasm was reflected in good demand for exploration 
leases in the governments recent sale 
last year was a record year for drilling with 21 new fields 
begun said angus nicolson a scottish development agency official 
ultimately we are looking at finite resources said ian 
henderson deputy managing director of shell uk exploration and 
production the challenge now is to find the smaller and smaller 
amounts and produce them cleverly 
even after cutting costs however its difficult to make a 
profit the experts said there are the usual complaints that the 
margins are thin marnoch said 
indeed henderson conceded that his companys net income has 
eroded but he declined to elaborate 
the piper alpha rig operated by occidental petroleum corp was 
owned by occidental and other oil companies and shell was not 
directly involved in the disaster but upgrading safety has 
increased its costs henderson said 
a public inquiry into the disaster might result in 
recommendations for costly safety measures for example the 
government already has asked the industry to comment on the 
possibility of requiring all operators to install emergency shutdown 
valves

two japanese players revving up for entry into the 
crowded field of 20000 to 40000 luxury cars in the united states 
are on a collision course with european makers for a share of the 
growing upscale segment 
as a result auto industry analysts predict some foreign 
competitors could get severely bruised in of one the most lucrative 
markets in the world 
neutral country attacks germany and japan says an 
advertising campaign recently started by saabscania of america 
inc fighting to keep the swedish automakers spot in the united 
states 
peugeot motors of america inc with its roots in france also is 
cranking up a new campaign and has offered dealers incentives they 
can pass to customers 
britains sterling motor cars meanwhile is restructuring its 
entire us marketing service and parts plan to slow a sales skid 
what we are seeing happen is that a lot of the european 
manufacturers who have taken their niche for granted have realized 
all of a sudden that its not a guarantee said autoindustry 
analyst jeannette garretty of the bank of america in san francisco 
the prevailing attitude has been is that there is a saab buyer a 
mercedes buyer who will always be there 
thats been changing 
us sales for 14 europeanmade cars last year were 164 percent 
behind 1987 levels led by audis 447 percent tumble and sterlings 
sales dip of 379 percent during the same time sales of all 
imported cars dropped 4 percent 
european cars made up 55 percent of the entire us car market 
in 1988 down from 68 percent the year before 
the fiercest competition promises to be among the expensive 
relatively lowvolume european imports including saab peugeot 
sterling bmw mercedesbenz volvo and audi some analysts wonder 
how those companies will fare in the scrap over the market pie 
we have dealers saying this is the most competitive time 
theyve ever faced said tony kirton director of marketing for 
audi of america inc they often say that but this time i believe 
them 
besides watching each other european makers are scrutinizing the 
latest wave in the japanese invasion of the united states car market 
toyotas lexus and nissans infiniti luxury car divisions 
each of the japanese automakers plan to begin selling two models 
this fall the lexus cars are expected to cost between 20000 and 
35000 infinitis prices will range from 25000 to around 40000 
that wedges them into the market now divvied up by volvo saab 
peugeot mercedesbenz bmw sterling and audi the japanese makers 
have said their target with infiniti and lexus principally is the 
european competition not the few us entries from general motors 
corps cadillac and fords lincolnmercury divisions 
i think they will get off to a pretty good start said auto 
analyst david healy of drexel burnham lambert inc of new york 
the names of the companies are known these guys have deep pockets 
and a lot of patience 
i think we can count on the fact that it will be a pretty good 
product he said 
saabs us president bob sinclair disagrees 
the japanese are moving upscale and thats a very significant 
move he said theyre reliable but theyre bland and look 
basically alike 
japans move into the luxury import segment challenging the 
europeans began in march 1986 with hondas acura division in 1988 
sales for the division rose 165 percent over the year before by 
volume acura sold more cars last year than did all european imports 
except volkswagen division spokesman mike spencer said honda is 
counting on acuras sales to increase 15 percent to 20 percent this 
model year 
automakers and analysts predict the luxuryperformance segment of 
the car market will grow during the next year partly reflecting the 
financial success of the babyboom generation nonetheless theres 
still concern whether it will grow enough for everybody to survive 
were really fortunate weve had a 3year head start in that 
segment spencer said 
acura will remain strong in the market garretty said because of 
established reputation its priced lower than most of the europeans 
and whats expected for lexus and infiniti acuras prices are more 
in line with saabs 
they saab do have reason to be concerned said analyst 
kathleen heaney of nikko securities co international inc of new 
york saab is more of a cult following people either love it or 
hate it she added saab is one of those companies which is 
stuck in no mans land 
healy agreed and wondered about the future of saab and peugeot 
in the united states peugeot has a much smaller us presence than 
saab selling about twothirds as many cars last year but its 
european automobile operations are stronger healy said 
so saab has decided to take off the gloves in its advertising in 
an attempt to make its name better known in the united states 
i think its the old story about the farmer with the mule 
first you have to get its attention sinclair said we thought 
we should throw bombs and hand grenades to get their attention

the government claimed thursday that defense 
lawyers said most jurors in the gaf corp criminal stock 
manipulation case favored conviction when a judge declared a 
mistrial because the panel was deadlocked 
defense attorneys immediately denied the claim attributed to them 
the gaf case drew wide attention as the first criminal trial 
arising from the confessions of imprisoned insider trader ivan 
boesky it was the second mistrial in the case and suggested 
prosecutors cannot easily win convictions but the government asked 
thursday for a third trial starting next month 
it wasnt clear when us district judge mary johnson lowe would 
set a new trial date for gaf and vice chairman james t sherwin 
as we understand it most jurors felt beyond a reasonable doubt 
that mr sherwin is guilty and were confident that they all will 
next time said assistant us attorney bruce baird who heads the 
securities and commodities fraud division 
we actually were told about the split by defense lawyers he 
said we were told that is what they learned 
but attorneys for sherwin and gaf a wayne njbased specialty 
chemicals maker said they had not spoken to jurors or indicated to 
prosectuors which way the jury was leaning 
no one from the defense made that statement to my knowledge 
because there would be no basis to make that statement said 
stephen kaufman an attorney for sherwin 
its speculation its surmise without any proof he said 
there is no public information and the jury issued a communication 
that they dont want to discuss the matter 
the jury said in a statement through lowe they would not comment 
on their more than 90 hours of deliberations that followed the 
sixweek trial jurors reached by telephone thursday stuck to their 
pledge 
the panel reported last saturday it was deadlocked 111 but did 
not indicate whether the majority favored acquittal or conviction 
on wednesday it reported a three way split some to acquit some to 
convict and others undecided 
the judge then asked whether further deliberations would be 
fruitful seven said no five said yes and lowe decreed the mistrial 
the original deadlock note of 11 to 1 did not indicate what the 
sentiments of the jury were said alan levine an attorney for 
sherwin they only thing that can be said for the next note is 
that it appears there was some kind of a shift 
but i think its still not possible to tell what the sentiments 
were saturday night or wednesday afternoon he said 
after the 111 note the defense asked lowe to declare a mistrial 
several times as the tiring deliberations progressed 
lowe also declared a mistrial in january after ruling that the 
government unintentionally withheld evidence at that time jurors 
on the first panel said they could not have convicted gaf based on 
the testimony 
gaf two subsidiaries and sherwin were charged last year with 
allegedly trying to boost the stock price of union carbide corp in 
1986 shortly before selling a large block of shares they also were 
charged with securities fraud wire fraud and conspiracy 
the purpose of the alleged deal was to maximize gafs profits 
from the planned sale of a large block of union carbide stock after 
a failed takeover of the much larger chemical concern 
the second mistrial was perceived as a setback in the 
governments efforts to stage criminal trials in a wall street fraud 
investigation that began with the insider trading scandals of the 
mid1980s 
its always disappointing when all 12 jurors dont accept the 
governments case baird said as long as were confident in the 
strength of our cases and confident that most jurors saw the case as 
the government saw it well try it again

if you think corporate takeover battles are like 
the wild west you might say polaroid corp circled the wagons to 
repel a 32 billion assault from investor roy e disney 
after disneys shamrock holdings inc announced its bid eight 
months ago polaroid methodically placed stock in friendly hands in 
preparation for its annual meeting using an employee stock 
ownership plan a share repurchase program and the sale of shares to 
a sympathetic third party 
polaroids moves were upheld by delaware state courts and this 
past week shamrock said it was selling its 496 million polaroid 
shares back to the instant photography pioneer under the repurchase 
plan however the disney group would not say whether it was 
abandoning its bid 
it seems to have worked said eugene glazer an analyst who 
follows polaroid for dean witter reynolds inc of the strategy 
designed to garner enough support to prevent shamrock from unseating 
polaroids board at the annual meeting 
an estimated onethird of polaroids voting stock is held by 
company allies making it difficult for shamrock to win the majority 
it would need in a shareholder proxy fight 
moreover the polaroid strategy likely ensures that shamrock 
would fail through a tender offer to shareholders under state law 
in delaware where polaroid is incorporated a suitor would have 
to acquire 85 percent of polaroids stock or wait three years to 
complete the merger 
polaroids strategy has intrigued observers 
other companies that are incorporated in delaware are going to 
look extremely carefully at the actions polaroid has taken as a 
guideline for how to defend yourself against an unfriendly 
acquirer glazer said 
in upholding polaroids moves the delaware court of chancery 
disagreed with shamrocks contention that the employee stock 
ownership plan 11 billion stock buyback and sale of 300 million 
in preferred shares to corporate partners lp were intended primarily 
as takeover defenses 
despite that ruling the fact remains that these steps constitute 
a powerful shield against a hostile bid 
most employee stock ownership plans or esops arent created as 
takeover defenses but as a way for companies to raise cash they 
also are useful when a company is acquired by employees avis inc 
was taken private through an esop in 1987 
many companies like them the national center for employee 
ownership a research organiation estimates there are 9500 esops 
covering nearly 10 million workers in the united states 
lawyer todd lang who has drafted esops says stock ownership 
tends to keep your employees interested in the profitability and 
productivity of the company and interested in the stock price 
but when jc penney co inc created a 700 million esop last 
summer and procter amp gamble co upped its employees stake to 20 
percent from 14 percent earlier this year analysts said these were 
defensive steps 
analysts made the same judgment when polaroid unveiled its esop 
on july 12 1988 the company had already received overtures from 
shamrock although the disney group did not announce its bid 
publicly for another eight days 
esops bind workers closer to their employers and managers 
fighting a takeover battle expect employees to stand with them when 
the workers vote their stock at a shareholders meeting 
the theory is the employees always vote along with management 
and their jobs said lang noting that workers fear layoffs in a 
hostile takeover 
theres little doubt how polaroid employees would vote they 
signed petitions and held demonstrations against a shamrock takeover 
but in the course of the polaroidshamrock battle a possible 
wrinkle emerged in esops that could complicate their use as a 
takeover defense theres no guarantee that all the stock in a plan 
will be voted according to employees wishes 
under polaroids esop a trustee votes the shares held by 
individual employees according to their instructions shares issued 
to the plan but not held by individual employees known as 
unallocated shares are to be voted in the same proportion as 
allocated shares reflecting the employees sentiment 
the problem is with the unallocated shares 
the labor department which has jurisdiction over esops under 
the employee retirement income security act told the trustee of 
the polaroid esop citizens and southern trust co of atlanta it 
was not bound by the plans provisions and could decide for itself 
how to vote the unallocated shares 
the letter was not binding on the trustee however noted 
attorney lang an expert agency is usually given high credence 
when they interpret their own statutes and the letter could be 
given weight in a court decision 
but corey rosen executive director of the national center for 
employee ownership doubted that if the departments stand were 
tested in court and upheld it could survive the subsequent public 
outcry 
it would be a situation where employees are forced to sell a 
company they dont want to he said 
rosen said the labor department was looking at the employees as 
shareholders seeking the maximum value for their stock instead of 
workers concerned about their jobs 
citizens and southern refused to discuss the issue or how it 
might vote the unallocated shares which account for 90 percent of 
the esop the entire plan holds nearly 14 percent of polaroids 
stock 
but polaroid wasnt relying solely on its employees for support 
it was certain to have the votes of corporate partners a 
partnership formed to help companies block hostile takeover 
attempts polaroid is paying as much as 11 percent annual dividends 
to corporate partners and placed two members of the partnership on 
its board 
selling stock to a white sheik a party who will support a 
company against a hostile suitor is not new but some companies 
have learned the hard way that the ploy can have undesirable 
repercusssions 
in 1984 chriscraft industries inc helped warner communications 
inc avoid an unwanted bid from publisher rupert murdoch by becoming 
warners largest stockholder warner chairman steven ross has had 
reason to regret the move he and chriscraft chairman herbert 
siegel have been bickering ever since 
the third part of polaroids defense the stock buyback has been 
used by many companies seeking to protect themselves even if theyre 
not facing a takeover threat by having fewer vulnerable shares on 
the market 
general motors corp ryder system inc borden inc and tenneco 
inc are among companies that recently have repurchased stock 
in the fall of 1987 retailer dayton hudson corp was the target 
of a hostile bid from dart group corp then on oct 19 the stock 
market collapsed taking with it darts bid 
dayton hudson wasted no time it immediately started buying back 
15 million shares

eastern airlines moved against its

court to force them back to work while announcing that the company 
will begin to train replacements soon 
a threejudge panel of the 11th circuit court of appeals in

hourlong hearing eastern asked the judges to overturn a lower 
court ruling permitting the pilots to honor striking machinists 
picket lines under the railway labor act 
the question is whether the rla expressly forbids a sympathy 
strike said judge r lanier anderson iii that is the issue 
before us 
in new york on thursday federal bankruptcy court judge burton 
lifland said he would appoint an examiner to oversee eastern during 
its reorganization under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws in a 
move described as unusual by bankruptcy attorneys lifland said the 
asyetunnamed examiner would be given the power to try to mediate 
between eastern and its creditors and employees as well as gather 
information 
in the federal appeals court eastern attorney david ross told 
the judges that because the air line pilots association was 
negotiating a new contract with eastern they could not strike for 
any reason 
the railway labor act says you cannot strike in support of your 
collective bargaining goals until you have exhausted all of the 
procedures of that act and there is no dispute those procedures 
have not been exhausted he told reporters afterward 
but jim lindsey who represented alpa argued that the pilots 
have the right to stage a sympathy strike and that the federal 
courts dont have the authority to define what a sympathy strike is 
congress took that right away from the judicial branch in 1932 
lindsey said 
lindsey said he thought the judges might rule sometime next week 
in miami eastern spokesman robin matell said that despite alpas 
contention the carrier could not find qualified pilots to replace 
strikers training for the first group of replacements was about to 
start 
were hiring no question about it matell said the first 
class starts on monday and that will have 30 or 40 people in it 
these are people who have been interviewed and passed the 
examination 
in addition he said eastern has received into the thousands 
of phone calls in response to its ads seeking new pilots which 
began running sunday 
ron cole spokesman for easterns alpa pilots dismissed the 
hirings as unimportant saying many pilots meet federal aviation 
administration requirements but arent ready to work at a commercial 
airline 
this is a situation that the faa is going to have to keep a 
close eye on he said 
eastern has been getting about 115 flights a day aloft recently 
said another spokewoman karen ceremsak and the new pilots will 
increase that number before the strike the company had more than 
1000 flights a day 
after the bankruptcy court hearing in new york both eastern and 
the pilots union said they agreed with the judges decision to 
appoint an examiner with power to act as a mediator 
eastern had asked lifland to appoint an examiner to review all 
transactions between eastern and affiliated airlines during 
bankruptcy proceedings the unions have asked the bankruptcy court 
to appoint a trustee a more powerful official who actually would 
run the airline during its bankruptcy reorganization 
lifland indicated his appointment of an examiner did not 
necessarily mean he would not consider naming a trustee later he 
said he would ask the examiner to take on more than just 
factfinding duties in the hopes the examiner could mediate 
differences between the embattled company and its unions and other 
creditors 
it sounds like a trustee not an examiner said farrell 
kupersmith chief financial adviser to the pilots union 
but eastern president phil bakes also expressed no problems with 
the judges decision saying we wish we had thought of it

the government said thursday it will soon 
renew payments on ecuadors 11 billion foreign debt after a more 
than twoyear suspension 
within the process of negotiations with private foreign banks 
and after a 26month suspension of interest payments ecuador will 
make modest and partial installments this year government 
spokesman washington herrera said 
herrera declined to give further details but the central bank 
said payments are expected to be resumed in the coming weeks 
the small andean country has balked at repayments since the start 
of a financial crisis incited by a major earthquake in march 1987 
which ruptured a key oil pipeline and paralyzed the petroleum export 
industry for six months until line could be repaired 
during the year previous the economy suffered by drastically 
declining world oil prices ecuador depends on oil sales for more 
than 60 percent of its foreign exchange 
president rodrigo borja called for renegotiations with foreign 
creditors shortly after he took office in august 1988 and talks 
began earlier this year 
the congress has allotted 500 million for debt payments in this 
years budget

the handful of companies involved in nuclear 
fusion research arent expecting any profit windfall as a result of 
an advance claimed thursday by researchers in salt lake city 
fusion plants built by private industry will some day provide 
clean safe and inexpensive power but in spite of the announcement 
that day remains several decades off company officials said in 
interviews 
two researchers said thursday they produced controlled nuclear 
fusion using high schoollevel chemistry that could lead to a 
technology capable of driving electrical generators within a few 
years 
b stanley pons of the university of utah and martin fleischmann 
of the university of southhampton in england cautioned that more 
research is needed to determine whether the process will work on a 
large scale 
officials in the tiny private sector of the nuclear fusion 
business said they wanted to learn more about the work but that 
even in the best of circumstances it would only be a first step 
we thought that during the 1980s fusion would be going into 
engineering development that would require the private sector that 
would have happened but the energy crisis went away and the 
reagan administration cut spending said stephen o dean president 
of fusion power associates of gaithersburg md 
fusion power associates was formed in 1979 as a group of private 
companies and organizations involved in fusion work 
weve sort of been in a holding pattern waiting for better 
times in terms of government policies dean said we need a 
commitment to engineering development we dont see how that can be 
done in private industry 
only two companies are gathering substantial revenue from nuclear 
fusion and in both cases the money comes entirely from government 
funding he said 
general atomics a privately held company in san diego calif 
has a 30 millionayear contract to operate an experimental 
magneticconfinement fusion device it has other government 
contracts worth 5 million to 6 million a year 
kms fusion inc of ann arbor mich makes fuel capsules that are 
used as the targets of experimental laserconfinement fusion 
reactors the company is the only private company receiving 
department of energy funding for laser fusion research its funding 
is less than general atomics dean said

centaur partners ended its monthslong 
hostile takeover attempt of pennwalt corp thursday announcing it 
was dropping its 110pershare offer 
the withdrawal comes three days after the chemical company 
announced it will accept a 132pershare offer from the french 
governmentcontrolled oil and chemical concern societe nationale elf 
aquitaine based on the number of pennwalts outstanding shares 8 
million elf aquitaines offer amounts to more than 1 billion 
centaurs announcement coincided with elf aquitaines formal 
commencement of the offer 
centaur which owns about 13 percent of pennwalts stock dropped 
the offer because of the elf aquitaine development the new 
yorkbased investment group said in a statement no officials were 
available thursday evening to comment on the decision said centaur 
spokesman james d daniels 
pennwalt had fought centaur since the investment group first made 
its plans known last june 
during the fight pennwalt sold off a pharmaceutical division and 
most of its equipment business the company also went to court to 
stop centaur from calling a shareholders meeting where the 
investment group hoped to replace the directors paving the way for 
the takeover bid to succeed 
pennwalts chairman edwin e tuttle maintained throughout the 
takeover bid that the company believed centaur never actually wanted 
to acquire the company but merely wanted to drive up the stock 
prices 
centaur does indeed stand to make a profit the investment 
group headed by abbey butler and melvin estrin began buying 
pennwalt stock in june when the price was 65 a share 
it is estimated that centaurs stock will bring the investors 
more than 60 million 
i cant imagine centaurs principals are too upset said 
don pattison an analyst with cj lawrence morgan grenfell in new 
york even if they were sincere about wanting to run the company 
a profit like that can certainly soften the disappointment 
pennwalt spokeswoman sue kinard could not be reached for comment 
but elf aquitaines spokesman walter montgomery said theres not 
much to comment on this doesnt change elfs position 
pennwalts stock closed unchanged at 13025 thursday in 
consolidated new york stock exchange trading the stocks price 
jumped 1312 about 11 percent to 13012 when elf aquitaines 
offer was made public monday

columbia college students and unions supporting 
the striking machinists at eastern airlines on thursday called on 
the college to withdraw a top alumni award to frank lorenzo 
chairman of the embattled airline 
some 300 students and supporters of the striking airline 
employees chanted union busting is disgusting as they gathered 
in front of low library on the columbia campus where lorenzo and 
five other prominent alumni were to have received the john jay award 
at a dinner thursday night 
the college an undergraduate school at columbia university 
scrapped plans for the annual dinner last week because according to 
a statement the atmosphere would have been marred by the current 
emotional climate in the labor dispute between eastern airlines and 
its machinists union 
fred knubel a college spokesman when asked thursday if the 
school would withdraw lorenzos award pointed to a sentence in last 
fridays statement which read the board of directors of the 
columbia college alumni association will decide on its next steps 
at its fall meeting 
the john jay award is given to prominent alumni for their 
achievements and service to the college 
dan ashby a spokesman for the airline pilots association told 
the protesters we are here tonight because we are outraged that 
the president and board of trustees of columbia have chosen to honor 
francisco lorenzo at a time when he is destroying eastern airlines 
and the lives of its 30000 employees 
knubel said the college would have no comment on the rally and 
the petition 
also attending the was leroy washington spokesman for the 
international association of machinists other unions represented 
were the transport workers union district 65 united auto workers 
and local 1199 retail wholesale and department store workers

holly farms corp directors have rejected 
the latest buyout offer from rival poultry processor tyson foods 
inc saying there is no way to ensure the 118 billion bid was 
sound holly farms said thursday 
wednesdays rejection of the 6350ashare offer came the same 
day that a chancery court judge in delaware gave holly farms 
permission to ask its shareholders on april 14 to approve a friendly 
merger with conagra inc of omaha neb 
but judge maurice hartnett said no merger would be allowed until 
legal questions surrounding the proposal were settled 
the conagraholly merger would be accomplished through a stock 
swap valued at 5925 a share or about 1 billion while tysons 
118 billion offer is for cash 
the struggle to acquire holly farms a diversified memphis 
company heavily dependant on fresh fryer sales began last october 
a takeover by tyson foods would permit the springdale ark company 
to keep its standing as the nations largest poultry processor 
one of the main snags in the merger proposal announced last year 
by holly farms and conagra is a lockup option that would permit 
conagra to buy prime holly assets should their proposed merger fall 
through 
hartnett has yet to rule on the validity of that agreement which 
tyson claims was designed to make holly farms unattractive to any 
buyer other than conagra 
tysons buyout offer is contingent on dissolution of the lockup 
which is why holly farms rejected it holly farms said in a 
statement 
until tyson removes from its tender offer the asset option 
condition holly farms stockholders can have no assurance that 
tysons 6350 price represents deliverable value the statement 
said 
john tyson son of tyson president don tyson said the holly 
farms rejection was about as anticipated 
tyson foods is filing proxy materials with the securities and 
exchange commission and hopes to get it to holly stockholders 
sometime next week john tyson said

a british and an american scientist said 
thursday they have produced controlled nuclear fusion using basic 
chemistry that could lead to a technology capable of driving 
electrical generators within a few years 
what we have done is opened the door of a new research area 
said martin fleischmann of southampton university in england our 
indications are that the discovery will be relatively easy to make 
into a usable technology for generating heat and power 
nuclear fusion the power that fuels the sun is regarded as 
sciences next great frontier in developing new sources of energy 
but has generally been considered to be years away from commercial 
exploitation it differs from conventional processes in that it 
fuses atoms rather than splits them and generates little 
radioactive waste 
fleischmann and b stanley pons chairman of the university of 
utahs chemistry department said at a news conference here that in 
laboratory tests their coldtemperature electrochemical process 
has produced a surplus of energy for periods of up to 100 hours 
however the researchers cautioned that more research is needed 
to determine whether the process will work on a large scale 
we dont know what the implications are the science base has 
to be established as widely as possible to challenge our findings 
fleischmann said but it does seem there is a possibility of 
realizing sustained fusion in a relatively simple device 
if the technology is practical on a large scale it would provide 
a safe relatively clean and virtually inexhaustible energy source 
other nuclear scientists said the experiment will have to be 
duplicated independently before the findings of pons and fleischmann 
can be accepted 
people are pushing coldtemperature nuclear fusion quite 
vigorously these days like any science this claim has to be 
reproducible if it is indeed there it is quite a discovery said 
chan choi a fusion researcher at purdue universitys school of 
nuclear engineering 
pons said that in the process an electrical current is used to 
drive nuclear particles through a lattice of palladium and platinum 
electrodes forcing positively charged particles to fuse together 
and create a new atom 
unlike more traditional fusion techniques which require 
tremendous heat and are therefore very expensive the 
electrochemical process is carried out at room temperature in a 
fragile glass flask 
scientists have sought a practical application of fusion for 
about 35 years existing nuclear reactors are powered by nuclear 
fission 
pons said the amount of deuterium the source of the deuteron 
particles used in the process contained in one cubic foot of 
seawater could produce as much energy as 10 tons of coal 
pons said he and fleischmann had developed the technique after 5 
years of research and financed it with about 100000 of their own 
money they conceived of the idea while hiking in a canyon east of 
salt lake city and conducted their first experiment on pons kitchen 
stan and i thought the experiment was so stupid we financed it 
ourselves fleischmann said if you scale it up we could burn 
up a few million 
fleischmann said the research has been submitted to a scientific 
journal which he declined to name if accepted it would be 
published in may he said 
the pair now are seeking a grant from the federal department of 
energy to continue their research university of utah president 
chase peterson said the school has applied for patents to cover the 
techniques in the united states and internationally 
everything we know about it says it ought to have commercial 
application he said 
purdues chan said most coldfusion research involves using a 
subatomic particle as a catalyst to start the fusion reaction while 
the main thrust of fusion research has involved heating particles to 
superhot temperatures of more than 1 million degrees while 
simultaneously compressing them 
the low temperature is quite a departure from the norm if the 
research is correct thats quite an achievement he said 
to create fusion scientists must prevent positive ions from 
repelling one another so that they can fuse together richard l 
morse a professor of physics and nuclear engineering at the 
university of arizona said this can be done by accelerating them to 
a high velocity by heating them or by using a particle accelerator 
or by blocking out the positive trait 
cold fusion he said attempts to block the natural repulsion 
id be a little skeptical that anything of economic value could 
be achieved this way morse said some of the limitations are 
pretty fundamental
