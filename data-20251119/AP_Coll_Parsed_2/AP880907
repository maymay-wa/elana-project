republican george bush criticized democrat michael dukakis 
before a jewish group wednesday as having trouble making up his 
mind on whether to support or oppose creation of a palestinian 
state but dukakis told the same group he would never recognize a 
unilateral declaration of a palestinian state or government in 
exile 
bush and dukakis were speaking to a bnai brith convention in 
baltimore 
the vice president was the first to address the jewish group and 
he underscored the closeness of usisrael relations 
no threat no stone thrown is strong enough to divide us no 
wedge will be driven between us bush pledged 
bush declared his opposition to creation of an independent 
palestinian state in the middle east and criticized dukakis 
although he didnt mention him by name 
my administration would not support the creation of any 
palestinian entity that would jeopardize the security of our 
strategic ally israel he said 
anyone who has trouble making up his mind on this issue or 
who proposes to leave it open just doesnt understand the dangers 
to israel and to the united states just doesnt understand the 
very real threats that continue to exist added bush 
dukakis has said the question of a palestinian state should be a 
matter of negotiations between israel and its neighbors 
dukakis pledged support for israel and said republican vice 
presidential nominee dan quayle has voted repeatedly against 
foreign assistance to israel 
we will not sell weapons that would threaten the security of 
israel to any nation he said 
the republicans have sold awacs planes to saudi arabia 
mavericks missiles to kuwait stingers missiles to bahrain and 
billions of additional dollars worth of sophisticated arms to arab 
countries that refuse to make peace with israel dukakis said 
george bush has supported those sales and dan quayle has 
voted for them lloyd bentsen and i are going to say no to arab 
shopping lists that endanger the security of israel he said 
in a break with the reagan administration on the domestic front 
bush told knightridder newspapers wednesday he will soon outline a 
proposal calling for some adjustment in the minimum wage 
the administration opposes raising the minimum wage which is 
now 335 an hour but campaign sources told knightridder that 
bush was expected to link a raise in the minimum wage to a 
subminimum wage training differential for teenagers and other 
new hires congress has opposed such a differential in the past 
we ought to maintain a minimum wage differential for training 
people bush said bush has been criticized by his opponents as 
insensitive to the needs of working people 
the vice president received encouraging news from the latest abc 
newswashington post poll which found bush leading dukakis by an 
eightpoint margin 
the survey of 1104 likely voters found that 51 percent favored 
bush while 43 percent prefer dukakis the poll conducted aug 31 
to sept 6 had a margin of error of 35 percent 
an another front however the bush campaign ran into a public 
relations problem because of a second record linking the public 
relations and lobbying activities of bush campaign members with 
governments with drug connections 
nbc and cbs reported wednesday that campaign manager lee 
atwater senior adviser charles black and scheduler paul j 
manafort were parties in the lobbying firm of black manafort amp 
stone which was paid 800000 to represent the bahamian government 
in 1985 
the proposed contract with the government of prime minister 
lynden pindling mentioned that in fact the drug enforcement 
agency and the department of treasury could be viewed as active 
critics of pindling administration policy 
the emphasis of the lobbying plan should be a mixture of 
executive branch concentration and congressional lobbying the 
proposal said noting connections within the state department and 
with thenattorney general edwin meese iii 
bush at the time was spearheading a drugenforcement effort that 
included investigations of pindling a report last week linked bush 
aide stuart spencer with lobbying efforts on behalf of panamanian 
leader manuel antonio noriega 
bush caused a momentary stir at an american legion convention in 
louisville ky when he mistakenly referred to the day as the 
anniversary of the japanese attack on pearl harbor 
i wonder how many remember today is pearl harbor day bush 
told the veterans fortyseven years ago to this day we were hit 
and hit hard at pearl harbor and we were not ready 
he went on but then alerted by the murmuring among the 6000 
veterans in the audience bush abruptly stopped and said 
did i say sept 7 sorry about that 
the attack was on dec 7 1941 
bush said dukakis would cancel and delay our strategic 
modernization with what amounts to an undeclared unilateral 
freeze 
democratic presidential nominee dukakis spoke at kean college in 
union nj and asked where was george bush while his 
administration was doing its best to slam the door of college 
opportunity in the face of millions of young people across this 
country 
george was right there all the time said dukakis not 
doing and not saying a thing 
the massachusetts governor said he and his running mate lloyd 
bentsen are going to stop the assault on college loans and 
grants and were going to stop it cold 
dukakis described his own proposal under which the federal 
government would guarantee bank loans to college students with 
repayment based on a percentage of future earnings and extending 
over a persons working life 
bush has proposed allowing parents to earn interest taxfree on 
us savings bonds to help pay for college but he has not 
suggested any overhaul of the loan program 
but the reagan administration has already launched a small 
experimental incomecontingent loan program with repayments pegged 
to students income in later life the democratic controlled 
congress balked last year at a major expansion of the program now 
being tried at 10 campuses 
bentsen and republican vice presidential nominee dan quayle 
tended to senate business

only a few birds are chirping at 830 
am when the sounds of a tchaikovsky piano concerto fill the woods 
of this northern michigan town 
the world youth symphony is rehearsing for an upcoming 
performance the music flows with deceiving precision one could be 
listening to a symphony orchestra not a collection of high school 
musicians at summer camp 
but this is anything but an ordinary summer camp 
this place is a paradox because the natural aspect is serene 
but serene is hardly the word to describe the activity here its 
crazy said ray wilkins chairman of the camps visual arts 
department 
the national music camp the 61st edition of which ended in 
august attracts 2100 campers from third grade through high 
school they come from all 50 states and 26 foreign countries to 
spend a summer of intensive study in music dance drama and the 
visual arts 
many campers already are accomplished in their chosen field 
they come to hone their skills at the camp which is spread over 
1200 acres and has about 450 buildings the camperstaff ratio is 
almost two to one and private lessons are available for those who 
want them 
these are bright kids and many of them are extremely 
wellequipped for a career in the arts said tom oosting 
director of the camps theater program 
with such a collection of talent competition among campers can 
get intense 
people come to the national music camp to see how they stack 
up said edward downing the camps director a lot of big 
decisions can be made during the summer as young people decide on a 
possible career in the arts 
perhaps the most intense competition occurs every friday when 
violinists in the world youth symphony challenge each other for the 
right to sit in the first chair the competition is known as 
bloody friday 
there are people who take it too seriously but competition 
has always been a part of being here downing said we like to 
think its friendly competition and we try to keep it that way 
its an opportunity for the camper to show how he or she has 
progressed not necessarily to beat the next person ahead of you 
despite the emphasis on the arts campers enjoy their free time 
like others their age many boys and girls like to find a secluded 
spot in the evening to talk quietly 
george wolff a high school student from warren mich said 
some campers like to play classical music but never would listen to 
it on their own its kind of humorous he said people will 
play mozart and beethoven then come back to their cabin and listen 
to a led zeppelin cassette 
the camps scenic location is a main reason youngsters get so 
much out of the program 
this place is absolutely conducive to clearing your mind and 
focusing on your work oosting said you need blue skies and 
varied visual stimuli 
the camp which was founded in 1927 also does its best to make 
sure the kids are kept busy campers in the theater department can 
be involved in up to three plays at one time 
however said oosting the theater program can be daunting 
rehearsal time is limited because the camps activities are 
structured in 50minute periods 
most gilbert and sullivan operettas are 2 hours long but are 
rehearsed and staged here in 50minute periods he said in 
most cases until the actual performance its probably never been 
run through from beginning to end 
campers belie their youth in terms of dedication to their 
specialty at night it is not unusual to hear the sounds of a 
violin or horn coming from cabins as campers practice on their own 
during the day the youth bustle from one class to the next 
walking quickly with a clear sense of purpose 
wolff said he would like to become an opera singer a career 
goal shared by few of his peers 
when i was 14 and listening to opera it was hard for some 
people to handle he said but i dont limit myself to 
listening to just opera i listen to all kinds of music 
the rules at the camp can be interpreted as strict all campers 
are required to wear a uniform blue corduroy pants for boys and 
knickers for girls and blue shirts for all campers from third 
through ninth grade are not allowed to leave the grounds during the 
eightweek session high schoolers are permitted to leave only with 
their parents or other preapproved adults 
yeah sometimes the rules get out of hand but its really 
trivial compared with what youre learning wolff said

faced with the prospect of losing the 
grain farm that has been in their family for most of this century 
seven members of the richard kurth family turned to a new cash crop 
marijuana 
that decision discovered in a drug bust last fall has turned 
many in this farm town of 1700 against the kurths some see no end 
to the controversy particularly after most of the family received 
reduced sentences 
i dont believe they will ever be able to live in the 
community again said joan stewart editor of the river press 
newspaper its never going to be forgotten 
yet some of the kurths say all they want to do is remain on the 
4500acre farm and cattle feedlot which still faces foreclosure 
im not going to let a community shove me out said cindy 
halley daughter of richard kurth the family patriarch 
its not just the familys action that has upset fort benton 
about 960 valid signatures far more than the 549 needed have been 
gathered on a petition to recall chouteau county prosecutor tom 
sheehy over the way the case was handled 
this type of prosecution will only encourage more drug 
traffic says the petition which expresses concern over plea 
bargaining and notes the kurths were not required to post bond 
this prominent family has never paid a cent of bail they 
werent brought in complained winnie appleby who runs a local 
motel 
dr william gertson heading the recall effort said people 
wanted sheehy to turn the case over to federal prosecutors 
because we felt like he was inexperienced and we felt like he was 
so liberal that nothing would happen 
the prosecutor who is suing to invalidate the recall petitions 
defended the plea bargains that resulted in convictions of richard 
kurth and his wife judy both 57 and five others 
guilty is guilty sheehy said 
he noted that district judge chan ettien released the family 
members on their own recognizance and reduced sentences that sheehy 
recommended 
richard kurth received four concurrent 20year sentences with 
all but five years suspended while his wife received a fiveyear 
sentence with all but one year suspended both could be out in less 
than a year with good behavior sentences for the others were 
suspended altogether or deferred 
ettien struck a nerve with his courtroom comment that the social 
ill from marijuana use does not approach that of alcohol 
the judge who declined to elaborate wrote in his sentencing 
order that except for one criminal offense the kurths had been 
an exemplary group 
some people in town agree howard axtman who sells farm 
equipment and had two kurth children in his boy scout troop said 
im not a supporter of what they did i dont think anyone is 
but they were good people 
up to a point they were typical people too 
most farmers in montana have suffered years of drought and low 
prices for grain 
but in 1985 richard and judy kurth decided that to pay their 
debts they would grow marijuana they have said the decision 
stemmed from an offhand remark made by an officer of norwest bank 
in great falls 
perhaps in jest perhaps not the bank officer suggested 
they could save their ranch only by growing an illegal cash crop 
of some sort perhaps marijuana defense lawyer ralph randono 
said at the couples sentencing 
he contended the bank was very aware of what the kurths were 
doing 
frank shaw president of the bank termed the comments 
preposterous and total fabrications 
after beginning the operation the couple decided to recruit 
their adult children all three agreed along with two of their 
spouses son bill kurths wife lisa was not involved authorities 
said 
kind of the way i took it was either you hop on the bandwagon 
and help out or i guess you can just go down the road and find 
another job said soninlaw clay halley because it was either 
do this and save the ranch or there wasnt going to be any ranch 
in nearly two years authorities say the family sold 400000 
worth of marijuana 
in addition to the sentences the state is seeking 750000 in 
taxes and interest based on the estimated value of the 2155 
marijuana plants seized in last octobers raid 
family members had a lot to learn about growing marijuana they 
said in a recent interview first they went to libraries and 
bookstores they also received advice from customers lost some 
crops and learned from mistakes 
just like anything else in agriculture you try it and if it 
doesnt work you change it and try it again clay halley said 
hired men and customers came and went at the farm 14 miles 
south of fort benton without knowing marijuana was being grown and 
dried in four separate buildings with automatic watering and 
lighting systems windows and doors in those buildings were locked 
and covered 
even sheriffs deputies serving papers involving the kurths 
debts had no reason to suspect anything said undersheriff doug 
williams 
the loan agreement showed norwest bank had agreed to forgive the 
kurths 13 million loan if they paid 275000 they paid 125000 
and hoped to make the final payments by april 1988 then 
restructure their debts with the federal land bank save the farm 
and stop growing marijuana 
our objective was to not continue this thing over two years 
and when we got done in two years to still have a ranch said 
son doug kurth 
just 5 months before the last loan payment was due federal and 
county law officers arrived at the kurth property after receiving 
a tip 
the kurths say they were actually relieved to see law officers 
pull up on oct 18 two days earlier men posing as drug 
enforcement administration agents had attempted a robbery the 
following day they had received a 25000 extortion demand 
but they have since had to face their own young children deal 
with publicity and withstand the continued scrutiny of their 
neighbors and the townspeople 
the familys clothing cars travel and entertainment are often 
discussed and many people maintain the kurths could have altered a 
lifestyle described as highflying if they had truly wanted to 
get out of debt 
they lived so much higher than people who were in debt said 
gertson they were flashy in their dress flashy in their way of 
living 
and editor stewart said of richard kurth his lifestyle is not 
poor farmer and never has been 
doug kurth and his wife rhonda and the halleys say such talk 
is a price they pay for living in a small town despite it all the 
two families want to remain 
doug summed up the message hed like to convey to the community 
saying hey its over with were paying our debt to society 
leave us alone

human rights leaders and jews are 
hailing a new law that imposes fines or jail sentences on anyone 
convicted of discrimination based on race religion or sex 
they call it a significant advance in the protection of civil 
liberties in argentina 
we think the law has extraordinary social and political 
significance for argentine society said david goldberg 
president of the delegation of argentine israelite associations 
there was a gap in previous legislation in that there was no 
penalty for those who did discriminate said goldberg a medical 
doctor whose organization is the largest of several that represent 
the estimated 400000 jews in this south american country 
simon lazara a socialist congressman and a leader of the 
permanent assembly for human rights said the law is not solely 
aimed at antisemitism but also at discrimination based on color 
or creed or against the native indian communities 
the legislation was introduced early in 1984 by president raul 
alfonsin who cofounded and ran the permanent assembly for human 
rights before he was elected to office in october 1983 his 
inauguration seven weeks later ended a harsh nearly eightyear 
military dictatorship 
as reworked and finally approved by congress in august the new 
law penalizes anyone who arbitrarily blocks obstructs or 
restricts the full exercise of fundamental rights and 
guarantees 
argentinas constitution of 1853 as amended protects the right 
to assembly universal suffrage and freedom of speech and worship 
although roman catholicism is the countrys official religion and 
only catholics can hold the nations presidency and vice presidency 
the law punishes by jail up to three years anyone convicted of 
belonging to an organization that promotes the superiority of one 
race or color or creed over another 
anyone convicted of a crime or offense committed in 
persecution or hatred of a race religion or nationality or with 
the intent to destroy a national ethnic racial or religious 
group could be sentenced to additional fines or prison 
the law also requires restitution in cases of property damage 
overall the new law constitutes a vision of the new democracy 
in argentina reflecting the conditions that have existed since the 
end of the last military dictatorship lazara said 
argentinas centuryold tradition of democracy has been 
tarnished by six military interventions since 1930 including coups 
that ousted gen juan d peron in 1955 two civilian presidents in 
the 1960s and perons wife isabel in 1976 
more than 9000 argentines most of them sons and daughters of 
the middle class disappeared and are presumed dead following 
their arrests in the late 1970s by security forces trying to crush 
the montonero urban guerrillas and leftist political opposition in 
general 
discrimination usually is not overt but it is pervasive darker 
skinned argentines of indian descent while not barred from 
whitecollar jobs more commonly are manual laborers very few jews 
are in the army women are paid less than men for doing the same 
job 
antisemitism in recent years has been reflected by the knocking 
over of jewish tombstones in cemeteries the painting of 
antisemitic graffitti on walls and very infrequently but always 
intimidating the setting off of small bombs in the doorways of 
synagogues 
we dont have a very serious problem of discrimination based 
on religion or race but there is in the background among certain 
sectors some antisemitism said jose ignacio lopez alfonsins 
press secretary 
angel grushka leader of the leftist federation of jewish 
cultural entities said the new law is helpful but he added tha 
the wished the acts of discrimination that would invoke the 
penalties were more precisely spelled out 
we still have to work very hard on the judicial level to make 
sure that antisemitic actions are punished grushka said 
antidiscrimination legislation in argentine law dates to 1949 
in 1964 similar legislation that penalized those convicted of 
discrimination was implemented but that legislation was revoked by 
the military government that came to power two years later

this year has brought a heady string of successses 
to javier perez de cuellar the un secretarygeneral tempered by 
reminders that enmities built over centuries do not fade easily 
another sobering element is the nearinsolvency of his 
organization which was created in 1945 as the hope of the world 
but in recent years has been called inept or useless at best and 
at worst seriously biased 
the run of success began in april with an agreement for the 
soviet union to withdraw its 100000 soldiers from afghanistan 
after more than eight years of helping the communist government 
fight moslem guerrillas that agreement took six years of un 
mediation 
then in the past two weeks came the iraniraq ceasefire 
direct talks between the belligerents a revival of negotiations on 
a settlement in divided cyprus and acceptance of a un peace plan 
for the disputed western sahara 
un roles also are foreseen in southern africa and cambodia 
where progress has been made toward peaceful settlements 
a sign of growing un popularity is the increased sales of 
tshirts emblazoned with doves of peace and its blueandwhite 
globe emblem 
reality is always present however to keep euphoria from 
getting out of hand 
in geneva the iraniraq peace negotiations that began aug 25 
were deadlocked this week 
no one had expected the enemies to shake hands and make up 
immediately after eight years of war but perez de cuellar admitted 
to frustration nonetheless 
he left the negotiations thursday to meet other commitments 
appointing swedens un ambassador jan eliasson to continue his 
work as mediator 
a new problem arose when the afghan government asked for more 
talks on the unmediated afghan agreement the soviet union said 
this week it had sent jet fighters back into the country to help 
the army fight the rebels who are supported by the united states 
and pakistan 
if all goes well and a larger un role is required to monitor 
regional political settlements the money problem will grow because 
some members including the united states are behind in their dues 
arrears in dues total 600 million the united states owes more 
than 467 million to the regular budget and 70 million to 
peacekeeping operations 
funding is a huge problem un spokesman francois giuliani 
told reporters in geneva this week he said the organization was 
going broke and being forced to use money intended for october 
salaries to pay for the un peacekeepers in iran and iraq where 
the ceasefire began aug 20 
diplomats say they expect the united states and other members 
as in past budget crises to produce the money needed for the 
organization and its peacekeeping operations 
one reason for the new effectiveness of the 159member world 
organization is increased cooperation among the five permanent 
security council members the united states soviet union 
britain china and france according to the diplomats 
they say an afghan agreement was possible because of improved 
eastwest relations and the decision by soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev to cut soviet losses and withdraw 
the main un role is that of catalyst ready to enter the 
picture when nations realize their best interests lie in settling 
regional conflicts 
we must be patient perez de cuellar said thursday when 
questioned about lack of progress in the iraniraq talks 
these problems are very difficult and complicated they cannot 
be solved overnight remember how long the afghanistan talks went 
on 
he admitted to frustration at the slow pace however and said 
he had been very busy with meetings on the cyprus and the western 
sahara problems 
recent achievements by the united nations make an impressive 
list and perez de cuellar has been mentioned as a possible 
candidate for the nobel peace prize the 68yearold peruvian 
diplomat says the prize if awarded should go to the organization 
rather than the man

this years summer movies attacked for being 
everything from blasphemous to reactionary nevertheless shattered 
boxoffice records with a cartoon bunny and an african prince 
leading the way 
while critics debated the alleged evils of the last temptation 
of christ and rambo iii moviegoers plunked down 
approximately 17 billion for tickets 
that beats the previous summer record of 159 billion set in 
1987 
people are movieminded and theyre going bob selig 
president of the national association of theater owners in 
california said tuesday people are just not going to stay at 
home every night regardless of what they have there 
videocassettes and cable television though increasingly 
popular didnt keep fans from who framed roger rabbit and 
coming to america each of which grossed more than 110 million 
the summer season which began in late may and concluded on 
labor day was not dominated by any movie as beverly hills cop 
ii and top gun had done in 1987 and 1986 respectively 
indeed four separate movies led this summers boxoffice tally 
disneys roger rabbit an unusual comedy merging animation 
and live action was the seasons no 1 hit followed closely by 
paramounts coming to america featuring eddie murphy as an 
african prince in search of an american bride not far behind was 
paramounts crocodile dundee ii the fishoutofwater 
adventure story that took in more than 100 million and big 
20th century foxs comic look at a child trapped in a mans body 
which is close to passing the 100 million mark 
to have four movies over 100 million is unusual i believe 
its only happened once before said barry london president of 
marketing and distribution for paramount pictures 
london said the quantity of good movies this summer created an 
environment for audiences the publics having a good time with 
one movie makes them want to come back again london said 
its been a good diverse product mix said peter farwell 
vice president of corporate relations for general cinema the 
countrys fourthlargest theater chain it seems weve had movies 
that appeal to all segments of the population theres been 
something for everybody 
film reviewers apparently had little impact on which movies 
became hits coming to america met with mixed reviews and mgms 
willow and disneys cocktail both panned still brought in 
more than 50 million apiece 
at the same time the controversies surrounding last 
temptation and rambo iii appeared to have little to do with 
their box office performance last temptation which probably 
wouldnt have been a boxoffice hit under any circumstances 
collected more than 2 million after being blasted by conservative 
christians for its depiction of a jesus with human weaknesses 
rambo iii the violent sovietbashing saga about its 
invasion of afghanistan that opened the week the russians began 
pulling out of the country grabbed only 55 million in the 
nations theaters down sharply from the 150million success of 
rambo first blood part ii in 1985 
summer flops included the big blue big top peewee 
mac amp me the rescue and monkey shines

the house is taking up a politically potent 
antidrug bill as congress returns from vacation to face a long 
list of troublesome issues made all the more contentious by 
election campaign tensions 
among the issues that remain to be settled before lawmakers quit 
to campaign for reelection are spending levels on star wars arms 
control issues a major overhaul of the welfare system competing 
proposals on child care and aid to nicaraguas contra rebels 
many of those same issues are being debated by republican george 
bush and democrat michael dukakis in their contest for the 
presidency their running mates sens dan quayle rind and 
lloyd bentsen dtexas left the campaign trail at least for the 
day to be on hand for the resumption of a congressional session 
that broke in midaugust in advance of the republican national 
convention 
both chambers were convening today for what was expected to be 
the final congressional session of the year 
leaders of the democraticcontrolled congress hope to finish 
their work by sept 30 to permit members time to campaign for 
reelection nov 8 all 435 house seats will be up for grabs along 
with 33 of the 100 senate positions 
a postelection lame duck meeting is not considered likely 
heeding electionyear polls showing voters are worried about 
illegal drugs both chambers are trying to come up with antidrug 
packages 
the house bill on the floor today was written by democrats with 
an eye toward attracting republican support 
the bill would cost up to 2 billion a year which would be in 
addition to the 39 billion a year the federal government already 
spends to fight drug abuse the plan includes something for 
everyone involved in fighting illegal drugs more money for 
education treatment and rehabilitation more resources for state 
and local law enforcement efforts to seize drugs on land in the 
air and on the seas 
legislators from both parties say the imminent election could 
affect both rhetoric and votes in congress 
if the republicans try to dream up some vote to try to 
embarrass sen bentsen they have to be aware that whatever they do 
could also catch sen quayle said sen david pryor dark 
for example democrats may push for votes on their legislation 
to increase the minimum wage from 335 per hour to 455 hourly 
over a threeyear period an increase opposed by president reagan 
if it were sent to his desk the president might be forced to 
consider the political consequences that a veto would have on bush 
pryor and sen pete domenici rnm ranking republican on the 
senate budget committee agreed that members are anxious to finish 
work and return home to campaign 
we have a lot of things still to be done but people want to 
finish up so theres going to be a strong push to get things 
resolved and done said domenici 
i think the presidential election will have some effect but i 
think the greater effect will be members wish to get out and 
campaign for their own elections said pryor 
the pentagon budget is likely to be the most contentious issue 
they said reagan vetoed congress first military budget bill last 
month because he didnt like its arms control policy restrictions 
or cuts in his proposed star wars budget 
another campaign issue child care is the subject of numerous 
bills in both chambers the fastestmoving bill is the 
democraticbacked 25 billion act for better child care services 
to provide an array of services for children and parents 
though reagan and other conservatives oppose the measure 
democrats have declined to compromise democratic leaders in both 
chambers could bring the measure to a vote setting up an 
electionseason confrontation with the white house 
in addition congress has passed and reagan has signed only two 
of the 13 appropriation bills needed to pay for the federal 
government when the new fiscal year begins oct 1 but the other 11 
have been passed separately by each chamber and are now in 
housesenate conference committees to resolve differences 
the senate version of the military spending bill also includes a 
democraticbacked contra aid proposal which the house is likely to 
approve with few changes the current contra aid package expires 
sept 30 the new plan calls for 27 million in humanitarian 
aid food clothing and shelter and sets up procedures for a 
subsequent vote on releasing 165 million in frozen military 
supplies 
if reagan wants the military aid house speaker jim wright 
dtexas has vowed not to stand in the way of a floor vote 
while quayle will be among the conferees on the defense bill 
bentsen is one of the housesenate conferees who are working on a 
major social issue welfare reform 
the reagan administration had expressed reservations about the 
way the compromise was shaping up before the negotiators recessed 
last month but dukakis has told democratic lawmakers he wants them 
to finish work this year 
the reform effort centers on a greatly expanded work education 
and training program for welfare recipients the biggest stumbling 
block is a provision which requires some recipients to do community 
work 
the house is tentatively scheduled to vote on another social 
issue sept 14 when it considers a family leave bill that 
guarantees 10 weeks of unpaid jobprotected leave for new parents 
employed by firms of 50 persons or more the business community 
strongly opposes the bill contending it would make companies 
noncompetitive and the government shouldnt mandate employee 
benefits

the drug enforcement administrations chief 
administrative law judge says marijuana should be legalized as a 
prescription drug because smoking it helps cancer patients control 
nausea after chemotherapy 
francis l young recommended reclassifying marijuana as a 
schedule ii drug so that it could be prescribed by physicians to 
treat the often severe nausea accompanying chemotherapy as well as 
muscle spasms caused by multiple sclerosis 
young whose findings are not binding on deas head john lawn 
acknowledged that strong emotions are aroused on both sides of 
any discussion concerning the use of marijuana 
nonetheless it is essential for this agency and its 
administrator calmly and dispassionately to review the evidence of 
record correctly to apply the law and act accordingly he wrote 
in an opinion released tuesday 
young rejected as specious the argument that prescribing 
marijuana cigarettes as a medicine will send a signal that 
marijuana is ok generally for recreational use 
the fear of sending such a signal cannot be permitted to 
override the legitimate need amply demonstrated in this record of 
countless sufferers for the relief marijuana can provide when 
prescribed by a physician in a legitimate case 
young cited testimony by doctors and patients during 11 days of 
hearings that marijuana was an accepted and effective treatment for 
nausea among cancer patients and for multiple sclerosis a 
debilitating and crippling neurological disease 
the hearings were ordered in 1980 by the us circuit court of 
appeals here which chastised dea for ignoring its statutory 
obligation to consider evidence that marijuana might have some 
medical benefit 
the appellate court had twice previously overruled deas 
rejection of petitions first filed in 1972 by the national 
organization for the reform of marijuana laws norml 
the groups attorney kevin b zeese vowed to take the case 
back to the court if lawn or his successor rejects youngs 
recommendation 
dea has historically opposed moving marijuana from the list of 
schedule i drugs which includes heroin pcp and lsd to schedule 
ii 
dea spokesman cornelius dougherty said lawn wont have any 
comment until he has had a chance to look at youngs 68page 
opinion 
dougherty said lawn could opt to hold further hearings before 
making a final decision 
zeese hailed youngs decision saying it marks the first time 
there has ever been an unbiased hearing on whether or not marijuana 
is safe for use under medical supervision 
its a very important step in the process zeese said 
even if dea upholds youngs findings the food and drug 
administration and state regulatory agencies would have to pass 
judgment before marijuana were made available as a drug 
young determined that smoking marijuana was more effective at 
controlling nausea from chemotherapy than capsules that contain the 
synthetic thc the chemically active ingredient of cannabis 
when smoked natural marijuana is inhaled and generally takes 
effect more quickly than the synthetic capsule which is ingested 
and must be processed through the digestive system before it takes 
effect young said 
he also cited a sevenyear experiment by at least 10 hospitals 
in new mexico that showed marijuana cigarettes were highly 
effective in controlling nausea after chemotherapy the 
cigarettes were supplied by the federal government under 
regulations that allow medical research 
efforts by louisiana at making marijuana a prescription drug for 
cancer patients were frustrated by the insistence of federal 
authorities that it would only be made available as part of a 
research project young said 
few doctors were willing to file the required paperwork to 
participate under those conditions he said 
young also rejected dea contentions that marijuana was not 
proven a safe drug saying by any measure of rational analysis 
marijuana can be safely used within a supervised routine of medical 
care 
marijuana can be harmful marijuana is abused but the same is 
true of dozens of drugs or substances which are listed in schedule 
ii so that they can be employed in treatment by physicians in 
proper cases despite their abuse potential he said 
in the case of multiple sclerosis there are few drugs to treat 
muscle spasms and they often cause serious side effects young said 
marijuana was also found to be an accepted and effective 
treatment of painful bone spurs caused by pseudo hypoparathyroidism 
young said there was insufficient evidence that a respectable 
minority of physicians had accepted marijuana as a treatment for 
glaucoma a degenerative opticnerve disease that slowly causes 
blindness 
but he did note that two highly qualified and experienced 
ophthalmologists accepted marijuanas medical value for treating 
the disease 
as with multiple sclerosis there are only a limited number of 
other drugs to treat glaucoma and they can cause serious side 
effects young said

a study released today challenges the notion 
that america will be able to replace millions of jobs lost in 
fading smokestack industries with new jobs in emerging 
hightechnology fields 
the council on competitiveness said the united states has lost 
its oncecommanding lead in many hightech industries it said that 
only a concerted effort by government industry and the nations 
schools can reverse the trend 
in field after field from combustion engineering to consumer 
electronics from machine tools to the integrated circuit foreign 
competitors have moved into markets pioneered and once dominated by 
american firms the report said often their success was built 
on exploiting inventions made in american laboratories by american 
scientists 
the report said other countries such as japan have done a much 
better job of bringing new technology to the marketplace quickly 
unless this trend is reversed the study warned the united 
states will suffer further deterioration in its trade deficits and 
a declining standard of living 
technology is essential to americas competitiveness the 
driving force behind increased productivity export growth and a 
rising standard of living said john young chairman of the 
council and president of hewlettpackard co 
in releasing the report young said he wanted to challenge the 
comforting illusion that the sunrise industries of high 
technology are the wave of the future the economic panacea we all 
need 
in 1987 our trade deficit with japan in electronics was 
almost as large as it was for automobiles so silicon valley is not 
so far removed from detroit he said 
the report cited these developments 
american companies share of the us domestic market has 
shrunk dramatically in many hightechnology fields between 1970 
and 1987 us manufacturing companies share of the american 
market in phonographs fell from 90 percent to 1 percent in color 
televisions from 90 percent to 10 percent in machine tools from 
100 percent to 35 percent and in telephones from 99 percent to 25 
percent 
americas trade surplus in hightechnology products has 
declined precipitously during the 1980s and was actually in deficit 
for the first time in 1986 
foreign inventors captured 47 percent of us patents in 1987 
up from 35 percent in 1975 with japanese inventors holding key 
patents in an increasing number of fields 
by 1986 japan had captured 65 percent of the world market in 
computer chips the united states had less than 30 percent 
america could face a shortfall of 500000 scientists and 
engineers by the year 2010 due to retirements and a declining 
number of students choosing careers in science and engineering 
bobby inman a member of the council and the chairman of 
westmark systems inc said that in global competition the key to 
success in developing new technology for the marketplace is speed 
and teamwork 
weve been too slow too fragmented too uncoordinated and too 
adversarial he said 
the report said us companies face an uphill struggle in global 
markets unless the federal government improves the machinery for 
making national technology policy 
the report called on the next president to give his national 
science adviser cabinet rank with the power to coordinate all 
government policies relating to research and development 
the federal government operates more than 700 research 
laboratories with an annual budget of 20 billion close to 
onethird of the governments annual spending for research and 
development 
but the report said there is no consensus on the projects these 
labs should be pursuing and coordination is so lax that it is 
difficult to determine just how many labs there are or what 
projects they are pursuing 
the report said investment in education equipment and 
facilities should be made a top federal priority it estimated that 
10 billion would be needed over the next 10 years to restore us 
university research facilities 
the government also should promote faculty development programs 
as a way of filling an estimated 1300 to 1800 vacant engineering 
positions at us universities the council said 
the council also called for tax credits to companies for 
research and development regulatory reform to speed the commercial 
application of new technology and reduction of the federal budget 
deficit as a way of lowering the cost of capital to us businesses 
the primary challenge for policy makers is to create a new 
policy framework appropriate for todays competitive environment 
young said we can no longer afford to view the commercial 
application of technology as a secondrate priority 
the council founded in 1986 is composed of 151 chief 
executives from industry organized labor and higher education it 
has issued a series of reports aimed at improving the ability of 
american companies to compete in world markets

michael dukakis spoke of his immigrant 
heritage before a backdrop of 22 american flags and the statue of 
liberty george bush led the republican convention in a recitation 
of the pledge of allegiance 
typical scenes from what is already the most star spangled 
presidential campaign in memory 
the red white and blue hue of the contest no doubt reflects a 
judgment that americans are in the mood for another dose of 
patriotism the sort of stuff ronald reagan promoted in two 
landslide election victories 
but flagwaving also is the refuge of candidates who would 
rather not spell out how they plan to balance the budget or create 
millions of new wellpaying jobs 
flagwaving isnt limited to creating a sea of color for the 
evening television news shows 
read my lips says republican bush no new taxes 
rhetorical flagwaving 
good jobs at good wages says democrat dukakis waving his 
favorite rhetorical flag 
weighing in on tuesday was the president an old master at this 
kind of campaigning 
after eight hard years of rebuilding americas strength do we 
really want to return to a disneyland defense policy the 
president asked the american legion 
he ticked off the defense systems he claimed dukakis opposes 
including the trident missile and the stealth bomber both of which 
the massachusetts governor supports 
on the question of a federal budget awash in record amounts of 
red ink both candidates talk about the need to reduce the 
deficits but they arent saying how theyd do it 
the flexible freeze proposed by bush is derided by dukakis as 
son of voodoo economics the memorable phrase bush once used 
and now wishes he hadnt to describe reagans economic policies 
but dukakis own plan for cutting the deficit is based on 
unspecified cuts and his determination to collect up to 100 
billion in unpaid income taxes 
helping the homeless the elderly providing better schools and 
health care rebuilding the nations roads and bridges restoring 
the competitive edge to american industry cleaning up the 
environment all these are widely accepted goals to be reached 
through the vaguest of proposals 
everybody is for cooperation bringing together government 
business and labor 
with new taxes a forbidden topic and budget deficits remaining 
at record levels neither bush nor dukakis wants to commit himself 
to specific proposals with price tags the nation cant afford 
so instead they tout their leadership abilities a pitch that 
assumes the main task is to convince voters that the candidate will 
make the right decisions whatever they may turn out to be 
dukakis talks about his 10 years as governor of massachusetts 
and describes himself as a tightfisted manager whose hallmark is 
competence 
bush holds up his impressive resume and says he was at reagans 
side when interest rates inflation and unemployment declined from 
the levels of the final year of democrat jimmy carters presidency 
but nothing waves quite so impressively as the flag 
republican vice presidential nominee dan quayle stood at the 
base of the statue of liberty on labor day to denounce the 
mindset that would impede the daily recitation of the pledge of 
allegiance 
he was offering a version of what has become the most frequently 
heard republican thrust of this campaign that dukakis vetoed 
legislation that would have required massachusetts public school 
teachers to lead pupils in the daily recitation of the pledge of 
allegiance 
dukakis vetoed the measure after receiving a state supreme court 
opinion that said it was unconstitutional 
should public school teachers be required to lead our children 
in the pledge of allegiance asked bush in his speech to the gop 
convention my opponent says no but i say yes 
of course the vice president was not proposing federal 
legislation to require any such thing that would violate 
republican beliefs in states rights not to mention the 
constitution 
to counter any suggestion that hes lacking in patriotism 
dukakis campaigns surrounded by flags of all sizes huge ones for a 
backdrop small ones passed out to the audience 
his rallies are often conducted to the heavy beat of neil 
diamond singing coming to america his appearance on ellis 
island the first stop in america of his mother when she came from 
greece 75 years ago ended with a solo trumpet rendition of 
america the beautiful 
by now the voters ought to be convinced that both presidential 
candidates are patriots who love their country and revere its flag 
convinced and ready to hear how the contenders plan to deal with 
national problems

the recent us agreement with japan on beef 
and citrus was hailed as a major step toward improved trade 
relations but an agriculture department economist says rice 
remains a symbol of japanese protectionism 
although the united states continues to press japan to open its 
rice market to imports only a small quantity can come in for use 
in alcohol or confectionery products says lois a caplan of the 
departments economic research service returning travelers also 
are allowed to bring in small amounts 
the united states for years has been after japan to liberalize 
its import policies so more american products can flow into the 
japanese market japan is the us farmers largest foreign market 
but officials say freer trade would open the door even wider 
after months of negotiations the united states and japan signed 
a pact on july 5 which gradually widens access to the japanese 
market by 1991 however japan adamantly refused to budge on the 
question of rice 
although japanese consumers pay more than twice as much for rice 
as americans do sentiment is strong in japan to protect the 
nations rice farmers 
in september 1986 the rice millers association a private us 
trade group filed a complaint against japan under section 301 of 
the 1974 trade act charging that japans virtual ban on rice 
imports constituted unfair trade practices 
the us government decided not to pursue the 301 action 
against japan but urged japan to discuss its rice policy in the 
current round of global trade negotiations caplan said japan 
has agreed to consultations under the new round but has repeatedly 
refused to have bilateral discussions with the united states 
caplan whose analysis is in a report about us trade with 
pacific rim countries said rice is a very sensitive issue in 
japan because it is a staple food and is important in many japanese 
traditions 
many older japanese have bitter memories of hunger during and 
immediately after the second world war and still have ties to the 
farming community she said the japanese government and the 
ldp liberal democratic party which derives much of its support 
from farmers have steadfastly rejected demands to liberalize the 
rice market and have promised to maintain the present policy of 
selfsufficiency in rice 
in most of the last two decades japan has produced more rice 
than it has consumed leading to periods of burdensome surpluses 
the unneeded rice inventories were reduced by subsidizing exports 
using rice in livestock feed or by limiting production 
the criticism of japans restrictive rice policies and strong 
pressure by its foreign trading partners have started 
unprecedented debate in japan over its agricultural policy 
including import restrictions caplan said 
consequently he said the discussion and social changes taking 
place in japan are likely to make it politically feasible for 
japan to move toward freer market access for agricultural imports 
down the road 
changes include an aging population with fading memories of 
world war ii food shortages a decline in the political influence 
of farm groups and an increasing awareness of the high cost of 
domestic agricultural products compared with overseas prices 
caplan said

the soviet union has bought more us corn for 
delivery during the current marketing year the agriculture 
department says 
officials said tuesday that an additional 802400 metric tons of 
us corn have been sold by private exporters for delivery during 
the 198889 marketing year which began on sept 1 
more than 17 million tons of corn have been sold to the soviets 
in the last week according to usda announcements 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn or 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans the 802400 tons of 
corn would be about 316 million bushels 
corn prices have been averaging about 268 per bushel at the 
farm level according to usda estimates meaning that the new sale 
could have a farm value of around 847 million 
no indication was given whether the recent new corn sales would 
count under the current longterm grain supply agreement with the 
soviet union or be carried forward separately in case a new pact is 
forthcoming 
the current fiveyear pact is set to expire sept 30 and 
negotiators are trying to work out a new one or at least an 
extension of the current agreement to take effect on oct 1

washington that was seized by the british during the revolutionary 
war 
they stole it said alice west clark of fairhaven this 
bible belongs in this country and it belongs to my family 
the washington masonic bible was seized by the duke of 
cornwalls light infantry during the raid on old dartmouth village 
it now is a prized possession of the light infantry museum in 
england 
clark said that when the british were marching through what is 
now acushnet and north fairhaven on sept 6 1778 they set fire to 
the home of bartholomew west an 80yearold invalid west was 
saved by neighbors and the redcoats moved on after taking the 
family bible 
clark who is uncertain whether she is related to the original 
wests but whose lineage stretches back to that era told the 
standardtimes of new bedford that the bible was printed in 1712

family it was signed by washington when he received a masonic 
degree

the us forest service says it may be forced 
for the second straight year to raid a reforestation trust fund to 
pay its fastmounting firefighting bill 
the forest service already has spent 190 million this year on 
firefighting and the western fire season is just entering its 
traditional peak month 
an interior department appropriations bill now pending in 
congress includes 125 million for firefighting and rep peter 
defazio dore said tuesday that most of it will be used to repay 
the knutsenvanderberg trust fund from last years borrowings 
the forest service spent 265 million in 1987 to fight western 
fires most of which struck in late august and september 
while congress has traditionally bailed out the forest service 
defazio said smoke and mirrors budgeting could eventually leave 
the trust fund short of money 
a forest service budget official said no decision has been made 
on whether to borrow from the knutsenvanderberg trust fund 
its a possibility said robert gordon an assistant 
director of the agency 
he said the fund typically has about 400 million in it and the 
programs it finances generally cost about 200 million a year 
money from the fund comes from fees timber operators pay when they 
log national forests and is earmarked for reforestation projects 
it will eventually catch up with you if you dont replenish 
it but i think we will be all right this year gordon said

the number of hispanics has grown by more than 
onethird since 1980 and now represents 81 percent of the nations 
population the census bureau says 
in a report issued tuesday the bureau also said the rate of 
hispanic growth is nearly five times that for the rest of the 
population and more than half of all hispanics in this country 
live in just two states california and texas 
the bureau estimated there were 194 million americans of 
hispanic background as of last march that is 34 percent more than 
the 145 million people who listed themselves as hispanics in the 
1980 census 
the nations nonhispanic population increased by about 7 
percent in the same period 
about half the hispanic increase was a result of immigration and 
half resulted from birth rates exceeding death rates 
while people of spanish ancestry made up a growing share of the 
nations residents they are extremely concentrated geographically 
the bureau found about onethird 339 percent live in 
california and 213 percent live in texas meaning those two 
states account for well over half of all hispanics in the united 
states 
the study did not estimate the hispanic population of every 
state but it said that nearly 90 percent live in just nine states 
those are california 66 million texas 41 million new york 
21 million florida 15 million illinois 801000 arizona 
648000 new jersey 646000 new mexico 543000 and colorado 
368000 
other findings of the report include 
the unemployment rate among hispanics was 85 percent compared 
with 58 percent for nonhispanics 
people of mexican heritage were the largest hispanic group at 
121 million they were followed by puerto ricans living on the 
us mainland 25 million central and south americans 22 
million and cubans 1 million 
the proportion of hispanic families anchored by a married 
couple was 70 percent down from 74 percent when it was last 
measured in 1982 at the same time the share of families headed by 
a woman with no spouse present increased from 26 percent to 30 
percent 
more than half 51 percent of hispanics have completed high 
school and 10 percent have completed four years of college that 
still trails nonhispanics of whom 78 percent are high school 
graduates and 21 percent have finished college

jesse jackson says he is eager to get on with 
his role in the fall democratic campaign although he was excluded 
from a meeting between presidential nominee michael dukakis and 
democratic leaders in his home state of illinois 
dukakis met in illinois on tuesday with elected leaders and 
fundraisers including sen paul simon rep dan rostenkowski 
other members of congress and other elected officials though at 
home in chicago jackson was not invited 
dukakis spokesman leslie dach said the reason was that jackson 
is a national leader and the meeting in illinois was focusing on 
the dukakis state strategy and organization 
i didnt know anything about it other than the press 
inquiries jackson said in a telephone interview from chicago 
so i have no comment to make 
sources said jackson was angered by the exclusion and one 
associate speaking on condition of anonymity described him as 
seething but jackson said he was neither hurt nor angry 
i just hate for people to be allowed to put words in my mouth 
or give some adjective description of what my emotions are he 
said im working im hopeful im registering voters 
he said he had spoken monday night and tuesday morning to 
dukakis vice chairman john sasso the two are to meet thursday to 
discuss the future of the campaign 
jackson said that areas dealing with campaign direction and 
priorities still have to be worked out he said he hoped to 
discuss his ongoing voter registration efforts with the campaign 
and he said he hoped to discuss targeting the message of the 
democratic ticket to teamsters working women family farmers and 
others who need to be democrats 
asked if he would get a schedule of campaign appearances at this 
meeting jackson said i certainly hope so 
asked if he feels dukakis has been slow to involve him in the 
campaign jackson said there are some decisions the campaign has 
to make about how it will employ its volunteers including people 
like new york gov mario cuomo sen edward kennedy of 
massachusetts and himself 
i assume thats the kind of thing sasso will be doing he 
said referring to dukakis close confidant who has just returned 
to the campaign 
the plans are incomplete he said i hope they will be 
complete soon i hope before this week is out that all of the 
remaining areas will be resolved and well be on our way 
dach said the meeting with sasso will include discussion of 
how we can best work together places details themes but he 
also indicated the campaign sees the meeting as involving 
evolving issues that need to be addressed and refined 
jackson has declined to criticize dukakis despite some 
incidents that some jackson supporters have perceived as slights 
the most recent involved reports that the dukakis camp had 
conducted polling that found jackson had high negatives in some 
states where he beat dukakis in the primaries and that the dukakis 
officials said they did not want jackson campaigning in those 
states 
while these reports came from sources close to jackson and the 
national democratic party jackson himself said he had received no 
such direction 
i dont have anything in writing on that he said

president reagan is campaigning against the 
carter administration and the news media as he attempts to convince 
voters that he has put americas defense policy on the right track 
and the democrats would derail it 
the president jumped into the postlabor day election fray 
tuesday as he ended a threeweek california vacation and returned 
to the white house where he planned a meeting with republican 
congressional leaders today 
it will be a meeting to map strategy and to get reports from 
the leaders on what they found out from their constituents during 
the recess white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters 
aboard air force one 
the congressional recess coincided with reagans vacation which 
was spent mainly at his ranch north of santa barbara with a 
fiveday interval in los angeles 
on his way back to washington reagan stopped in louisville 
ky to address the american legions 70th national convention 
asking after eight hard years of rebuilding americas strength 
do we really want to return to a disneyland defense policy 
deriding the policies of the president from whom he wrested the 
white house in 1980 reagan said an administration from the 
party of franklin roosevelt harry truman and john kennedy had 
incredibly lost faith in the place of america the role for good 
that america played the moral mission of america in the world 
reagan also reminded the legionnaires of something he said when 
he addressed their convention during his 1980 campaign once we 
have the military programs to reverse the trends now in favor of 
the soviet union we must strive for arms limitation agreements 
that will further that security including significant arms 
reductions so long as they are equitable and based on strict 
reciprocity 
actually i didnt read that for your benefit but for the 
benefit of my gang on the press platform back there he told 
the audience at louisvilles commonwealth convention center 
they keep saying that the inf agreement i signed with mr 
gorbachev the first significant equitable and reciprocal 
reduction of us and soviet nuclear missiles in history shows how 
ive grown in my job but im waiting for them to acknowledge the 
simple truth of what ive been saying for eight years about 
strength being the only road to peace 
reagan also touched on some of the legislative issues facing him 
as he headed back to washington with 4 months remaining in his 
term 
earlier this year the majority in congress turned a deaf ear 
to our pleas and to those in central america who hunger for the 
freedoms we in the united states take for granted he said we 
hope that with your help we might still convince this congress to 
do whats right 
the senate has passed a bill which the administration describes 
as minimally acceptable to resume assistance to rebels fighting 
the leftist government of nicaragua the house has not acted 
the president also said that before i leave office i want to 
be sure that we have a cabinetlevel department of veterans 
affairs a bill to upgrade the status of the veterans 
administration has passed the senate and awaits house action 
much of the speech was devoted to denunciation of the previous 
democratic administration and of the democrats now seeking to 
regain the white house 
reagan at one point claimed that democratic nominee michael 
dukakis wants to scrap the trident missile and the stealth bomber 
dukakis actually favors both

the government has committed 36 million in 
emergency assistance for floodplagued bangladesh and a private 
us group says it will provide another 4 million for medicine and 
food 
the agency for international developments office of foreign 
disaster assistance said tuesday that the government assistance 
will include 10000 tons of food and more than 2000 tons of corn 
and wheat seed us disaster management experts also will be sent 
to dhaka to help assess the situation and advise on further 
assistance the agency said 
oxfam america a private humanitarian organization also 
announced its relief program on tuesday 
of the 500 deaths that have been reported officially many 
were caused by consuming contaminated food and drinking water and 
as a result of snakebites oxfam said in a statement from its 
boston headquarters 
the greatest medical need is for water purification tablets 
which we are attempting to secure in large quantities and deliver 
as quickly as humanly possible 
the organization said experts fear that because most roads and 
highways have been out thousands of families will starve to 
death unless supplies reach them soon 
oxfam blamed the second consecutive year of major floods in 
bangladesh on massive destruction of trees in northern india and 
china allowing water to pour unchecked into the deltas of 
bangladesh 
the deforestation of the region has stripped away many of the 
natural barriers that protect against the waters of the ganges 
river and the melted snows of the himalayas the organization 
said 
oxfam said it is concerned that many more deaths will occur in 
bangladesh in the years to come with continued inattention to this 
problem

and other stars sing for human rights on the third stop of amnesty 
internationals global rock tour 
the concert tuesday opened to a sellout crowd of 80000 
including senior communist officials 
it was a rare event in eastern europe 
individual western rock groups have been allowed to play in 
communist european capitals but this was believed to be the first 
such group performance in the soviet bloc 
the budapest concert also was unusual because it was sponsored 
by a western human rights organization the west has often accused 
east bloc countries of violating human rights commitments 
the state news agency mti reported that chief patron of the 
concert was hungarian top ideologist janos berecz a politburo 
member it said soviet government spokesman gennady gerasimov also 
was present as was interior minister istvan horvath 
one source said premier and communist leader karoly grosz was 
also seen at the nep stadium as were soviet diplomats 
the tour which began in london friday then took the stars to 
paris is marking the 40th anniversary of the un universal 
declaration on human rights it will include 20 cities on five 
continents 
the performers include britains sting american folk singer 
tracy chapman and senegals youssou ndour 
gabriel told reporters that negotiations still were under way to 
take the tour to moscow and that the performers hoped it could be 
arranged 
during a break in the concert berecz was quoted by mti as 
saying that there is no need to be afraid of human rights issues 
but persistent efforts are needed for them to be accomplished and 
to prevail to the full extent 
berecz was also reported as saying that there was no 
obstacle to cooperation with amnesty international since the 
organization is assessing countries not according to their social 
systems but on the basis of their human rights record 
hungary has taken the unprecedented step recently of accusing an 
allied country of human rights abuses budapest maintains that 
neighboring romania is pursuing discriminatory policies that harm 
the culture and tradition of about 17 million ethnic hungarians 
who live there 
ian martin secretarygeneral of amnesty international visited 
budapest last week for brief talks with horvath and with gyula 
horn the state secretary for foreign affairs 
thousands of austrians went by special train to budapest for 
tuesdays event with a special package deal costing 45 fans from 
czechoslovakia east germany and poland were also in town for the 
performance

the grave of william butler yeats in western 
ireland where the great irish poet was buried in a state funeral 
in 1948 probably doesnt contain his remains a researcher says 
the tomb in drumcliffe county sligo says diana souhami more 
likely contains the remains of anonymous frenchmen with whom yeats 
shared a paupers grave before being brought to ireland for 
reburial 
ms souhamis conclusions which met with disbelief among some 
keepers of yeats memory are based on letters of yeats friend 
the painter hannah gluck ms souhami read the letters while 
writing a biography of ms gluck 
yeats died in france in 1939 after stipulating he wanted to be 
buried at drumcliffe he had even written his own epitaph now 
inscribed on the gravestone seen by thousands of visitors annually 
cast a cold eye 
on life on death 
horseman pass by 
yeats scholar john kelly was quoted by the daily telegraph on 
tuesday as saying ms souhamis findings if true represented a 
very cruel irony 
but canon pat wood president of the yeats society in sligo 
said in a telephone interview its an old old story and i dont 
believe it 
he said anne saddlemyer author of a biography of yeats wife 
georgie examined the controversy and concluded the remains at 
drumcliffe were the poets 
ms saddlemyer lives in toronto and her telephone was not 
answered tuesday yeats son michael who lives in dublin also did 
not answer telephone calls 
ms souhami said in an interview that from letters she found 
among ms glucks papers it appeared that georgie had yeats buried 
in a cemetery in roquebrune southern france believing the grave 
would be left intact for 10 years 
in fact perhaps unwittingly she had bought a paupers grave in 
which yeats was buried with four or five others this grave was 
cleared in 1946 and the bones placed in a common ossuary a 
receptacle for bones of deceased people ms souhami said 
why she chose the communal grave isnt clear she said 
perhaps she thought she had a 10year concession what is certain 
is that she didnt and its certain that it was all cleared out in 
1946 
in 1947 ms gluck and the journalist edith heald visited the 
site and were shocked to find no trace of yeats grave she said 
ms gluck then contacted yeats friend edmund dulac who wrote to 
the priest at the graveyard asking whether yeats remains could be 
dug up and identified 
ms souhami said she found among ms glucks papers a letter to 
dulac from the priest a man identified only as biancheri which 
said is it possible to find the bones of the poet yeats in the 
ossuary yes if we empty the entire contents of the ossuary and 
if we have details of distinctive characteristics which will enable 
us to reconstruct the skeleton after painstaking research carried 
under the direction of a medical expert 
yeats purported remains were exhumed and shipped to ireland 
just one month later much too soon to enable the bones to be 
identified under the terms described by biancheri said ms souhami

a huge fire tuesday prompted an 
evacuation order for the old faithful tourist complex at 
yellowstone national park and a wall of flames moved to within 600 
yards of the town of silver gate and threatened cooke city 
the 500 to 600 visitors and nonessential employees near the 
parks most popular attraction would be asked to leave by 9 am 
mdt wednesday for safety reasons and to allow firefighters the 
access they need to protect structures said yellowstone 
spokeswoman joan anzelmo 
this is not a panic at all she said this will be a slow 
orderly closure and evacuation as closures have been in different 
locations throughout the summer 
gusts 30 mph pushed the main body of the 144000acre north fork 
blaze to within 1 miles of the complex tuesday evening and carried 
embers to within threequarters of a mile of the area where they 
sparked spot fires 
to the north flames surged out of the northeast corner of 
yellowstone within 600 yards of the tourist community of silver 
gate but moving eastward on a collision course with the larger 
community of cooke city three miles away 
officials said the flames passed to the north of silver gate 
along a hillside without damaging buildings but the community 
remained endangered and the situation appeared to be worsening as 
the flames moved east 
the sheet of flame was barely 600 feet from downtown silver gate 
as it paralleled the community spreading one mile to the east 
within an hour officials said 
observers said the fire billowed hundreds of feet into the air 
through a cloud of spewing embers that were doused by firefighters 
as they landed on buildings 
earlier the fire forced hundreds of firefighters to retreat to 
new positions in what was called a lastditch effort to keep the 
flames from overrunning the community 
fire officials were pessimistic about holding back the 
unpredictable 61300acre storm creek fire only 1 miles west of 
silver gate the first town in the fires path 
were going to make every effort we can to save every 
structure and every home in these communities said mike warren 
branch commander of the firefighting effort 
hundreds of firefighters retreated tuesday fearing for their 
safety too hot yelled one however more experienced 
firefighters remained to extinguish hot spots and wet down trees 
tuesday night flames leaped from tree to tree a few hundred 
yards from silver gate after a spot fire flared on a nearby 
hillside firefighters splashed buildings with water in a 
lastditch effort to save the community 
the spot fire was estimated at 20 acres and growing fast 
earlier tuesday authorities went door to door to order 
evacuations of cooke city 
gov ted schwinden and federal authorities tuesday imposed a ban 
on all outdoor recreation outside montanas cities and towns to 
lessen the fire danger 
we could face a very very dangerous day or day and a half 
schwinden told reporters when you count up the score mother 
nature is way ahead 
thirteen major fires have burned roughly 1 million acres in 
yellowstone and the surrounding national forests in wyoming 
montana and idaho inside the 22 millionacre park 633725 acres 
are charred 
elsewhere a fire in parched grass and pine in central 
washington exploded overnight from just 160 acres monday to more 
than 25000 acres tuesday sending firefighters fleeing and 
overrunning at least one bulldozer that could not move fast enough 
state officials said it burned toward some of the states prime 
fruit orchards 
forests and grassland also burned in california oregon and utah 
the boise interagency fire center the coordinating office for 
firefighting in the west says fires so far this year have charred 
365 million acres an area larger than connecticut which is 32 
million acres but slightly more than 2 million of the acres are in 
alaska during the last big fire season 1985 28 million acres 
burned including alaska 
the fire center has called this the worst fire season in 30 
years but without giving a specific year or acreage 
the us forest service said tuesday it has spent 190 million 
battling this summers blazes last year the forest service spent 
265 million to fight fires through september 
the national weather service said any relief is still five days 
away longrange weather maps show a low pressure system dropping 
into the pacific northwest from the gulf of alaska by sunday which 
could bring rain to montana and snow in the states western 
mountains 
but until then the weather service said montana can expect 
relatively strong wind 
park county commissioners declared an emergency and directed 
sheriffs deputies to forcibly remove people from silver gate and 
cooke city deputies remained behind to protect property from 
looting 
silver gate was encircled by firebreaks monday about a halfmile 
away and work continued tuesday on strenghtening the fire break 
around cooke city 
about 75 fire trucks were stationed in the two towns some from 
as far away as new york and california the trucks were manned by 
250 firefighters to protect buildings in addition to 1200 
firefighters battling the fire itself 
inside yellowstone crews battled to defend the stores lodges 
and cabins around old faithful geyser from the north fork fire 
which was mile away 
its a very defensible area denny bungarz north fork fire 
incident commander said before the evacuation order we feel 
very good that if that fire gets around old faithful well be able 
to skirt the fire around it with little or no loss 
soldiers from fort lewis wash worked tuesday to place a 
4000foot irrigation line on the western edge of the complex to 
protect it from flames expected wednesday the soldiers also 
chopped down small trees and brush 
the northwest flank of the north fork fire was about three miles 
northeast of west yellowstone mont after jumping the madison 
river over the weekend but tuesdays change in wind direction 
pushed the flames away from town 
a lobe of the north fork fire also burned back into the targhee 
national forest in idaho where it originally started before 
entering yellowstone said troy corn fire information officer

looters plundered government buildings and 
factories on wednesday and army trucks loaded with troops rolled 
downtown after staterun radio said security forces would shoot to 
prevent further destruction 
the defense forces and the peoples police force shall open 
fire to impose control should they find that these looters bent on 
violence continue their acts radio rangoon announced 
the violence combined with the resignation tuesday of nearly 
200 foreign ministry officials from the ruling party was another 
blow to the besieged government of president maung maung 
sources described the situation as chaotic many residents 
closed the doors of their homes and shops and traffic was minimal 
looters broke into the customs department warehouse a building 
of the education department and soap and textile factories thieves 
were spotted carrying away air conditioners and office equipment 
from the rangoon office of the un food and agriculture 
organization 
a livestock and poultry farm near the citys airport was 
pilfered 
more troops were seen in the kamayut hledan area near the campus 
of rangoon university where students have held rallies and 
meetings to plot strategy to force the government to give in to 
their demands for democracy 
the radio broadcast was the first stern warning about 
intervention to stop looting which has been occurring in the 
citys suburbs for several weeks and spread downtown tuesday when 
the government allowed looting to go unchecked 
a statement from the 187 foreign ministry employees who resigned 
from the burma socialist program party said they decided monday to 
quit en masse to protest 26 years of oneparty rule 
many other government departments have expressed opposition to 
the government through public statements strikes and 
demonstrations the unrest has crippled the administration which 
faces mass demonstrations nationwide thursday if it does not yield 
to demands for democracy 
but the government has refused to budge from its plan for the 
party leadership to meet monday to consider organizing a referendum 
on establishing multiparty democracy 
we have now reached a stage where the government should comply 
forthwith with the peoples wishes any responsible government 
would have done so long ago said the statement from the foreign 
ministry employees 
procrastination in any form by the government either by 
resorting to irrelevant legal procedures or by various maneuvers 
tactics and ruses designed to retain the reins of power would 
inevitably bring about immense suffering to the people together 
with the ultimate threat of fratricidal strife it said 
a ministry officer said the party resignations would have little 
effect on work of the ministry which has been minimal since the 
upheavals began in late july 
ministry sources said employees of 16 of the 26 foreign 
diplomatic missions except for the ambassadors expressed support 
for the demands of their colleagues in the foreign ministry 
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said hundreds of 
people tuesday carried away bags of rice from a warehouse in the 
western part of the city then sold it to merchants for a quarter 
of the normal price 
nearby looters took frozen fish and equipment from a warehouse 
at the fisheries department and another group stole provisions 
from a food and beverages corporation warehouse near the rangoon 
university campus the sources said 
two ricefilled carriages at the central railway station were 
pilfered by railway employees where were later joined by nearby 
residents 
residents of the suburb of south okkalapa earlier reported that 
at least 20 people died monday in a clash between looters and 
members of a neighborhood vigilance committee who rushed to a 
government biscuit factory to stop looting 
on monday opposition leaders aung san suu kyi and former 
defense minister tin oo threw their support behind a demand by one 
student group that an interim government be formed by 8 pm 
wednesday or protests will follow thursday 
virtually every day at least one of the more than 40 student 
groups has held news conferences or meetings to demand democracy 
the demands also are being circulated in the more than 20 daily 
newsheets which progovernment groups also have used to try to 
splinter the opposition and criticize a multiparty system 
burmas turmoil mounted after students rioted in september 1987 
to protest economic policies then led broaderbased street 
protests in march and june 
street riots flared anew after ne win resigned july 23 after 26 
years in power and the party chose hardliner sein lwin to succeed 
him 
government radio said 112 people died in rangoon in rioting 
against sein lwin who resigned after only 17 days diplomats 
believe many more people were killed 
demonstrations have been largely peaceful since maung maung took 
power aug 19 as the first civilian leader in 26 years

a soviet newspaper has provided new details about 
dictator josef stalins death which has been shrouded in mystery 
because of incomplete or disputed official accounts 
sovietskaya estonia quotes a retired bodyguard as saying stalin 
went unattended for at least 14 hours after suffering a stroke 
because lavrenti beria the head of the secret police refused to 
let anyone summon physicians 
the article appeared in sundays edition of the newspaper 
published in the soviet republic of estonia and copies arrived in 
moscow on tuesday 
the paper attributed most of its report to the bodyguard maj 
at rykov who it said was present when stalin stricken at his 
dacha outside moscow died in march 1953 
rykov told the paper that beria insisted stalin was only 
sleeping and his guards panicked when they found the dictator 
unconscious on the floor of his country residence or dacha 
no one dared contradict beria who became chief of the secret 
police in 1938 and carried out bloody purges and stalin was not 
attended by doctors until the next day according to the report 
stalin had ruled the country since 1924 eliminating his 
opponents inside and outside the ruling communist party and 
enforcing harsh collectivization 
little official information was given about his death and 
historians have challenged the official reports released as other 
party officials engaged in a power struggle for leadership 
sovietskaya estonia basing its article on what it said was a 
lengthy interview with rykov gave this version 
stalin probably died several days before march 5 1953 the day 
given officially as the date of death 
he died at his dacha and not in the kremlin as official 
reports said 
an autopsy showed stalin suffered a series of small strokes in 
his final years that affected parts of the brain responsible for 
psychotic activities results of the autopsy have not been 
officially released 
it took more than six months to embalm and preserve the body 
before it was put on public display 
the newspaper said rykov had served as a guard at stalins dacha 
and recently entered the papers editorial department and offered 
to tell his story 
he could talk for hours about the leader of the people 
saving every little fact in his memory the report said 
it quoted rykov was as saying stalin went to bed at 4 am on 
march 1 1953 after guests had left 
in the afternoon guards noticed there was no movement in 
stalins study or other rooms but at 630 pm a light was turned 
on in the study and in the hall rykov said according to the 
newspaper 
it quoted him as saying no one summoned the guards who became 
concerned and when one went in to deliver a letter stalin was 
lying on the carpet in the dining room having obvious 
difficulties in saying anything other guards came into the room 
and carried stalin into the largest hall it could be seen that he 
was cold and he probably was on the floor three to four hours 
without any help 
the account said beria and georgi m malenkov a close aide who 
briefly succeeded stalin as the communist party leader arrived at 
3 am on march 2 after beria telephoned instructions that no one 
was to say anything about stalins condition 
after seeing the unconscious leader beria insisted the guards 
had panicked and that stalin was simply sleeping according to 
the report 
doctors finally were summoned apparently by nikita s 
khrushchev who won the power struggle to become the party chief 
later in 1953 and they arrived between 9 am and 10 am 
the doctors were so nervous they could not even take off 
stalins shirt rykov was quoted as saying it had to be cut 
through with scissors the diagnosis was brain hemorrhage 
treatment was attempted but it was not surgical what surgeon 
could take responsibility for stalins life especially when beria 
frightened everybody asking whether they could guarantee that 
stalins life could be preserved 
beria was arrested in july 1953 and charged with conspiracy 
against the state after a secret trial he and six alleged 
accomplices where shot in december 1953 
the newspaper article also described the evening of march 5 
1953 when ss debov who had embalmed the body of soviet founder 
vladimir lenin was summoned 
one of stalins cars took debov to stalins postmortem 
examination which showed some irreversible changes localized in 
parts of the brain responsible for psychotic activities which were 
caused by a number of small hemorrhages rykov said 
stalins funeral was held on march 9 and the body carried to the 
mausoleum which was closed for more than eight months for a 
permanent embalming procedure 
on nov 17 1953 the mausoleum was opened for the people with 
lenin and stalin lying together the newspaper said 
it reported the identical coffins remained side by side until 
oct 31 1961 when soldiers took stalins remains to a plain 
gravesite nearby but outside the kremlin wall 
khrushchev had begun his campaign against what he called the 
cult of stalin

here is a text of lloyd bentsens remarks to 
the house of representatives on july 12 1950 concerning the use 
of atomic weapons in korea 
mr chairman i speak to you of a subject which may well 
result in a third world war or a lasting peace this battle in 
korea has been called a lot of fancy names in the past three weeks 
some have said it is merely a police action but try telling a gi 
in the foxholes of korea that he is just a cop on his beat ask the 
wives and mothers of those who are fighting in korea today they 
will tell you there is just one threeletter word for it war 
it is time we face up to reality time we admit we have a 
small war on our hands one we want to end as quickly as possible 
to avoid a worldwide conflagration 
the seriousness of this situation is difficult to 
overemphasize with each new day our newspapers tell of american 
men retreating of our troops outnumbered and outgunned our forces 
are on a peninsula surrounded by water on three sides and by the 
enemy on the fourth an enemy with a force we have underestimated 
korean allies whose strength we have overestimated 
a north korean army with approximately 200000 welltrained 
men attacking us tanks double the size of our own thrown against 
our outnumbered troops at least 150000 chinese communists in the 
vicinity of the korean border prepared to join the north koreans if 
we continue to suffer defeat at their hands 
the soldiers in korea have done a magnificent job when you 
consider their lack of fighting equipment our logistical problem 
is most complex the distances involved are tremendous our enemies 
have a relatively simple problem of supply by merely transporting 
on overland routes it takes no stretch of the imagination to 
realize this could develop into another bataan 
what can we do to end this war now 
my suggestion may result in my being labeled an alarmist or an 
extremist but if it should result in an earlier end to this 
warfare and the saving of american lives as i believe it will 
then i mind not the labels i propose our commanderinchief the 
president of the united states advise the commander of the north 
korean armnies to withdraw his troops to the north side of the 38th 
parallel within one week or use that week to evacuate a named list 
of principal north korean cities which would be subjected to atomic 
attack by our air force 
there are those who will recoil in horror and condemn such 
action but to those i say it is deserving of these people who are 
so morally wrong as to attack peaceful neighbors in the dead of 
night those who will accept the surrender of american boys tie 
their hands behind them and then brutally murder them 
to those who will speak and write against this suggested 
action i ask why not do it now rather than six months from now 
wishing we had done it 
this war is past the wristslapping stage this is not a time 
for wishful thinking the president made a brave move when he sent 
our american forces to korea 
now we are faced with the next step if we lose south korea 
after the steps we have taken our nation will have suffered its 
severest setback in its fight against communism it is not beyond 
the realm of possibility that we could lose south korea if the 
troops of communist china join the affray and we refuse to use all 
the weapons at our command 
we are fighting this battle with one hand tied behind us let 
us use everything we can to end this war now should this war in 
korea continue we can expect it to hearten communist satellites 
throughout the world we can expect similar trouble in yugoslavia 
iran and formosa from the huks in the philippines and an 
intensified attack by the communist forces in indochina 
should this war in korea continue this great and powerful 
nation can find itself fighting a war of containment all over the 
world draining us of manpower and resources communist russia 
during our struggles can continue to let her satellites take the 
losses while building her own atomic stockpile until that fateful 
day when the men in the kremlin decided they are strong enough and 
we are weak enough 
better to let those who would destroy free nations know that 
the united states stands ready to use full military might to stop 
aggression that the atomic bomb awaits those who would violate the 
peace of free men

the farmers almanac expects to see a 
little less snow and a lot less drought next year but what the 
172yearold digest of americana really wants to see less of is 
pennies 
the penny inspiration for homely expressions that have been a 
staple of almanacs since benjamin franklin set up shop a penny 
saved is a penny earned is one has outlived its usefulness 
concludes the 1989 edition of the farmers almanac 
only tradition explains our stubborn attachment to the penny 
but sometimes traditions get ridiculous the almanac says living 
down its reputation as a defender of longheld values 
instead editor ray geiger has proposed a new coin worth 12 
cents or one bit 
i cant think of anything you can buy with a penny the penny 
candy is all a nickel said geiger who with varying degrees of 
success has led the publications previous campaigns to restore 
city names to postmarks eliminate the ninedigit zip code and 
print currency in colors other than green 
you see a penny on the street and you no longer bother to pick 
it up and young children often find its no longer worth their 
time and effort to empty jars of pennies and package them in 
50cent rolls geiger said in a recent interview 
also in the newly released edition is a prediction for another 
cold and mean winter but not as rough as the last one with a 
little less snow in the midwest and the rockies 
the summer of 1989 should be more pleasant with drier than 
average weather but no repeat of this years drought according to 
geiger we didnt predict the drought but neither did anybody 
else he said 
but what really gets geiger heated up is the persistence of the 
penny whose purchasing power has diminished to the point where its 
only uses are making change and collecting sales taxes according 
to the almanac 
the almanacs plan for the bit a name derived from two 
bits the colloquial expression for a quarter takes into 
account the change in monetary values 
this perceives the dollar as being cut into eight equal 
pieces half a dollar is four bits 75 cents is six bits the 
almanac said it points out that while us money is based on the 
decimal system stock markets routinely list prices in increments 
of oneeighth of a dollar 
the us mint churns out billions of pennies each year and the 
almanac suggests that as many as 200 billion of the coins may be 
squirreled away in vaults baby banks cookie jars and shoe boxes 
the almanac says the introduction of the bit would bridge the 
gap between the dime and the quarter for greater flexibility in 
coin combinations that would produce 22 cents 27 cents and so 
forth all the way up to 97 cents 
to promote the idea the almanac suggests a goldtoned coin that 
would be about as thick as a dime midway in size between the 
nickel and the quarter 
the treasury department declined to embrace the recommendation 
saying there has been no groundswell of support for a change 
weve periodically examined the penny and right now the 
department has no plans to eliminate it its still an integral 
part of the coinage system said spokeswoman felice pelosi 
undaunted geiger said he was prepared to travel to washington 
to solicit support for the change 
some people will think this is a nutty idea but they thought 
it was a nutty idea to bring back the old postmark and that was a 
singlehanded victory for the farmers almanac he said 
geigers almanac which is sold to banks insurance companies 
and other businesses for distribution to customers as a promotion 
claims a circulation of more than 5 million 
its 48 pages are a compendium of calendar data household hints 
oneline jokes inspirational messages recipes and of course 
weather predictions derived through a secret formula by the 
almanacs forecaster caleb weatherbee 
geiger who turns 78 this month is marking his 55th year as 
almanac editor a tenure he says ties the record established by the 
original editor of the old farmers almanac a new hampshirebased 
publication founded in 1792

democratic vice presidential candidate lloyd 
bentsen returns to the senate today after a labor day recess spent 
in campaigning that he says surprised him with its ferocity 
i think this is early on to be as aggressive as it is said 
bentsen who had to battle some jeers as he wrapped up a campaign 
trip at the virginia polytechnic institute in blacksburg va on 
tuesday 
mike dukakis the democratic presidential nominee and vice 
president george bush the gop candidate also faced hostile 
elements in their appearances on tuesday 
bentsen was interrupted as he spoke at an outdoor rally at 
virginia tech by students carrying bush posters instead of 
ignoring them bentsen spoke to them directly 
i met george bush once before he told them alluding to the 
1970 texas senate race in which he defeated the thencongressman 
bush and quayle season is opening early this year he said 
afterward bentsen visited with reporters on his campaign jet 
and said he enjoyed the challenge it gets my adrenaline up he 
said 
bentsen told reporters he felt the republicans were running on 
phony issues such as dukakis veto of a bill requiring the 
pledge of allegiance in schools a decision the massachusetts 
governor made based on a supreme court opinion 
the texas senator has been responding by sharpening his own 
attacks on tuesday at virginia tech he said the republicans have 
tried to trash educational opportunity across the country 
we cant make quality education available only to the 
privileged few he said as part of the democrats charge that 
the republicans are unfair to working people 
bentsen planned to spend today in the senate including a 
procedural vote on a politicallysensitive textile trade bill he 
was scheduled to leave the capitol again this evening for a 
1000perperson reception in connecticut to raise money for his 
senate campaign 
under an unusual texas law bentsen is running for both the vice 
presidency and reelection to his senate seat since he cannot drop 
out of the latter without handing the spot to the gop for six 
years if he were to win both races he could then resign from the 
senate and a special election would be held 
bentsens latesummer campaigning has been concentrated in 
texas the south and border states but he planned to begin a more 
wideranging schedule thursday after campaigning in new york on 
thursday he was heading for iowa and then california

the five astronauts who in about 
three weeks will fly the first postchallenger space shuttle 
mission intensified emergency and countdown training here today 
a busy schedule called for them to inspect their shuttle 
discovery and its communications satellite payload on the launch 
pad rehearse an emergency departure from the pad fit their flight 
pressure suits and be briefed on preparations for the launch

launch discovery in the last week of september but wont set a 
firm date until sept 14 following a twoday flight readiness 
review 
commander rick hauck and pilot dick covey scheduled practice 
runway landings today in a jet plane modified to handle like the 
shuttle they had planned to do the flying on tuesday but rain 
forced a postponement 
hauck covey and mission specialists george nelson mike lounge 
and dave hilmers all veteran shuttle fliers arrived here 
yesterday from the johnson space center in houston for three days 
of training culminating on thursday with a countdown test 
for that test the astronauts will board discovery to take part 
in the final two hours of the count rehearsing launchday 
procedures

could be less than three weeks from launch but we are and were 
ready hauck said tuesday 
the space shuttle fleet has been grounded since the loss of 
challenger and its sevenperson crew in an explosion 73 seconds 
after launch on jan 28 1986

the army is studying the potential 
consequences of giving stimulants like amphetamines to soldiers to 
help solve the problem of keeping them alert when they go days 
without sleep a newspaper reported 
officials expect to give stimulants to troops in the field in 
the near future according to a report by the washingtonbased 
walter reed army institute of research which conducted the study 
the san jose mercury news which obtained the report said 
tuesday that similar studies are being conducted by the navy and 
air force 
army spokesman ben smith said the objective is to find drugs 
that can keep soldiers sharp when they are awake for days among 
those under study are amphetamines and stimulants such as 
nicotine the newspaper reported 
smith said concerns about side effects have placed their 
possible use in doubt past research has concluded that extended 
use of amphetamines and their derivatives can lead to paranoia 
hallucinations and violent behavior 
youd love to find the perfect drug that enhances performance 
without side effects smith said but any recommendation about 
what to use would have to come from elsewhere our researchers are 
objective scientists 
the nonclassified research has been under way for about four 
years and is the latest in a series of military studies on jet lag 
and sleep deprivation smith said 
he said the report will be published in the journal 
neuropsychopharmacology published by the university of california 
san diego and will be reviewed at many levels of the military 
research is under way to identify new stimulant drugs that can 
maintain normal alertness and performance in the face of days or 
weeks of partial sleep the report said 
it predicted that in the next decade the studies will no doubt 
provide novel means both behavioral and pharmacological to 
sustain soldier alertness and unit performance according to the 
newspaper 
gregory belenky a walter reed scientist and a principal 
researcher in the study was not available for comment tuesday 
smith said but belenky is not a supporter of amphetamines and is 
not making a case for their use in the report smith said 
army and navy officials say their personnel are not allowed to 
use stimulants or sleepinducing drugs unless prescribed by a 
doctor but in july air force officials acknowledged that some 
pilots use the amphetamine dexedrine 
the officials said the pilots only take the stimulant to stay 
awake on long flights and that it is not used for normal 
daytoday training flights 
in the army experiments subjects were kept awake 48 hours and 
then are given either a placebo or up to 20 milligrams of an 
amphetamine belenky told the mercury news 
use of amphetamines really brought people back to normal 
levels for about 12 hours he said it really sort of restores 
mood it restores performance

government officials said today they 
have no way to distribute millions of dollars in foreign aid to the 
more than 20 million victims of floods that still cover 
threefourths of this impoverished nation 
railroads and highways were washed away bridges were mangled 
and the dhaka airport was still partly under water today and unable 
to receive large planes 
the floods have claimed at least 1267 lives according to 
newspaper reports the government put the death toll at 412 
about 21 million people nearly onefifth of the total 
population have lost their homes according to the government 
with wells and pumps throughout much of the lowlying nation 
under water people have resorted to drinking the very flood water 
that has marooned them thousands of new cases of diarrhea were 
reported each day 
although the government has begun distributing water 
purification tablets its efforts were hampered by flood waters 
that prevented helicopters from landing in some of the worst hit 
areas 
in most places people are marooned it is difficult to supply 
the purification tablets so people will be facing more diarrhea 
typhoid is also possible although we have no reports yet said a 
government relief official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
he said there were no reports of starvation but added there 
is danger of people starving if we cant get food to them in time 
the floods began in june with the arrival of the annual monsoon 
rains 
the waters subsided but rose to new heights aug 27 as heavy 
rains in neighboring india and nepal washed down from the himalayan 
mountains into the ganges and brahmaputra rivers which run through 
bangladesh to the bay of bengal 
the independent bengalilanguage newspaper khobar today reported 
101 deaths in the past 24 hours that were not included in the 
government tally khobar said most of the latest victims drowned or 
died of diarrhea and snake bites 
the governments health control center said tuesday night that 
at least 102000 people throughout the country were known to be 
suffering from diarrhea that count included 10000 cases reported 
in the past 24 hours 
foreign ministry and relief ministry officials said they were 
unable to estimate the total amount of foreign aid offered so far 
however japan has offered 13 million dollars in flood relief 
the united states 36 million and canada 5 million the european 
common market pledged 560000 dollars and other offers continued 
to arrive 
bangladesh one of the poorest and most densely populated 
nations on earth already was slated to receive 2 billion in 
foreign assistance before the floods 
its certainly one of the worlds biggest receivers of foreign 
aid said earling dessau head of the united nations development 
program in bangladesh 
the united nations has 1200 foreign and local staffers working 
in bangladesh the largest un mission in the world desau said 
bangladesh needs 18 million tons of rice a year for food and was 
expected to produce 165 million tons until the flood hit the 
shortfall was covered by imports largely in the form of grants 
from abroad 
but 8 million tons of rice was in the ground when the floods 
struck and the government estimates that at least a fourth of that 
crop has been destroyed how much of the remainder can be saved 
depends on how fast the flood waters recede 
the ganges brahmaputra and meghna rivers the largest in the 
country have started receding but the levels of at least 12 of 
their tributaries has risen the governments flood control center 
said

workers who boycotted official unions 
after solidarity was outlawed should now join those unions instead 
of agitating for their own says government spokesman jerzy urban 
lech walesa called the comment irresponsible and said such 
government utterances could jeopardize roundtable talks at 
which communist authorities have promised to discuss reinstating 
the solidarity independent labor federation which he chairs 
urban in his first news conference since a 19day strike wave 
ended saturday also said tuesday that the talks between government 
officials and worker representatives would be held sometime this 
month 
he said government officials want the meetings to begin as soon 
as possible but that they would be canceled automatically if any 
more political strikes occur 
the last of the strikes ended after walesa won government 
assurances that the legalization of solidarity would be discussed 
in the roundtable talks 
urban said the round table with walesa and other worker 
delegates will include several dozen people and cover speeding 
economic recovery reaching a national consensus improving living 
standards and democratizing poland 
asked about the strikers demand for reinstatement of 
solidarity urban said allowing two trade unions in one plant was 
unacceptable 
if followers of some tendency connected in the past with 
solidarity are a majority in a given plant then they can either 
join the official trade union outnumbering it and directing it 
where they wish or form a coalition a compromise body with the 
official union he said 
the existing legal rules offer a broad scope of 
possibilities he said and solidarity activists made a 
historical mistake in boycotting the new government unions 
created in 1982 after solidarity was outlawed 
urban said a prosolidarity union could be formed in a plant 
where no union existed but it would not be permitted to use the 
name solidarity in the present legal situation 
reached at home in gdansk after urbans news conference walesa 
said let them talk but they should remember that they could 
destroy the round table by such irresponsible statements this is 
all i can say 
solidarity activists say they want their own unions not 
membership in the unions established by the government under the 
1981 martiallaw crackdown 
the official union federation called opzz said it would oppose 
allowing new unions into plants where it is established 
an opzz resolution also said premier zbigniew messners 
government should resign its leaders have said government 
officials should be held personally accountable for economic 
problems that led to last months strikes which affected 20 
enterprises employing 100000 people 
numerous signs in the official press and in speeches at a party 
conference last month have pointed to changes in the government at 
the next parliament session which is expected this month such a 
shakeup would not affect the communist party leadership which 
holds the real power

a guerrilla leader has endorsed 
plans by the rebels political allies to participate in national 
elections in march but still vows military action to complicate 
the election 
leonel gonzalez one of five commanders of the leftist farabundo 
marti national liberation front said tuesday that the rebels 
approve of the plans by the democratic revolutionary front to take 
part in the elections 
that they have decided to participate is an autonomous 
decision that in no way damages the militarypolitical alliance 
but rather strengthens it in light of the current situation he 
said on the rebels clandestine radio venceremos 
the democratic revolutionary front an umbrella organization of 
leftist political organizations linked to the guerrilla army 
announced last month that they would take part in the elections 
the rebels and the leftists have boycotted elections here for 
the past decade contending the balloting was part of a 
usdesigned counterinsurgency effort and that democracy did not 
exist in el salvador 
the rebels have been battling the usbacked government since 
1979 an estimated 65000 people have died during the civil war 
the election likely will be a close contest between el 
salvadors two dominant parties the incumbent christian democrats 
and the conservative republican nationalist alliance 
the rightist alliance known as arena gained control of the 
legislature and twothirds of the countrys municipal governments 
in elections held in march 
incumbent president jose napoleon duarte barred by the 
constitution from another term as president has been diagnosed as 
having terminal liver cancer gonzalez said on radio venceremos 
that the lefts participation is intended to prepare all forces 
for the politically negotiated solution to the war it is a 
correct decision 
but he said we must make the entire electoral process a 
political and military battleground 
our military action will deepen the political crisis and 
complicate the electoral scheme he said 
the guerrillas demand a share of power in what they say would be 
a transition government of broad popular participation the 
government has repeatedly rejected the demand insisting the rebels

defense lawyers appeared grim but 
insisted the trials of remaining defendants in the 7 million wells 
fargo robbery would not be harmed by the guilty pleas of two others 
luz berrios berrios and paul s weinberg accepted plea bargains 
in federal court tuesday and pleaded to reduced charges stemming 
from the 1983 heist the secondlargest in us history 
ms berrios pleaded guilty to conspiring to use some of the 
stolen cash to pay for a toy giveaway in hartford in 1985 weinberg 
pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of transporting some of the 
stolen money in 1984 
its not going to hurt us said attorney leonard weinglass 
who represents juan segarra palmer a harvardeducated lawyer 
accused of being the ringleader of a puerto rican terrorist group 
that claimed responsibility for the robbery prosecutors declined 
comment while the cases of other defendants are pending 
the pleas were made as jury selection began in the trial of 
weinberg ms berrios her husband segarra palmer and four 
others questioning of 165 prospective jurors was expected to begin 
thursday 
authorities say the group los macheteros planned to use the 
money to finance terrorist acts aimed at ending the us 
governments control of puerto rico 
ms berrios told us district judge t emmet clarie that she 
conspired with others in puerto rico to send between 5000 and 
12000 to hartford to pay for toys given away on jan 6 1985 
three kings day the day when people in many latin american 
countries exchange gifts 
assistant us attorney albert s dabrowski said that 
racketeering and other felony charges against ms berrios would be 
dropped at sentencing she faces a maximum penalty of five years in 
prison and a 10000 fine no sentencing date was set 
ms berrios will not testify at the trial of any other wells 
fargo defendants said her attorney jacob wieselman 
weinberg a springfield mass attorney pleaded guilty to a 
misdemeanor charge of aiding and abetting in the transport and 
receipt of less than 100 in stolen money from the heist at a wells 
fargo depot in west hartford on sept 12 1983 he had been charged 
with four felonies 
weinberg admitted to transporting some of the stolen cash from 
pennsylvania through connecticut to springfield but his attorney 
f mac buckley said weinberg had been duped into his role by 
segarra palmer to whom he loaned his truck and trailer 
weinberg faces a maximum penalty of one year in prison and a 
1000 fine he will testify for the government in other cases 
nine other defendants are awaiting trial at a later date after 
the government appeals a ruling by clarie throwing out some 
taperecorded evidence obtained through wiretaps 
three defendants are at large including victor gerena the 
wells fargo security guard who authorities say was recruited by los 
macheteros to carry out the robbery he allegedly fled to cuba with 
4 million 
the government contends that all of the defendants except 
weinberg are salaried members of los macheteros 
authorities believe some of the money is buried in puerto rico 
the only money recovered was the torn halves of a 10 bill

the safe landing of two cosmonauts after two 
aborted attempts comes during a busy year for the soviet manned 
space program with cosmonauts seeking to break their own countrys 
endurance record in an orbiting station 
the soviet union inaugurated manned spaceflight in 1961 and has 
since gained the confidence to televise launches and landings live 
and invite foreigners to climb aboard for a ride as it did with 
the afghan cosmonaut who returned to earth today 
but the tense ordeal of the afghansoviet crew reminded the 
soviets of the dangers of space flight in a similar if less 
tragic way that the explosion of the space shuttle challenger in 
january 1986 sobered us space officials 
we are already used to everything going smoothly in space 
commentator alexander tikhomirov told soviet viewers in a prime 
time television newscast and some forget about the danger which 
space research entails and here this once more convinces us how 
complex a matter it is and what a huge amount of abnormal 
situations awaits cosmonauts in orbit 
whether the problems with the latest mission in which 
malfunctions trapped the the two cosmonauts in orbit as food and 
oxygen dwindled will delay the next ventures in the soviet program 
is unclear 
those ventures include a nov 21 blastoff by a sovietfrench 
crew for a monthlong mission a 1990 voyage with an austrian crew 
member and a later mission with a malaysian crew member 
the most enduring symbol of soviet commitment to manned 
spaceflight has been the orbiting mir space station the research 
complex launched in february 1986 is planned as a permanently 
manned fixture in space 
two cosmonauts have been aboard mir since dec 21 and plan to 
break the 326day space endurance record set by yuri romanenko 
aboard mir last year in june a sovietbulgarian crew spent 10 
days in space including a visit to mir soviet officials also have 
indicated they will launch their own space shuttle unmanned by 
years end they have emphasized the shuttle will not be flown 
manned until it is proven safe 
the candor with which the soviets informed the world of the 
plight of their temporarily stranded crew showed how treatment of 
the space program has changed under soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev it was a far cry from the secrecy in which missions were 
veiled starting with the oct 4 1957 launch of the first 
satellite sputnik 
since yuri gagarin blasted off as the first man in space in 
1961 manned launches have become routine soviet officials now 
show launches and in some cases landings on live television and 
invite foreigners to watch the blastoffs the first live tv 
coverage of a soviet manned space launch was the apollosoyuz 
mission in 1975 the first launch to be shown live of an 
allrussian crew was in 1984 
space has also served political purposes for the soviet union 
prior to the afghan mission the soviets had 13 guest 
cosmonauts aboard their spacecraft in flights that serve to show 
off their scientific prowess and promote friendly ties with other 
countries 
as us officials still grapple with the tragic deaths of the 
seven challenger crew members the soviets have to think back 17 
years to their last fatal space disaster 
three cosmonauts docked with the salyut 1 space station and 
then during reentry on june 30 1971 air leaked out of their 
capsule and they suffocated 
the first and only other fatality in a soviet space flight was 
vladimir komarov his soyuz 1 capsule crash landed april 24 1967 
but soviet officials never explained what exactly went wrong 
western space experts believe six to eight other cosmonauts died 
in training accidents on the ground from 19601975

the stock market now has less factors to make investors 
cautious and their participation finally began to be active

although the volume is not that much yet it has been at least 
inceasing he said adding that the market was regaining its 
strength 
among the issues attracting investors were steels shipbuilding 
and resortrelated stocks 
the dollars decline was widely attributed to the bank of 
japans short term economy forecast tuesday that reported the 
japanese economy has been and will be growing without inflation 
although some securities companies once sold the yen to buy 
the dollar for their profittaking purposes the dollarbuying 
drive in the market was not strong any more said hiroyuki

opposition leader cuauhtemoc cardenas 
suffered another setback in his quest for the presidency when the 
supreme court refused to investigate alleged electoral fraud 
in a unanimous opinion the court said tuesday it could 
intervene in a congressional certification of the election results 
only if irregularities jeopardized the entire vote count 
cardenas the candidate of the leftist national democratic 
front claims the july 6 election was rigged to favor carlos 
salinas de gortari of the governing institutional revolutionary 
party or pri 
official results gave salinas 5036 percent of the vote 
cardenas 3112 percent and clouthier 1707 percent the pri has won 
every presidential race since it was formed in 1929 but never by 
such a narrow margin 
on friday the chamber of deputies begins what are expected to 
be tense sessions to confirm salinas victory 
in a letter to cardenas supreme court president carlos del rio 
rodriguez said the court was empowered to investigate only those 
fraud cases that could place in doubt the legality of the entire 
election process 
his ruling was carried by the excelsior news service 
the decision followed a vigorous defense of salinas victory by 
the pris two highest officials 
this has been the most watchedover election in mexicos 
history said pri secretarygeneral manuel camacho solis he 
rejected the fronts arguments that another vote count would show 
cardenas won 
camacho solis said that even applying the political criteria 
of the front there exists no basis for saying that cuauhtemoc 
cardenas won the election cuauhtemoc cardenas loses in the urban 
areas he loses in the rural areas 
pri president jorge de la vega dominguez accused cardenas and 
national action party candidate manuel clouthier of pressing their 
fraud protests to upset the presidential transition 
salinas is scheduled to be inaugurated dec 1 
the opposition parties in an immoral and perverse attitude 
have been speaking since long before the elections of electoral 
fraud de la vega dominguez said monday they never proved it 
because it never occurred 
their objective is simplistic and puerile the conquest of 
public power through provocation confusion disorder and 
destabilization de la vega dominguez said 
his statements were among the strongest by the pri on the 
opposition since the election

his campaign will prove that the conservative movement isnt 
over

prime minister yitzhak shamir vowed to foil 
palestinian dreams of an independent state but called for a 
dialogue with leaders in the occupied territories as he launched 
his campaign against the rival labor party 
shamir leader of the rightwing likud bloc said tuesday that a 
victory for his party in the nov 1 national elections would put 
an end to the delusions regarding an independent palestinian state 
or a provisional palestinian government 
he said a likud victory also would send a message to all arab 
rioters and the terrorist organizations controlling them that 
they do not stand a chance of fulfilling their goals and plots 
palestinians have been rioting in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip since dec 8 more than 250 palestinians have been 
killed four israelis have died 
israel captured the gaza strip from egypt and the west bank from 
jordan in the 1967 middle east war 
the palestine liberation organization under pressure to fill 
the vacuum left by jordans king hussein when he dropped claims to 
the west bank in july has said it may declare a palestinian state 
in the occupied lands or a government in exile 
about 3000 rightwing supporters some waving israeli flags 
cheered as shamir criticized the leftofcenter labor party which 
advocates trading land for peace with palestinians 
in a bid for crucial support from religious voters the 
nonobservant shamir donned a skullcap at the end of his speech and 
read a special prayer recited before the jewish new year which 
begins next week skullcaps are worn by observant jews 
if elected shamir said he would immediately invite the 
leaders of egypt and jordan and palestinians in judea and samaria 
the biblical names for the occupied west bank and gaza to 
negotiate directly for peace on the basis of the camp david 
agreements which call for limited palestinian autonomy 
each side will be able to raise any issue as long as we dont 
stop talking until all possibilities for peace have been 
exhausted he said 
he said the palestinian uprising had not changed his mind about 
the need to negotiate autonomy 
we know many palestinians are taking part in the acts of 
hostility and hatred against israel shamir said but we also 
know many understand that the path of violence will only heap 
tragedy and suffering upon them 
shamir said likud would step up the construction of jewish 
settlements in the occupied territories until there is absolutely 
no doubt in anyones mind that we have returned to our ancestral 
homeland 
jewish settlement slowed under the current laborlikud coalition 
government because labor opposes jewish settlements in densely 
populated arab areas of the occupied territories 
shamir said his government would strengthen ties between israel 
and the united states and he scorned labor for saying that his 
hardline policies would create a rift with washington 
our relations have never been better or closer than during the 
likud era said shamir

gov dick bryan crushed three 
democratic rivals for the right to challenge sen chic hecht in 
november as the republican senator easily won his partys primary 
vietnam war hero james bo gritz who has made forays into 
southeast asia in search of pows lost his bid for a seat in the 
us house of representatives to republican party activist lucille 
lusk 
with all precincts reporting in tuesdays democratic primary 
bryan 51 garnered 61987 votes or 80 percent none an option 
listed on the ballot came in second with 6991 votes or 9 percent 
trailing the 51yearold governor and none were patrick 
fitzpatrick with 4691 votes or 6 percent manford cave rock 
manny beals with 2651 votes or 3 percent and larry kepler with 
1650 votes or 2 percent 
hecht 59 defeated larry scheffler owner of a graphics 
business in henderson who said he would press for reprocessing 
nuclear waste brought to nevada so that only lowlevel less 
radioactive waste would remain 
hecht had 55352 votes or 82 percent scheffler had 5617 votes 
or 8 percent and 6454 voters or 10 percent favored none 
now the primary is over and were gearing up for this race 
said hecht who is seeking a second term youre going to see the 
most exciting race nevada has ever had 
bryan who is serving his second term said he looked forward 
to the challenge that lies ahead we feel that weve generated 
some momentum but as weve said from the very beginning this is 
going to be a very tough race 
in the gop house primary lusk received 12075 votes or 48 
percent to 10715 votes or 42 percent for gritz and 2562 votes or 
10 percent for retiree john kraft the democratic incumbent jim 
bilbray had no opposition 
we needed a larger voter turnout said gritz 
gritz said of his main opponent lucille would be much better 
in the home than in the house of representatives that is 
ms lusk said she was ready to take on mr bilbray as for 
gritz she said i think what i believe is more believable than 
what he believes 
in the senate race hecht has become known for verbal miscues 
once referring to a nuclear suppository when he meant 
repository and on another occasion saying he had debated 
diametric materialism with a soviet official when he meant 
dialectic 
a recent survey of senate administrative assistants ranked him 
as the least effective senator in washington 
hecht has attacked bryan as being too prolabor and said i 
brought out what this campaign is about the outofstate labor 
bosses want to control the senate 
bryan responded that hecht has resorted to inaccuracies and

his contributions come from labor and hecht was incorrect to say 42 
percent of all contributions came from labor groups

city officials have paid a 192000 fine 
and face milliondollar penalties by weeks end but the mayor says 
prospects look bleak for a quick settlement of an impasse over 
housing desegregation 
im sorry to report that there hasnt been any significant 
movement mayor nicholas wasicsko said tuesday the court is 
standing firm but the councilmen say they want some concessions 
before they comply the two sides are considerably far apart 
meanwhile westchester district attorney carl a vergari 
declined to prosecute the four councilmen who have refused to vote 
for the courtordered housing desegregation plan 
he said he has doubts about the constitutionality of a statute 
which criminalizes the act of voting and he cited gov mario 
cuomos refusal to remove them from office pending court appeals 
vergari had been asked to act by the emergency financial control 
board a state panel that has taken over yonkers finances 
at issue is us district judge leonard sands order that 
yonkers build low and moderateincome housing which grew out of 
sands 1985 finding that yonkers for decades had intentionally 
segregated schools and public housing 
the city schools were desegregated under a plan approved by 
sand and the city council agreed in january to develop 1000 units 
of housing 
but under enormous community pressure four councilmen peter 
chema nicholas longo henry spallone and edward fagan voted aug 
1 to block one portion of the plan 
sand levied escalating fines against the city 100 for the 
first day and doubling every day after that he also fined the 
nayvoting councilmen and threatened them with jail 
the penalties were stayed pending appeal last week the us 
supreme court reinstated the fines against the city with a cap of 
1 million a day but continued the stay of the councilmens 
punishment 
a 192000 fine was paid tuesday if the fines were to continue 
through the week yonkers would owe 204800 by late today by 
friday the city would reach the 1 million daily cap bankruptcy 
would arrive nov 12 according to city officials 
no facetoface meetings took place tuesday but key figures in 
the crisis of the states fourthlargest city were in touch by 
telephone including city council members the national association 
for the advancement of colored people the justice department and 
the offices of cuomo and sand

the reported explosion of a titan 2 rocket 
stage as it fell away from a booster did not prevent four navy spy 
satellites from climbing toward their proper orbits sources said 
the satellites are moving exactly as they should be an air 
force source said tuesday speaking on condition of anonymity 
everything is just peachy 
the satellites were launched from vandenberg air force base 140 
miles northwest of los angeles on monday atop a 103foothigh 
liquidfueled titan 2 the lompoc record newspaper quoting ground 
observers reported tuesday that the titan 2s expended first stage 
apparently blew up in a secondary explosion after separating from 
the boosters second stage the rest of the booster was seen 
continuing skyward 
a second source also insisting on anonymity told the 
associated press that the satellites were not endangered 
neither source could confirm the secondary explosion but said 
they wouldnt necessarily know of such an event if it didnt affect 
deployment of the satellites 
i checked into it and everything i know is positive said 
capt marty hauser an air force public affairs officer at the 
pentagon it went well 
the observers who were very familiar with launch procedures 
believed the crimson flash resulted from a puncture in a nearly 
empty oxidizer tank on the the 375 million rockets first stage 
according to the record 
the newspaper said similar anomalies happened after launches of 
other rockets at vandenberg without preventing their payloads from 
reaching orbit 
capt norma payne a vandenberg spokeswoman would not discuss 
whether an explosion occurred or whether the secret payload reached 
proper orbit 
were not going to comment on the results of a classified 
space flight she said 
space policy expert john pike of the federation of american 
scientists has identified the titan 2s payload as a white cloud 
navy ocean surveillance system of four satellites which would be 
used to listen to the soviet fleets radar and radio communications 
four or five sets of white clouds about 16 to 20 satellites 
already are in orbit with the new set likely meant to replace 
aging white clouds launched in the early 1980s pike said 
the rocket was the first of a series of refurbished titan 2 
intercontinental ballistic missiles to be used as a space booster 
the missiles were originally deployed in silos in arkansas kansas 
and arizona in the 1960s but were removed because of corrosion and 
other aging problems 
the air force decided to refurbish titan 2 as space boosters 
because it was cheaper than building new rockets 
on monday payne called the titan 2 liftoff a spectacular 
launch with all systems operating as expected but said officials 
would not know for two to three days whether the payload achieved 
its intended polar orbit circling the earth from north to south 
poles 
last friday a satellite said to be designed for intercepting 
soviet communications was launched by a 65 million titan 34d 
rocket from cape canaveral fla a source close to the project who 
spoke on condition of anonymity said the satellite failed to 
achieve its desired stationary orbit when the rockets upper stage 
failed to reignite he said there was little hope of salvaging 
that mission

three weeks after the korean war began in 
1950 thenrep lloyd bentsen urged president truman to threaten an 
american atomic attack on principal north korean cities if the 
invading communist forces did not withdraw from south korea 
bentsen now the democratic vice presidential candidate but then 
a freshman congressman was among the first washington figures to 
advocate use of nuclear weapons in korea others were to speak out 
in agreement but neither president truman nor later president 
eisenhower ever voiced their support 
in an interview tuesday bentsen said he is older and wiser 
now and would not do the same again 
north korean troops invaded south korea on june 25 1950 
american and south korean troops were caught by surprise and 
suffered heavy casualties as they retreated 
in remarks to the house of representatives on july 12 1950 
bentsen said the president should make clear that the united 
states stands ready to use full military might to stop aggression 
that the atomic bomb awaits those who would violate the peace of 
free men 
my suggestion may result in my being labeled an alarmist or an 
extremist he said but if it should result in an earlier end 
to this warfare and the saving of american lives as i believe it 
will then i mind not the labels 
bentsen then just 29 years old said we are fighting this 
battle with one hand tied behind us let us use everything we can 
to end this war now he drew cheers in the house with the 
speech says the edition of facts on file for that week 38 
years ago 
bentsen now 67 and the senior senator from texas called for a 
difficult and deadly decision by truman as communist troops pushed 
american and united nations forces back 
i propose our commanderinchief the president of the united 
states advise the commander of the north korean armies to withdraw 
his troops to the north side of the 38th parallel within one week 
or use that week to evacuate a named list of principal north korean 
cities which would be subjected to atomic attack by our air 
force bentsen said 
there are those who will recoil in horror and condemn such 
action he added to those who will speak and write against 
this suggested action i ask why not do it now rather than six 
months from now wishing we had done it 
bentsen repeated his sentiments before cameras on the capitol 
steps and a film clip appeared in a 1982 documentary the atomic 
cafe 
fifteen days after bentsens suggestion truman answered a flat 
no when asked if he were considering the use of nuclear weapons 
in korea but after the chinese entered the war in november 1950 
trumans public stance changed there has always been active 
consideration of its use he said of the atomic bomb 
bentsen explaining his stance in the interview tuesday said 
eisenhower used that same threat to bring the north koreans to 
bargain 
at the time you have to remember we were losing 50000 
americans and the marines were really being booted around and we 
were being kicked off the peninsula he said so you have to 
put it in the time period and at that time we controlled the 
bomb 
asked if he would do the same now he answered i must say 
im an older and wiser man 
bentsen spokesman mike mccurry said the dukakis campaign was 
aware of bentsens remarks when dukakis chose him as his running 
mate 
the korean war was to last until july 27 1953 when a truce 
began as the first step in peace talks us losses were put at 
54660 killed and 103284 wounded 
questions of age and judgment have been raised in the 1988 
presidential campaign by bentsen who has suggested that the 
republican vice presidential nominee 41yearold sen dan quayle 
of indiana is not seasoned enough to be a heartbeat from the 
presidency

army trucks loaded with armed troops 
patrolled the capitals main streets today with orders to shoot 
looters who were sacking government buildings factories and 
warehouses 
the us embassy in rangoon ordered an evacuation of 95 american 
dependents as a precautionary measure said ross petzing the 
us embassy spokesman in bangkok there were no reports that any 
of the approximately 55 us embassy staff members would leave 
diplomatic sources said the italian israeli and several other 
small embassies sent out dependents in recent days and that the 
japanese and larger western embassies were considering evacuations 
petzing said the first group of 45 americans would arrive in 
bangkok on thursday if the airport in rangoon was open 
antigovernment forces have called for a nationwide strike 
thursday to press demands for an interim government and democracy 
and it was believed airport workers would join in the work stoppage 
the streets are deserted people are pretty much in fear of 
their property things have pretty much closed down said a 
western diplomat in rangoon there is a widespread perception 
that things have deteriorated 
today was the first time in nearly three weeks that the military 
presence has been obvious in rangoon where there was looting 
tuesday 
as the troops rolled in the city staterun rangoon radio 
announced that the defense forces and the peoples police force 
shall open fire to impose control should they find that these 
looters bent on violence continue their acts 
it was the first stern warning about intervention to stop 
looting which began outside the city several weeks ago 
radio rangoon said its warning does not concern those people 
who are demonstrating peacefully referring to prodemocracy 
demonstrations against the threeweekold government of president 
maung maung 
looters broke into the customs department warehouse a building 
of the education department and soap and textile factories thieves 
were spotted carrying away air conditioners and office equipment 
from the rangoon office of the un food and agriculture 
organization 
a livestock and poultry farm near the citys airport also was 
pilfered 
many residents closed the doors of their homes and shops and 
traffic was minimal 
the western diplomat said the looting was probably the act of 
desperate and poor people taking advantage of the breakdown of law 
and order rather than an antigovernment move other analysts 
believe disorder is being purposely stoked by authorities to 
justify further crackdowns 
protesters blame the burma socialist program party for 26 years 
of repression and inept ecoomic policies that have turned burma 
into one of the worlds poorest nations 
ne win who seized power in a military coup 26 years ago blamed 
student unrest in march and june in part for his decision to resign 
in july he was replaced by sein lwin whose appointment sparked 
riots in which hundreds of people died 
sein lwin resigned after 17 days and was replaced by maung 
maung burmas first civilian leader since the coup but protests 
have continued 
despite a crumbling administration defections from the ruling 
party and signs of dissatisfaction within the powerful military 
the government has refused to budge from its plan for the party 
leadership to meet monday to consider organizing a referendum on 
ending oneparty rule 
on tuesday 187 foreign ministry employees resigned from the 
ruling party to protest the governments refusal to bow to the 
peoples demands 
also today a government newspaper accused a former army major 
of using his influence to lure to their deaths 20 students and 
buddhist monks who were behind many of the protests against 26 
years of authoritarian rule 
the working peoples daily said that zau htaung a former army 
major offered a cash bounty for the heads of students and monks 
it said zau htaung persuaded residents of a rangoon suburb to lure 
to a biscuit factory the students and monks who were members of a 
local vigilance committee 
it said zau htaung and 40 other people involved in the deaths 
fled after being attacked by a mob but it said 38 of them were 
captured 
the newspaper did not say whether zau htaung acted on his own 
initiative or why he had allegedly organized the killings

the federal government has gone to court 
to try to confiscate nearly 50000 condoms it says are defective 
the case is believed to mark the first time the federal food and 
drug administration has sought to seize a batch of condoms for 
destruction 
the us attorneys office filed suit in us district court 
here on tuesday asking the court to order the us marshal to seize 
the condoms from the warehouse of mentor corp of minneapolis 
the seizure would include about 44350 condoms from a batch of 
contraceptives made for mentor by an east coast factory said 
assistant us attorney roylene champeaux 
the fda routinely tests condoms every three months before they 
leave manufacturers warehouses if more than three condoms of a 
batch of 1000 leak the batch is declared substandard said mentor 
spokesman al mannino 
previously manufacturers were allowed to destroy the condoms 
and file affidavits with the fda stating they had been destroyed 
he said 
but the fda is now taking a much tougher approach to condom 
quality control government health experts have advised use of 
condoms as a preventive measure against the spread of aids or 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
judge paul magnuson is expected to sign the seizure order later 
this week champeaux said mentor will have until nov 10 to 
contest the seizure according to the governments complaint if 
mentor does not file a claim for the return of the condoms the 
government will destroy them champeaux said 
that would be fine that would save us the cost of destroying 
them said mannino who said he was baffled by the governments 
action 
fda inspectors declared the mentor batch defective aug 1 
mannino said 
mentor which has headquarters in minnesota and santa barbara 
calif makes a variety of implantable devices and health care 
products

school maintenance workers hiked the 
heat to 120 degrees hoping to get rid of a pesky mold but the heat 
ended up killing plants and lab animals and sending students in 
search of cooler classrooms 
officials arriving at lakewood high school tuesday morning 
walked into a stifling heat that had been simmering for three days 
in the schools science wing floors buckled students plants 
withered away tanks of tropical fish perished as did a turtle a 
snake and at least one favorite lab rat 
there were many students and a teacher who were emotionally 
attached to that rat science department chairman richard 
henderson said tuesday afternoon when the wing had cooled down to 
a balmy 90 degrees 
lakewood principal barbara broughton said she feared computers 
films and other materials also may have been damaged by the heat 
workers turned on the heating system in the science wing in an 
attempt to dry the area ms broughton said the wing has been 
experiencing a persistent mold problem in recent years because a 
ventilation system has failed to properly dehumidify the building 
she said 
by raising the temperature workers hoped to kill the mold 
spores and alleviate the problem 
but ms broughton said she and her teachers were not warned and 
animals and plants were not moved 
as soon as students walked in here they knew something 
wasnt right henderson said it really was unbearable 
school officials scrambled to find cooler rooms for tuesdays 
classes but expected rooms to be cool enough to be used today 
maintenance workers wont know for several days whether the heat 
treatment solved the mold problem said carol jackson public 
information officer for the pinellas county schools

an elementary school that draws most of 
its pupils from public housing projects will soon require students 
to wear uniforms the schools principal said 
parents who refuse to have their children wear the required 
attire will face having their children transferred to another 
school school officials said 
however william olds executive director of the connecticut 
civil liberties union said requiring uniforms in a public school 
is blatantly unconstitutional olds said he doesnt believe the 
school system could legally transfer a pupil for failing to comply 
with the dress code 
although the dress code doesnt take effect until oct 3 at 
least a dozen boys came to school tuesday wearing what will be 
their required attire gray pants white shirts green ties and 
brown or black shoes 
the girls wanted their dresses today too but we told them 
theyd have to wait said jeffie frazier principal of the helene 
grant school which has about 300 students in kindergarten through 
fourth grade 
girls will have to wear white blouses white socks and dark 
shoes 
the dress code is part of an effort to build selfesteem and end 
clothing competition frazier said the idea has been so 
successful she said that 51 families have added their names to a 
waiting list to enroll their children in the school 
parents who have difficulty affording the uniforms can get 
financial aid from community organizations frazier said 
schools superintendent john dow jr said he enthusiastically 
supports the new dress code if it proves successful school 
officials added it may be expanded to other schools 
about 50 public schools around the nation have adoped dress 
codes among them schools in baltimore washington dc and perth 
amboy nj according to state and national education officials

mohammed ali hamadi gloated after 
a us navy diver was murdered during the hijacking of a twa 
jetliner an american witness testified today at hamadis trial on 
air piracy and murder charges 
the witness peter w hill was one of 39 americans held hostage 
for 17 days aboard twa flight 847 in june 1985 after it was seized 
on a flight from athens to rome and diverted to beirut us navy 
diver robert stethem was shot and killed during the ordeal 
hill 60 testified that after stethem was killed hamadi 
started talking to him hamadi gloating said this is the gun 
that killed him stethem he seemed quite proud of it 
hill said that was the only time he saw hamadi with the gun in 
his hand 
hamadi has admitted he was one of the hijackers but denies 
killing stethem saying he tried to prevent the slaying 
hill who lived in hoffman estates ill at the time of the 
hijacking was the first american to testify at hamadis trial 
hill who worked for a west german travel agency was directing a 
holy land tour for chicagoarea residents 
he said passengers were forced to put their heads between their 
knees for nearly six hours after the flight was hijacked and that 
some were abused 
i was conscious that some passengers were being abused 
physically i couldnt see it because my head was between my knees 
but i heard the sound of slapping hill testified 
later when two men were brought back to the economy class i 
became aware that they had been subjected to a horrible beating 
hill said identifying them as passengers curt carlson and stethem 
i could see that mr stethem had been severely beaten 
later hill said i heard a muffled sound from the forward 
department i am somewhat of an expert on small arms and i 
determined that it was a gunshot i feared the worst 
stethems body was then thrown onto the beirut airport runway 
hill testified that flight 847 pilot john testrake of richmond 
mo told him a young man stethem was brutally murdered 
every time i think of it even after three years i am very 
affected hill said his voice shaking with emotion 
stethems father richard took notes during hills testimony 
and his mother patricia listened with her head bowed 
hill said shortly after the murder 12 men dressed in soldiers 
uniforms came aboard the plane there was definite comradery 
between these men which we later learned were from amal and the 
hijackers 
he added that the hijackers robbed everyone on the plane taking 
money and jewelry from the passengers they became common 
thieves common pirates and they were drooling over their gains 
during testimony tuesday hamadi repeated his claims of 
innocence involving stethems death but he refused to identify the 
accomplice who he says shot the sailor 
i already said the other one of his accomplices was 
responsible and he was the murderer hamadi said 
our orders were not to kill we were told to hijack the plane 
to force it to land and to state our demands but not to kill 
hamadi said he refused to say who issued the orders 
transcripts of tapped telephone calls introduced in court 
suggested that hamadi a lebanese shiite moslem received help from 
iran in covering his tracks after the hijacking 
the court heard transcripts of two calls hamadi made from iran 
to his older brother abbas who was living in west germany they 
indicated hamadi was in iran for at least three months after the 
hijacking 
in a telephone call from iran on oct 13 1985 mohammed hamadi 
told his brother he was going back to beirut the next day but abbas 
hamadi warned him he would be arrested because he was wanted by 
us authorities 
were going on a military plane to syria and then were taking 
a military car to beirut mohammed hamadi said 
when abbas hamadi asked him who told him that mohammed hamadi 
replied the revolutionary guards told me referring to irans 
paramilitary troops 
prosecutors say mohammed hamadi was a member of hezbollah a 
radical lebanese shiite moslem group backed by iran that is 
believed to be holding foreign hostages in lebanon hamadi has 
denied being a member of the group 
hamadi was arrested on jan 13 1987 at frankfurt airport when 
customs inspectors found explosives in his luggage he went on 
trial here after west germany refused a us extradition request 
in april a west german court sentenced abbas hamadi to 13 years 
in prison for kidnapping two west german businessmen in beirut in 
an unsuccessful bid to gain his brothers release from prison

authorities are investigating an israeli 
general for complicity in a draftdodging scam that has raised a 
furor in this country israel radio reported today 
investigators were looking into the activities of the reserve 
general as well as two majors believed to be ringleaders in the 
scheme the radio said it did not provide their names 
the disclosure of the inquiry monday shocked many in this 
country where the army is seen as a sacred institution and its 
soldiers as heroes for defending the tiny nation against arab 
enemies 
police also arrested a new suspect in the case the radio said 
the suspect a tel aviv doctor whose name was not given was 
reportedly charged with forging medical reports for draftdodgers 
he was at least the second physician implicated in the scam 
an army official who insisted on anonymity said he could not 
confirm or deny the radio report but added now that the 
investigation is no longer undercover it is widening so far at 
least 17 people have been arrested and the army said it was 
pursuing dozens more 
renaan gissin deputy army spokesman said the draftdodging 
scheme was uncovered monday with the arrest of 16 people including 
highranking officers and doctors and touches on the very essence 
of the israeli defense forces the sacred principle here is to do 
military service 
he said two lieutenant colonels two majors and an orthopedic 
surgeon were among the first group arrested 
reports said monday that about 60 people had paid thousands of 
dollars to escape the draft or reserve service but newspapers 
reported tuesday that several hundred people may be involved 
this is just the tip of the iceberg gissin said the last 
word has not been said 
the scheme which investigators say started in november 
reportedly involved falsified medical statements and tampering with 
army computers to show men excused from reserve duty 
in israel a nation of 41 million both men and women are 
drafted at age 18 after their three years of duty men do reserve 
service of up to 62 days a year until age 55 women serve two years 
and reserve duty is not obligatory 
avoiding service has long been a social taboo and many 
employers ask applicants to prove they served in the army 
news of the scandal has prompted scathing editorials in many 
israeli newspapers 
the englishlanguage jerusalem post said today the uncovering 
of an entire network whose beneficiaries may have run into the 
hundreds poses a new problem for the army it urged against 
crying havoc but called for greater vigilance in preventing 
the recurrence of draft evasion 
 
there are virtually no conscientious draft resisters in israel 
and fewer than 300 people have refused service during the last 
decade in controversial operations in lebanon or the occupied lands 
since dec 8 palestinians in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip have been in revolt against israels 21year occupation more 
than 255 palestinians and four israelis have been killed 
defense minister yitzhak rabin on tuesday described the 
draftdodging scandal as an aberration but said he would order a 
full investigation of the medical exemption system 
we have to remove this disease from the healthy body of the 
army with all means available he said on israel television 
parallel to that we have to examine our means of supervision in 
the defense system 
politicians on both ends of the political spectrum went further 
urging reevaluation of israeli society at a time when values of 
the countrys pioneer days are being lost 
we must all do a selfevaluation about the type of society 
were building here a society where everything can be bought with 
power or money said gad yatsiv of the leftwing mapam party 
geula cohen of the rightwing tehiya party said the corruption 
displayed in the latest scandal was rooted in an atmosphere of 
materialism and abandonment of the ideals of national 
responsibility

law enforcement agencies have formed a task 
force to investigate the slayings of 30 women since 1985 saying 
they were modeling their effort on washington states green 
river task force 
a task force consisting of detectives and prosecutors has been 
working informally since june and was formally appointed thursday 
san diego county sheriffs sgt liz foster said tuesday 
authorities in both san diego and seattle have denied published 
reports that there is any conclusive link between the san diego 
slayings and the 48 deaths attributed to the green river killer 
socalled because many of the bodies were found near the 
seattlearea river 
in both series of killings the victims were mostly prostitutes 
or transients san diego investigators believe at least 10 of the 
30 unsolved slayings since 1985 are the work of one killer the 
most recent green river killings occurred in 1984 
foster said the task force began working informally after 
several meetings between sheriffs officials and members of the 
green river task force 
san diego county prosecutors reportedly are obtaining computers 
for the task force because their seattle counterparts recommended 
it the san diego union reported 
the slayings in washingtons king county are the nations worst 
unsolved series of killings forty bodies were found around seattle 
and portland ore and an additional eight women are missing and 
feared victims

a county judge has barred a woman from 
obtaining an abortion during a divorce proceeding calling her 
estranged husbands bid to block the procedure a type of custody 
fight 
the ruling tuesday blocks shawn k lewis who is about three 
months pregnant from aborting the fetus conceived after she filed 
for divorce from carlton j lewis 
lewis had sought the order claiming that as the father he was 
entitled to a say in what happens to the fetus mrs lewis could 
face 45 days in jail and a 100 fine for contempt of court if she 
defies the order 
genesee county circuit judge valdemar washington in a 17page 
ruling said he issued the injunction because the couple had filed 
for divorce and the case falls squarely within the jurisdiction 
of divorce proceedings 
in this courts view this is not a case of mothers right to 
terminate pregnancy versus fathers rights to veto pregnancy 
washington said 
once that divorce filing occurred an additional 
responsibility was placed on the court to look into the interests 
of any minor children that the parties may have 
he said no michigan court has ruled on when a fetus becomes a 
child so he must consider the case a custody fight as if the child 
already was born 
her attorneys said they will seek an emergency hearing before 
the state court of appeals 
im very disappointed said linda pylypiw who represented 
the woman on behalf of the american civil liberties union i 
dont believe washington ruled on any of the constitutional 
issues 
pylypiw said a woman has a right under the 14th amendment which 
guarantees a right to privacy to choose abortion during the first 
trimester of her pregnancy 
steven moss attorney for lewis hailed the ruling but said it 
would be decided ultimately by higher courts 
washington had granted a temporary order halting the abortion 
aug 8 after considering written arguments he made the order 
permanent tuesday 
the hometown of the couple who are in their 20s has not been 
disclosed 
the couple have a 16monthold child who is living with mrs 
lewis

the forthcoming us presidential election is disproving the 
predictions made earlier by commentators who felt that it would 
fail to arouse much popular interest being viewed by most as a 
hohum contest between a candidate who was seen as little more than 
a yesman to the present incumbent and an opponent perceived to 
be as charismatic as a word processor the increasingly 
popular sport of quayling which involves beating about the bush 
to flush out the republican vice presidential candidates 
peccadillos which the media considers fair game to take pot shots 
at has helped allay such qualms

the supreme court today refused to 
review the death sentences of two sikhs convicted in the 1984 
assassination of prime minister indira gandhi news reports said 
press trust of india quoted a threejudge panel as saying it 
found no reason to review the aug 3 judgment upholding the murder 
convictions and death sentences 
satwant singh and kehar singh have no legal appeal left but 
they can ask president ramaswamy venkataraman for mercy if the 
president turns down their pleas they will be hanged 
the two and a third sikh balbir singh were convicted of 
murder and conspiracy by a trial court in january 1986 the 
sentence was upheld by the delhi high court in december of that 
year 
the supreme court acquitted balbir singh in july saying 
evidence against him was scanty 
we have examined and reexamined every material on record 
press trust quoted the judges as saying we see no reason to 
entertain the review petitions 
the three sikhs were not related singh which means lion in the 
punjabi language is added to every male sikhs name by doctrine of 
the faith 
mrs gandhi was shot and killed in the garden of her new delhi 
residence on oct 31 1984 by satwant singh and beant singh both 
members of her security staff beant singh was shot by other guards 
minutes later and satwant singh was wounded 
beants uncle kehar singh and balbir singh a policeman were 
arrested on charges of conspiracy 
the assassination was apparently in revenge for an army attack 
mrs gandhi ordered on the golden temple sikhisms holiest shrine 
which was being used as a base by militants fighting for an 
independent sikh state 
the campaign mainly in the northern state of punjab still 
lingers and has claimed more than 1800 lives this year sikhs 
comprise 2 percent of indias 800 million people but they are in a 
majority in punjab a rich agriculture state bordering pakistan

fruit growers turned on their irrigation 
systems to help fight a fire that exploded by 25000 acres in 24 
hours threatening washingtons important apple crop 
the irrigation systems helped keep the fastgrowing dinkleman 
fire from jumping the entiat river on tuesday the last major 
barrier between the flames and this central washington town of 400 
residents 
they started up the irrigation systems around their homes 
said nick mickel of the state department of natural resources 
the irrigation stopped the flames 
that was a major factor in slowing the spread down along the 
entiat river mickel said that saved those orchards from being 
damaged 
the fire is concentrated in a narrow canyon in the cascade 
mountains near the columbia river and has raced through heavy 
timber and tinderdry grass along the hillsides the blaze 
believed to be humancaused grew from about 160 acres monday 
by nightfall tuesday the fire had burned between 25000 and 
30000 acres destroyed one house and forced the evacuation of a 
dozen others state officials also closed a 40mile stretch of us 
97 between chelan and wenatchee because of heavy smoke but 
reopened it late tuesday night 
there were no reports of the fire blowing up overnight us 
forest service spokesman ron dehart said today a total of 1100 
firefighters and more retardantdropping aircraft were expected 
today 
the lush green fruit orchards that run for miles along the 
opposite bank of the entiat river remained undamaged the orchards 
are the backbone of the local economy and would take years to 
replace 
the heavy moisture that collects in the trees and underlying 
grass from the irrigation makes the orchards a natural firebreak 
mickel said 
the chelan county sheriffs department asked growers along a 
fivemile stretch of the river to turn on their sprinklers monday 
night mickel said many sprinklers remained on tuesday morning 
and growers also used hoses to wet down the roofs of farmhouses 
near the flames 
at some points the flames were just 400 feet from homes 
climbing spectacularly up the trunks of trees and heavy smoke 
blanketed the entire canyon 
bill self the owner of entiat natural orchards credited quick 
action by firefighters rather than his irrigation system for 
saving his house packing shed and trees 
embers flying across the river ignited vegetation above his 
property and winds pushed the flames down toward the buildings he 
said 
several helicopters and 50 ground crew with bulldozers came 
within five minutes self said they brought everybody up here 
and saved the farm 
lots of people complain about where their tax dollars go but 
ill gladly pay my taxes for this kind of service self said

tourists casually packed 
their cars and evacuated the old faithful complex today as a 
windblown wildfire roared less than a mile away while a river of 
fire flowed within feet of two small towns on yellowstones 
northern border 
it was the first time in yellowstones 116year history that 
evacuations had been ordered near old faithful park officials said 
the tourists at old faithful couldnt see any flames today 
because a ridge blocked their view but park spokeswoman marsha 
karle said the smoke in the park made it harder and harder to 
breathe 
the 500 to 600 visitors and nonessential employees at the hotel 
and campground complex near the parks most popular attraction were 
ordered to leave for safety reasons and to allow firefighters the 
access they need to protect structures says spokeswoman joan 
anzelmo 
this is not a panic at all she said 
wendy morrison of scottsdale ariz said a bellman knocked on 
her door at 645 am and told her the national park service was 
evacuating the area 
we kind of figured it was coming so it was not too much of a 
shock morrison said we got in yesterday and were planning to 
stay through tomorrow 
winds gusting to 30 mph pushed the 144700acre north fork blaze 
to within threequarters of a mile of the complex early today 
embers carried by the wind started spot fires even nearer to the 
famed geyser 
firefighters in cooke city mont where the giant storm creek 
fire surged out of the park hoped today that a stiff west wind 
wouldnt shift enough to fan the flames across a 20foot firebreak 
separating the fire from the tiny tourist towns of cooke city and 
silver gate at the parks northeast corner 
overnight wind blew parallel to the narrow eastwest firebreak 
and firefighters channeled the fire past the northern edge of 
silver gate 
by this morning the fires leading edge was past silver gate 
and within a quarter mile of cooke city but still following the 
10 to 20footwide firebreak channel 
sked how close the fire was to buildings fire information 
officer dave mcmorran said zero its right up behind the 
buildings 
officials hoped the fires scorched path would protect the towns 
from a return 
at the old faithful complex officials are confident they can 
protect structures from the advancing flames these include the 
historic wooden old faithful inn two other lodges hundreds of 
cabins a general store a service station and a clinic 
on tuesday soldiers laid a 4000foot irrigation line to wet 
down the area to divert the flames 
the blaze is among 13 major fires that have burned roughly 1 
million acres this summer in yellowstone and the surrounding 
national forests in wyoming montana and idaho inside the 22 
millionacre park 634000 acres are charred 
firefighters wetted down buildings in cooke city and silver gate 
as the 63000acre storm creek fire surged out of the park both 
towns with a combined yearround population of 150 were ordered 
evacuated earlier tuesday as the fire threatened from 1 miles away 
windblown embers landed on buildings but were quickly doused by 
firefighters who waged a nightlong effort to save the community 
some firefighters sprayed rooftops just above a portable sign 
that read give it hell guys it aint over til its over 
firefighters cut silver gates power tuesday night to prevent 
the downing of live power lines the town was lit only by 
spotlights and the orange glow of the spot fire 200 yards away was 
bright enough to read by 
david liebersbach fire commander at silver gate estimated 
firefighters had a 25 percent chance of saving the town 
other montana fires also forced evacuations 
the 66000plusacre canyon creek fire in westcentral montana 
grew so quickly that officials had no accurate idea of its size 
said jane weber of the lewis and clark national forest the growth 
prompted an evacuation of an undetermined number of cabins 
more than 30 cabins southwest of augusta were ordered evacuated 
weber said to the southwest across the scapegoat wilderness the 
canyon creek fire forced evacuations north of ovando about 75 
miles northwest of helena and officials evacuated about 10 homes 
near a new fire eight miles west of glacier national park 
in southwest montana firefighters began evacuating 12 to 15 
homes west of darby as the little rock creek fire spread to more 
than 1000 acres in the bitterroot national forest the fire was 
about two miles from darby today but the town was not considered 
threatened said fire information officer paul gyles 
gov ted schwinden on tuesday banned all outdoor recreation 
outside montanas cities and towns due to the fire danger 
elsewhere a fire in parched grass and pine in central 
washington exploded from 160 acres monday to more than 25000 acres 
tuesday sending firefighters fleeing destroying at least one 
house and forcing the evacuation of a dozen others state officials 
closed but later reopened 40 miles of nearby us 97 due to 
smoke 
the fire the largest of several in washington burned toward 
some of the states prime fruit orchards 
in idaho wind whipped a fire in the nez perce national forest 
from 25900 acres monday to 36780 by tuesday night 
campgrounds were evacuated about 225 miles north of san 
francisco in the king mountain range where a 1150acre fire was 
burning and firefighters continued today to mop up the remnants of 
wildfires that blackened more than 25000 acres in southern 
california forests and grassland also burned in oregon and utah 
the boise interagency fire center the coordinating office for 
firefighting in the west said fires this year have charred 365 
million acres an area larger than connecticut slightly more than 
2 million of the acres are in alaska during the last big fire 
season 1985 28 million acres burned the fire center has called 
this the worst fire season in 30 years

the us public health system is sick and will 
get sicker unless americans stop taking it for granted and demand 
more from themselves and their leaders a national academy of 
sciences report concluded today 
we have slackened our public health vigilance nationally and 
the health of the public is unnecessarily threatened as a result 
said the report by the academys institute of medicine public 
health is a vital function that is in trouble 
our guard is now down richard d remington told a news 
conference at which the report was released the american people 
must understand that everyones health will suffer in the long run 
if we do not take care now to rebuild the capability of and 
confidence in our public health agencies 
remington chairman of the committee that conducted the study 
is a professor of preventive medicine and environmental health at 
the university of iowa 
rather than dwell on specific health problems the 218page 
report offers a blueprint for structural changes and attitude 
shifts at federal state and local levels to shore up the system in 
general 
it said the nation is on the verge of falling victim to past 
successes noting that many of the major improvements in the 
health of the american people have been accomplished through public 
health measures 
but the public has come to take the success of public health 
for granted it said 
the panel cited aids and access to health care for the indigent 
as examples of immediate crises 
at the same time it said lingering problems with equally 
great significance for the health of the public and the wellbeing 
of our society require continuing attention 
it gave four examples 
injuries which kill 140000 of the 70 million americans hurt 
each year they are the leading cause of death for children and 
young adults 
teenage pregnancy pregnant teenagers have higher rates of 
miscarriages complications stillbirths infant and maternal 
deaths than pregnant adults and their surviving children are more 
likely to suffer injuries and also more likely to be hospitalized 
by age 5 than children of adult mothers 
high blood pressure despite improvements hypertension still 
afflicts about 60 million americans and makes them susceptible to 
strokes and heart disease 
smoking and substance abuse smoking is the single greatest 
cause of premature death in this country the report said citing 
estimates that smoking contributes to as many as 225000 deaths a 
year from coronary heart disease 100000 from cancers and 20000 
from lung disease 
in a third category the institute cited toxic substances and 
alzheimer disease as time bombs that will require increasing 
attention in coming years 
the panel said there is plenty of blame to go around for 
continuing public health problems and that solutions will 
require a comprehensive strategy and a strong commitment on the 
part of the entire society 
many of the problems are with health professionals and 
politicians the report said 
public support always fragile because of limited awareness 
is increasingly being eroded by controversy it said 
and while faulting the tendency of elected officials to react 
or overreact only to crises the report did not clear health 
professionals saying they ignore the political implications of 
health care at the publics peril 
many public health professionals who talked with us seemed to 
regard politics as a contaminant of an ideally rational 
decisionmaking process rather than as an essential element of 
democratic governance it said 
making clear it believes that public health protection should 
apply to the more than 30 million uninsured or underinsured 
americans the panel said the ultimate responsibility for 
assuring equitable access to health care for all through a 
combination of public and private sector action rests with the 
federal government 
it also said geography should be no more of a barrier than lack 
of money 
no citizen from any community no matter how small or remote 
should be without identifiable and realistic access to benefits of 
public health protection it said

illegal dumpers of syringes blood vials and 
other infectious medical wastes face stiffer penalties under 
legislation signed into law today by new york gov mario cuomo 
the bill is part of a state effort to stem the flow of medical 
trash that washed ashore on several new york city and long island 
beaches in recent months forcing the temporary closure of several 
popular shores during the hottest summer in decades 
cuomo called this years descriptions of the floating debris 
shocking and said the incidents threaten the livelihood of 
thousands who work at our beaches and the enjoyment of the millions 
of new yorkers who use the beaches for recreation 
under the bill approved by cuomo penalties of up to four years 
in jail and fines of up to 50000 could be brought against people 
convicted of illegally disposing of the socalled red bag medical 
wastes the debris is dubbed that because its supposed to be 
thrown out in specially marked containers 
cuomo also said he signed a companion bill today that provides 
2 million to pay for stepped up enforcement of the infectious 
waste disposal rules by the state departments of environmental 
conservation and parks recreation and historic preservation 
the legislation is designed to put teeth into regulations 
recently established by the state environmental conservation and 
health departments those new rules are designed to provide 
cradle to grave tracking of the medical wastes and to make sure 
that discarded infectious materials are clearly marked to make 
tracing easier

the kennebec journal augusta maine on george bush 
environmentalist 
standing on the shore of lake erie george bush spoke these 
remarkable words i am an environmentalist 
the words were remarkable because the reagan administration 
which he has served faithfully for eight years has regarded 
environmentalist as something close to a dirty word 
on no other issue even irancontra is george bush so 
vulnerable to serious sustained criticism by his democratic 
opponents 
until this year he has never even murmured a dissent against 
the policies of a president who came into office maintaining that 
trees cause pollution while appointing james second coming 
watt as interior secretary who later disclosed he thought we 
should use up all available natural resources while there was still 
time 
the reagan record on the environment is not merely dismal it is 
repellent

watertown sd public opinion on the pledge of allegiance in 
schools 
indeed its difficult to believe that two grownups running for 
president in this perilous age have nothing better to argue about 
than whether school children should recite the pledge of allegiance 
the pledge of allegiance is an emotional issue those who 
believe children should have the right to recite it in unison want 
to instill patriotism in our youth 
but those who believe children should not be forced to take an 
oath have an equally important goal to protect freedom of belief 
both sides have a strong point to make who can say which side 
is right the founding fathers arent available for comment on the 
issue

nashville tenn banner on congressional reform 
the pentagon has come under heavy criticism and close scrutiny 
deservedly so for procurement scandals and information peddling 
by consultants and lobbyists 
but last week defense secretary frank carlucci tossed the ball 
back to congress serving notice that if chances for abuse are to 
be reduced congress is going to have to clean up its own house 
congress should revise its procedures to make it impossible 
for individual members who want to force the president to purchase 
an item not included in his defense request to do so by burying an 
amendment within the overall defense budget package the defense 
secretary said 
he made it clear that any meaningful reform is going to have to 
include reform of procedures in congress

the dallas morning news on medical wastes polluting the beaches 
it has been the summer of the syringe when americans discovered 
to their horror that it probably wasnt the sharks they had to fear 
at the seashore but the medical waste 
as far back as december 1978 the environmental protection 
agency announced it would regulate infectious wastes as hazardous 
wastes under the resource conservation and recovery act 
but when final regulations were issued in 1980 infectious waste 
was not included as a hazardous waste 
finally this summer the epa asked for public comment on its 
handling of the biomedical waste issues but critics say thats too 
little too late 
a federal approach would be helpful since the current patchwork 
of state legislation makes it possible for dumpers to shift to 
states with more lenient laws 
still more laws would not be necessary if the epa would move 
more quickly to define medical waste and include it in hazardous 
waste regulations

look at how much time vice presidential nominee dan quayle has 
had to devote to putting to rest the silly charges surrounding his 
national guard service before that ran its course it was 
something to do with a female lobbyist 
and what about the wimp factor applied to george bush and 
how much time and effort hes had to give to overcoming that as 
well as a couple other meaningless charges 
meaningless yes nevertheless those charges have taken their 
toll on the republican ticket both bush and quayle could have 
better used that time and effort to get their own ideas in focus 
before the voters 
as long as they have to run around countering charges of one 
kind or another theyll never get their own messages out and 
that of course is what negative campaigning is all about

the daily dunklin democrat kennett mo on the vice 
presidential nominees 
neither daniel quayle nor lloyd bentsen appears to break any 
preconceived mold of leadership retardation we expect from someone 
selected for a job that requires not much more than silent 
subservience and pleasant countenance 
the expecation that anyone holding the office of vice 
president will as the saying goes grow in office seems 
wistfully and overly optimistic given the lack of duties of the 
position 
americans will just have to conclude that there is some unseen 
quality in both vice presidential candidates that will sometime be 
revealed 
neither quayle nor bentsen makes us stop asking the decadeslong 
question that haunts so many americans how come we never get any

their bills for the loan interest the government pays 
the federal watchdog agency says that the loan act should be 
rewritten to allow the secretary of education to charge interest on 
overpayments made to lenders and also to require that the latter 
employ independent auditors to certify the loan accounts and 
interest billings 
congress could and should do that before the current session 
expires

vigilance against hijackings and other misdeeds that threaten 
the safety of airline passengers obviously is not what it should be 
thirtytwo of the nations commercial airlines have been fined a 
total of 1 million by the federal aviation administration for 
failing to provide adequate security checks at airports 
inspectors still were able to smuggle phony weapons aboard 
planes without having them detected by xray machines guards or 
metal detectors 15 percent of the time they tried to do so the faa

the airlines had better remedy the problem swiftly lest

the atlanta constitution on an energy policy 
by 1979 the united states had wrestled a comprehensive energy 
policy into place 
shocked by prices that had been quadrupled by the monopolistic 
organization of petroleum exporting countries the nation adopted 
policies designed to reduce its energy dependence sharply 
the idea was to protect ourselves from future vulnerability to 
opec but over the eight years of the reagan administration the 
energy program has been dismantled 
no the strategies of the late 70s were not necessarily 
appropriate for all time and yes more of the energy savings of 
the early 80s were caused by extortionate prices than by federal 
policy 
but guiding policies are needed all the more in the absence of 
conservationforcing high prices and it is blithe at best to act 
as if the nation needs no energy policy at all

anchorage alaska daily news on the us security policy 
security policy represents both a quandry and an opportunity for 
the next american president a quandry because a decade of 
unprecedented peacetime buildup of us defense capacity cannot 
for budgetary reasons be continued and an opportunity for much 
the same reason 
the opportunity is clear and it flows directly out of the 
maturation of policy under president reagan in the past two years 
 
how to grasp the opportunity four key steps reduce the 
superpowers nuclear arsenal as president reagan has long 
proposed keep the arms race out of space as the soviets have 
suggested untangle the eastwest standoff in europe and 
control the spread of nuclear and chemical weapons 
americans should listen carefully to what michael dukakis and 
george bush have to say about these matters and consider which of 
them is better equipped to exploit the opportunities

marshall minn independent on human rights in romania 
congress has gone on record opposing plans of president 
ceausescu of romania to destroy more than half the traditional folk 
villages in his country 
under a massive collectivization program romania would bulldoze 
7000 of its 13000 traditional villages to make way for 
governmentowned agriculturalindustrial complexes 
the displaced people would be hearded into stateowned 
standardized housing units to be built in centuriesold town 
centers 
violation of human rights of all its citizens is part of the 
governments miserable record it has denied its 25 million ethnic 
minorities the right to preserve their native language 
recent congressional action expressing outrage at romanian 
repression will have little effect of the contempt for human rights 
and cultural legacies displayed by ceausescu 
but it may give some hope to the oppressed minorities in romania 
that their plight has not gone unnoticed

the decatur ala daily on presidential debates 
it will be good if there are several presidential debates for 
from them it is possible to learn more of each man 
in planned speeches a candidate will only say what he wants the 
audience to hear that is even true in press conferences 
but a debate is a little different and issues usually are 
addressed even though one or the other or both might have to face 
topics not to his liking 
the campaign is here both candidates are at the same starting 
line the one who gets elected is going to be the one who lets the 
american people know exactly what he plans and how he is going to 
carry out those plans 
eight years ago president reagan said he was going to balance 
the budget within four years he didnt tell us how he was going to 
do it and the american voters let him get away with it and you 
know what has happened to the budget 
not only do we want to hear what the candidate is going to do 
we want to hear how he is going to do it

on some of its promises which were supposed to bring a new era of 
friendship with the united states 
along with balking over agreements to dismantle certain 
strategic military installations such as the huge radar station 
located at krasnoyarsk in central asia the soviets seem to be 
dragging their feet in withdrawing from afghanistan 
we suspect that soviet general secretary mikhail gorbachevs 
overtures toward the united states have been placed on the back 
burner until after the us presidential election 
soviet hesitancy at this time will not go over very well with

the sheridan wyo press on forest fire control policies 
us forest service and park service personnel having gone 
through one of the worst forest fire years in their history are 
looking at fire control policies 
officials at yellowstone national park are under the gun in 
particular over their earlier policy of let the fire burn that 
policy didnt last long when fires began to threaten major tourist 
areas and since then the park service has put everything it has 
into fighting the blazes 
it is easy to be critical of the forest service or park service 
for not getting these fires out immediately the impossibility of 
such a demand is attested to by the extremely dry conditions which 
firefighters had to face 
but yes since the nations attention is now on forest fires 
the policy should be reviewed it should be adjusted wherever 
necessary

if rj reynolds tobacco co wants a pat on the back and hearty 
congratulations for developing a hightech lowsmoke cigarette it 
will not get them here 
the allure of the cigarette called premier and to be 
testmarketed in three cities starting oct 1 is that it will emit 
only a trace of ash or smoke that could irritate people nearby 
however the reynolds people arent claiming that premier will 
be any less dangerous than regular cigarettes 
apparently they are more concerned about prying the 
increasingly vehement antismoking crowd off their backs than 
reducing the health hazard to those who will smoke their cigarettes

the rev silvester mooney who headed douai abbey 
in england for 40 years and was believed to be the worlds oldest 
roman catholic monk has died at age 102 the abbey said wednesday 
popularly known as grandfather abbot mooney was deeply loved as 
a simple taciturn man who never accepted any comfort that wasnt 
available to his fellow monks said the rev oliver holt a 
community spokesman 
he did however accept a television set as a 101st birthday 
gift and enjoyed watching sports programs holt said 
his 100th birthday brought special greetings from pope john paul 
ii and mooney marked the occasion by preaching a 20minute sermon 
without notes 
holt said recent checks of records indicated mooney probably was 
the worlds oldest living catholic monk and definitely the oldest 
benedictine 
born in liverpool on june 14 1886 mooney was sent to douai in 
northern france at age 11 to be educated by the english benedictine 
community of st edmunds he was ordained a priest in 1911 
he returned to england with the 80strong community which 
established a new abbey called douai 50 miles west of london in 
1929 mooney was made its abbot until he retired in 1969 
holt said mooney recently underwent treatment for a small 
abnormal growth but attributed his death monday night basically

postal deliveries were nearly at a halt and 100 
million pieces of undelivered mail piled up wednesday in a weekold 
nationwide strike that idled more than half of the countrys 
180000 postal workers 
the strikes left only two of 82 mechanized sorting offices in 
operation one in belfast northern ireland and one in gloucester 
all 11000 collection mailboxes in london were sealed 
the national postal service said in a statement that the backlog 
of undelivered letters and parcels reached 100 million equivalent 
to the amount of mail delivered in two working days 
the mail users association said the postal dispute was costing 
british industry 43 million a day 
the postal service said talks were under way but the british 
broadcasting corp reported little progress 
we are talking about holding talks said a post office 
spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity 
south wales electricity pledged that no customers would be cut 
off during the strike because of unpaid bills 
the national federation of the selfemployed and small 
businesses representing about 50000 small companies said many 
companies could be in trouble if the strike continues because of 
the delay in receiving checks 
faced with the threat of empty spaces in letterstotheeditor 
columns the times the daily telegraph and the independent invited 
readers to send letters by fax machine and the bbc invited 
listeners to dictate their letters by telephone 
the labor action began aug 31 with a 24hour strike called by 
the union of communication workers which said it was unfair to 
offer bonuses to junior employees only in selected regions 
the weekly bonuses of about 1252 to 3340 were given to new 
staffers in london and southeast england where the postal service 
has trouble recruiting and keeping workers the union maintains the 
bonuses should be paid to all workers or not at all 
the union represents 140000 postal workers the post office 
said today that more than 90000 of them were on strike 
many postal workers around the country refused to return to work 
on sept 1 because local managers hired extra temporary workers to 
help clear the backlog of mail the walkouts since have escalated 
the post office said tuesday that many union members walked out 
because they were denied large overtime payments after temporary 
workers were hired to clear the backlog 
the union denied this and said the walkouts were provoked by 
management demands that staff cross picket lines handle mail from 
areas not theirs and sign guarantees that they will not strike or 
take other protest action again 
private couriers are profiting from the labor troubles 
tnt express uk which says it is britains largest courier 
said its 26 nationwide depots hired extra workers to handle a 400 
percent increase in business since the strike began

an undertaker who became enraged when told he 
couldnt smoke on a crosscountry flight faces up to 20 years in 
prison for his conviction on a federal charge of interfering with a 
flight crew 
james tabacca 34 also faces a 250000 fine when he is 
sentenced nov 14 by us district judge wallace tashima 
jurors ruled tuesday that tabacca so intimidated a stewardess 
that she could not perform her duties however jurors rejected the 
prosecutions contention that tabacca had also assaulted the flight 
attendent 
a prosecutor had told the jury that tabacca of universal city 
became outraged when flight attendant pamela martinez tried to stop 
him from lighting up aboard a trans world airlines flight from 
boston to los angeles on dec 30 he had been seated in the 
nosmoking section at the last minute 
he grabbed her arm twisted it and shoved her across the aisle 
into the bulkhead said assistant us attorney robin scroggie 
the prosecutor said tabacca also shouted obscenities at ms 
martinez rammed his shoulder into her and swung his garment bag 
into her leg 
tabaccas attorney deputy public defender marilyn butler 
admitted her client lighted a cigarette but denied that he 
assaulted the flight attendant 
defense lawyers said they would appeal the conviction on several 
grounds arguing among other things that the statute making it 
illegal to interfere with a flight crew member was intended to 
apply only when the safety of a flight is jeopardized 
although tabaccas ticket was for the smoking section most 
seats on the flight were later converted to nonsmoking because of 
new government regulations requiring airlines to provide nosmoking 
seats for all passengers who arrive on time and want them

republican george bush talking tough on defense received a 
warm reception at an american legion convention today while 
democratic rival michael dukakis told a college audience george 
was right there as the reagan administration fought aid programs 
for students 
bush speaking to about 7000 people at the legion gathering in 
louisville ky renewed his contention that dukakis would weaken 
the nations defense 
i do not doubt my opponents patriotism but patriotism is not 
the issue the issue is how best to deter war to keep peace and to 
fulfill our countrys special responsibility as leader of the free 
world bush said 
my opponent opposes the sdi strategic defense initiative 
but like you in the american legion i support it we cannot leave 
america hostage to soviet ballistic missiles he said 
bush sent murmers through the audience when he said at one 
point i wonder how many americans remember that today is pearl 
harbor day 47 years ago to this very day we were hit and hit hard 
at pearl harbor and we were not ready 
he later corrected himself the japanese air strike was on dec 
7 1941 one of the bestknown dates in us history and the 
legionnaires gave him a goodnatured round of applause 
dukakis in remarks prepared for delivery at kean college in 
union nj criticized reagan administration cuts in federal 
student aid programs and outlined his own college opportunity 
proposal 
that proposal that would have students receive loans in return 
for their agreement to pay back a percentage of their income for 
the rest of their working lives 
as for bush dukakis asked where was george bush while his 
administration was doing its best to slam the door of college 
opportunity in the face of millions of young people across this 
country 
where was he while his administration was denying 
middleincome families the hope for a future of prosperity and 
success for their children 
george was right there all the time not doing and not saying 
a thing dukakis said 
one day earlier behind the scenes dukakis agreed to bushs 
request that they meet facetoface only twice and have running 
mate lloyd bentsen debate republican dan quayle once negotiations 
continued today on scheduling and format 
dukakis criticized bush on tuesday after the vice president told 
a shipyard worker in portland ore his wages have dropped from 
1336 an hour to 950 an hour under the reagan administration 
because youre going through a competitive change the 
reference was to foreign competition 
after being met by a booing and jeering union crowd at the 
northwest marine iron works in portland bush said during lunch 
all i need is 51 percent of the vote 
george bush made it clear today that he really does not 
understand the hopes and dreams and aspirations of millions and 
millions of american workers across this country dukakis said in 
response to bushs comments thats not an adequate answer to 
american workers 
last week bush evoked an angry response when he called a small 
increase in the unemployment rate statistically irrelevant 
today bush addressed the 70th annual convention of the american 
legion in louisville where president reagan on tuesday lambasted 
the democratic ticket on defense matters 
reagan said that while bushs opponents have praised him for 
reaching a treaty with the soviets banning intermediaterange 
nuclear weapons in europe they also opposed deploying the 
missiles that made that treaty possible 
yes it comes down to this after eight hard years of 
rebuilding americas strength do we really want to return to a 
disneyland defense policy with mickey mouse treatment of our men 
and women in uniform goofy strategic plans and donald ducklike 
lectures telling us that whatever goes wrong is our own 
blanketyblank fault reagan asked 
the battleground of the airwaves began seeing some action in 
ads that the began airing tuesday in several states the democratic 
national committee accused reagan and republicans of misleading 
americans about the threat posed by the the federal budget deficit 
later this week dnc plans include an ad stressing dukakis 
bring prosperity home theme which emphasizes economic policies 
a dukakis campaign ad that began airing nationally tuesday night 
shows a montage of shots from dukakis speech at the democratic 
convention and lists his major accomplishments as governor 
the dukakis campaign also began airing a third ad just in texas 
touting dukakis and his running mate bentsen for supporting 
legislation to give workers 60 days notice before a plant closing 
despite the air time dukakis had some trouble getting his 
campaign off the ground tuesday 
his flight was grounded in chicago by the federal aviation 
administration after a surprise inspection turned up three minor 
safety violations forcing the massachusetts governor to cancel an 
appearance in columbus ohio 
the flight he managed to take home to boston landed safely but 
a cone over the rear galley popped off and dropped to the tarmac 
the pilot said a passenger had pulled an emergency release cable 
that opens the cone only when the plane is on the ground 
bentsen set the tone for the educational attacks telling an 
audience at virginia polytechnic institute in blacksburg va that 
the republicans have been trying to trash educational opportunity 
across the country 
bentsen planned to spend today in the senate including a 
procedural vote on a politicallysensitive textile trade bill 
quayle an indiana senator was also in washington

republican presidential nominee george 
bush today confused the anniversary of pearl harbor day as he 
delivered a tough defense speech to a national american legion 
convention 
in his talk to about 7000 members of the nations largest 
veterans organization the vice president also said a democratic 
administration would leave the nation hostage to soviet ballistic 
missiles 
but murmurs spread through the audience as bush saidi wonder 
how many americans remember that today is pearl harbor day 47 
years ago to this very day we were hit and hit hard at pearl 
harbor and we were not ready 
however a few minutes into his speech bush paused abruptly and 
said did i say sept 7 strike that dec 7 1941 bush a 
world war ii navy pilot added im glad i corrected that i saw 
this guy shaking me off out here 
bushs correction on the date of the japanese invasion of the 
hawaiian naval base that triggered us entry in world war ii won a 
goodnatured round of applause and laughter from his audience 
sheila tate bushs press secretary said it was 47 years ago 
this year and he just said today he wasnt thinking 
the pearl harbor remark did not appear in a prepared text of the 
vice presidents speech 
bush spoke a day after president reagan told the same group that 
a victory by democrats in december would return the nation to a 
disneyland defense policy 
bush continued along the same vein claiming rival michael 
dukakis would weaken the nations defense 
i do not doubt my opponents patriotism but patriotism is not 
the issue the issue is how best to deter war to keep peace and to 
fulfill our countrys special responsibility as leader of the free 
world bush said 
he voiced his strong support for the reagans administrations 
star wars missile defense system 
my opponent opposes the strategic defense initiative but 
like you in the american legion i support it we canot leave 
america hostage to soviet ballistic missiles bush said 
the vice president also said that if elected he would not 
hesitate in ordering the kind of preemptive military strike that 
reagan called for in 1986 against libya if conditions warranted 
he also said that he would continue to press for the 
administrations effort to make the veterans administration a 
fullfledged cabinet agency if such legislation does not pass 
during the rest of reagans term 
on tuesday bush said his experience makes him better able than 
dukakis to keep his cool in the face of the kind of heavyduty 
heckling both candidates were exposed to on the campaign trail 
if i hadnt been through demonstrations before i would have 
gotten a lot tenser bush told reporters after being jeered by 
shipyard workers in portland ore 
the democratic nominee campaigning in the chicago area 
encountered noisy antiabortion protesters for the second day in a 
row 
ive seen campaigns before bush said in everett wash 
ive been at this level of american politics before and theres 
nothing like it its unique its his dukakis first exposure 
when it happens you dont need to get all uptight about it 
and act like youre being put upon because this is how it works at 
this level in politics 
bush will focus on middle east policy at an address later in the 
day to a bnai brith convention in baltimore 
booed and jeered loudly by several hundred unionized iron 
workers some of whom were waving dukakis signs bush told his port 
of portland audience dont listen to all this dukakis stuff 
theyre on the ropes and they have to make all this noise 
the gop nominee was taunted and jeered as he spoke to iron 
workers at a shipyard the hardhattd workers accused bush of 
union busting and booed insistently throughout his speech 
bush returned the fire telling the iron workers to quiet down 
and listen to him defend the reagan administrations record on 
jobcreation 
the democrats are trying to mislead you he said things 
arent going to get worse unless they get elected i know the truth 
sometimes hurts 
bush also produced a 38yearold union card showing he was a 
member of the united steelworkers of america bush belonged to the 
union for a brief period when he lived in compton calif and sold 
oil drilling equipment for a texasbased company his dues were 
paid for 1950 through payroll deductions the card stated 
how many guys running for president of the united states has 
been a member of the us steelworkers union bush asked 
youre looking at one 
aboard air force two bush said the intensity of the protest 
surprised him but he added he may have scored a few points 
when we were in there at the lunch counter this guy came up 
and he says im not for you im still not for you but youve got 
a lot of guts to show up which is nice 
bush said that he counted at least two loudmouths in the 
crowd clearly for him so when i needed succor i would turn to 
them

mike tyson who suffered a concussion when he 
smashed his car into a tree had told his wife shortly before the 
crash that he was going to try to kill himself a newspaper 
reported today 
the daily news said the information came from individuals with 
an intimate knowledge of tysons situation 
tyson remains in columbiapresbyterian medical center where he 
was taken sunday after his car struck a tree at the upstate home of 
a friend doctors said tuesday that tyson had lost consciousness 
for about 20 minutes and suffered a concussion and amnesia 
tysons oct 22 title defense against frank bruno in england was 
indefinitely postponed because of the injuries 
im going to go out and kill myself the daily news said 
tyson is reported to have told his wife actress robin givens 
im going to crash my car 
a source close to tyson told the associated press that the 
heavyweight champion was brooding all week because his wife 
refused to be with him at his upstate new york training site 
instead chosing to hang out with her fancy friends at the us 
open 
the source however called any suicide threats just idle 
threats and said those close to tyson believed he was simply 
looking for a little attention from his wife 
the new york post today quoted ruth roper givens mother as 
saying mike did absolutely not try to kill himself 
repeated efforts by the associated press to reach tysons

ill do it again

champion has suffered a chemical imbalance since childhood that 
prods him to violence including incidents in which he beat or 
threatened his wife 
according to the news a psychiatrist treating tyson has 
recommended that he be committed for psychiatric evaluation 
doctors evaluating tysons physical condition said it would 30 
to 60 days before he could resume training

republican sen chic hecht brushed 
aside a primary challenger and promised the most exciting race 
nevada has ever had as he began his underdog campaign against 
popular democratic gov dick bryan 
bryan who turned back three challengers of his own in a primary 
tuesday said we feel that weve generated some momentum but as 
weve said from the very beginning this is going to be a very tough 
race 
a poll taken in august for the gaming industry showed bryan with 
a 14point lead over hecht who is seeking a second term hecht 
said tuesday that his own polls show him trailing bryan by 5 
percent to 6 percent and said that was right where we want to 
be 
with all precincts reporting from tuesdays voting bryan 51 
had 61987 votes or 80 percent patrick fitzpatrick had 4691 votes 
or 6 percent manford cave rock manny beals had 2651 votes or 
3 percent and larry kepler had 1650 votes or 2 percent none 
an option listed on the ballot drew 6991 votes or 9 percent 
on the gop side hecht 59 had 55352 votes or 82 percent 
larry scheffler owner of a graphics business had 5617 votes or 8 
percent and 6454 voters or 10 percent favored none 
hecht has attacked bryan as too prolabor and says the 
outofstate labor bosses want to control the senate 
bryan has characterized hecht as ineffectual and said his rival 
was wrong in claiming that 42 percent of bryans campaign 
contributions came from labor groups he said he had in fact 
received about 189000 from labor out of 18 million and i 
dont care if youre using the old math or new math that works 
out to 104 percent 
in a gop congressional primary vietnam war hero james bo 
gritz who has made forays into southeast asia seeking mias lost 
to party activist lucille lusk lusk received 12075 votes or 48

irans prime minister withdrew his 
resignation under orders from ayatollah ruhollah khomeini irans 
official media reported wednesday but he hinted at wide splits in 
tehrans leadership 
the islamic republic news agency monitored in nicosia said 
premier hussein musavi told khomeini in a letter tuesday night that 
he agreed to retract his resignation out of concern for islam and 
the revolution and the interests of the country 
musavi later chaired a meeting of his 21member cabinet and said 
khomeinis instruction was a divine gift tehran radio 
reported 
but in a rare admission by an iranian leader he was quoted as 
citing difficulties in the decisionmaking process in the 
executive that he hoped khomeinis action would eliminate 
he did not elaborate but it appeared to be a sideswipe at 
president ali khamenei one of his political rivals underlining 
the divisions that have beset the tehran hierarchy for some time 
khomeinis intervention after musavi submitted his resignation 
monday may have defused the political crisis for now 
but the political divisions were largely set aside during the 
eightyear war with iraq and western analysts believe iran faces a 
period of political turbulence now that the fighting has stopped 
musavi said he was resigning because as many as eight of his 
ministers more than onethird of his cabinet would fail to win a 
vote of confidence in the majlis irans 270seat parliament 
on tuesday hours before the parliament was to vote on the 
cabinet khameneis office said musavis resignation was turned 
down 
irna said musavi agreed to stay on after khomeini told him 
your resignation letter caused some surprise you should have 
at least mentioned something about it to me or highranking 
officials 
khomeinis letter broadcast by tehran radio told musavi in 
the event that you fail to reach agreement as regards some of the 
ministers actions will be carried out as they were in the past 
khomeini did not elaborate but he rescued musavi from a 
noconfidence vote in the majlis four years ago by appealing to 
deputies for unity while iran was at war with iraq 
the revolutionary patriarch stressed it is the legal right of 
the majlis to vote for any minister that it desires to vote for 
in these days when the people are sending their children to 
the fronts of sacrifice to assist islam it is no time for 
complaining and resigning you should continue your service in 
your bastion as prime minister 
tuesdays parliamentary session was canceled after musavis 
resignation was announced but a new session was scheduled for 
sunday 
rival factions in tehran have disputed postwar policies 
particularly the task of reconstruction and efforts by parliament 
speaker hashemi rafsanjani to bring iran out of political isolation 
rafsanjani the acting military commander and the most powerful 
figure in iran after khomeini and khamenei favor seeking foreign 
investment to help rebuild the countrys shattered economy 
musavi a radical technocrat who has been premier for seven 
years opposes outside intervention he fears it will drive iran 
into debt and allow in the multinationals booted out after the 1979 
revolution 
philip robbins of the londonbased royal institute for 
international affairs said it was easy enough to decide during 
the war not to take loans from the west when no one was offering 
them anyway 
but now western companies are willing to do business with 
iran that presents the iranians with some difficult decisions 
he said in a telephone interview 
musavi despite impeccable revolutionary credentials has no 
power base of his own like rafsanjani khamenei and interior 
minister ali akbar mohtashemi a hardliner whose influence is 
growing 
irans internal divisions were sharpened when khomeini decided 
last month to accept a unsponsored ceasefire in the war with 
iraq after a string of battlefield defeats 
musavi won a personal vote of confidence in parliament in july 
squelching speculation that he might be eased out and replaced 
possibly by mohtashemi 
but the political feuding probably will come to a head by next 
year when khameneis term as president expires analysts said 
khomeini has decreed khamenei cannot run again 
the debate over irans direction in the postwar era is only part 
of the power struggle between rival factions over who will fill the 
political vacuum when khomeini dies 
the 88yearold revolutionary leader reportedly has been ailing 
iranian leaders have denied that but khomeini has appeared 
increasingly frail in recent public appearances

the state department criticized nicaragua on 
wednesday for refusing to allow the united states to replace eight 
diplomats whom the sandinista government expelled two month ago 
in addition department spokesman charles redman said nicaragua 
is not issuing visas to us diplomats assigned to replace envoys 
being routinely reassigned or to personnel seeking to visit the 
embassy on official business 
the sandinistas appear to be engaged in an effort to obstruct 
the normal functioning of our diplomatic mission redman said 
adding that the policy contradicts nicaraguas stated wish to 
improve relations with the united states 
the personnel shortage in managua prevents the embassy from 
providing normal economic and political reporting and precludes 
normal consular services he said 
on july 11 nicaragua expelled ambassador richard melton and 
seven other diplomats charging they were attempting to destabilize 
nicaragua 
in response the united states expelled nicaraguan ambassador 
carlos tunnermann and seven of his colleagues tunnermann had 
served both as ambassador to the united states and to the 
organization of american states 
the nicaraguan government said the expulsion of tunnermann was 
illegal because envoys assigned to international bodies such as the 
oas cannot be targets of retaliation in bilateral political 
disputes 
us diplomats in managua have been told that the visas sought 
by the united states will be approved if tunnermann is allowed to 
return to his post in washington 
meanwhile redman said the united states will not allow the 
nicaraguan government to replace the expelled envoys so long as the 
sandinistas continue to refuse visas for us diplomats

michael dukakis switched his focus from the 
economy to education today as his campaign and the democratic party 
began major advertising efforts touting his record as massachusetts 
governor and criticizing republican policies 
dukakis took particular aim at gop rival george bush who has 
said repeatedly that he wants to be known as the education 
president 
in remarks prepared for delivery during an afternoon appearance 
at kean college in union nj the democratic nominee criticized 
reagan administration cuts in federal student aid programs and 
outlined his own college opportunity proposal 
dukakis described his proposal that would have students receive 
a loan in return for their agreement to pay back a percentage of 
their income for the rest of their working lives 
as for bush dukakis asked where was george bush while his 
administration was doing its best to slam the door of college 
opportunity in the face of millions of young people across this 
country 
where was he while his administration was denying 
middleincome families the hope for a future of prosperity and 
success for their children 
george was right there all the time not doing and not saying 
a thing dukakis said 
the democratic nominee arrived home tuesday night ending a 
strange campaign day that saw his first event disrupted by 
antiabortion protesters and his only other scheduled event 
canceled because of minor problems with his chartered plane 
the campaigns plane troubles continued today as a second craft 
carrying additional reporters televisions crews and campaign 
staffers was grounded in boston by what aides said was hydraulic 
problems the plane a midway airlines dc9 jet was the same one 
that dukakis had flown from chicago to boston a day earlier 
dukakis some of his traveling press and campaign aides flew to 
new jersey today in their familiar presidential airways boeing 737 
dukakis had been forced to abandon that plane in chicago tuesday 
when a federal aviation administration spot inspection found 
several minor maintenance problems 
the plane was later flown to boston empty and was back in 
service this morning 
dukakis wasted no time tuesday in lashing into bush for telling 
a shipyard worker in oregon earlier that his wages had dropped from 
1336 to 950 per hour during the reagan administration because 
of competitive change 
george bush made it clear today that he really does not 
understand the hopes and dreams and aspirations of millions and 
millions of american workers across this country dukakis said at 
the airport thats not an adequate answer to american workers 
in ads that began airing tuesday in several battleground states 
the democratic national committee accuses reagan and republicans of 
misleading americans about the threat posed by the federal budget 
deficit the hey pal ad asks voters whether they can afford 
four more years of gop control of the white house a question 
dukakis has asked at his recent rallies 
the dnc will supplement that ad later this week with another 
commercial focusing on the bring prosperity home theme dukakis 
spokesman leslie dach said 
the dukakis ad which began airing nationally tuesday night is 
titled new era and was shown in california and texas prior to 
the republican national convention it features a montage of shots 
from dukakis speech at the democratic convention and lists his 
major accomplishments as governor 
the dukakis campaign also began airing a third ad just in texas 
a 30second spot touting dukakis and his running mate texas sen 
lloyd bentsen for supporting legislation to give workers 60 days 
notice before a plant closing 
reagan and bush opposed the legislation but the president 
allowed it to become law without his signature bushs running 
mate indiana sen dan quayle led the senate opposition to the 
measure bentsen was its chief sponsor 
the ad shows a red stamp reading no superimposed over photos 
of bush and quayle as the announcer says shouldnt there be a 
law to give you and your community 60 days notice 
a dukakisbentsen campaign logo then appears on the screen as 
the announcer says the choice is clear 
dukakis spent several hours tuesday stuck in chicago while the 
federal aviation administration conducted a surprise inspection of 
his presidential airways charter inspectors found three minor 
safety problems forcing dukakis to cancel an appearance in ohio 
the boeing 737 was repaired in chicago and was to rejoin the 
campaign today 
his only other appearance came in what usually is friendly turf 
for dukakis an ethnic gathering but his speech at a 
polishamerican restaurant outside chicago was delayed for several 
minutes because of antiabortion protesters several of whom were 
pushed and dragged out of the hall by dukakis supporters 
dukakis says he personally opposes abortion but believes women 
should be allowed to choose to have an abortion 
on the flight home dukakis joined the pilot and copilot in the 
cockpit for the landing in boston just after the plane landed a 
cone over the rear galley popped off and dropped to the tarmac the 
pilot said a passenger had pulled an emergency release cable that 
opens the cone only when the plane is on the ground

mobs plundered government offices and 
warehouses wednesday and state radio said security forces shot 
five looters diplomats said chaos was near and prepared to 
evacuate their families 
opposition leaders called for a nationwide general strike 
against 26 years of repressive oneparty rule on thursday leaders 
hoped for the largest of the many mass protests that have driven 
two governments from office in less than two months 
looters ranged through the capital and one western diplomat 
said the streets are deserted people are pretty much in fear of 
their property things have pretty much closed down there is a 
widespread perception that things have deteriorated 
staterun rangoon radio reported looting in 38 areas of the 
capital tuesday and wednesday it said security forces shot and 
killed five people wounded six and arrested 88 looters 
the radio urged people to report looters to police and said more 
than 43 million in state property had been plundered since the 
beginning of august 
an earlier broadcast said security forces would open fire to 
impose control if looting continued but the order would not 
apply to peaceful antigovernment demonstrations 
soldiers fired into crowds of unarmed demonstrators last month 
killing 112 people by government count and several hundred 
according to other reports 
army trucks patrolled the main streets shortly after the radio 
announcement late wednesday morning 
in its 8 pm broadcast rangoon radio said the government was 
invoking a 1987 order banning demonstrations at the parliament 
building and several other sites 
minutes later groups of protesters could be heard shouting 
down with the burma socialist program party government we will 
go on demonstrating the party has ruled since a military coup by 
ne win in 1962 with socialist policies that have isolated burma and 
brought economic ruin on a nation rich in resources 
party leaders plan a special meeting monday to consider holding 
a referendum on oneparty rule as promised by president maung 
maung but opponents demand an interim government leading to 
democracy 
because the situation is sliding towards chaos up to 100 
dependents of us embassy employees will be evacuated as soon as 
possible said the western diplomat who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
ross petzing of the us embassy in bangkok thailand said 
its just a precautionary measure due to the unpredictability of 
events over the next week and we hope it will be temporary 
he said the first group of 45 americans would arrive in bangkok 
on thursday unless strikes grounded the flight 
other diplomats said 41 thai embassy dependents would leave 
thursday but the foreign ministry in bangkok said no final 
decision had been made 
diplomats said the italian israeli and several other embassies 
had evacuated dependents and the japanese and larger western 
embassies were considering doing so 
demonstrators have not threatened foreigners and the us 
embassy has been favorite rallying point with protesters 
applauding the american flag 
vernon a walters us ambassador to the united nations said 
wednesday during a visit to bangkok the united states will do 
everything we can to see burmas passage to freedom occur in a 
peaceful way if at all possible 
the western diplomat said he saw about 10 trucks each carrying 
at least 20 soldiers parked tuesday night near the shwedagon 
pagoda and around rangoon university where students plan 
antigovernment strategy 
he described it as the largest force he had seen in rangoon in 
two weeks 
many residents barred the doors of their homes and shops as 
looters raided raided the customs department warehouse an 
education department building rangoon university livestock and 
poultry farms soap and textile factories and rice barges along the 
rangoon river 
thieves seized air conditioners and office equipment from the 
local office of the un food and agriculture organization and 
ramsacked warehouses of the un childrens fund 
looting began after a general strike aug 8 that caused a 
gradual breakdown in government control and spread to downtown 
rangoon on tuesday 
the western diplomat said the looting is an act of 
desperation by poor people who need food and other supplies in a 
city paralyzed by strikes and protests 
turmoil began in burma with student riots in september 1987 that 
led to street protests in march and june 
ne win resigned july 23 and was succeeded by a hardline former 
general sein lwin who lasted only 17 days maung maung is the 
first civilian leader since 1962

changes in adoption laws designed to 
curb illegal baby trade have restricted the ability of 
foreigners to adopt filipino youngsters and may mean that many will 
spend their childhood in orphanages 
new regulations which took effect aug 3 ban adoptions of 
filipino children by foreigners residing in the country unless at 
least one prospective parent is related to the child 
foreigners living abroad can still adopt filipino children 
through international agencies but prospective parents living here 
will have to return to their own country and file papers there 
through an international agency 
the procedure can take years depending on the adoption laws in 
the country where the papers are filed 
government figures indicate that in recent years about 17 
percent of the 2500 children adopted here annually have been taken 
by foreigners residing in the philippines and who were not related 
to the child 
more than a third of all adoptions of filipino children are by 
foreigners including those who file papers abroad and would not be 
affected by the changes 
the new code is not antiforeigner said lourdes balanon 
assistant director of the governments bureau of child and youth 
welfare it is an effort by the government to protect our 
children 
ms balanon said that in the past foreigners could adopt 
filipino children in a few weeks previous regulations allowed 
single foreigners to adopt with much less red tape than in the 
united states or other countries 
ms balanon added that although many of the adoptive foreign 
parents were of good character others may have been fronts for 
baby trading selling youngsters to couples abroad who were 
unable to have children 
mothers were convinced to give up their children and even 
kidnapping may have been encouraged she said 
because local adoptions usually were arranged without the 
services of an international agency the government here had no way 
of ensuring the childs welfare once the parents left the country 
but some welfare workers fear the new regulations will 
discourage legitimate adoptions by qualified foreign families 
living in a country without a tradition of taking in children who 
are not related to those who adopt them 
in filipino society adoption of children with no blood ties is 
rare government figures show that in the past two years only 5 
percent of the children adopted here were taken by filipino couples 
who were not related by blood 
traditionally orphans and children of impoverished parents 
unable to care for them become the responsibility of the extended 
family uncles aunts cousins and grandparents 
but children born out of wedlock are often kept secret from 
their families 
abortion is technically illegal and birth control is frequently 
shunned in this predominantly roman catholic country unwed mothers 
find themselves under tremendous social pressure to turn their 
infants over to religious or government orphanages 
in other cases extended families sometimes are too poor to take 
in another child 
older children will be especially affected said lisa 
hechenova of the asilio de san vincente de paul orphange in manila 
because if filipinos adopt at all they want infants foreigners 
are more inclined to accept toddlers and even 6to10year olds 
jose a 3yearold toddler at manilas hospicio de san jose 
orphanage is one of those children who because of new 
regulations may never have a home he has been at the orphanage 
for more than eight months because officials have had difficulty 
finding him a home and the new changes in the law will make it even 
more difficult 
sevenyearold maria was among the last children adopted by a 
resident foreign couple she was given in july to a european couple

sen joseph r biden jr saying he is a 
little wiser more serene returned to the senate wednesday 
nearly seven months after he underwent emergency brain surgery to 
repair an aneurysm 
looking tanned and trim as he stepped off the train from 
wilmington del biden plunged into a busy first day attending a 
surprise party in his office talking with reporters chairing a 
foreign relations subcommittee hearing on presidential war powers 
and voting in the senate 
later the senate put aside business on a textile bill to pay 
tribute to biden 
with bidens parents wife children and other relatives looking 
on from the gallery the senate voted unanimously to welcome him 
back and gave him a standing ovation a parade of senators from 
both parties took the floor to praise biden including 87yearold 
john stennis dmiss who had been a fellow hospital patient 
having friends make a difference having a place you want to 
be makes a difference biden said in an emotional thankyou 
speech 
im more happy to be back than you can imagine the 
45yearold senator told his staff which had draped his office in 
balloons and welcome back senator banners 
biden who last year was a candidate for the democratic 
presidential nomination later captured by massachusetts gov 
michael dukakis reflected on the 12month period that took him 
from the campaign trail to the hospital 
biden said his withdrawal from the race saved my life my 
doctors told me the prospects of my still being alive if i stayed 
in the presidential race were very remote 
there is no way i would have been the candidate biden said 
i either would have died or been in the hospital 
biden also said he bore no grudge against the dukakis aide whose 
leaked reports to the press helped end bidens campaign 
john sasso who was fired by dukakis and then recently rehired 
had given reporters information that biden had taken quotes from a 
british politician and used them unattributed in his own speeches 
any personal feeling disappeared between the first aneurysm 
and the blood clot biden joked adding that he would work for 
dukakis in this falls presidential campaign 
biden was hospitalized last february complaining of neck pain 
and nausea a middleofthenight emergency transfer brought biden 
from a hospital in wilmington to walter reed army medical center in 
washington hours later he was operated on for an aneurysm in an 
artery supplying blood to his brain 
another smaller aneurysm was found and biden underwent 
additional surgery on may 3 
looking back over the year biden said i hope than im a 
little wiser i think i have a somewhat more serene outlook not a 
sense of urgency 
i thought a lot about whether i wanted to stay in this 
business biden said of his lengthy recuperation i like what i 
do im very good at what i do it made me eager to get back to 
do my job 
biden was welcomed back by senate majority leader robert c 
byrd dwva and republican leader bob dole rkan 
weve greatly missed his leadership his counsel his warm 
sense of humor over the past months byrd said but you can 
always count on senator biden to overcome any adversity 
joe had a tough time of it over the past seven months dole 
said but to the surprise of no one who knows joe bidens spirit 
and tenacity he triumphed

rep connie mack iii fresh from victory in a 
republican senate primary said wednesday the gop has a 
tremendous opportunity to reclaim the seat while two democrats 
launched a runoff campaign that threatens to divide the party 
the conservative mack grandson and namesake of the legendary 
philadelphia as baseball manager turned back a challenge from 
former outspoken federal prosecutor robert merkle in tuesdays 
voting 
state insurance commissioner bill gunter led a sixway 
democratic race but failed to win a majority and will compete oct 
4 against the secondplace finisher rep kenneth buddy mackay 
in a nevada senate primary republican sen chic hecht coasted 
to nomination for a second term and will face democratic gov dick 
bryan who buried three challengers 
the florida seat at stake is now occupied by democrat lawton 
chiles who decided to retire after three terms 
mack 47 began his day in key west 90 miles from communist 
cua to emphasize his campaign theme of less taxes less 
spending less government more freedom 
he pledged to reach out to conservative democrats and said 
we felt all along we had a tremendous opportunity and obviously 
if that becomes a very tense runoff election thats divisive plus 
we add to that george bush is running very strongly in florida 
that just adds to our opportunity 
mack got campaign help during the primary from president reagan 
and indicted former national security council aide oliver north 
and expects strong national republican support for the general 
election 
mackay meanwhile picked up the endorsement of rep dan mica 
who ran third in tuesdays primary mica overwhelmingly carried his 
home palm beach county and neighboring broward and mackay from 
ocala in northcentral florida said micas support should be a 
tremendous help in south florida 
were in high gear now but weve got a lot of work to do 
mackay 55 said as he headed to south florida for joint news 
conferences with mica 
gunter insurance commissioner since 1976 was in tallahassee 
working out strategy for his third senate runoff he told reporters 
he wasnt surprised by the mica endorsement of his opponent and 
said he was pleased with his firstplace standing although he has 
slipped from initial polls four months ago 
when youve got undecided voters and when you have a situation 
where the frontrunner is being dumped on as i was youre going to 
see some settling gunter said im delighted with our 
position 
gunter and mackay both expressed hope for a positive runoff 
campaign but they clashed repeatedly during the primary campaign 
as they had in the 1980 senate primary 
democrats hold a 32 lead in statewide voter registration but 
intraparty divisions caused by bitter runoffs were blamed for their 
defeat in the 1986 governors race and 1980 senate race 
mackay 55 had accused gunter 54 of conflict of interest for 
accepting contributions from the industry he regulates and his 
campaign manager greg farmer called gunters 12 years in his 
current office a saga of sleaze gunter called mackay 
hypocritical for accepting funds from political action committees 
that he said wanted to influence votes in the ultimate regulatory 
body congress 
mackay ran third in the 1980 primary in which gunter ran second 
then defeated incumbent richard stone in a runoff gunter lost to 
republican paula hawkins but democrat bob graham won that seat 
back by defeating mrs hawkins in 1986 
with all votes counted mack had 394444 votes or 62 percent 
to merkles 244926 votes or 38 percent 
gunter tallied 372434 votes or 38 percent followed by mackay 
with 258648 votes or 26 percent mica 44 was third with 179729 
votes or 18 percent state sen patricia pat frank had 117379 
votes or 12 percent 
former republican gov claude r kirk 62 was fifth with 50304 
votes or 5 percent and former senate postal clerk fred rader 41 
had 11617 votes for 1 percent 
elsewhere in florida 10term democratic rep william chappell 
of ormond beach captured 70 percent of the vote against primary 
challenger charley roberts a retired army veteran chappells name 
has been mentioned in published reports about the defense 
procurement probe but he denied wrongdoing 
macks predecessor la skip bafalis made it into a runoff 
as he sought to win back the congressional seat he gave up to run 
for governor in 1982 in a fiveway race he finished second with 
29 percent to former lee county commissioner porter goss who had 
38 percent retired army gen james dozier held hostage 42 days 
in 1981 by red brigade terrorists in italy finished third at 18 
percent

the state department said wednesday it has 
asked the government of burundi to accept international involvement 
into an inquiry on last months tribal massacre that is believed to 
have claimed thousands of lives 
department spokesman charles redman said the inquiry would cover 
both the causes and solutions to the violence that has erupted 
periodically in burundi in central africa 
more than 100000 hutus who make up more than 85 percent of the 
population were killed in 1972 and an estimated 5000 died in the 
slaughter last month the hutus have been feuding for decades with 
the tutsis who dominate burundis politics 
redman confirmed earlier independent accounts that government 
forces were responsible for some of killings while condemning the 
armed forces role he said authorities in burundi have permitted 
journalists and embassy observers free access to area where the 
atrocities occurred 
redman said there has been no cutoff of us aid but that 
officials are assessing the situation

the us public health system largely a 
victim of its own success has eroded to a point where americans 
are at unnecessary risk a national academy of sciences panel said 
wednesday 
members of a committee formed by the academys institute of 
medicine declined at a news conference to put the blame on any 
particular administration or segment of the health community 
i think this is something that has evolved over time said 
bailus walker jr professor of environmental health and toxicology 
at state university of new york in albany and president of the 
american public health association 
nonetheless they said the system probably is less equipped to 
cope with health emergencies than it was 20 or 30 years ago and 
that the first task is to get the public to accept that there is a 
problem 
our guard is now down said richard d remington chairman 
of the committee and professor of preventive medicine and 
environmental health at the university of iowa the american 
people must understand that everyones health will suffer in the 
long run if we do not take care now to rebuild the capability of 
and confidence in our public health agencies 
the report itself said we have slackened our public health 
vigilance nationally and the health of the public is unnecessarily 
threatened as a result public health is a vital function that is 
in trouble 
it said many of the major improvements in the health of the 
american people have been accomplished through public health 
measures but lamented that the public has come to take the 
success of public health for granted 
joseph boyle executive vice president of the american society 
of internal medicine and a former president of the american medical 
association said part of the problem is dwindling communication 
between private doctors and public health officials 
they have lost one another and in the process they have lost 
their way said boyle 
he noted that individual americans rely heavily on their 
individual physicians for advice on health matters in general 
including what they should demand from government in the way of 
public programs 
although the 218page report focuses on examining the public 
health system rather than specific health problems remington cited 
aids as an example of a threat the system was not well equipped to 
handle 
i think were going to be treated to more of the same and 
worse he said who knows which environmental problem will 
explode next 
not only is aids a good example of the kind of new diseases that 
can arise he said the way it is being dealt with is a good 
example of a major problem health professions dont trust 
politicians and politicians dont trust health professionals 
both sides are a little bit right and both sides are a little 
bit wrong said remington 
walker added that there are numerous instances where public 
health data suggested one approach and political pressures result 
in another pressed for an example he cited reluctance by some 
government officials to aggressively promote use of condoms as a 
barrier to sexual transmission of aids 
although not linked specifically to aids one section in the 
report itself says public support always fragile because of 
limited awareness is increasingly being eroded by controversy 
while elected officials too often eschew unpopular positions on 
health issues health officials too often fail to take into account 
the need for public support for public policies the report said 
many public health professionals who talked with us seemed to 
regard politics as a contaminant of an ideally rational 
decisionmaking process rather than as an essential element of 
democratic governance it said 
the panel cited aids and access to health care for the indigent 
as examples of immediate crises but said there are lingering 
problems with equally great significance for the health of the 
public and the wellbeing of our society 
it gave four examples injuries teenage pregnancy high blood 
pressure and smoking and substance abuse 
the institute also cited toxic substances and alzheimer disease 
as time bombs that will require increasing attention in coming 
years

anyone who illegally dumps the kind of 
infectious medical wastes that turned 1988 into a nightmare for 
beachgoers faces longer jail terms and stiffer fines under 
legislation signed into law wednesday 
gov mario cuomo said the syringes blood vials and other 
medical debris that washed ashore this summer threaten the 
livelihood of thousands who work at our beaches and the enjoyment 
of the millions of new yorkers who use the beaches for recreation 
several popular beaches were temporarily closed during the 
states hottest summer in decades when the debris came ashore 
under the bill approved by cuomo penalties of up to four years 
in prison and fines of up to 50000 could be brought against 
people convicted of illegally disposing of socalled red bag 
medical wastes the name refers to waste that is to be thrown out 
in specially marked containers 
previously state law had provided for illegal medical waste 
dumpers to face up to 15 days in jail and fines of up to to 2500 
according to state department of environmental conservation 
spokesman rw groneman 
cuomo also said he signed a companion bill wednesday that 
provides 2 million to pay for stepped up enforcement of the 
infectious waste disposal rules by the state departments of 
environmental conservation and parks recreation and historic 
preservation 
the bills are aimed at putting teeth into regulations recently 
established by the state environmental conservation and health 
departments that set out guidelines for disposal of medical wastes 
and require cradle to grave tracking 
among the debris discovered on new york beaches this summer were 
vials containing human blood infected with the hivvirus the 
aidsrelated immune system deficiency and hepatitis according to 
state health department tests 
groneman said the dec has not finalized its report on the source 
of the debris

un secretary general javier perez de cuellar said 
wednesday that the iraniraq peace talks in geneva are blocked 
because iran refused iraqs request to discuss navigation and 
border issues 
perez de cuellar met briefly with president francois mitterrand 
at the elysee palace to brief him about the talks that began aug 
25 five days after a unsponsored ceasefire began in the 
eightyear war 
france a permanent member of the un security council 
presides over the council 
the iraniraq negotiations aim to put a permanent end to the war 
that has left an estimated 15 million people dead 
perez de cuellar told reporters after the meeting he was seeking 
a formula to settle the issues that have stalled the un talks in 
geneva 
to be truthful i cannot say the situation will be unblocked 
tomorrow said the secretarygeneral who also was scheduled to 
meet with foreign minister roland dumas and premier michel rocard 
irans deputy foreign minister mohammad javad larijani told 
reporters you cant say the negotiations are deadlocked but 
they definitely are slowing down 
he said the problem was iraqs wish to discuss freedom of 
navigation and the shatt alarab waterway a section of the border 
between the two countries the border has been a source of dispute 
between the two neighbors for 150 years 
an agreement made in 1975 in algiers gave half of the waterway 
to each country but iraq has since renounced the agreement and 
claimed all of the waterway 
iran has listed as priorities the withdrawal of troops to 
international borders exchange of war prisoners and assigning the 
blame for starting the war 
larijani said a discussion on the shatt alarab is not the 
next issue on the agenda even though iran which has four ports 
on the waterway is interested in the matter 
changing the borderline is out of the queston larijani 
said however 
larijani met in the french capital with rocard and dumas to 
bring them up to date on the iranian point of view in the geneva 
negotiations and to discuss improving relations 
paris broke diplomatic relations with iran in july 1987 after a 
dispute involving a french demand to question an iranian embassy 
employee about a wave of terrorist bombings 
relations were resumed in june after that issue was settled and 
the last three french hostages held in lebanon were freed 
larijani said iran appreciated the french naval presence in the 
persian gulf region he said it was calm and discreet compared to 
us intervention in the gulf which he termed hysterical 
asked about reports of recent usiranian contacts he denied 
there had been any official contact involving highlevel officials 
queried about lowlevel unofficial contacts he suggested a 
reporter consult the iranian foreign ministrys secret files

a nigerian teenager who is fighting 
deportation to her homeland because she says her father beat her 
will be allowed time to pursue her case further her lawyer said 
wednesday 
hours before omoleura oyesiji 17 was to be sent back to 
nigeria on tuesday her lawyer susan koenigcramer filed a motion 
for a temporary restraining order to block the action 
during a brief hearing wednesday the us immigration and 
naturalization service agreed to give koenigcramer an additional 
day to file a motion for habeas corpus which would claim oyesiji 
is being held illegally by the ins filing of the motion would 
suspend the deportation order until a federal judge rules on it 
said us attorney ron lahners 
the girl a high school senior is to stay with her foster 
parents in omaha until her fate is decided said koenigcramer the 
attorney said that at very least she hopes the girls safety can 
be ensured if she returns to africa 
in march 1987 oyesiji moved from nigeria to omaha with her 
father and stepmother so her father could attend the university of 
nebraska college of medicine 
omaha police responded to a call of a domestic assault at the 
family home in september 1987 authorities said a doctor found 
scars on the girls body possibly from previous beatings 
koenigcramer said though no charges were brought against the 
father the girl was placed in a youth home 
in december oyesijis father and stepmother moved back to 
nigeria leaving the girl behind because the girl moved to the 
united states on her fathers visa she was ordered to be deported 
koenigcramer said 
the girls foster mother sue fichter said she is a dedicated 
student who is earning good grades 
she is a terrific girl said ms fichter it was a 
supposed to be a temporary stay but we liked her so much we asked 
her to stay 
lahners said the ins had no choice but to try to deport the 
girl since an immigration judge signed a deportation order in july 
i think the immigration service is being very fair about it 
in allowing the young lady all of her legal rights lahners said 
but you must understand their situation they must enforce the 
law

a real estate broker who said six 
numbers had been driving me crazy presented a winning lotto 
ticket today to claim her record 55 million prize 
sheela ryan of winter springs said she didnt know what shed do 
with her winnings and was unsure whether she would quit her job 
she can pick up her first check for 2767361 next week 
ive always been middle class and the middle class always 
needs money she said at a news conference with her two attorneys 
and lottery officials 
ms ryan 63 a native new yorker said she was single and had 
no children 
she said today marked her first trip on a plane her first news 
conference and this is the first time ive ever won 55 million 
she said she picked the first six numbers that she read on the 
front page of the orlando sentinel 3 27 19 35 20 and 5 she 
bought the winning ticket in the central florida town of longwood 
these numbers were driving me crazy she said she had won 
4 twice previously in the game ms ryan said she had been buying 
four tickets a week until florida offered a 23 million jackpot in 
early august since then shes been buying five tickets 
before ms ryan claimed her prize several dozen lotto players 
claimed they had the winning ticket 
weve had several dozen calls from folks saying we have the 
winning ticket what do we do without identifying themselves or 
their city or anything else lottery secretary rebecca paul said 
tuesday until someone comes through the door with a ticket we 
take it all with a grain of salt 
its not a crime to claim a winning lottery ticket but its a 
felony to present an altered lottery ticket for payment 
one of the claimants was charles hill an elementary school 
janitor in the tiny hamlet of bristol about 280 miles northwest of 
longwood officials said hill told them his wet ticket was 
recovered from a pile of laundry after saturdays drawing 
hills claim was enough to get him a 23000 chevrolet van with 
no cash down 
tommy thomas owner of a panama city chevrolet dealership said 
tuesday that he gave a brand new mauve van to hill after liberty 
county sheriff harrell w revell told the credit manager that the 
ticket was bona fide 
we took a chance with them thomas said i figured if they 
were lucky enough to win the lottery we could do that 
but lottery officials said today that hill did not have the 
winning ticket 
we have denied mr hills claim based on the fact he does not 
have the original of his ticket a statement by tom bell general 
counsel for the lottery department read the lotterys 
verification procedures on the copy provided by mr hill indicate 
that he does not have the winning ticket 
several dozen people other than hill have called the department 
claiming to have the winning ticket according to mrs paul she 
said one identified himself as a resident of minnesota and another 
caller came from central florida 
the jackpots final value was put at 5516 million which 
breaks down into 20 annual payments of 276 million before taxes 
earlier estimates put the jackpot at 54 million a record for a 
state lottery 
gov bob martinez who has opposed the lottery announced 
tuesday that it had broken 1 billion in sales since it began in 
january the biggest winners he said are floridas schools 
this recordbreaking pace is exciting both for the players 
and public education in florida martinez said 
since 35 percent of lottery sales go to education 350 million 
or double earlier projections will go to support education 
martinez said

senate republican leader bob dole welcomed dan 
quayle back to the senate on wednesday giving him a fire 
extinguisher to fight off the press but stopping short of calling 
quayle an asset to the gop ticket 
i know youve been on a roller coaster ride dole said as he 
welcomed the indiana senator back after a summer recess in which 
quayle became the partys vice presidential nominee 
thank goodness our roller coaster is going up and michael 
dukakis is disappearing out of sight dole said dole said 
dukakis should get the rip van winkle award for 1988 hes 
been asleep he just disappeared 
since his nomination quayle has been dogged by controversies 
over his military service personal life and academic record and 
some in his own party have expressed skepticism about whether the 
41yearold senator should be on the ticket 
dole a onetime presidential hopeful who was on george bushs 
short list of vice presidential prospects has himself expressed 
reservations about quayle dole said recently that people of his 
generation might have problems with allegations that quayle used 
his wealthy familys influence to get into the national guard 
during the vietnam war 
he repeated that view wednesday saying if he did get certain 
breaks that would create a problem in the minds of many 
particularly i would say in my generation 
dole was asked by reporters after his reception for quayle 
whether he now thinks quayle is an asset to the republican ticket 
i think hes becoming an asset dole said did that mean the 
senator thought quayle had achieved that status yet he was 
pressed becoming dole replied 
at the reception dole presented quayle with a small fire 
extinguisher which he said quayle could spray on the press from 
time to time 
he also gave quayle a framed copy of the pledge of allegiance 
the republicans have critized dukakis the democratic presidential 
nominee for vetoing a massachusetts bill that would have required 
teachers to lead students in the pledge quayle devoted his labor 
day fall campaign kickoff speech to the pledge 
dole called quayle a rising young star in our party later 
he told reporters that despite quayles rocky start as the vice 
presidential nominee the young senator was catching on pretty 
fast 
you just get out there and do it dole said its a whole 
new world when you start a national campaign theres constant 
media attention and i think hes adapted very well in the last few 
weeks 
but dole gave a somewhat equivocal answer when asked about 
quayles qualifications for national office 
i think dan quayle is a very quick study its probably not 
fair to compare him with somebody whos been in the senate for 
1218 years or more dole said 
quayles democratic counterpart sen lloyd bentsen of texas is 
completing his 18th year in the senate 
my view is that he quayle is qualified its like saying 
compared to who you can always find someone better than anybody i 
know of in any business or profession there are others who have 
more experience but i think bush saw certain attributes he thought 
would be helpful to get him elected and he chose dan quayle its 
george bushs choice dole said 
quayle told his fellow republican senators no matter what 
happens in this election the people who know me best and the 
people i am closest to are the people right here in this room 
i cant wait to get back out there on the campaign trail he 
said quayle leaves thursday for a quick trip to illinois and ohio 
he said he would return to washington for key senate votes as he 
was needed

if we complete it may offer us greater serenity and power than 
weve ever had she said

an acquaintance was investigated in connection with the beating

a group of blacks whose death 
sentences have drawn worldwide protest spent their 1000th day on 
death row on thursday waiting for the countrys highest court to 
decide whether they can appeal 
the fivejudge appeal court in bloemfontein which turned down 
an earlier appeal from the sharpeville six heard arguments 
wednesday from defense attorneys asking that the case be reopened 
to hear evidence from a state witness who said police pressured him 
to lie 
the government has indefinitely postponed the hangings of the 
five men and one woman until the judicial proceedings are complete 
the court did not say when it would render its decision 
president pw botha has resisted appeals from the united 
states britain the united nations most european nations 
australia japan and canada to grant clemency in the case 
diplomats from 13 countries attended the hearing 
the defendants were sentenced to die for their roles in the 1984 
mob killing of black town councilor kuzwayo dlamini 
no evidence was presented that the six contributed physically to 
his death but they were convicted in 1985 under the principle of 
common purpose because they allegedly were active members of 
the crowd that stoned and burned dlamini during riots over a rent 
increase 
botha has said he will not intervene in the judicial process 
and he already has turned down a request for clemency before the 
new evidence of possible perjury was brought forward 
the state attorneys told the appeal court it had no jurisdiction 
to review the case once the president had made a decision even if 
new evidence was raised 
in june the lower court judge who imposed the death sentences 
rejected a motion to reopen the trial to consider the new evidence 
he said the defendants could appeal to the higher court but he felt 
their only hope lay with botha 
sydney kentridge a defense lawyer said the controversy 
surrounding the witness joseph manete could be resolved only if 
the case were reopened to allow new oral evidence but he also 
agreed with a suggestion by one of the judges jl van der merwe 
that wednesdays hearing could constitute the actual appeal he 
said he could imagine no further argument than had already been 
presented 
the defense submitted an affidavit in which manete said he 
falsely testified that two of the defendants were at the scene of 
the killing he also wrote a letter to botha describing in detail 
how police allegedly assaulted and threatened him and other 
witnesses 
i cannot interfere with the judicial system in south africa 
unless it is completed and only when it is completed will i as a 
human being deal with this matter on merit botha said in a 
british television interview tuesday 
some of bothas critics have accused him of hypocrisy on this 
issue noting that he ordered a halt to prosecution of south 
african soldiers about to go on trial for murder in southwest 
africa also known as namibia 
the sharpeville six are francis mokgesi 31 reid mokoena 24 
oupa moses diniso 32 duma joshua khumalo 28 reginald sefatsa 
32 and theresa ramashamola 27 
ms ramashamola would be the first south african woman executed 
in connection with a case widely viewed by activists as political 
violence against black officials who cooperate with the 
whitedominated governments segregated political structures is 
considered by many blacks to be a consequence of apartheid 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services

the air force has quietly approved the final 
construction phase for a nuclear doomsday radio network 
concluding that the project can be expanded without harming the 
environment 
the decision to expand the socalled gwen network of radio relay 
towers across the nation was made last month by air force deputy 
assistant secretary james f boatright said kevin gilmartin a 
spokesman for the air force electronic systems division at hanscom 
air force base mass 
it followed a review of public comments received since sept 25 
1987 when the air force published a final environmental impact 
statement on the work gilmartin said wednesday 
approval of the final construction phase means the gwen network 
ultimately will grow from 56 radio towers linking 38 terminals at 
military bases to 96 towers linking 49 terminals the spokesman 
said 
that represents a reduction from the 126 towers proposed last 
fall but will still provide a final operational capability he 
added 
gwen an acronym for ground wave emergency network is a 
system of lowpowered radio antennas and transmitters designed to 
ensure adequate communication links for us military forces 
following a nuclear attack the air force says the network is 
needed to ensure that a president can give a launch order to 
strategic air command bombers 
the service has said it would like to complete the expanded 
system by january 1992 
a typical gwen station consists of a thin 300foot tower and 
three small shelters surrounded by a fence the shelters house 
electronic equipment and an emergency generator and fuel the 
stations normally require a 700squarefoot parcel of land 
each gwen antenna is connected to a small grid of copper wire 
buried underground at its base and operates with less than 2000 
watts of power 
the air force currently is completing construction of what it 
calls the thin line system of 56 gwen towers fifty of those 56 
towers are already operating receiving and relaying brief test 
messages every 20 minutes 
some of the towers in the initial system generated public 
controversy with citizen groups in such states as massachusetts 
oregon pennsylvania and california banding together to fight gwen 
on grounds the towers increased the likelihood of their towns 
becoming nuclear targets 
the air force repeatedly dismissed those arguments asserting 
the isolated towers were not worth that type of targeting attention 
by the soviet union 
gwens construction surfaced anew as a political issue a few 
weeks ago when former defense secretary james schlesinger 
criticized democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis for 
opposing the project 
dukakis the governor of massachusetts wrote letters in 1986 
and 1987 opposing the placement of gwen towers in his state both on 
environmental and policy grounds 
now that boatwright has certified expansion of the system as 
posing no significant impact to the environment the air force 
must perform environment studies for each individual tower site and 
award a contract for additional equipment gilmartin said 
the air force estimates the entire system will cost roughly 600 
million when completed he said

solidaritys national spokesman won fresh 
support from president reagan on wednesday and urged polish 
authorities to make good on their pledge to negotiate with the 
banned independent trade union 
time is running out said janusz onyszkiewicz who has been 
the spokesman for solidarity since 1981 
people are expecting that some kind of compromise finally 
will be thrashed out and if nothing will indicate this is something 
that will happen soon then peoples patience will wear thin 
onyszkiewicz said predicting more labor unrest if the government 
doesnt bargain with solidarity 
the government seeking to end a 19day strike wave that swept 
poland from the baltic coast in the north to the silesian coal 
fields in the south last wednesday held talks with solidarity 
leader lech walesa for the first time since releasing him from 
martial law internment in november 1982 
the strikes are over but in warsaw government spokesman jerzy 
urban said that talks would not resume until later this month 
urban also said they would be called off if any more political 
strikes occur and urged workers to join governmentsponsored trade 
unions rather than try to revive solidarity 
polands communist authorities proclaimed a state of war against 
solidarity on dec 13 1981 and outlawed the union the following 
year before last week the government refused to negotiate with 
walesa and still refuses to allow solidarity to operate as a legal 
union 
walesa called urbans remarks irresponsible 
onyszkiewicz warned that if the people see that the talks are 
just a smokescreen there will be more unrest in poland 
when we ended the last strikes in august 1980 we had 
castiron guarantees in writing that the government would allow 
the creation of independent trade unions this time we dont 
said onyszkiewicz 
the only thing that we can say for sure is that there was an 
agreement to hold talks on all issues including unions said 
onyszkiewicz who is making his first visit to the west in five 
years 
but it would be extremely foolish of the polish government not 
to come up with something if not there will be new strikes in 
a few months he said 
if the government negotiates in earnest with solidarity now it 
can do so without the pressure of nationwide strikes and protests 
and can reach a reasonable compromise said onyszkiewicz who by 
profession is a lecturer in mathematics at warsaw university 
in two or three months they will be forced into 
concessesions and they will be viewed as a group that can be 
talked to only with a pistol to their heads he said 
after meeting with reagan in the oval office onyszkiewicz told 
reporters the us president was committed to maintaining pressure 
on the polish government 
i didnt ask for anything specific but it is obvious that if 
you want to see poland in a stable condition then you must 
obviously keep the pressure on the authorities and president 
reagan said that this pressure will be kept he said 
reagan imposed economic sanctions on poland after the martial 
law declaration and did not lift them until military rule ended 
and most political prisoners were released this year poland and 
the united states exchanged ambassadors for the first time since 
1982 
the solidarity spokesman said economic reforms introduced by 
polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski to decentralize some 
decisionmaking will not win popular support unless there are 
deep changes deep political changes in poland 
austerity cant be imposed by sheer force we need not only 
economic changes but political changes in the country thats why 
we need independent institutions thats why so many poles think we 
need solidarity said onyszkiewicz 
solidarity is a group that is committed against the use of 
force that gives it a moral power and it gives us hope that change 
will come in the future and that it will be bloodless he said 
i am optimistic in the long run we cant lose the most 
difficult period is still ahead it is going to be hard he said 
for geopolitical reasons we must accept the leading role of 
the communist party in setting out foreign and defense policy but 
we would like to be allowed to discuss and to help decide domestic 
policy issues such as housing he said

the belief that americas economic standing in 
the world will be rescued by emerging hightechnology industries 
was questioned wednesday by a prestigious study group which said 
the country is fast losing its dominance in many of these fields 
the council on competitiveness contending that the country has 
been far too complacent in the face of growing foreign competition 
recommended a major effort on the part of government industry and 
schools to reverse the trend 
we cannot afford any further erosion in our oncecommanding 
technological lead said the report of the council comprised of 
151 top officers of industry labor and higher education because 
technology is a driving force behind productivity improvements 
export strength and a high standard of living the stakes are 
enormous it said 
in releasing the report john young chairman of the council and 
president of hewlettpackard co said he wanted to challenge the 
comforting illusion that high technology industries would provide 
the economic panacea we all need to offset job losses in 
traditional smokestack industries 
in 1987 our trade deficit with japan in electronics was 
almost as large as it was for automobiles so silicon valley is not 
so far removed from detroit he said 
the report said that us companies market share had shrunk so 
dramatically over the past two decades that the country suffered a 
trade deficit in hightechnology goods for the first time ever in 
1986 
citing government statistics the report said that between 1970 
and 1987 american manufacturing companies saw their proportion of 
the us market for record players fall from 90 percent to 1 
percent in color televisions from 90 percent to 10 percent in 
machine tools from 100 percent to 35 percent and in telephones from 
99 percent to 25 percent 
in field after field foreign competitors have moved into 
markets pioneered and once dominated by american firms the 
council said often their success was built on exploiting 
inventions made in american laboratories by american scientists 
the report said countries such as japan have done a much better 
job of bringing new technology to the marketplace quickly 
weve been too slow too fragmented too uncoordinated and too 
adversarial said bobby inman a member of the council and the 
chairman of westmark systems inc 
roland w schmitt president of rensselaer polytechnic 
institute said that at the same time we are slipping downward in 
our ability to compete with foreign nations in high technology 
product sales we are slipping into dependence on foreign nationals 
to sustain education and research efforts 
he said that in us engineering schools currently 40 percent 
of the students and onethird of the faculty are foreign born 
even this infusion of talent will not be enough to prevent an 
estimated shortage of 500000 scientists and engineers in the 
country by the year 2010 the report said 
schmitt said the decreasing interest of american students in 
math and science was caused in part by a generally lackluster 
quality of teaching at the high school level 
to correct these problems will require increased federal 
spending even in this era of tight budgets the report said 
among the councils recommendations 
the presidents national science adviser should be elevated to 
cabinet rank with the power to develop a presidential strategy for 
the development of science and technology 
the federal government which spends as much on research and 
development as all of american industry combined should 
concentrate more on commercialization the report said the current 
priorities of defense space energy and health were focused too 
narrowly 
federal spending to support university research should be 
increased with 10 billion needed over the next 10 years to 
upgrade university research facilities which have seen their 
federal funding decline by 95 percent in real dollars since 1970 
the 700 federal research labs which have an annual budget of 
20 billion are at present so poorly supervised that it is 
difficult to determine just what projects they are pursuing some 
labs should be closed and the remaining ones better supervised 
the council also said tax credits to companies for research 
spending should be made permanent and congress should streamline 
its own decisionmaking on rampd spending which at present is 
splintered among nine different budget subcommittees 
the primary challenge for policymakers is to create a new 
policy framework appropriate for todays competitive environment 
we can no longer afford to view the commercial application of 
technology as a secondrate priority young said

as plagued by officials who lined their pockets through 
influencepeddling 
prosecutors on the third day of the trial said the law 
enforcement apparatus in the central asian republic of uzbekistan 
sold promotions and accepted gifts from officers who paid bribes to 
remain on the force 
one of the defendants pyotr begelman was accused of taking 
1600 from officers to help them get off a waiting list for buying 
a new car soviets sometimes wait years for a car 
begelman was quoted in a document read in the soviet supreme 
council as saying it was well known that to work in the 
uzbekistan police or interior ministry you had to give bribes 
and where could you get the money if not from subordinates 
begelman asked rhetorically 
the charge sheet read in court wednesday said begelman bribed an 
official of the communist partys policymaking central committee 
in uzbekistan to become a deputy interior minister in 1982 
begelman laughed sarcastically as a court reporter read some of 
the things he is accused of doing 
another codefendant identified only as kh norbutaev was 
accused in the charge sheet of taking 12000 rubles 19047 from 
one witness alone either in cash or in gifts such as alcohol 
sheep shoes fur hats and a finnish suit 
another of the nine defendants stood up in the dock at the start 
of the session to complain that investigators were using moral 
and psychological pressure to make him confess in moscows 
lefortevo prison where the accused are being held during a trial 
that is expected to last up to eight weeks 
that defendant former uzbek interior minister khaidar yakhyaev 
slept during some of the afternoon session 
an attorney for yakhyaev 61 said the defendant maintains he is 
innocent of all charges the defendants have not yet been given an 
opportunity to enter their pleas pending completion of the reading 
of the charges against them the indictment runs about 1500 pages 
on tuesday the government finished laying out its case against 
brezhnevs top police official who was said to have killed himself 
following discovery of his extravagant lifestyle financed by 
bribery 
the government charged that nikolai a shchelokov who served as 
interior minister under brezhnev took cash bribes as well as 
extravagant gifts including wine and pearls 
the principal defendant in the case is yuri m churbanov a 
shchelokov deputy who is married to brezhnevs daughter galina 
churbanovs wife has not appeared in court his lawyer told 
reporters she is ill but will testify in defense of her husband 
later in the trial 
the trial is seen as a further attempt to discredit brezhnev 
whose regime is routinely referred to by soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev and his top officials as a period of stagnation 
western reporters are being allowed to witness the opening days 
of the trial and have been told they will also be permitted to 
attend for the verdict

the pentagon is continuing to pay tens of 
millions of dollars more than it should for weapons because defense 
contractors are hiding information that would bring prices down 
the general accounting office said wednesday 
despite some pentagon successes in halting overpriced weapons 
contractors still arent complying with a 1962 law designed to 
provide more information to government contract negotiators the 
congressional watchdog agency told a house subcommittee 
the law the truth in negotiations act requires disclosure to 
the government by contractors of all relevant information about 
contracts companies found to be in violation can be sued for 
recovery of the overpricing 
our work shows that when contractors fail to disclose relevant 
cost or pricing data the government pays higher contract prices 
than warranted said paul math associate director of the gaos 
national security division 
math told the house government operations national security 
subcommittee that gao auditors have looked at 18 major contractors 
in the past four years and recommended that 32 million be 
recovered on 38 contractrs 
the pentagon agreed and has recovered 6 million and is still 
trying to get the rest of the money back math said 
a new round of gao checks on five contractors found potential 
overpricing of almost 18 million math said about 13 million was 
due to noncompliance with the 1962 law and the other 5 million 
was attributed to faulty contractor estimate systems 
the reviews involve noncompetitive contracts which are awarded 
without bidding the pentagon has generally pushed for more 
competition in its contracts in recent years but still awarded 79 
billion worth of noncompetitive contracts in fiscal 1987 math 
said 
the pentagon embarrassed by overpriced weapons has instituted 
a series of reforms that have partially solved the problem math 
said 
but further improvements are needed he added detailing new 
rules which would provide more data to government contracting 
officials that information would enable them to better argue for 
lowerpriced contracts 
derek j vander schaaf the pentagons deputy inspector general 
generally agreed with maths comments and also said the pentagon 
needs more auditors to check contracts 
we need to increase the audit resources the department of 
defense is dedicating to defective pricing reviews vander schaaf 
said

charged wednesday with seconddegree murder in the death of a state 
corrections officer killed during a shootout that ended the clans 
13day standoff in a rual compound 
the charges filed in 3rd circuit court in summit county name 
clan leader addam swapp his brother jonathan swapp and john 
timothy singer 
state attorneys had waited to file charges in the death of 
department of corrections lt fred house until after the three men 
and clan matriarch vickie singer had been sentenced last week by a 
judge following a federal trial on firearms attempted murder and 
bombing charges 
assistant attorney general creighton horton said that barring 
new evidence mrs singer would not be charged in houses death 
evidence presented during the federal trial showed the bullet 
that killed house was fired by john timothy singer 22 son of mrs 
singer during the shootout at the singer homestead in marion on 
jan 28 the gun battle seriously wounded addam swapp who 
triggered the siege when he bombed a nearby mormon chapel 
on friday us district judge bruce jenkins sentenced addam 
swapp to 15 years in federal prison jonathan swapp 21 and john 
timothy singer were sentenced to 10 years in prison and mrs 
singer 45 was given a fiveyear term 
the penalty for seconddegree murder is five years to life in 
prison 
third circuit judge maurice d jones ordered that the three be 
held without bail but it was not immediately known if they would 
be moved to the summit county jail in coalville or would remain in 
the salt lake county jail 
the complaint was signed by ronald e miller criminal 
investigator for the state attorney generals office it said the 
three men had either killed house 35 or acting under 
circumstances evidencing a depraved indifference to human life 
engaged in conduct which created a grave risk of death to another 
and thereby caused the death of fred house 
the document listed 34 people who witnessed the slaying or 
otherwise provided evidence no arraignment was scheduled 
the murder complaint said that after the three are tried they 
will be returned to the custody of federal officials to begin 
serving their prison sentences for the federal convictions 
swapp said the bombing of the kamas stake center was ordered by 
god as a sign of the impending collapse of the mormon church and 
all government he also said the act would trigger the return of 
family patriarch john singer slain by police nine years before for 
resisting arrest 
the clan maintained singer was killed in a churchstate 
conspiracy and that the family had been harassed for years by 
police and neighbors

the nations commercial banks enjoyed their 
most profitable six months on record through june this year 
despite continuing losses in texas the government said wednesday 
you could hardly ask for better said federal deposit 
insurance corp chairman l william seidman 
commercial banks earned 105 billion in the first and second 
quarters this year topping the 97 billion in net income for the 
second and third quarters of 1985 which had been the most 
profitable six months since the fcic began keeping track in 1934 
in the first half of last year banks lost 54 billion the big 
loss was almost entirely attributable to huge reserves set aside by 
the largest banks for expected losses on loans to third world 
countries 
banks havent seen the need to build those reserves further this 
year and are thus earning strong profits banks set aside 916 
million on foreign laons in the first six months of this year 
compared with 164 billion in the same period a year ago 
we think we will see record profits for the year if the 
economy continues on its current level said seidman whose 
agency insures commercial banks deposits up to 100000 the most 
profitable year for banking was 1985 when the industry posted 
earnings of 181 billion 
the apriljune period of 1988 was the second most profitable 
quarter on record after the julyseptember quarter of last year 
when banks reported 58 billion in net income 
however the banking picture remained bleak in texas a state 
troubled by soured real estate prices and a depression in the oil 
industry banks there lost 29 billion in the first half with 
23 billion of that attributable to a single institution first 
republicbank corp of dallas which has since been rescued with 4 
billion in federal money 
elsewhere in the oildependent southwest banks earned modest 
profits 
seidman said he hoped that the condition of banks in texas would 
improve now that so many have been closed or merged with healthier 
institutions at the end of august 173 banks had failed or 
required government assistance to stay open ninetyseven of those 
including 42 first republicbank subsidiaries were in texas 
seidman said failures would continue at the same rate this year 
setting a postdepression record but then decline next year 
in the midwest battered earlier in the decade by farm bank 
failures the profitability of most banks has been restored in the 
first half 7 percent of banks in iowa kansas minnesota 
missouri nebraska north dakota and south dakota lost money 
compared with nearly double that amount a year ago 
farm losses caused by this year drought may check the 
improvement in banks in the region but seidman said midwestern 
banks should be able to weather any difficulties because theyve 
lent more carefully than in the past and because of government aid 
to farmers 
other figures cited by the fdic include 
the number of unprofitable banks has dropped from 2243 in the 
first six months of 1987 to 1729 this year 
banks on the fdics problem list dropped from a peak of 1601 
at midyear 1987 to 1455 on june 30 of this year 
the total of bad loans those on which payments are not being 
made totaled 734 billion in the second quarter 3 percent less 
than a year ago 
bank lending in real estate and to consumers grew at the 
expense of traditional commercial loans to business much of the 
expansion in real estate loans was to build commercial projects 
such as offices and shopping centers much of the growth in 
consumer lending was in home equity loans 
seidman also noted that growth in commercial bank deposits 
barely matches inflation and is not keeping up with growth in the 
economy meanwhile deposits at savings and loan institutions have 
grown twice as fast he said many insolvent sampls which have not 
yet been closed by regulators are paying high interest rates in 
order to attract depositors

in a lawsuit titled united states of 
america vs 308 cardboard cases more or less of condoms 
federal officials dont want to leave condom quality control to 
someone else 
federal prosecutors are asking a federal judge to order the us 
marshals office to seize a batch of defective condoms from mentor 
corps warehouse in suburban brooklyn center the lawsuit is 
against the product not mentor corp 
the seizure would include about 44350 condoms from a batch of 
contraceptives made for mentor by an east coast factory said 
assistant us attorney roylene champeaux 
judge paul magnuson is expected to sign the seizure order later 
this week champeaux said the marshals service will confiscate 
the condoms and officially put them in magnusons custody 
according to the governments complaint mentor will have until 
nov 10 to contest the seizure if mentor does not file a claim for 
the return of the condoms the government will destroy them 
champeaux said 
that would be fine said mentor spokesman al mannino that 
would save us the cost of destroying them 
mannino said he was baffled by the governments action because 
his company had informed the federal government that it was going 
to destroy the condoms 
fda inspectors declared the mentor batch defective aug 1 
mannino said a batch is substandard if more than three condoms of 
a batch of 1000 leak he said 
on aug 18 mentors quality control officer signed an affidavit 
saying the company would destroy them 
in the past manufacturers were allowed to destroy the condoms 
and file affidavits with the fda stating they had been destroyed 
he said 
but the company recently was notified that the fda is now taking 
a much tougher approach to condom quality control 
comparing the suit to an admiralty law action champeaux said 
this is the same thing as seizing a ship 
mentor has headquarters in minnesota and santa barbara calif 
the company which makes a variety of implantable devices and 
health care products buys condoms from other manufacturers and 
adds an adhesive to the inside as well as an outer hood

washingtons orchard belt was spared from a 
blistering 30000acre forest fire wednesday by farmers who turned 
on their irrigation systems and by a shift in wind and temperature 
the arrival of cool humid weather and more favorable winds gave 
firefighters the upper hand for the first time in three days 
the plan is for direct attack today said doreen medina 
us forest service spokeswoman 
the blaze believed to be humancaused grew from about 160 
acres monday for a time it had threatened the lush green fruit 
orchards that run for miles along the opposite bank of the entiat 
river the orchards are the backbone of the local economy and 
would take years to replace 
the chelan county sheriffs department had asked growers along a 
fivemile stretch of the river to turn on their sprinklers to keep 
the blaze from spreading on the orchard side of the river 
about 700 firefighters used bulldozers to ring the fire while 
dozens of aircraft and helicopters bombed it with water and flame 
retardant an addditional 100 people including national guardsmen 
are supporting the firefighters 
the fire 50 percent surrounded by fire lines wednesday was not 
expected to be completely contained before friday 
we had done a lot of defensive work now most of that is 
holding and they are taking the resources and putting them on the 
fire line medina said were actually going out and building 
line 
smoke from the fire was so thick tuesday that a 40mile stretch 
of us 97 between chelan and wenatchee was closed the shift in 
winds helped officials reopen the highway wednesday and dozens who 
had evacuated from their homes were allowed to return one home on 
the outskirts of this central washington town of 400 was destroyed 
more than 3 million acres of public and private forests in 
eastern washington were closed because of the fire danger and bans 
or restrictions have been levied statewide on hunters fishermen 
and campers 
the major area of concern was the entiat fires west and 
northwest side a critical winter range for one of the states 
largest mule deer herds 
this is the turning point on this fire said ron dehart 
spokesman for an interagency task force battling the fire 
right now weve got it pinned in a corner with the fire 
stopped by the entiat river on the southern flank highway 97 on 
the eastern flank dehart said 
elsewhere in washington five fires were burning in the 
northeast corner of the state those have burned 58000 acres and 
were requiring the efforts of 4000 firefighters 
janet edwards a spokeswoman for the firefighting effort in the 
colville national forest said only one of the fires was still 
growing that one near republic wash was at 17600 acres

three top retired military officers testified 
wednesday that the war powers act should be repealed on grounds 
that its restraints on a presidents ability to expose us forces 
to the risk of combat are unworkable and possibly unconstitutional 
i think the nation would be best served by repealing the 
entire act said retired air force gen david c jones a former 
chairman of the military joint chiefs of staff it is a continual 
sore in relations betweeen the executive and congress 
another joint chiefs chairman retired army gen john w vessey 
jr said he agreed with jones that repeal of the act would be a 
good thing 
retired air force general brent scowcroft national security 
adviser in the ford administration also called for repeal 
describing the act as wellmeaning but deeply flawed 
the three retired officers testified before the senate foreign 
relations committee which is examining possible steps to 
strengthen the the war powers act enacted over president nixons 
veto in 1973 
the act requires the president to notify and consult with 
congress whenever he orders troops into combat conditions and says 
those forces may have to be withdrawn within 60 days unless 
congress approves their continued deployment 
the hearings were chaired by sen joseph r biden jr his first 
official act since his recovery from brain surgery earlier this 
year 
scowcroft said that while the consultations between the 
president and congress called for by the act are a worthwhile goal 
the act does not make clear what is meant by consultations 
how does the president deal with objections to his plans he 
asked how can a president deal with confidentiality what if 
congress is out of session 
to a layman it seems that the law most clearly is 
unconstitutional he said if being commander in chief has any 
meaning at all it must include the ability to move troops 
he and the others said congress can use its power of the purse 
as expressed in the appropriations process to force a president to 
withdraw us forces 
this act is an invitation to struggle between the two 
branches he said we need to increase cooperation between the 
two branches not an attempt by one branch to tie the other down 
vessey said that the way things stand now the war powers act 
provides the nations adversaries with an opening to drive a 
wedge between president and congress and the american body 
politic 
sen brock adams dwash said the arguments for repealing the 
act amount to a declaration that it is better to let the pot boil 
until there is an explosion between the congress and the president 
or between the people and the president rather than go ahead with 
an orderly procedure under the war powers act

us defense secretary frank c carlucci said 
wednesday he is satisfied with chinas assertions that its growing 
arms trade will not contribute to instability in the middle east 
and other volatile regions 
he told reporters two days of talks were the best discussions 
we have ever had on the question he was fully usatisfied 
with the chinese explanation and i hope we can put this issue 
behind us 
the united states will continue to work to expand the 
technology that is being made available to china carlucci said 
adding without elaboration that new technology exchange programs 
are being discussed in aviation and other fields 
boeing is negotiating the sale to china of about a dozen ch47 
transport helicopters for use by a rapid deployment force the 
united states has supplied china with helicopters technology for 
fighter jets torpedoes and other ammunition 
carlucci met on wednesday with 84yearold deng xiaoping 
chinas leader and head of the central military commission 
he conferred tuesday with defense minister qin jiwei premier li 
peng and vice premier wu xueqian 
among matters discussed were ussoviet arms reduction talks 
the soviet military withdrawal from afghanistan the situations in 
cambodia and korea modernization of chinas armed forces and 
chinese domestic policy 
the chinese clearly attach great importance to their own 
satellite launching service which could suffer serious losses if 
washington does not issue export licenses for us communications 
satellites carlucci told reporters 
defense department officials said the issue was raised by all 
the chinese leaders carlucci met on tuesday and urged the reagan 
administration to approve launching of us satellites by china 
i indicated that from my perspective i did not see this as a 
national security issue the defense secretary said they have 
given us all the assurances we need on the safeguarding of the 
technology it is not a technology transfer issue it is a trade 
issue 
the commerce department and some us congressmen have argued 
that launching american satellites with the chinese long march 
rocket would undermine efforts by us companies to establish 
commercial launching services 
carlucci also was asked about a statement by deng xiaoping that 
he hoped vice president george bush would win the presidential 
election 
bush headed the us liaison office in beijing in 197475 
before full diplomatic relations were established and has met deng 
and other chinese leaders in frequent visits to china since then 
i gave him deng about a billion absentee ballots carlucci 
said jokingly 
deng generally receives only visiting presidents and premiers 
his meeting with carlucci underscored the importance with which 
china views overall relations and military links with the united 
states 
military ties have developed since diplomatic relations were 
established in 1979 exchanges of senior military officials are 
common the united states sells a small amount of military hardware 
to china and us warships made a port call in 1986 at the yellow 
sea port of qingdao

objections of the reagan administration 
the spot running in texas concludes the choice is clear 
or is it 
i want a kinder and gentler nation bush says at the outset 
of a 30second spot running in california in an excerpt from his 
convention acceptance speech im a quiet man but i hear the 
quiet people others dont i hear them and i am moved

scenes bush cooking corn in a big pot bush biting into a 
sandwich at a picnic bush lifting a grandchild into the air and 
kissing her

notification laws in the country and touts texas sen lloyd 
bentsen dukakis running mate as the man who won the fight to 
make 60day notification law the two are shown in their

the national centers for disease control plans more 
rigorous sanitary inspections of cruise ships and new health 
scorecards that will help the public judge a ships history a cdc 
official said wednesday 
dr vernon n houk director of the cdcs center for 
environmental health and injury control said the center plans to 
hire additional inspectors and set up an improved inspection 
routine of the cruise ships 
houk said the proposed new reporting procedures would replace 
passfail designations with a numeral rating and include a median 
score of all inspections from the previous five years 
a single inspection score does not accurately predict the 
possibility of an epidemic on a particular cruise said houk 
however an epidemic is significantly less likely to occur on a 
vessel whose staff maintains a higher level of sanitation over a 
period of time 
he added scores over a fiveyear period would provide the 
traveling public with more information than is now available 
meanwhile outbreaks of germrelated illnesses has remained 
stable on passenger vessels although more ships are docking at us 
ports 
cruise ship voyages from the us have nearly doubled from the 
mid1970s to about 3500 trips yearly but houk said the number of 
gastric diseases since 1980 has remained steady at about two cases 
per 10 million passengerdays that figure represents the total 
number of days at sea 
since the cdc resumed unannounced cruise ship inspections in 
march 1987 five outbreaks affecting about 22000 passengers have 
been investigated 
the cdc spot inspection program halted in 1985 was refunded by 
congress after limited cooperation from cruise ship lines using 
private inspectors 
only about 30 percent of 78 cruise ships inspected by the cdc 
since march 1987 achieved scores above 85 the minimum passing 
mark on first inspection however all but five ships passed on 
reinspection according to cdc figures 
the inspections include checking water food preparation and 
storage and general cleanliness said the biweekly cdc cruise ship 
report summary distributed to travel agents and cruise ship 
operators 
houk said at a public meeting here wednesday that the numeral 
reporting system could be implemented early next year if approved 
by federal officials there is no fine or other penalty for cruise 
ships failing cdc inspections but the lines could suffer losses if 
tour operators direct clients to other vessels or the public learns 
of the low score 
reputation is invaluable in the cruise ship industry said 
john layzell a vice president at miamibased admiral cruise one 
of 22 lines operating out of us ports if the traveling public 
reads about an unsatisfactory score in their sunday travel 
sections then they might just change their minds 
james mitchell jr a travel agent from hanover nh who 
attended the conference said the cdc reports will not have full 
impact until they are circulated among most of the 30000 tour 
brokers around the country 
right now at best 3 percent of the travel agents get the 
reports he said most agents dont even know these reports 
exists

south africa is a country drifting toward 
massive violence and only bold new internal leadership and strong 
signals from other countries will avert largescale bloodshed sen 
paul simon said wednesday 
simon said his recent fiveday trip to south africa convinced 
him that it is time for the united states to adopt its strictest 
economic sanctions yet as a signal to pretoria that apartheid the 
subjugation of the black majority must be abandoned 
blacks are living in despair and hopelessness and whites are 
living in fear simon dill told a news conference and the 
greater the fear the more there is repression 
new sanctions legislation similar to a bill passed aug 11 in 
the house was scheduled to come before the senate foreign 
relations committee on thursday simon chairs the panels africa 
subcommittee 
simon and another senate backer of the harsh sanctions measures 
assistant democratic leader alan cranston of california said they 
believed the measure could be brought to the floor for a vote in 
the waning days of this years session 
but both conceded that it would be difficult to pass the bill in 
the absence of significant republican support and they 
acknowledged that opponents could make it difficult to get ifrom mentor 
corps warehouse in suburban brooklyn center the lawsuit is 
against the product not mentor corp 
the seizure would include about 44350 condoms from a batch of 
contraceptives made for mentor by an east coast factory said 
assistant us attorney roylene champeaux 
judge paul magnuson is expected to sign the seizure order later 
this week champeaux said the marshals service will confiscate 
the condoms and officially put them in magnusons custody 
according to the governments complaint mentor will have until 
nov 10 to contest the seizure if mentor does not file a claim for 
the return of the condoms the government will destroy them 
champeaux said 
that would be fine said mentor spokesman al mannino that 
would save us the cost of destroying them 
mannino said he was baffled by the governments action because 
his company had informed the federal government that it was going 
to destroy the condoms 
fda inspectors declared the mentor batch defective aug 1 
mannino said a batch is substandard if more than three condoms of 
a batch of 1000 leak he said 
on aug 18 mentors quality control officer signed an affidavit 
saying the company would destroy them 
in the past manufacturers were allowed to destroy the condoms 
and file affidavits with the fda stating they had been destroyed 
he said 
but the company recently was notified that the fda is now taking 
a much tougher approach to condom quality control 
comparing the suit to an admiralty law action champeaux said 
this is the same thing as seizing a ship 
mentor has headquarters in minnesota and santa barbara calif 
the company which makes a variety of implantable devices and 
health care products buys condoms from other manufacturers and 
adds an adhesive to the inside as well as an outer hood

president reagan has invited the foreign 
ministers of egypt and israel to a minisummit meeting in new york 
on sept 26 to try to give new impetus to lagging mideast peace 
efforts us and diplomatic sources said wednesday 
initially secretary of state george p shultz planned to meet 
with israeli foreign minister shimon peres and egyptian foreign 
minister ahmed esmat abdel meguid while all were attending the 
special session of the un general assembly 
reagan decided to step in to demonstrate that us interest in 
promoting a settlement of the arabisraeli conflict had not flagged 
despite a lack of progress in recent months and elections to be 
held in the united states and israel in november shultz also will 
participate 
they want to show the initiative is still alive said a 
diplomatic source who like the others demanded anonymity a us 
official said reagan wanted to put his weight behind the us 
proposal for a mideast peace conference and see whether the 1979 
peace treaty egypt signed with israel can be expanded further into 
the arab world 
the presidents invitation was conveyed tuesday to a senior 
israeli embassy official who readily accepted in behalf of his 
government shultz called in egyptian ambassador abdel rauf 
elreedy on wednesday to outline the us initiative 
while reagan is in new york he also will address the un 
session 
state department spokesman charles e redman declined to say 
whether reagan would meet with the foreign ministers a lot of 
meetings are possible in new york but im not at a point where i 
can confirm those at this point he told reporters 
peres head of the labor party has supported shultzs efforts 
this year to convene a mideast peace conference but prime minister 
yitzhak shamir head of the likud coalition has resisted partly 
because the administration proposes that israel yield most of the 
west bank and gaza in exchange for arab recognition 
shamirs likud associates suggested in jerusalem that the reagan 
administration was meddling in israeli affairs by setting up a 
meeting just five weeks before israels election the nov 1 
balloting is viewed as a referendum on israels mideast policy 
at this hour i still dont have all the details on the 
meeting the prime minister said i will just say one thing we 
must not forget that we are on the eve of elections 
uri oren political adviser to deputy prime minister david levy 
of likud called the meeting a bad joke and astonishing 
evidence of improper policy both external and internal 
everybody understands that such a meeting cannot advance any 
political process several weeks before the elections he told an 
associated press reporter in jerusalem 
jordans king hussein has insisted on a guaranteed israeli 
withdrawal as a condition for attending peace talks shamir 
rejected the proposition during a trip by shultz to the region last 
spring and hussein subsequently said he would no longer try to 
intercede on behalf of the palestinian arabs who live in the 
territories israel captured from jordan and egypt in the 1967 
mideast war 
the us blueprint for peace envisaged jordan resuming its 
control of west bank territory which it held from 1948 to 1967 
while shamir favors selfrule but not statehood for the 14 million 
palestinians in the west bank and gaza 
there is no place in the administrations plan for a separate 
palestinian state 
reagans predecessor jimmy carter engineered the 
israeliegyptian peace treaty by holding a summit at camp david 
md in 1978 with former israeli prime minister menachem begin and 
the late egyptian president anwar sadat 
a meeting in new york would give israel another opportunity to 
step up its relations with egypt under the treaty president hosni 
mubarak has resisted however until the settlement can be 
broadened to include palestinians 
meanwhile yehoshafat harkabi a former chief os israeli 
military intelligence on wednesday called on his government to 
negotiate with the palestine liberation organization for the 
creation of a palestinian state on the west bank and in gaza 
in a washington speech harkabi who now teaches writes and 
lectures called the pl0 the enemy and an ugly 
organization but he said israel must recognize there either 
will be a palestinian state as our neighbor or israel will be the 
palestinian state

a man who chopped down a neighbors 
stately oak tree to improve reception on his television satellite 
dish was placed on two years probation wednesday and ordered to 
stay off the tree owners property 
superior court judge thomas g west granted the request by 
arthur anderson 59 of redding for accelerated rehabilitation a 
form of probation on charges stemming from the felling of the 
83yearold oak 
in his decision the judge didnt address tree owner charles 
marriners request that andersons satellite dish be taken away 
from him during the probationary period 
hes going to be able to enjoy the fruits of his crime 
marriner 62 also of redding told the court 
andersons lawyer jeffrey b sienkiewicz told west that his 
client is very regretful about this entire incident 
i dont believe that mr anderson knew that the tree was on 
mr marriners property sienkiewicz said 
marriner said however that anderson had to go over a stone 
wall and a fence to get to the tree which was about 170 feet from 
the marriner home 
police said it was the second time anderson was caught on 
marriners property they said he cut down a tulip tree there in 
may 1987 and was warned then against trespassing 
west said he was not ordering anderson to make restitution 
because that issue is pending in a civil suit marriner has filed 
he seeks 37000 in compensation for the two trees 
anderson a construction worker cut down the tree june 12 
police said he told police that he and his wife are television 
addicts and said now i can get the disney channel 
under the accelerated rehabilitation program available only to 
firsttime offenders if the defendant completes probation 
successfully the charges are erased from his record

american experts say the soviets handled 
tuesdays crisis on their soyuz spacecraft with a sophistication 
and confidence that comes from years of successful missions 
nicholas johnson a us authority on soviet space said despite 
the drama of two men caught in a malfunctioning space capsule the 
situation was much less serious than problems the soviets 
encountered on earlier flights 
the soviets have had major anomalies about every four years 
since 1967 said johnson who works for teledyne brown 
engineering in colorado springs colo a major space contractor 
these are situations which are potentially life threatening 
and this one was probably the most modest of all of them he said 
the soviets lost one cosmonaut in 1967 three in 1971 in 1975 
there was an inflight launch abort during a prelude to the joint 
ussoviet mission in which an apollo spacecraft linked up with a 
soyuz in space and in 1983 there was a launch abort when the 
rocket caught fire on its pad and the cosmonauts had to be pulled 
off with an emergency system 
donald k slayton who was one of the three astronauts aboard 
apollo in the joint mission said the fact the soviets passed up an 
opportunity to land safely but off target on tuesday shows there 
was no panic or severe emergency 
if they had had a serious problem of running out of 
expendables oxygen they would have gotten it down somewhere 
slayton said that tells you they had it under control 
marcia smith the sovietspace expert at the library of 
congress said the successful landing was a feather in their cap 
especially for ground controllers who sorted out what the problem 
was and sorted out the fix for it 
the experts acknowledged they need a great deal more information 
before passing final judgments but slayton said the way in which 
the soviets handled the problem shows they certainly are more 
sophisticated now than they were in 1975 
theve got a lot more epxerience now than they did then and 
its probably simpler for them now he said slayton one of the 
original seven american astronauts is vice president of space 
services inc a private launch company in houston 
miss smith said she does not know whether the soyuz problem was 
with an infrared sensor that determines the position of the 
spacecraft by taking readings of the earths horizon or with the 
ships computer 
there is some indication now there was a misprogramming of the 
computer she said 
being marooned in space has been a concern of all space 
travelers since humans first went into orbit slayton said this 
concern was reflected in the design of the mercury spacecraft 
americas first manned orbiting vehicle he said the oneman craft 
had three solid retro rockets any one of which could have brought 
the astronauts to earth somewhere 
the soyuz had two engines the main one can be shut down and 
restarted while the backup can be fired only once 
im interested in what engine they fired said miss smith 
she called the backup the last shot to get them home 
johnson said the soviets were just as candid with the public 
about their problem nine years ago when soyuz33 malfunctioned with 
a soviet and a bulgarian aboard and had to abandon its plans to 
dock with a space station 
we didnt hear all the details after the 33 incident but they 
told us there was a malfunction in the main engine he said 
the waited 24 hours and used the backup engine to get back 
by coincidence he pointed out one of the cosmonauts on the 
space station was vladimir lyakhov the commander of the soyuz that 
got in trouble on tuesday

leftist guerrillas blew up colombias 
main oil pipeline and fierce fighting is driving hundreds of 
peasants out a southern state the defense ministry said wednesday 
president virgilio barco offered sept 1 to negotiate peace with 
colombias six guerrilla groups but there has been no answer from 
the insurgents 
one of the guerrilla groups the national liberation army blew 
up the canon limon oil pipeline on tuesday the defense ministry 
said in a news release 
guerrillas have attacked oil pipelines 46 times this year 
canon limon is an oil field in northwest colombia with 1 billion 
barrels of reserve petroleum discovered four years ago by the 
occidental petrolum co 
the pipeline which pumps 225000 barrels of oil a day will be 
shut down at least until saturday for repairs the state oil 
company ecopetrol said in a news release 
the 500mile pipeline takes oil from canon limon in the state 
of arauca to the caribbean port of covenas 
ecopetrol has estimated that guerrilla attacks on oil 
installations have cost colombia 300 million this year 
meanwhile the defense ministry communique said heavy fighting 
is going on between guerrillas and the army in the southern state 
of tolima hundreds of peasants are fleeing the area the statement 
said 
it said nothing about casualties in the battle with elements of 
the leftist colombian revolutionary armed forces

members of congress expressed concern 
wednesday that americas electronics industry could suffer 
irreparably if it is left behind in the race to develop a new 
highquality television system 
the result they said could cost the country in many ways an 
even higher trade deficit and thousands of jobs lost as well as 
the loss of potential military medical consumer and other 
applications that are expected to come with development of the 
technology 
rep edward j markey dmass chairman of the 
telecommunications subcommittee asked electronics industry trade 
associations to submit reports to the panel by january outlining 
steps the government could take to assure american involvement in 
highdefinition tv 
suggestions have ranged from antitrust exemptions for us 
companies involved in hdtv research and development to 
appropriating pentagon funds for hdtv research because of the 
potential military applications of the technology he said 
over the last decade the united states has shifted from a major 
supplier to a net importer of electronics products he noted 
hdtv could make a bad situation worse markey said at the 
final of three hearings on highdefinition tv called hdtv 
high definition tv produces clearer brighter images on a wider 
tv screen with highquality sound the japanese have been 
developing hdtv for nearly 20 years and the europeans have been 
working on their own system for several years both systems are 
incompatible with us television broadcasting 
the federal communications commission last week set preliminary 
guidelines that will allow research to proceed toward establishing 
an american hdtv system under the fcc guidelines a us system 
must be able to be received on existing tv sets so current 
equipment would not become obsolete but to receive improved 
picture quality viewers would have to buy a new tv set 
richard elkus jr chairman of the prometrix corp and 
testifying for the american electronics association said advanced 
tv offers the us electronics industry an opportunity to rebound 
in a market projected to reach 20 billion in us sales and 40 
billion worldwide by the year 2007 
it also will have ripple effects in other areas he said for 
example hdtv products will use a large supply of advanced 
semiconductors and hdtv will have applications in military and 
medical fields he said in testimony submitted to the panel 
he added however that regardless of what standard the united 
states selects it wont stop the japanese from entering the us 
market 
more important than selecting a standard he said is government 
and industry coming up with a strategy to put american companies 
back on the electronics manufacturing track and to develop 
marketing and distribition systems that will rival the japanese 
about 20 advancedtv systems are under development and competing 
to be designated as the us hdtv standard 
richard wiley a former fcc chairman and chairman of the fccs 
advisory committee on advanced tv technologies said his panels 
testing of the systems could begin by the end of the year and will 
take a year and a half to complete 
this is not going to be something youre going to solve 
overnight he said referring to the selection of a standard 
system the involvement of us electronics companies in the 
emerging industry and the gradual replacement of tv sets by 
american viewers 
wiley estimated that the united states had a year or two to 
establish a national hdtv policy but markey said im not as 
optimistic as you are in the time we have before us

the united states has warned the antisoviet 
mujahedeen rebels in afghanistan against producing and smuggling 
drugs to support their fight a us official said wednesday 
we have indicated to them it would be bad for them in congress 
and in us public opinion said the official speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
the seven rebel groups based in pakistan are waging a fight for 
control of afghanistan now that the soviet union has begun a 
pullout to end its 8year occupation the rebels are fighting the 
sovietbacked kabul government and are also expected to vie for 
supremacy among themselves 
a report issued by the state department this week said the 
estimated 3 million to 5 million afghan refugees expected to return 
next year from pakistan and iran will need a quick and profitable 
cash crop to make a living on their ravaged lands the cultivation 
of opium and heroin will be extremely tempting the report said 
it urged international agencies coordinating the repatriation of 
afghan refugees to raise the level of public awareness of the 
narcotics problem 
its something were very aware of and weve talked to the 
mujahedeen about said the us official who is involved in the 
repatriation effort 
the state department report said the soviet pullout as well as 
pakistani president zia ulhaqs death last month in a plane crash 
cast serious doubt on the prospects for successful narcotics 
control in southwest asia 
the international narcotics control strategy report is 
issued by the state department every six months to update 
government officials and congress about attempts of some 50 
countries to eradicate drug production and smuggling 
afghanistan already the largest producer of illicit opium in 
southwest asia is likely to be faced with even greater levels of 
opium cultivation in the unsettled conditions following the soviet 
troop withdrawal the report said 
whatever new government is established in kabul after the 
soviets leave will be faced with so many other pressing needs 
that narcotics control may not be given a high priority it said 
in pakistan president zia was a strong supporter of drug 
eradication and his unexpected death introduced serious 
uncertainties in pakistan that may have an impact on narcotics 
control the report said 
the united states has made it clear to the caretaker government 
in pakistan that narcotics control remains a highpriority issue 
in uspakistan relations the document said

airman ron arad is now under the control of the faithful 
resistance movement a faction based in the bekaa valley that

a century of misguided attempts to fight every 
forest fire worsened this summers blazes in yellowstone national 
park by allowing a natural buildup of fuel national park service 
officials said wednesday 
its obvious it made it worse said walt dabney chief 
ranger of the service 
if more fires of the past had been allowed to burn fewer 
combustible gases would have built up through the natural decaying 
of tree leaves and underbrush thus todays forest blazes would be 
easier to manage the officials said 
though the service will review its policy of letting many fires 
burn our policy is sound based on scientific research said 
william penn mott director of the service 
the problem is the building up of fuel in many areas due to 
the previous policy 
the park service has followed a policy of letting most fires 
burn since 1972 it fights them only when they threaten settled 
areas or areas outside the parks yellowstone was established as a 
park in 1872 
ecologists say natural fires are important in preserving species 
diversity and attracting wildlife in fact many species such as 
the lodgepole pine typical of yellowstone depend on fire for 
reproduction 
the forest service whose land almost completely surrounds 
yellowstone follows a similar policy for its wilderness areas 
but it relies on deliberate controlled burning and timber 
harvesting to manage the fifthsixths of its domain that is not 
wilderness in that larger area most fires are fought if the 
service judges that they will not stay within reasonable 
bounds said peterson 
since july 21 the park service has been trying to put out the 
fires in yellowstone and has directed its other installations to 
extinguish quickly any fire for which there wont be resources to 
monitor and steer away from vulnerable areas it has banned 
controlled burning for the rest of the summer 
of the 13 separate fire outbreaks in and near yellowstone five 
originally were allowed to burn some of them starting on forest 
service land outside the park some fires have merged leaving 
eight active now 
in hindsight we would have tried to put out every fire 
peterson said if we had known the weather would evolve the way 
it did we would have done it differently mott said 
without a crystal ball or higher connections that we dont 
have we cant know its not going to rain in july and august 
dabney said 
he said the current western fires are on a scale not seen for 
more than 200 years 
on capitol hill senators from wyoming and montana complained to 
interior secretary donald hodel that allowing some of the 
yellowstone fires to burn was a grave mistake they said mott 
should be fired because of the yellowstone destruction 
the national park service and the forest service made a very 
gross error in judgement naively and stupidly said max baucus 
dmont theres been too much hope and prayer and not enough 
action

after a day devoted to debate and explanations of the bills 
provisions the house postponed votes on amendments until thursday 
speaker jim wright dtexas has labeled the bill 
bipartisan a strategy that will allow incumbents of both 
parties to claim credit for the politically popular legislation 
during their reelection campaigns 
but the tactic also guarantees votes on republicaninspired 
amendments that would allow the federal death penalty for 
drugrelated killings deny federal benefits to convicted drug 
users and admit some illegally seized evidence in court 
the house took up the bill on congress first day back from a 
monthlong recess 
other issues that lawmakers must settle before they quit next 
month to campaign for reelection are spending levels for the star 
wars antimissile program arms control issues a major overhaul of 
the welfare system competing proposals on child care and aid to 
nicaraguas contra rebels 
democrats may push for votes on their legislation to increase 
the minimum wage from 335 per hour to 455 hourly over a 
threeyear period an increase opposed by president reagan 
it was just two years ago that congress passed its last 
comprehensive antidrug bill but lawmakers from both parties now 
agree it failed to stem the tide 
i hope it does wright said when asked whether this measure 
will have greater success i dont know what else to do if it 
doesnt 
he said more treatment facilities and education are needed and 
called local police illequipped and undermanned against drug 
lords 
the bill would increase spending for federal and state law 
enforcement agencies to intercept illegal drugs on land in the air 
and on the seas 
it would establish a sevenday waiting period for purchasing a 
handgun a provision that makes the legislation the latest 
lightning rod for the gun control debate 
banking laws would be changed to try to stop the laundering of 
drug money at legitimate financial institutions education programs 
would be expanded for youth including disadvantaged youngsters and 
the most hardened gang members 
the bill encourages latin american countries to form a regional 
antinarcotics force and pledges financial support if one is 
started 
federal contractors would be required to maintain a drugfree 
workplace tight controls would be placed on the usmade 
chemicals that are used to manufacture heroin cocaine and other 
drugs 
states would be given money to develop programs to stop the 
spread of aids by intravenous drug abusers 
as debate began the bills democratic floor manager rep 
charles b rangel of new york urged colleagues to meet the 
challenge of fighting illegal drugs 
while pledging not to discuss such issues as vice president 
george bushs role as reagans drug coordinator rangel accused the 
administration of asking for severe cuts in the programs 
congress approved as part of the 1986 antidrug bill 
he also told the house dont allow the emotionalism of 
amendments to distract from what we really have to do give 
assistance to those people on the front line 
nonetheless rep george gekas rpa urged lawmakers to 
support his amendment for what he called the ultimate weapon 
against drug traffickers the death penalty 
the proposal would permit capital punishment for anyone who 
intentionally kills a person while committing a federal drug felony 
rep william mccollum rfla will propose that the government 
deny student loans public housing licenses and other benefits for 
five years to those convicted of two or more drugrelated offenses 
within a 10year period and for 10 years to those convicted of 
drug distribution 
mccollum also will propose that a portion of federal highway 
money be withheld from states that do not require suspension or 
revocation of drivers licenses for those convicted of drugrelated 
offenses 
rep dan lungren rcalif will try to win admission of 
illegally seized evidence in federal cases if police made a search 
with the good faith belief they were acting constitutionally 
mccollum will attempt to strip from the bill a provision calling 
for a sevenday waiting period for the purchase of a handgun 
during which lawenforcement authorities could perform a background 
check 
employees and supporters of the national rifle association 
contacted lawmakers to oppose the provision while hundreds of 
uniformed police officers supporting the delay roamed through the 
capitol on wednesday seeking support 
meanwhile attorney general richard thornburgh told an executive 
working group on federalstatelocal prosecutorial relations that 
the antidrug bill has provisions that hold great potential 
but also has language that could hinder and obstruct law 
enforcement efforts 
he said the administration supports the death penalty but wants 
to strengthen sections on the admission of evidence and laundering 
of illgotten gains

a private engineering study of the bugriddled 
new us embassy in moscow finds that the structure cannot be 
salvaged and recommends it be dismantled and rebuilt says a house 
member involved in the issue 
this time the engineers told the state department only 
american labor and materials should be used there should be better 
security on the construction site and the building should be 
preconstructed in the united states as much as possible 
rep olympia snowe rmaine said the report by bdm corp 
supported the conclusion she had reached following a tour of the 
site more than a year ago soon after it was discovered that the 
building was suffused with a sophisticated soviet eavesdropping 
system 
one earlier study by former defense secretary james r 
schlesinger had concluded the eightstory building could be 
partially salvaged by removing and rebuilding the top three floors 
for use in unclassified embassy work and called for building a new 
annex for topsecret activities 
the administration should move quickly to begin tearing down 
the new building this fall so that they take advantage of the warm 
season snowe said in a statement she said some 38 million 
remains available in the construction account that could be used 
for the dismantling 
the structure should be taken apart carefully she said rather 
than demolished so that building components can be shipped back to 
the united states for further study by intelligence experts who 
still havent fully figured out the technology used in the soviet 
bugging system 
bdm which studied the embassy problems at the state 
departments request concluded that complete dismantling and 
reconstruction would cost 160 million and take 45 months to 
complete snowe said there is no way the new structure can be 
modified to make it secure she said 
abandoning the new project and trying to rehabilitate the 
current outmoded embassy building would cost 170 million and take 
80 months leaving the project susceptible to security problems for 
a longer time and increasing the likelihood of inflationary cost 
increases the firm concluded 
the reagan administration has not yet decided what to do about 
the embassy building which has already cost nearly 60 million in 
construction costs and studies

the united states has offered the philippines 
489 million in aid this year in an effort to extend american use 
of two major military bases for two years congressional sources 
said wednesday 
the offer includes a doubling of the yearly fee for using subic 
bay naval base and clark air base from 180 million to 360 million 
but the philippines government is asking for a more sizable 
increase to more than 1 billion in aid overall 
the negotiations on renewing the base agreement whose terms 
expire in 1991 are in suspension at least until foreign minister 
raul manglapus meets here next week with state department officials 
and key members of congress said the sources who spoke only on 
condition of anonymity 
this years military and economic aid to the philippines totals 
463 million the reagan administration is seeking congressional 
approval of 289 million for next year in addition to food aid 
which this year amounts to 62 million 
although negotiations over the us bases in the philippines and 
also in greece have broken down the state department on tuesday 
voiced confidence the talks would be resumed and settlements 
reached 
both allies benefit from the presence of us military forces on 
their territory spokesman charles e redman said he said the 
talks with the philippines would be reopened on a mutually 
convenient date and the negotiations with greece had been 
suspended temporarily 
redman said ambassador nicholas platt had returned to washington 
from manila for longplanned consultations and that further 
discussions probably would be held when manglapus chief negotiator 
for the philippines is here next week 
secretary of state george p shultz is scheduled to meet with 
manglapus on sept 30 during the special session of the un 
general assembly in new york 
the philippines a former us colony have had strong ties with 
washington since their partnership against japan in world war ii 
since corazon aquino took over as president in 1986 us military 
and economic aid has totaled 13 billion 
the subic bay and clark bases are among the most important us 
military bases overseas

the maker of the antiacne medicine accutane 
announced a federally sanctioned program wednesday aimed at 
preventing the drugs use during pregnancy a practice that studies 
show can cause birth defects 
the drug sold by hoffmannla roche inc since 1982 has been 
identified by the company as a factor in at least 70 cases of birth 
defects and us food and drug administration spokeswoman faye 
peterson said incidents of deformities caused by the drug are 
notoriously underreported 
donald d hollander president of the the nutleybased companys 
roche dermatologics division said the manufacturer will begin 
requiring physicians prescribing accutane to obtain a signature on 
a patient consent form advising of the drugs risks 
womens health groups and some professional associations have 
long sought such a procedure for accutane hollander said such 
consent forms are unprecedented for a drug already approved by the 
federal government 
in essense the message we wish to communicate is simple 
hollander said accutane should not be prescribed or taken if 
pregnancy cannot be excluded during therapy 
hollander said hoffmannla roche was taking another highly 
unusual initiative in offering to pay for women using accutane to 
receive an initial pregnancy test and birthcontrol evaluation it 
recommends 
the company also promised to distribute pregnancy information 
kits offer a pregnancy counseling referral service and make major 
changes in the way it packages the drug to include health warnings 
the offer to reimburse doctors for pregnancy testing and birth 
control exams is strictly a company initiative but the other 
moves announced at a new york news conference essentially amount to 
an adoption of guidelines written in april by an fda advisory 
committee said ms peterson 
we recommended these steps in order to curb overprescription 
of the drug which should really be used as a last resort for 
people with severe recalcitrant acne when other methods of control 
have failed ms peterson said 
at the april meeting the federal committee rejected calls to 
pull the drug off the market noting that it is the only effective 
treatment for a severe disfiguring form of acne 
she said the fda expected to complete evaluation of hoffmannla 
roches new packaging proposal within two months 
dr william cunningham company assistant vice president and 
director of medical affairs said the proposal calls for the drug 
to be packaged in 10tablet individually wrapped envelopes a 
change from the 100tablet bottles previously marketed 
cunningham said the packets which will be covered with warnings 
against use of the drug during pregnancy will help prevent overuse 
of the drug 
reaction to the companys announcement from medical and womens 
groups was enthusiastic 
cindy pearson program director of the national womens health 
network in washington said the use of patient consent forms would 
ensure that doctors and patients discuss the risks before the drug 
is taken 
william heineke spokesman for the american academy of 
dermatology said the group favors the use of all other alternative 
treatments for severe acne before resorting to accutane 
a female using accutane should employ effective methods of 
contraception should have a negative pregnancy test two weeks 
prior to using the drug at least once a month during use and a 
month after completion of treatment he said

five astronauts on wednesday 
inspected the space shuttle discovery which they hope to ride into 
orbit late this month and their commander reported it all looks 
clean it all looks good 
commander rick hauck and his crew drove to launch pad 39b for a 
session that also included an examination of the communications 
satellite in the spaceships cargo bay and a walkthrough of launch 
pad emergency escape procedures 
haucks crewmates are pilot dick covey and mission specialists 
george nelson mike lounge and dave hilmers 
they received launch preparation briefings and visited the pad 
as the shuttle launch team began a countdown for a simulated 
liftoff on thursday during which the astronauts will board 
discoverys cabin for the final two hours 
the mock liftoff scheduled for 10 am is the last major test 
before launch 
after tomorrow were all going to be ready to fly hauck 
told reporters after the pad exercises 
asked if he saw anything that would prevent a late september 
launch of the first space shuttle mission in 32 months he replied 
i havent seen anything 
the national aeronautics and space administration is aiming for 
a liftoff in the last week in september but officials wont set a 
firm date until sept 14 following a twoday flight readiness 
review here 
engineers were troubleshooting one technical problem that was 
not expected to affect the launch date 
three valves that control the flow of gaseous oxygen in 
discoverys main engines and help pressurize the fuel tank were 
removed for inspection after two of them performed sluggishly 
during a recent launch pad test firing of the shuttles main 
engines 
the parts were flown to the plant of their maker eaton corp of 
valencia calif where the two sluggish valves were found to be 
slightly contaminated with minute particles of chrome and stainless 
steel said nasa spokeswoman lisa malone they were cleaned and are 
being tested she said 
three matching valves were removed from sister ship atlantis 
and were found to be contaminationfree malone said engineers will 
examine all six and pick the three in the best condition for 
installation on discovery

the two sellers of chlordimeform a pesticide 
used on an eighth of the nations cotton crop have agreed to quit 
marketing the product and will recall leftovers from farmers after 
the current growing season the environmental protection agency 
said wednesday 
the agency said it would make the distribution or use of the 
chemical a suspected cancer agent illegal after feb 19 the 
product has been used to destroy the eggs and larvae of the tobacco 
budworm and the cotton bollworm 
pesticide recalls are rare and a spokesman for one of the 
companies cibageigy corp said in grensboro nc he could 
recall none that took products back from farmers 
recalls will begin in four or five weeks after use for the 
current growing season is over said the spokesman steve powell 
farmers will receive refunds for unused amounts and reimbursement 
for any shipping expenses 
its our hope that little will be left over he said 
the other licensed seller is noram chemical co of wilmington 
del powell said he did not know whether noram bought its product 
from cibageigy or manufactured its own at noram spokesmen who 
could discuss chlordimeform had gone for the day 
cibageigy has sold chlordimeform under the trade name galecron 
and noram sold it under the name fundal about a million pounds 
annually had been used in recent years 
in 1985 and 1986 epa said it intended to undertake a special 
study of chlordimeform because of evidence that it caused tumors in 
laboratory animals 
in february the companies proposed to stop sales and give back 
their licenses and this proposal now accepted by epa means that 
the special study will not be started 
use on food crops was stopped in the 1970s after cancer in lab 
animals began to appear and usage restrictions were tightened epa 
said it did not believe there was any significant dietary risk from 
chlordimeform but it intends to revoke the regulations permitting 
a small residue on treated food 
although there appear significant risks for applicators 
exposed over a lifetime the available data do not support an 
immediate emergency ban on use epa said 
one of the breakdown products of chlordimeform a chemical 
called 5cat appears to cause the tumors observed in lab animals 
said karem ahmed of the consulting firm of environ corp who 
studied chlordimeform while at the natural resources defense 
council 
the chemical 5cat is also used as a raw material in the 
dyestuffs industry in germany and one group of dye workers studied 
there showed higher than normal incidence of bladder cancer 
according to ahmed this chemical is no longer used in the united 
states and epa said it would treat it as a new chemical requiring 
an epa safety review if any company wants to reintroduce it 
some workers in the leather and other industries who use 
dimethylformamide a starting chemical for one method of mking 
chlordimeform have developed excessive testicular cancer 
epa said it was consulting the centers for disease control and 
the association of state and territorial health officers as well 
as the companies on whether and how workers should be notified of 
possible effects of exposure to chlordimeform and related chemicals 
powell said the company had told its own production workers 
about chlordimeforms effects but he did not know what might be 
required for notices to farm workers

a threejudge panel convicted three police 
officers on wednesday in the torture and forced disappearance of a 
robbery suspect and sentenced them to 29 years each in prison 
four other officers were acquitted of charges of torture and 
forgery of official documents 
salvador dominguez head of the audiencia territorial of the 
madrid court read the unanimous decision to a court packed with 
journalists after a fourmonth trial and an additional 39 days of 
deliberation 
the trial began in april and was viewed by political observers 
as an indictment of the failure of socialist prime minister felipe 
gonzalezs government to curb abuses by the national police many 
of the senior police officials entered service during the francisco franco 
the government issued no statement after the verdict 
dominguez said the court found the three officers guilty of 
illegal detention torture and forced disappearance of santiago 
corella and forgery of official documents 
the three arrested two years ago are francisco javier 
fernandez alvarez 45 former chief of the national polices 
antirobbery brigade in madrid inspector victoriano gutierrez 
lobo 42 and inspector francisco aguilar gonzalez 41 
the 29yearold corella had a record of previous arrests when he 
was picked up as a suspect in a jewelry store robbery on nov 12 
1983 
prosecutors said the three policemen tortured corella physically 
and mentally in a madrid police station to such an extent that they 
decided to dispose of him make him disappear 
they said the officers forged police registers to cover 
themselves 
the defendants said corella escaped the day of his arrest after 
they took him to a field outside madrid to question him about an 
arms cache 
corellas body was never found 
defense lawyer manuel tuero told reporters the defense will 
exhaust all appeals 
the court ordered each of the three convicted men or the state 
to pay 40600 to corellas wife and each of his two children 
witnesses testified that the officers set up jewelry store 
robberies from which they split the take 
the three also were indicted in at least two different cases of 
police corruption and await trial on those charges 
the officers remain in preventive custody in a special prison 
unit in the northern rioja region

the police commissioner testified at a 
coroners inquest wednesday that he asked the british army to help 
seize ira agents because of fears a car bomb might explode and 
police couldnt handle with the situation 
the three unarmed ira agents were shot and killed by british 
soldiers on march 6 raising strong criticism of the government of 
british prime minister margaret thatcher and spurring charges that 
the deaths were part of an unofficial shoottokill policy 
against the ira 
the thatcher government denied the charges observers from the 
human rights organization amnesty international and from ireland 
are attending the inquest 
hearings began tuesday in the deaths of mairead farrell 31 
daniel mccann 30 and sean savage 24 who the irish republican 
army said were ira members in active service when they were killed 
in the british fortress colony 
the inquest has no power of prosecution but the gibraltar 
attorney general is expected to return criminal indictments if it 
rules the killings unlawful 
gibraltar police commissioner joseph canepa told coroner felix 
pizzarello and his jury that he was informed march 4 that the three 
ira members had been sighted in malaga spain about 75 miles 
northeast of gibraltar 
police in gibraltar then set up observation posts at strategic 
locations on the rock near spains southernmost tip 
at 1230 pm on march 6 mccann and farrell were identified by 
police as the two entered gibraltar from spain on foot canepa said 
they went to the gibraltar assembly area where they met savage 
who earlier parked a white renault in the neighborhood 
canepa said arrests were almost made at that stage at 325 
pm the three moved north toward gibraltars border with spain 
i asked the soldier to examine the car renault and he 
reported that in his view the car contained a bomb canepa 
testified i felt the police couldnt cope with the situation and 
so i requested the military help 
the soldier canepa refered to was one of seven military people 
believed to have been from britains elite special air service unit 
it was then canepa said that he signed a form asking the 
military to intercept and apprehend the three suspects 
i formed the view that we should arrest on suspicion of 
conspiracy to murder canepa testified 
minutes later he received a report that the three ira activists 
had been shot dead as they walked toward the border canepa said 
canepa said it was later determined there was no bomb in the 
renault 
two days later however spanish police located a car rented by 
the three ira agents in a parking garage in marbella spain a city 
about halfway between gibraltar and malaga they said it contained 
140 pounds of explosives and a timing device 
another witness a senior british security officer identified 
only as o for security reasons told the court the intelligence 
service failed to foresee these developments before the shootings 
that the three ira members would cross into gibraltar from 
spain unarmed two days before a suspected bombing attempt 
that the three would first drive an empty car in from spain to 
block a space near the suspected bombing target 
and that they would use a timing device rather than remote 
control to detonate the bomb 
o testified while concealed from the public by a curtain 
around the witness stand 
belfast lawyer patrick mcgrory representing the families of 
those killed tried to show in crossexamining o that british 
intelligence did not have enough evidence to justify killing the 
three rather than simply arresting them

a bomb exploded wednesday at a 
shopping center entrance in an exclusive white suburb of 
johannesburg killing a black man and shattering windows 
the mans body was torn asunder outside the main entrance of the 
north park plaza in suburban northcliff 
no one else was hurt 
police did not identify the type of bomb or say whether the man 
was carrying it when it went off at 725 pm

places in south africa was increased recently after the public 
demanded more thorough searches of people and parcels 
on tuesday night governmentrun television broadcast a special 
program on bombs with a reporter displaying the most common types 
used in south africa and showing how he could hide two under his 
coat 
wednesdays bombing was the second in three weeks at a shopping 
center in an affluent white suburb and followed a declaration 
earlier this year by guerrilla leaders of the outlawed african 
national congress that they would take their fight to the white 
neighborhoods 
the government usually blames such bombings on the anc the 
group seldom comments on such incidents although it has said it is 
conducting a campaign of sabotage aimed at ending the apartheid 
system of racial separation and white dominance of the government 
and economy 
seventeen people have been killed and nearly 200 injured in 
nearly 40 bombings in south africa this year 
more than 100 explosions have caused 31 deaths and about 565 
injuries since the government declared a national state of 
emergency on june 12 1986 police were given wide powers to detain 
people without charge restrict the press prohibit certain 
statements and almost all forms of public protest 
office buildings occupied by antiapartheid organizations have 
also been bombed and grenades have been planted or thrown at the 
houses of government opponents 
the latest occurred aug 31 when an explosion shattered khotso 
house a building housing the south african council of churches and 
other prominent groups

mexico mopped up from two tropical storms 
wednesday as yet another depression formed in the gulf of mexico 
scattered fragmentary reports indicated that storms killed at 
least 39 people in less than a week and left tens of thousands 
homeless many communities are without electricity telephones or 
drinking water 
as relief work went on in such hardhit states as veracruz 
oaxaca chiapas and guerrero tropical storm florence churned in 
the southern gulf about 125 miles northnorthwest of merida on the 
yucatan peninsula 
florences 45 mph winds strengthened wednesday night as the 
storm swirled in a stationary position forecasters at the national 
hurricane center in miami said they could not predict what 
direction it would take 
its out in the open waters of the gulf right now 
forecaster noel risynchok said the only current threat would be 
to marine interests 
the storm was expected to remain in place through thursday he 
said 
florence is the sixth named storm of the 1988 atlantic hurricane 
season only one debby had winds exceeding 74 mph making it a 
hurricane 
debby hit veracruz state friday night while debby was drenching 
one side of mexico another tropical weather system kristy was 
soaking the pacific coast 
both spawned heavy rains that sent rivers over their banks 
downed power lines washed out roads and rail lines and forced 
evacuation of tens of thousands 
veracruz state officials said wednesday an undetermined number 
of people was still missing in flooded areas the also said major 
gulf ports and some roads were still closed 
officials in southern oaxaca state on the pacific reported five 
more deaths wednesday raising the state toll to at least 12 and 
the national toll to 39 
veracruz officials confirmed 16 dead and chiapas state officials 
confirmed five central hildalgo state reported four dead and two 
deaths were reported in guerrero on the pacific 
at least half the corn crop in northern veracruz was wiped out 
a month before harvest said state spokeswoman guadalupe lopez 
some of the worst damage was in the orchards citrus and 
bananas she said adding that flooding also damaged coffee and 
beans 
nationwide crop damage was minimal said pascacio taboada of 
the agriculture ministry most orchards will survive the flooding 
he predicted 
taboada estimated flood waters covered less than 150000 acres 
less than 1 percent of mexicos cultivated land 
he said heavy rains filled most reservoirs to 70 percent of 
capacity which could mean ample water to irrigate the fall and 
spring crops

a 17th suspect was arrested wednesday and 
israel radio said a general was suspected of involvement in the 
sale of exemptions from military service a scandal that has 
tainted the nearly sacrosanct army 
the latest suspect is a tel aviv eye nose and ear specialist 
who allegedly sold false medical certificates israel radio said 
the doctor gideon bialistock was a dutch citizen who has lived in 
israel on a tourist visa for 20 years 
some israelis have paid up to 10000 for exemptions from 
compulsory military service 
later wednesday authorities released a lieutenant colonel one 
of 16 suspects taken into custody monday israel television said 
it did not elaborate 
the scandal came to light monday when military and civilian 
police arrested 16 israelis including highranking officers and 
doctors after a sixmonth undercover investigation 
foreign minister shimon peres praised the armys response i 
appreciate the fact that the army reacted immediately publicly 
and didnt cover up anything he said on israel radio peres is a 
former defense minister 
army officials said they would review the procedures for 
granting exemptions 
the scandal has angered israelis who consider the army a sacred 
institution and inspired scathing editorials in many newspapers 
the uncovering of an entire network whose beneficiaries 
may have run into the hundreds poses a new problem for the army 
the jerusalem post said it cautioned against crying havoc but 
recommended greater vigilance in the future 
members of the ring allegedly arranged exemptions from draft or 
reserve duty for hundreds of people by providing false medical 
certificates or tampering with army computers 
two army majors are the key suspects israel radio said 
wednesday one who had access to army computers and another who 
headed the manpower divisions medical committee 
it said a brigadier general was suspected of involvement in the 
scheme but had not yet been arrested 
army officials said further arrests were expected 
this is just the tip of the iceberg said col renaan 
gissin a deputy army spokesman the last word has not been 
said 
he described the number of people involved as unprecedented 
jewish men and women are drafted at age 18 in israel whose 
population is 41 million men serve for three years followed by 
62 days of reserve duty each year until age 55 women serve two 
years with no obligatory reserve duty 
avoiding service is a social taboo and many employers ask 
applicants to prove they did army service 
israel has virtually no conscientious objectors and fewer than 
300 people have refused to serve in controversial operations in 
lebanon or the occupied west bank and gaza strip during the last 
decade

michael dukakis told a major jewish 
organization wednesday that george bush supported arms sales to 
arab nations and the democratic presidential nominee promised he 
would say no to arab shopping lists that endanger the security 
of israel 
lloyd bentsen and i will never play politics with israels 
security the democratic presidential nominee said referring to 
his running mate 
dukakis spoke to the annual international convention of bnai 
brith an organization that works for jewish causes 
dukakis pledged support for israel and said republican vice 
presidential nominee dan quayle has voted repeatedly against 
foreign assistance to israel 
dukakis promised he would never recognize a unilateral 
declaration of a palestinian state or government in exile 
we will not sell weapons that would threaten the security of 
israel to any nation he said 
the republicans have sold awacs planes to saudi arabia 
mavericks missiles to kuwait stingers missiles to bahrain and 
billions of additional dollars worth of sophisticated arms to arab 
countries that refuse to make peace with israel dukakis said 
george bush has supported those sales and dan quayle has 
voted for them lloyd bentsen and i are going to say no to arab 
shopping lists that endanger the security of israel he said 
dukakis also referred to president reagans trip to a german 
graveyard where nazi ss troops were buried there will be no 
trips to bitburg dukakis said 
earlier in new jersey dukakis said bush stood silent while the 
reagan administration tried to slam the door of college 
opportunity for young people the democratic nominee proposed his 
own broad loan program aimed at middleclass students 
where was george dukakis said renewing the democrats cry 
at the national convention in atlanta in july george was right 
there all the time not doing and not saying a thing he said 
dukakis in a speech at kean college in union nj outlined 
his proposal for a college loan program aimed at making a higher 
education more affordable for the children of middleincome 
families 
the program would provide federal guarantees to back bank loans 
to college students in return for the students agreement to repay 
the loan with payment withheld automatically from their future 
earnings 
as described by his advisers students would agree to repayment 
plans based on a percentage of their earnings with payments 
extending for the rest of their working lives the percentage of 
income withheld would depend on how much money was borrowed said 
larry summers a harvard economist and adviser to dukakis 
aides said the program would add no net cost to the federal 
government 
bush has proposed allowing parents to earn interest taxfree on 
us savings bonds to help pay for college but he has not 
suggested any overhaul of the loan program 
but the reagan administration has already launched a small 
experimental incomecontingent loan program with repayments pegged 
to students income in later life congress balked last year at a 
major expansion of the program now being tried at 10 campuses 
loye miller a spokesman for secretary of education william 
bennett said the dukakis proposal sounds like theyre stealing 
our idea 
later bennett issued a statement saying somebody already laid 
this egg we have not seen all the details but the dukakis 
proposal looks suspiciously like the old yale university plan that 
proved unworkable a decade ago 
the plan according to miller failed because students who 
anticipated high incomes did not want to end up subsidizing the 
loans of their lowerincome colleagues 
dukakis said the opportunity to attend college is fading in the 
face of higher tuitions and stagnating wages he said college 
tuitions have incresed 60 percent under the reagan administration 
the massachusetts governor said scholarship assistance had 
quadrupled in his state under his leadership but that the reagan 
administration has cut college loans grants and workstudy 
programs 
and where was george bush while his administration was doing 
its best to slam the door of college opportunity in the face of 
millions of young people across the country dukakis said 
where was he while his administration was denying middle income 
families the hope for a future of prosperity and success for their 
children

a former state administrator pleaded 
guilty wednesday to a misdemeanor charge and avoided going on trial 
for bribery in connection with a 2yearold scandal over a failed 
potato sale to honduras 
laurence mcmerty the state agriculture departments former 
marketing director pleaded guilty to unlawful compensation for 
assistance in a government matter a charge punishable by up to one 
year in jail and a 1000 fine 
mcmerty 43 was accused of accepting a caribbean cruise and up 
to 4000 in cash from a miami agent william messner who acted as 
a middleman in the potato deal 
prosecutors dropped felony bribery charges in exchange for the 
guilty plea in which mcmerty admitted accepting 3200 in cash 
which he claims was reimbursement for expenses 
jury selection had started in state district court wednesday 
morning for mcmertys trial on the bribery charges if convicted 
he faced up to 10 years in prison 
i am confident and comfortable justice has been served 
deputy attorney general bruce quick said after mcmerty entered the 
plea wednesday 
messner pleaded guilty july 8 to bribery as part of a plea 
agreement that requires him to pay 60888 in restitution to the 
state messner who also was placed on probation was in jail for 
six months prior to the plea 
mcmerty claimed wednesdays guilty plea exonerated him of any 
serious wrongdoing in connection with the potato scandal which 
already had tarnished the career of state agriculture commissioner 
kent jones 
there is no implication of bribery there is no implication i 
did anything to harm the state in any way mcmerty said in a 
telephone interview from his home 
mcmerty acknowledged wednesday that he received 3200 from 
messners company petrolear holdings ltd but he said he believed 
he was entitled to the money as reimbursement for expenses he 
incurred in 1985 while trying to set up the potato sale 
mcmerty claimed that costs were built into the eventual potato 
sale so he could be reimbursed for the 1985 trip to central 
america mcmerty has maintained that he reimbursed messner for the 
cruise which was not involved in the misdemeanor charge to which 
he pleaded guilty wednesday 
the state offered mcmerty basically the same plea agreement last 
november quick said 
no date for mcmertys sentencing was set 
the potato sale soured in august 1986 after the financial 
arrangements came to the attention of attorney general nicholas 
spaeth 
messner secured from the state 185 million in notes that 
spaeth says were issued without authority by jones and former bank 
of north dakota president herbert thorndal messner returned a 
155 million note after spaeth disclosed the deal but he had 
already discounted and sold a 300000 note 
the state is still owed 104000 for 400000 pounds of seed 
potatoes that were shipped to honduras before the deal fell through

a study of business graduates has found no 
evidence of widespread discrimination against jews in the executive 
suite and says their pay actually increased faster than that of 
christians 
the study released wednesday by the american jewish committee 
tracked the careers of 444 men and women who received master of 
business administration degrees in 1974 or 1979 from harvard 
university columbia university or drexel university 
the study found 
five to 10 years after starting out as junior executives 83 
percent of the jews held administrative positions compared with 69 
percent of protestants and 53 percent of catholics 
jews had average salaries of about 111000 compared with 
83000 for protestants and 82000 for catholics partly because 
jews tended more often to go into commerce rather than 
manufacturing and service where salaries tend to be lower between 
the time of their graduation and the time of the survey jews had 
average annual raises roughly double those of christians the 
survey said 
nearly twothirds of the jewish mbas identified christians as 
their corporate mentors 
the study found that half the jewish mbas could not read hebrew 
letters and ritual observance on the average did not extend 
much beyond attendance at a passover seder and lighting candles 
on hanukkah at the same time a majority participated in christmas 
observances with a notinsignificant number having christmas trees 
in their homes 
the coordinator of the project murray friedman director of the 
committees middle atlantic states region and acting chairman of 
the us civil rights commission said however that that despite 
jewish gains in recent years discrimination has not disappeared 
nor are all businesses and economic sectors fully open to jews 
friedman said in philadelphia for example some business areas 
employ jews at the higher levels mainly in specialized areas like 
public relations and law 
sudden shifts in the american economy or the political climate 
could reverse the gains that have been made he added

israeli troops blockaded 
qalqilya for a second day wednesday turning the town zoo into an 
army base and helicopters circled overhead searching olive groves 
for palestinian stonethrowers 
also wednesday three palestinians including two 16yearolds 
were wounded in stonethrowing confrontations with troops near the 
west bank town of nablus about 12 miles east of qalqilya hospital 
officials said 
except for dozens of soldiers patrolling the streets qalqilya 
was a virtual ghost town one day after the army swept in and 
arrested more than 150 arabs as part of a new tactic to quell the 
9monthold palestinian rebellion 
by wednesday night more than 200 qalqilya residents were in 
custody israel radio said it said without elaborating that the 
detainees included members of several gangs that had hurled 
firebombs at israeli cars 
we have no illusions this measure will stop rock throwing and 
firebombing col ranaan gissin told reporters during an escorted 
tour of qalqilya this measure is to send a deterrent message 
to the people 
gissin the armys deputy spokesman said the town where troops 
have cut telephone lines and blocked all entrances would remain 
under curfew for at least several more days 
the town and surrounding areas also under curfew are home to 
about 35000 palestinians 
on wednesday israeli settlers who live in the area were 
permitted to drive through qalqilyas deserted streets to their 
homes 
during a twohour tour of qalqilya reporters saw two 
palestinians handcuffed and blindfolded being transported by jeep 
to interrogation in makeshift army bases set up at a local high 
school and the town zoo 
dozens of troops some wearing shielded helmets and others 
carrying clubs and automatic weapons patrolled the narrow streets 
on foot and in jeeps 
several arabs complained that during housetohouse searches for 
suspected rioters the army broke into homes and damaged property 
one palestinian man pointed to a broken lock and smashed windows in 
his home 
some residents watched troops from their windows and rooftops a 
small child was seen flying a kite from a rooftop and remnants of 
other kites hung from electrical wires 
an elderly arab man emerged on another rooftop where he yelled 
at troops claiming they were calling arabs profane names 
is this what you learned in the army you should be ashamed of 
yourself the man who was surrounded by several children 
shouted in hebrew 
on the street below one soldier was heard saying to another 
well deal with this guy later 
many of the palestinians arrested belonged to the outlawed plo 
youth group shabiba the army said it said they were suspected of 
throwing stones and firebombs at israeli cars or participating in 
riots 
the chopper overhead is to locate palestinian squads who have 
escaped into the orchards gissin said when we see them we 
pick them up 
besides uncovering caches of knives and axes troops also found 
a workshop for making nailstudded iron pieces called ninjas 
for puncturing the tires of passing cars 
gissin said qalqilya 15 miles from tel avivs northern 
suburbs became a particular problem because hundreds of vehicles 
from nearby jewish settlements and israeli cities pass through the 
town everyday 
qalqilya is one of the largest west bank towns near tel aviv 
one soldier accompanying the tour pointed to a hilltop in the town 
from where he said jordanian troops fired the only shell to hit tel 
aviv during the 1967 middle east war 
also wednesday police said a 25yearold west bank palestinian 
confessed to last months killing of an 18yearold israeli woman 
ziva goldovsky 
the suspect a friend of the victim said he killed her for 
nationalist motives after ms goldovsky refused to give him a 
pistol police investigator uri weisskoop told israel radio 
she was the fifth israeli to die in the palestinian uprising 
which has claimed the lives of at least 259 palestinians 
troops lifted a 13day curfew from the west bank village of bani 
naim near bethlehem during the closure arab residents said 
troops confiscated about 150 cars in an effort to force 
palestinians to pay their taxes 
underground leaflets have called on arabs to refrain from paying 
taxes to the israeli military government

the commander of a soviet space capsule stranded 
in space for a day may have worsened equipment problems by not 
taking manual control the government newspaper suggested wednesday 
after the soyuz tm5 landed safely 
the government daily izvestia said reporters questioned deputy 
flight chief viktor blagov of the soviet space program on whether 
the commander vladimir lyakhov made mistakes tuesday during 
attempts to fire braking rockets aboard his soyuz tm5 capsule 
the tiny capsule parachuted to a landing at 450 am wednesday 
moscow time 100 miles southeast of dzhezkazgan in the kazakhstan 
republic of soviet central asia 
despite a problem with the guidance system the spacecraft 
landed within only a few dozen miles of the intended target and 
only 24 hours late izvestia reported 
an american expert on soviet space flight said the two 
cosmonauts might have burned to death if the unexpected shutdown of 
their rocket engine had come only a minute later 
they were seconds away from death james oberg a space 
engineer and author of several books on the soviet space program 
said from johnson space center in houston the cutoff of that 
burn rocket firing was lucky for them 
another us space expert nicholas johnson said he believes 
the situation was much less serious than problems encountered in 
earlier soviet flights 
johnson said it is too early to make assumptions that the 
cosmonauts were near mortal danger and suggested that oberg was 
drawing conclusions with inadequate data johnson works for 
teledyne brown engineering in colorado springs colo a major 
space contractor 
television showed the spherical soyuz capsule floating toward 
the ground on a white parachute with orange stripes againt a 
reddish dawn sky a puff of dust rose from the ground when the 
capsule landed 
abdul ahad mohmand the first afghan in space and soviet 
crewmate lyakhov spent 26 hours aboard the cramped capsule that had 
enough air for only two days dwindling food supplies and no toilet 
of course it was not an easy thing to sit in spacesuits for 24 
hours lyakhov 47 said in an interview near the charred capsule 
the problems began after the capsule undocked early tuesday from 
mir the space station where lyakhov and mohmand spent six days 
with three other cosmonauts 
after boarding their capsule and undocking the cosmonauts made 
two attempts to reenter the atmosphere on tuesday 
izvestia quoted blagov as giving a philosophical answer to 
reporters asking whether technical problems or mistakes by mission 
control or the capsule crew were to blame for the landing delay 
life is guilty a coincidence of circumstances blagov said 
izvestia said tuesdays first landing attempt was aborted when 
an infrared sensor used in guiding the spacecraft malfunctioned 
the sensor locked onto the wrong tracking reference point and 
belatedly started an engine that slows the craft for reentry the 
cosmonauts manually overrode the system and shut down the engine 
the newspaper said 
a second attempt was made three hours later the sensor put the 
craft in the correct position but an onboard computer then used 
an old trajectory program and an engine burn was incomplete the 
old program had been in the computer since the soyuz tm5s last 
flight with a sovietbulgarian crew in june according to izvestia 
the newspaper then listed a question and comment it said 
reporters put to blagov 
why with this did the commander instead of turning off the 
computer and completely transferring to a manual control regime 
again give a command to the machine which could not be corrected 
for the continued working of the engine 
and only when the engine was shut off by an indication of a 
loss of ship stabilization did he do what he should have done from 
the very beginning stop the dynamic operation and wait for 
communication with the control center to report about the 
situation 
izvestia did not say whether blagov responded specifically to 
these comments but quoted him as saying we still must 
painstakingly study the whole situation 
the public questioning of a cosmonauts performance was highly 
unusual in the soviet space program it reflected the more open 
discussion of problems encouraged by soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev under his policy of glasnost 
other soviet space officials steered away from mentioning 
possible human error in the mission 
asked in an interview on staterun television to evaluate the 
crews performance blagovs boss veteran cosmonaut valery ryumin 
responded we consider that the crew worked well 
lyakhov said he and mohmand had wanted to make a third attempt 
at landing on tuesday but refrained from making it because the 
craft might have touched down outside soviet territory he said 
they preferred to wait until landing could be assured in kazakhstan 
after a sleepless night for the cosmonauts and scientists at 
mission control who corrected the problems the capsule attempted a 
third and this time successful reentry on wednesday 
we are expecting the opening of the parachute lyakhov a 
veteran military pilot told mission control during reentry 
we wish you a successful landing a ground controller said 
its as if were now racing along a cobblestone road 
lyakhov added 
then he reported there is the opening of the main 
parachute 
after speaking to reporters at the landing site the cosmonauts 
were flown to the nearby baikonur space center where doctors 
pronounced them in good health and spirits radio moscow said 
izvestia said the mission could be ranked as one of the most 
dramatic in the history of cosmonautics 
speaking to reporters after landing lyakhov a veteran of two 
long space flights did not admit to any mistakes 
there was no danger on the ship we kept the situation under 
control he said

teacher strikes in six states disrupted classes for 110000 
students wednesday but schools in louisiana and michigan reopened 
when teachers reached agreement on contracts 
many of the teachers on strike in 26 public school districts in 
michigan pennsylvania massachusetts new jersey illinois and 
ohio were holding out for raises 
we are doing this because we are the lowest paid teachers in 
the whole area and we have been for many years said lowell 
mass teacher coe kevghas as he picketed in front of the rogers 
school wednesday we dont want to strike but we are forced to 
strike veteran teachers earn less than rookie police and firemen 
why 
a settlement was signed tuesday night in southwest louisianas 
vermilion parish after officials agreed to collective bargaining 
with the vermilion association of educators representing 600 
teachers cafeteria workers and school bus drivers the teachers 
had been on strike for three weeks 
were very happy were going back to school and i think well 
have a better educational system association president betty 
girouard said 
in michigan teachers in fenton ended their oneday strike 
pending ratification of a threeyear contract terms were 
unavailable teachers returned to classrooms in the 2800student 
district 
elsewhere in the state walkouts continued in at least nine 
public school districts 
strikes continued wednesday in garden city napolean michigan 
center holland manistee baraga stockbridge pontiac and west 
ottawa school districts 
more than 1400 professors and academic staff members at wayne 
state university in detroit went on strike tuesday over union work 
rules and salary 
about 950 clerical workers and secretaries represented by the 
united auto workers have been on strike there since aug 25 
in peabody mass school officials canceled friday classes the 
citys 408 teachers on tuesday rejected a 17 percent wage increase 
over three years holding out for 42 percent 
to sit at the table locked in at 42 percent is totally 
irresponsible said mayor peter torigian 
bert latessa of the massachusetts federation of teachers 
defended the unions position the 42 percent wage request latessa 
said is smaller than it appears because the teachers maintain they 
have been performing extra duties such as handling oversized 
classes without extra pay 
elsewhere in the state lowells 970 teachers voted unanimously 
tuesday to stay off the job because of dissatisfaction with a 
proposed salary package the first day of school wednesday was 
canceled for the citys 13100 students 
teachers are seeking higher pay and longevity bonuses 
teacher strikes are illegal in massachusetts and the state 
labor relations commission on wednesday declared peabodys strike 
illegal and ordered teachers back to work the move was a 
relatively routine step designed to set the contract negotiation 
process in motion 
around massachusetts teachers in 35 communities were still

sailing became the no 1 spectator sport in san 
diego on wednesday as the americas cup got under way and 
enthusiasts tried to grab the best viewing spots on land and sea 
sailors aboard aircraft carriers and waterfront restaurant 
patrons peered through binoculars as the american catamaran stars 
stripes and the massive yacht new zealand moved through san diego 
bay toward the race starting line 
the heavily favored us boat skippered by dennis conner took 
an early lead in the first race of the bestofthree series stars 
amp stripes went on to defeat new zealand by a margin of 18 minutes 
15 seconds covering the 40mile course in 4 hours 5354 seconds 
the next two races are scheduled for friday and if needed 
sunday 
conner was the skipper of the yacht that won the americas cup 
back from australia last year after losing it to the aussies in 
1983 
a crowd gathered on a grassy embankment at embarcadero marina 
park site of the americas cup tourist village to watch the race 
proceedings live on a stadiumsized video screen positioned on a 
barge just offshore 
its going to be fun once we get our kiwi beer said chris 
hammonds 26 of cambridge new zealand who is on the first leg of 
a threeyear roundtheworld trip 
im not a big sailing fan but a proud kiwi new zealander 
and we want to make our presence felt he said 
americas cup village organizers had said that the compound 
would accomodate up to 70000 people but police estimates 
indicated only about 3000 turned out for the start of the first 
race said officer ken winklepleck 
i think thered have been a larger crowd here if it was a 
multinational race with everyone sailing similar boats said mike 
malcom 28 of atlanta but its still very exciting 
overcast skies cleared to brilliant blue as stars amp stripes and 
the new zealand began the race at noon wednesday after months of 
legal skirmishes and harsh words between the competitors 
through court action new zealand had forced san diego into an 
early defense of the cup upsetting san diego yacht club plans for 
a multinational event in 1991 san diego responded by choosing to 
sail a catamaran a first in the cups 137yearold history 
highspirited race buffs on spectator boats ranging from tugs to 
large yachts cheered and waved at landlubbers as they headed out to 
a marked viewing area several miles offshore 
one boat speeding out of the bay created swells that sent 
another craft which was to carry reporters along the race course 
crashing against a cement dock the media boat was damaged but no 
one was injured 
get that boats name a man shouted as the craft sped on 
banners balloons and flags flew from the spectator boats but 
the best decoration was provided by nature a school of dolphins 
leapt skyward as they passed by the american catamaran a few hours 
before race start 
at the americas cup village souvenir vendors were busy selling 
tshirts pins and other memorabilia video monitors stationed 
throughout provided race information and features on the two 
competitors 
i almost cried when i saw our boat new zealand sail out to 
the starting point said carol macleod 25 of auckland it was 
so big and graceful it looked good in the water 
fans of the stars amp stripes cheered loudly as conner and his 
crew waved from their 60foot catamaran as they made their way to 
the starting point four miles off point loma 
this is a great birthday present said mike cordell of san 
diego who turned 33 on wednesday an americas cup fan since 1974 
cordell said the race would be exciting despite the politics 
surrounding it 
but one disgruntled new zealander said the contest between the 
catamaran and yacht considered lopsided by sailing experts because 
of the cats speed advantage reflected poorly on the americans 
the stars amp stripes are making the kiwis look stupid in front 
of the americans but theyre making themselves look like fools in 
front of the rest of the world said tracy barclay 23 of 
cambridge new zealand

a senior plo official said wednesday the 
groups executive panel will meet this week prior to a conference 
whose main topic is creation of a provisional government for an 
indepandent palestinian state 
yasser abedrabbo a member of the palestine liberation 
organizations executive committee said the meeting saturday in 
tunis will consider proposals to be placed before an emergency 
session of the palestine national council the palestinians 
parliamentinexile 
a planned midseptember meeting by the council was postponed 
while plo leaders sought international recognition for a 
provisional palestinian government sources say the council 
probably will meet next month in algiers 
support for the plo to proclaim a provisional government has 
increased since palestinians in the israelheld west bank and gaza 
strip began their uprising dec 8 more than 280 palestinians and 
five israelis have died 
the continuing protests against israeli rule have bolstered the 
plos flagging fortunes with many figures within the plo urging 
declaration of an independent state in the occupied territories 
jordans king hussein decided july 31 to sever ammans legal and 
administrative links with the west bank adding to the pressure on 
the plo by challenging it to assume responsibility for the occupied 
region and live up to its claim to be the palestinians sole 
representative 
a top arafat lieutenant salah khalaf was quoted by kuwaits 
alanbaa daily wednesday as calling on the plo to take the 
historic realistic political decision of declaring an 
independent state soon 
we have no option but to take a key step that responds to the 
dictates of the palestinian uprising and its continuation jordans 
legal and administrative disassociation with the west bank and the 
international detente which envisages solutions to regional 
problems he said 
israeli officials have refused to deal with the plo calling it 
a terrorist organization prime minister yitzhak shamir has also 
vowed to wreck plo plans for a provisional government or a 
palestinian state 
the united states also refuses to deal with the plo until it 
accepts un security council resolution 242 which implies 
recognition for israels right to exist 
abedrabbo said he expected the national council to issue a 
policy declaration which would be based on international 
legality beginning with un security council resolution 181 and 
ending with 242 
resolution 181 established the state of israel but also called 
for a palestinian state 
israel has already annexed part of the arab land captured from 
jordan and egypt in 1967 where the plo hopes to create its state 
israeli critics have also complained that the 1948 partition 
resolution calls for giving up part of pre1967 israel as well

prime minister yitzhak shamir suggested 
wednesday that washington is meddling in israeli affairs by 
inviting foreign minister shimon peres his political rival to a 
mideast peace summit one month before israels election 
israeli foreign ministry officials confirmed that president 
reagan will act as host at a meeting between peres and foreign 
minister esmat abdel meguid of egypt to discuss the peace process 
us and diplomatic sources in washington said the meeting will 
take place sept 26 in new york israels general election will be 
held nov 1 and voters in the united states go to the polls on 
nov 8 
both shamirs rightwing likud bloc and peres leftofcenter 
labor party have billed the voting as a historic referendum on how 
to solve the arabisraeli conflict and deal with the 9monthold 
palestinian uprising in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
labor backs the us middle east peace plan which calls for the 
return of land for peace and negotiations in the framework of an 
international peace conference likud opposes key elements of the 
us plan ruling out the return of occupied lands and favoring 
direct talks on limited palestinian autonomy 
reacting to the news of reagans move shamir said at this 
hour i still dont have all the details on the meeting i will 
just say one thing we must not forget that we are on the eve of 
elections 
senior likud officials went further in their criticism 
this is a bad joke said uri oren political adviser to 
deputy prime minister david levy of likud it is astonishing 
evidence of improper policy both external and internal 
everybody understands that such a meeting cannot advance any 
political process several weeks before the election he told the 
associated press 
likud officials also accused peres of acting behind shamirs 
back by not informing the prime minister of the invitation which 
was conveyed to senior israeli officials in washington on tuesday 
but peres said he only found out about the proposed meeting from 
journalists on wednesday im surprised by this i didnt know 
about it he told israel radio in an interview 
peres welcomed the new us initiative and rejected charges that 
it was aimed at boosting labor which is slightly trailing likud 
and its potential coalition partners in the latest polls 
i dont see a reason that just because we are on the eve of 
elections we have to stop working for the advancement of the peace 
process peres said 
peres is scheduled to leave for new york on sept 22 to attend 
the annual session of the un general assembly during the visit 
he said he would meet with foreign ministers of nations playing a 
role in the middle east conflict 
secretary of state george shultz sought support for the us 
peace plan during four shuttles to the region this year but failed 
to win backing from most regional leaders egypt was the only arab 
state to endorse the plan

the city of yonkers which faces 1 
millionaday fines starting friday will begin laying off hundreds 
of employees as part of a doomsday plan to delay bankruptcy 
state officials said wednesday 
the fines stem from the city councils refusal to approve a 
housing desegregation plan ordered by a federal judge 
under the spendingreduction plan approved by the state 
emergency financial control board the city parks department and 
public library will shut down saturday the planning department 
will virtually close with just two employees staying on and 37 
million in employee fringe benefits will be cut 
a total of 20 million will be saved under this phase of the 
plan said secretary of state gail s shaffer the chairman of the 
control board the layoffs of 447 employees saturday also will come 
from the departments of real estate civil service fiscal services 
and public works 
other belttightening measures will kick in over the next few 
months if needed allowing the city to continue to operate until at 
least next year shaffer said 
the thrust of this plan is to preserve the most important 
services as long as possible shaffer said were making some 
fairly painful choices but the accelerated cuts will stretch out 
police fire and public safety services 
the control board ruling infuriated city councilman edward 
fagan one of four council members who have blocked approval of the 
desegregation plan 
it eliminates people we would need theres no concern in 
terms of employees rights fagan said after storming out of the 
meeting 
us district judge leonard sand ruled in 1985 the city had 
segregated housing and education for 40 years the citys schools 
were desegregated under a plan approved by sand and the city 
council agreed in january to develop 1000 units of low and 
moderateincome housing designed to promote integration 
but fagan and councilmen peter chema henry spallone and 
nicholas longo voted aug 1 to block the second portion of the 
plan in response sand levied escalating fines against the city 
100 for the first day and doubling every day after that 
sand also imposed personal fines against the four councilmen and 
threatened them with jail 
the penalties were stayed pending appeal last week the us 
supreme court reinstated the fines against the city with a cap of 
1 million a day the court upheld the stay of the councilmens 
punishment 
city officials have said the fines would bankrupt the city by 
thanksgiving gov mario cuomo said wednesday that as long as the 
us supreme court was considering the case he would not begin 
proceedings to remove the four councilmen 
spallone appearing wednesday on the syndicated donahue tv 
show suggested the city might refuse to pay its fines 
im going to have to vote on the transfer of funds to pay the 
fines and im saying this publicly im not voting for it 
spallone said ill never surrender the vote of the people 
the city council was scheduled to meet thursday to vote again on 
sands order

angolansouth african peace talks 
resumed wednesday with south africa stopping just short of accusing 
angola of violating a monthold ceasefire at issue are claims 
cuba sent 10000 more soldiers to angola bringing its force to 
60000 
south african president pw botha speaking in south africa 
said if the recent reports of a further largescale buildup of 
cuban troops and armaments in angola are correct we will have to 
make sure of that then it is a breach of the principles agreed to 
in new york and of the provisions of the geneva protocol 
angola has denied the cuban force has been augmented officials 
of the cuban delegation which joined in the usmediated talks 
also denied the report 
the cubans help angola in its fight against antimarxist 
guerrillas and also in blocking south african military incursions 
us sources in washington first made the claim of cuban 
reinforcements but the state department subsequently said it 
continued to estimate there were 50000 cubans in angola 
guerrilla leader jonas savimbi took up the claim in a news 
conference last week and said us diplomats tried to persuade him 
to accept an agreement that would allow the cubans three years to 
withdraw their forces 
savimbis union for the total independence of angola or unita 
which receives support from south africa and the united states has 
been fighting the marxist government since portugal granted angola 
independence in 1975 
the cuban withdrawal issue remains the main stumbling block 
negotiations were adjourned last week to give the four parties a 
chance to review their positions 
south africa which says it has withdrawn its forces from 
angola has insisted the cubans be withdrawn within one year it 
has said it will grant independence to southwest africa or 
namibia if the cubans withdraw angola initially said it would 
take four years for the cuban withdrawal though it apparently has 
offered to send them home in three years 
in a related development savimbi said he would be prepared to 
work under angolan president eduardo dos santos provided 
democratic elections are held following any peace agreement news 
reports in lisbon portugal said wednesday 
savimbi said in an interview in the stateowned daily diario de 
noticias i am prepared to work under orders of eduardo dos 
santos i would accept a position of second third fourth 
place it doesnt matter to me 
the rebel leader added though i set one condition that 
elections will be realized within a period agreed on by unita 
mpla fnla and other patriotic forces 
the mpla is dos santos popular movement for the liberation of 
angola the fnla or national front for the liberation of angola 
saw its support smashed after a defeat by mpla troops in 1976

threefourths of bangladesh was under 
water wednesday and some aid donors say it is time for longterm 
solutions in an impoverished land that becomes a vast flood plain 
every monsoon season 
we have started thinking about the focus of our development 
aid a diplomat from one industrial nation said privately it 
doesnt really make sense to pour millions into this country every 
year and see it washed away 
floods began in june with the annual monsoon season they have 
claimed 416 lives by the governments count which is considered 
low and 1267 on the basis of unofficial tabulations by dhaka 
newspapers 
the government said wednesday night all major rivers remained 
above flood stage but that water levels fell during the previous 24 
hours in all rivers except two small tributaries near the bay of 
bengal 
but people still were marooned on rooftops and scarce patches of 
high ground and as many as onequarter of the nations 110 million 
citizens were homeless 
wells and pumps have been submerged and people have begun 
drinking flood water causing a rise in diarrhea cases and fear of 
epidemics 
on wednesday night the health service reported 16813 new cases 
of diarrhea in the previous 24 hours bringing known cases in the 
past two weeks to 119882 eightythree of those people have died 
and are included in the official death count 
statistics come only from areas that can communicate with dhaka 
however so the figures probably are low 
officials say total damage and reconstration needs cannot be 
assessed until the waters recede but president hussain mohammed 
ershad said tuesday the cost of rebuilding roads and railways alone 
would be 156 million 
bangladeshi officials donor nations and international 
organizations all say the most pressing need is a regional plan to 
stop flood waters that originate outside bangladesh 
water rushes down from the himalayas each monsoon season in 
rivers that empty into the bay of bangal through the bangladesh 
delta 
ershad and other top bangladeshi officials emphasize the need to 
work with neighboring india and nearby nepal and bhutan for a 
solution but a senior un official said he has pushed regional 
planning in vain for nearly a decade 
until longterm steps are taken major aid donors say they have 
no choice but to help feed the people of bangladesh who are among 
the worlds poorest and provide medical assistance 
the united states for example is giving bangladesh 1315 
million in aid this year including 73 million for food the rest 
is for development assistance but generally goes for such things 
as health family planning and agricultural research 
washington has pledged 36 million of flood relief but most 
already was in the pipeline as part of the annual aid package 
american flood relief consists of speeding up delivery of 25 
million worth of wheat already in bangladesh for distribution this 
year plus 11 million consisting of seed and constributions to 
relief funds 
the international red cross appealed for 6 million for the 
flood victims american red cross president richard f schubert jr 
said the funds would be used over the next two months to feed up to 
1 million people clothe up to 100000 and provide medical relief 
and housing for the neediest of families 
world vision an international christian relief and development 
agency based in monrovia calif appealed for 500000 for flood 
relief aid for bangladesh 
several bangladeshi officials handling relief said wednesday 
they could not compute the total amount offered from abroad so far 
a senior un official whose office helps coordinates foreign 
aid also was unable to provide a total he said part of the 
problem was that much of the aid comes from funds that already had 
been allocated for bangladesh but now is being applied directly to 
flood victims 
the figures are changing almost every hour he said 
speaking on condition of anonymity a number of embassies are 
exploring what the scope might be and have not yet made a final 
commitment 
a senior western diplomat who follows aid donations closely 
said people talk about flood control but the major problem 
for bangladesh is overpopulation 
population density in bangladesh is 2000 per sqaure mile the 
worlds highest after hong kong and singapore 
while hong kong and singapore are little more than citystates 
however bangladesh is an agricultural nation of about 55000 
square miles roughly the size of wisconsin 
seventyfive percent of its people work in agriculture working 
the rice paddies and jute fields inundated by the floods

wyomings congressional delegation asked 
interior secretary donald hodel on wednesday to declare the state a 
disaster area because of wildfires in yellowstone national park and 
surrounding forests 
us sen malcolm wallop also called for the resignation of 
national park service director william penn mott for the simple 
reason that he continues to find some reason to celebrate this 
event while all the rest of us are suffering 
wyomings congressional delegation disagrees with the park 
services policy of allowing fires of natural origin to burn 
untended as long as they dont threaten structures or people 
however in the last month yellowstone officials have tried to 
suppress all new fires whether caused by man or nature but 
unusually dry conditions and gusting winds have prevented thousands 
of firefighters from gaining control 
republicans wallop and sen alan simpson along with montana 
sens max baucus and john melcher met with hodel in washington 
dc to express their displeasure with the way fires in the 
yellowstone area are being handled 
in yellowstone alone 644000 of the parks 22 million acres 
have been charred since late june while more than 1 million acres 
have been blackened in the park and its surrounding national 
forests 
simpson also pressed the delegations demands with president 
reagan during a separate meeting 
a disaster declaration which would have to come from reagan 
would make lowinterest loans and cash assistance available to 
businessmen and homeowners affected by the fires wyoming tourism 
has fallen off drastically because of the blazes

the man who disarmed the lone ranger will be 
spending lots of time around horses but hell be cleaning up after 
the animals rather than riding them 
edward louis young iii convicted of stealing pistols owned by 
jack carlson clayton moore was sentenced to spend 600 hours 
cleaning up after the horses at the houston mounted patrols 
stables 
the task could take 2 years if young spends 20 hours a month 
shoveling manure at the houston mounted patrols stables 
judge ted poe said the punishment was fitting for the theft of 
the weapons from the hero whos been bringing evil outlaws to 
justice on television and in movies for a halfcentury 
poe also sentenced young on tuesday to a month in harris county 
jail and placed him on probation for 10 years 
young a 45yearold former airline baggage handler was 
convicted of stealing moores chromeplated twin colt 45caliber 
revolvers at houston intercontinental airport on dec 24 1986 an 
appeals court recently upheld the conviction 
i carry no animosity and im certainly a believer in law and 
order and one thing for sure the ten commandments moore said 
wednesday from his california home and one of those is thou 
shalt not steal 
moore was signing autographs the airport when his bags 
disappeared 
aside from two us customs inspectors young was the only other 
person in the baggage area when moores luggage and guns were 
stolen young was apprehended after police traced him as the person 
who sold the weapons at a jewelry and gold exchange he contended 
someone had sold him the pistols and holsters for 200 outside a 
pawn shop 
youngs lawyer based his appeal on insufficient evidence and the 
fact that poe let the lone ranger wear his sunglasses and white hat 
while testifying 
poe who often wears cowboy boots under his judges robe in 
court said he had no intention of ordering moore to remove his 
trademark hat 
i wasnt about to be the one who revealed the identity of the 
lone ranger poe joked outlaws have been trying to find it out 
for years

e robert wallach the edwin meese iii friend 
under indictment in the wedtech bribery case said wednesday night 
that he was convicted by the news media even before he was indicted 
wallach speaking at an american university forum on the press 
said the first amendment guarantee of freedom of the press does 
not give them authority to desecrate the sixth amendment right the 
presumption of innocence 
the san francisco lawyer who goes on trial jan 3 in new york 
on federal racketeering and conspiracy charges said he was the 
victim of the media and a special prosecutors investigation whose 
purpose was to drive ed meese from office 
i became an appropriate vehicle to help to accomplish 
that i became a rag doll you chewed said wallach who is under 
indictment for allegedly taking payoffs from wedtech officials to 
influence meese the former white house counselor and attorney 
general and other public officials 
i was convicted before i was indicted i was convicted by the 
american media said wallach 
lyn nofziger the former white house political director 
appealing his conviction of illegal lobbying his former reagan 
administration colleagues told the forum that although some 
reporters are careless he received fair coverage at his trial 
you cant point a finger at the profession said nofziger a 
former reporter 
two reporters on the same panel ruth marcus of the washington 
post and james polk of nbc news insisted the press had no power to 
indict or convict anyone 
polk said wallachs problems stemmed from his indictment and the 
special prosecutors investigation of meese not the medias 
reporting of them 
the press is not the legal system the legal system to which 
bob wallach belongs as a lawyer decides guilt or 
innocence said polk a pulitzer prizewinning investigative 
reporter 
wallach said the way the press reports indictments makes people 
look guilty 
an even mediocre prosecutor can get a grand jury to indict a 
ham sandwich im not a sandwich and im certainly not a ham 
sandwich said wallach a law school classmate and longtime

an ambassador said wednesday that a 
tendency by the nonaligned movement to generate voluminous 
resolutions which have little or no impact has robbed the movement 
of the influence it once had in the world 
the criticism came during the opening session of a fourday 
conference of foreign ministers from nations that profess 
nonalignment and it was echoed by several other speakers who 
called on the movement to review its role 
delegations from 92 of the movements 101 members attended the 
meeting including 70 foreign ministers the conference is expected 
to map out the movements policies for the rest of the century 
the movement has become a marginal force on the world stage 
producing many declarations after each meeting which appear to 
have no impact singapores representative ambassador kishore 
mahbubani said in a speech 
we will have to reexamine carefully the procedures and 
practices of the movement that have allowed it to stagnate he 
said the central question is this can we attempt some bold 
restructuring within the movement to make it once again a vital 
force on the world stage 
zimbabwes foreign minister nathan shamuyaria said the 
movement risks becoming ineffective and irrelevant if it does 
not follow through on its resolutions and streamline its 
operations we must ensure that nam the movement is present at 
the tables where decisions are taken he said 
our major problem he added may not only be the volume or 
quality of our documents but rather the degree of our faithfulness 
in upholding promoting and defending the positions we adopt by 
consensus in those documents 
in general the movements documents lack concrete proposals for 
solutions to the problems they analyze shamuyaria said 
in his keynote address president george vassiliou of cyprus 
said the meeting must focus on bolstering the economies of its 
members which include the worlds poorest nations 
vassiliou told the 800 delegates the meeting was being held at 
a time of dramatic changes in the international scene in an 
atmosphere of optimism as a result of several positive political 
developments 
he mentioned superpower detente and progress toward the 
settlement of conflicts in iran and iraq afhganistan angola and 
the western sahara 
nevertheless he said we note with sadness that the economic 
conditions of most developing countries has not improved in fact 
it has deteriorated 
the conference will end saturday

rep stephen j solarz dny said wednesday 
that based on discussions he had recently with soviet officials in 
moscow he believes it is possible that the soviet union may 
eventually remove its historic barriers against people moving 
abroad 
i came away with the impression that it is no longer 
inconceivable that within a few years you could have something 
approaching freedom of emigration for jews and perhaps other 
citizens of the soviet union solarz told reporters 
during an august visit to the soviet capital he said i had 
some of the most remarkable discussions i have ever had with 
soviet officials who have influence on matters of clearance to 
leave the country 
solarz added that the officials whom he declined to identify 
told him that continued restrictions on the right of emigration 
are in fact inconsistent with glasnost and perestroika openness 
and restructuring the key reform policies of soviet leader mikhail 
s gorbachev 
while not saying when it would happen they said they wouldnt 
be at all surprised if the policies would change in the future 
said solarz a member of the house foreign affairs committee 
i was stunned to hear soviet officials talk about this as 
a conceivable possibility solarz said noting that he had become 
accustomed to haggling over the fate of each individual seeking 
to leave the soviet union

firefighters singed the edges of two 
small tourist communities wednesday in a sofar successful effort 
to protect the towns from a huge windblown forest fire making its 
way out of yellowstone national park 
another blaze the 5000acre red bench fire in the states 
northwest corner swept into glacier national park on wednesday and 
destroyed ranger stations before raging through the evacuated 
community of polebridge on the parks western boundary 
gusty wind fanned backfires lighted along a hillside north of 
silver gate and nearby cooke city creating a charred buffer zone 
in advance of the main body of the 119000acre storm 
creekhellroaring fire 
flames from the backfire roared past silver gate late tuesday 
night coming within 200 yards of buildings clustered along the 
communitys main street before continuing east past cooke city on 
wednesday 
the flames driven by winds up to 35 mph leaped a safety line 
wednesday and raced five miles east destroying four remote summer 
cabins near a mountain pass 
firefighters sprayed foam on buildings in colter pass 2 miles 
east of cooke city and saved about 40 structures before the heat of 
the soaring flames drove them out said fire official bob martines 
now with the fuels burned out at least on this side of the 
valley there wont be anything left to burn said bill stalker 
fire information officer 
however fire officials remained concerned that winds could 
shift and drive the main portion of the fire into dry unburned 
timber south of the canyon towns 
survival of the towns was a matter of luck driven by wind with 
gusts up to 25 mph flames from the backfire jumped a line at just 
the right spot and traveled down the north side of the canyon 
rather than through silver gate and cooke city 
asked how close the backfire came to structures at silver gate 
on tuesday night fire information officer dave mcmorran replied 
zero its right up behind the buildings 
the only thing between the fires and structures was the initial 
fire break itself which mcmorran described as one or two 
bulldozer blades 10 to 20 feet 
stalker said the blackened areas on the north sides of both 
silver gate and cooke city should significantly reduce the danger 
of fire slopping over from the main blaze which was still about 
a mile from silver gate 
evacuated residents may complain about the ugly scene of 
blackened timber marking the flames passage but it would have 
burned anyway he said had the main fire been allowed to sweep 
into silver gate unchecked that would have eaten the whole town 
in 15 to 20 minutes stalker said 
in silver gate exhausted firefighters slept anywhere they could 
find a grassy spot some had worked for more than 24 hours 
protecting buildings from the flames that raced by on the hillside 
the red bench fire breeched the western boundary of glacier park 
on wednesday and quickly charred more than 1000 acres of the 
park burning several vacant cabins and two ranger stations 
an abrupt wind shift sent the flames south and through the small 
evacuated community of polebridge said madelyn kempf fire 
information officer 
im sure there was extensive damage she said but officials 
could not determine the extent since we cant send people in 
there because of the firestorm conditions created by the 
fastmoving flames kempf added 
about 100 people live in the forested polebridge area 
two campgrounds in glacier were evacuated and closed officials 
said

the man representing mysterious greek 
financiers who former tv evangelist jim bakker says are backing his 
172 million offer to buy ptl has been convicted of fraud a 
television station reported wednesday 
wbtv in charlotte nc said from 1970 through 1981 louis 
pihakis who runs international financial consultants in pensacola 
fla was arrested or served time for a variety of charges 
including fraud mail fraud conspiracy forgery counterfeiting 
and parole violations 
the station did not say where it got its information the report 
said pihakis admitted to the station serving eight months in jail 
during that time on charges he said were trumpedup 
pihakis home telephone number in pensacola is unlisted and he 
could not be reached for comment 
bakkers lawyer jim toms of hendersonville nc told the 
associated press in a telephone interview wednesday night that 
neither bakker nor his lawyers know the identity of the greek 
businessmen 
he said they are relying on the word of longtime bakker friend 
and chicago businessman jerry sinclair who led bakker to pihakis 
and has acted as a middleman between them toms described pihakis 
as the us representative for the greek businessmen 
sinclair who declined to say what his business is but was 
identified by toms as a songwriter told the associated press in a 
telephone interview from fort mill that he was aware that pihakis 
had a criminal record but he did not know how extensive it was 
sinclair said he has had positive verification which did not 
come through pihakis that the greek money does exist 
he said pihakis has paid for any mistakes he may have made in 
the past we know him and trust him because he canot afford to 
make a mistake sinclair said 
thats the thing about the christian ministry that you must 
remember that were a very forgiving group that if somebody makes 
mistakes we dont mind that sinclair told the television 
station it matters who they are today you can find a record on 
just about anybody maybe the record might not be criminal but you 
got a record of sinning 
sinclair said as long as adverse publicity about pihakis does 
not scare away a midwest bank that has agreed to handle the greek 
funds the deal to buy ptls christian theme park satellite 
television network and real estate should go through in a matter of 
days the bank has not been publicly identified 
bakker had said tuesday he had 29 million of 3 million he 
needs for a down payment on a 172 million offer he has made to buy 
ptls assets the fort millbased ministry he left with massive 
debts last year after a sexandmoney scandal must sell the assets 
as part of a chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization 
sinclair said he told bankruptcy trustee mc red benton 
tuesday about pihakiss criminal background after being contacted 
by a reporter for wbtv sinclair said benton did not seem overly 
concerned 
benton who had set a thursday deadline for the down payment 
did not return phone calls wednesday his secretary said he would 
not talk to reporters until friday which she said was the earliest 
contracts might be signed with bakker 
toms said he was unsure how much money bakker has raised in his 
effort to gather 3 million in cash and pledges bakker and his 
wife tammy faye used a directmail campaign to ask supporters for 
donations reciting their troubles and offering copies of mrs 
bakkers latest gospel album 
benton has a deadline of saturday to present a buyer to us 
bankruptcy judge rufus reynolds who is based in greensboro nc 
benton said tuesday he may present more than one offer to reynolds 
a 113 million offer from canadian real estate executive peter 
thomas is still standing

aid a diplomat from one industrial nation said privately it 
doesnt really make sense to pour millions into this country every 
year and see it washed away 
floods began in june with the annual monsoon season they have 
claimed 416 lives by the governments count which is considered 
low and 1267 on the basis of unofficial tabulations by dhaka 
newspapers 
the government said wednesday night all major rivers remained 
above flood stage but that water levels fell during the previous 24 
hours in all rivers except two small tributaries near the bay of 
bengal 
but people still were marooned on rooftops and scarce patches of 
high ground and as many as onequarter of the nations 110 million 
citizens were homeless

matt thompson is first and foremost a 
shooter and if the soldier framed in his camera lens dies in 
combat well its going to make a great picture 
thompson clutching his cameras is tramping through the jungle 
aware of the viet cong stalking him and the american soldiers 
around him yet concentrating on getting the shot 
the shot thats going to amaze his wire service bosses back in 
new york the shot thats going to land on the front page of every 
newspaper around the world the shot thats going to win him the 
pulitzer prize the shot thats finally going to spark the job 
offer from life magazine 
i didnt want combat photographers to be overly glamorized 
said david hume kennerly writerproducer of the nbc movie 
shooter airing sunday i wanted to show what its really 
like the competitive nature i wanted to show a guy whose purpose 
is getting the one great photo to the exclusion of everything else 
he was going to wind up either famous or dead 
kennerly is himself a pulitzer prizewinning photographer who 
covered vietnam a onetime life magazine staffer and white house 
photographer in the ford administration in shooter he tells a 
compelling story of combat photographers 
the photographers work for international press a fictitious 
wire service operating out of a bureau in saigon 
the movie has the feel and texture of the real thing it throbs 
with the passion the cutthroat competition and the pranks of the 
photographers it swings between the dangers of combat to such 
humorous episodes as elderly american tourists who keep wandering 
into the shooting zones and the stickyfingered german 
photographer bent on shipping home the national art treasures of 
vietnam 
one of the photographers schemes involves the invention of a 
phony photo stringer named growald thompson wants to use the 
money paid the nonexistent stringer to aid a vietnam orphanage 
the other shooters without charity in mind horn in and start 
crediting some of their film to growald soon growald is the most 
talkedabout photographer in vietnam it ends with an ironic 
backfire to thompsons quest for the pulitzer prize 
kennerly was cowriter and coexecutive producer with stephen 
kline gary nelson directed the twohour movie on location in 
thailand kennerly had earlier written a book also called 
shooter about vietnam that was heavily illustrated with his 
pictures 
the movie stars jeffrey nordling as matt thompson alan ruck as 
a fellow shooter noble willingham as the bureau chief plus 
jeffrey allan chandler helen hunt rosalind chao steven ford and 
nick cassavetes 
the movie is autobiographical to a degree kennerly 
admitted lets say the photographer was based a bit on me but 
this isnt my story in vietnam every character was pulled from 
people i knew some of mes in the other photographers too 
kennerly worked for united press international in vietnam and 
was 25 when he won a pulitzer in 1972 he joined life only six 
weeks before the publication folded he then switched to time and 
is still associated with the magazine 
he got into motion pictures when he enrolled in a twoyear 
course in directing at the american film institute his student 
film also about a photographer in vietnam will be shown this 
season on the arts amp entertainment network he also produced the 
nbc movie the taking of flight 847 the uli derickson story 
shooter was originally conceived for nbc as a series pilot 
but so far the nework has shown no inclination to pick it up

elsewhere in television 
stupid parent tricks film critics gene siskel and roger ebert 
begin their 13th television season sept 17 by taking a swipe at 
eight annoying film cliches accompanied by film clips the cliches 
are 
the overturned fruit cart that shows up in every foreign film 
chase 
the horror movie heroes who ignore caution 
the prominently displayed products which are known in film and 
tv as closet commercials 
the obligatory stumble for every hero in a race 
parents who are dumber than their kids 
the killer whose filibuster allows the victim to escape 
the woman driver who never looks in the back seat 
and dumb errors in continuity such as showing the hero 
smoking from one angle but not from the reverse angle

todays special at your nearby investment firm 
a 1125 item guaranteed to shrink in value to 1000 by the time 
you cash it in 
youll pass you say you have enough trouble with unintended 
losses in managing your money without taking any intentional ones 
but a good many financial advisers suggest that the proposition 
in question known as a premium bond might merit a closer look for 
yieldconscious investors 
premium bonds are interestbearing securities that carry a price 
above their face or redemption value generally because interest 
rates have fallen since the bonds were first sold to the public 
as rates came down the bonds price was pushed upward by 
traders and dealers in the marketplace to keep its yield at least 
roughly competitive with those of new securities being offered at 
todays market rates 
in theory however this balancing process might not always be 
totally efficient premium bonds may at times be available offering 
interest income that could more than cover their decline over time 
in principal value 
many investors question the benefit of buying bonds at a 
premium believing that if they hold a premium bond until maturity 
they will be taking a loss says the brokerage firm of ag 
edwards amp sons inc in a report on the subject 
actually this is not the case at all when you consider the 
bonds total return the reason to invest in premium bonds is to 
achieve higherthanmarket income and current yield with the hope 
that these will more than offset the premium price 
in addition edwards points out premium bonds can provide some 
tax advantages even though the rules were tightened by the tax 
reform act of 1986 
owners of premium bonds issued by corporations or the federal 
government can if they choose take a tax deduction each year for 
the gradual decrease in the principal value of the bonds 
for securities bought before oct 23 1986 this amortization is 
applied as a simple reduction of investment income 
for purchases made since that date it is considered an 
investment interest expense still deductible but only if you 
itemize and only to the extent that you have net investment income 
in any given year from capital gains interest and dividends 
as long as it falls within these limits investment interest 
unlike consumer interest for credit purchases remains 100 percent 
deductible 
premiums naturally occur as well in the market for municipal 
bonds issued by state and local governments which pay interest 
that is exempt from federal income tax 
because the interest is not taxable owners of premium 
municipals are not allowed to take tax deductions either for 
yearbyyear amortization of the principal value or for a capital 
loss when the bonds mature 
so municipal bond investors appraise premium bonds in that 
market simply on the basis of the total return they offer interest 
payments minus the annual depreciation in their value 
premium bonds like all other marketable debt securities are 
subject to the constant ebb and flow of interest rates 
thus if you want or need to sell them before maturity you can 
realize a gain or loss independent of the projected decline in a 
premium bonds value from the time you buy it 
and obviously investing in premium bonds requires some pretty 
sharp calculating or the counsel of a trusted professional adviser 
willing to crunch the numbers for you 
but it also stands to reason that the more investors shy away 
from premium bonds the more potential opportunities they may offer 
for those willing to dig for them

how do you undo a stalemate that is the 
question one whose answer eludes our most skilled politicians 
more accurately the nations political leaders evade the issue 
the result being that the job of straightening out americans 
finances is sort of a political ghost felt and even talked about 
but never confronted 
the problem is this how do you deal with the fact that 
americans want their social benefits such as social security and 
unemployment payments but are just as certain that they dont want 
taxes raised 
the conference board a businessfinanced research group that 
contracted for a survey on the subject in an effort to puncture the 
quandary came full circle with this conclusion 
while it is widely agreed that the federal deficit should be 
significantly reduced a formidable majority of americans continue 
to oppose any reductions in this nations social programs 
not all social programs are enthusiastically supported said 
fabian linden of the nonprofit board but those that are 
enthusiastically supported he found tend to be in the bigbucks 
area 
based on results from 5000 households surveyors found four of 
five oppose any cuts in social security medicare and veterans 
benefits and three in five oppose reductions in health research 
unemployment and childcare benefits 
the areas favored for reduction involved a far smaller 
percentage of the population only onethird for example said no 
cuts should be permitted in food stamps public housing welfare 
and aid to small businesses 
the most enthusiasm for cutting was in the foreign aid category 
with 61 percent more than double the percentage in any other 
category recommending large cuts and only 66 percent holding 
fast for no cuts 
more than 50 percent insisted there be no cuts for environmental 
protection and 46 percent held out for no cuts whatever in roads 
and highways spending 
the findings suggest americans are no nearer than before to 
solving the dilemma of wanting to spend more than to pay since one 
survey after another finds voters opposed to higher taxes 
the trick may be to find tax increases that affect the fewest 
number of people but such taxes of course are also likely to 
provide the least revenue among the possibilities therefore are 
taxes on cigarettes and alcohol 
perhaps the least likely tax to be accepted by the public would 
be the valueadded tax which as might be surmised is also the tax 
that could do most to correct the budget imbalance 
such a tax on the increase in value of products at the various 
stages in production and distribution might provide as much as 
127 billion in revenue compared to 4 billion to 8 billion for 
boosts in alcohol and cigarette taxes according to the 
congressional budget office 
some of the possibilities studied by the budget office would 
seem to have little chance of passing including taxing capital 
gains at death limiting mortgageinterest deductions and raising 
capital gains taxes on home sales 
somewhere there is a solution but it is deep in the dark 
confines of the political closet a spooky place where timid 
political candidates do not even want to look

her surname may sound familiar but page hannah is 
launching a movie career based on her own merits not on family 
ties 
i just dont think people are stupid enough to base a 7 
million movie on the fact that im related to someone i just dont 
buy it said daryl hannahs younger sister whose new movie 
called shag opened last month in london 
set in south carolina in 1963 the film intrigued some critics 
as a kind of son or daughter of the highly acclaimed american 
graffiti it portrays four teenage girls on a last romantic 
summer fling 
shag also features bridget fonda daughter of peter fonda 
tyrone power jr phoebe cates and annabeth gish prompting nigel 
andrews in the financial times to write that the movies main 
interest was that everyone in it seemed to be the close relative 
of someone else 
but frecklefaced hannah 24 and 3 years younger than her 
glamorous blond sister says im not bombshell enough or 
unusual enough to bring in people simply because i have a last name 
thats similar to someone famous and i dont think anyone else 
in shag is either 
directed by british filmmaker zelda barron and opening in the 
united states early this autumn shag takes its name from a 
popular 1960s dance 
however hannah said the movie was not a retread of recent 
movies with dance themes such as dirty dancing and salsa 
all three were choreographed by kenny ortega 
its much more concerned with getting to know the 
characters hannah said 
and she added its extremely rare to have a film about four 
girls with a woman directing it 
hannah plays luanne the straightlaced daughter of a senator 
she hides behind enormous glasses her long hair piled into a bun 
in the back 
the chicagoborn actress has done yearlong stints as kate riley 
on the tv series fame and as adair mccleery in the soap opera 
search for tomorrow however shag is her first major 
screen role 
in great britain the fact that i have worked steadily is more 
recognized in america its like so shes worked steadily most 
of it hasnt really come out hannah said here its a 
testament that you keep getting jobs so obviously youre good 
one of 10 children and stepchildren she joked that acting was 
becoming kind of a new family business 
but she added that her sister has refrained from offering 
advice its not like lawyers sit down with their younger 
brothers and say this is the way its going to be

the role of freddy in nightmare on elm 
street doesnt carry the prestige of hamlet but robert 
englund isnt complaining 
in fact englund a shakespearean actor at the age of 21 
considers freddy one of his most challenging roles 
freddys one of the first times i used a lot of that theater 
training because i can physicalize him so much i can do a vocal 
characterization you have to live up to the scenery around you 
he said 
theres a lot of good oldfashioned acting 
freddy is the villain everyone loves to hate in the 
nightmare films in nightmare on elm street iv the dream 
master freddy returns from the dead to haunt the teenagers of 
springwood usa 
the first three nightmare films earned a combined 103 
million at the domestic box office with freddy unquestionably the 
main drawing card hes slated to carry his freddy portrayal to a 
tv series this fall called a nightmare on elm street freddys 
nightmares 
theres so many things wrong today englund said in an 
interview freddy becomes kind of a blanket evil i dont think 
people identify with freddy but i do think they enjoy the 
unapologetic evil 
like any actor englund had to find the motivation to play his 
character but how to relate to someone as evil as freddy 
i used a very concrete trick i looked around at the 
incredible youth and beauty of my costars they were gorgeous 
young they werent jaded i had my share of bitterness and bad 
stories 
i was able to use my envy that they were being pampered while 
i was being basted like a turkey with vasoline i would literally 
use that to get angry with them and resent them it was a nice 
parallel to freddys loathing of youth and beauty and innocence 
englund grew up in southern california in the 1950s and was 12 
when he enrolled in a childrens theater program at california 
state university at northridge in high school he won 10 acting 
awards in the teenage drama workshop and was eventually accepted 
at the royal academy of dramatic art in england 
englund appeared in the cleveland company production of 
godspell in 1972 his feature film debut was buster and 
billie which starred jan michael vincent and pamela sue martin 
he later appeared with jeff bridges and sally field in stay 
hungry and with henry fonda in the last of the cowboys 
in 1984 after playing willie in the popular tv miniseries 
v englund was looking for a change of pace 
i had some free time and the nightmare film was one of the 
few projects that came through my agent that fit perfectly in 
there englund recalled i had never played a monster i went 
in not knowing that freddy was always in makeup i thought that 
maybe he would be a before and after 
the first nightmare film was shot on the stage once used for 
the i love lucy tv series 
it was this wonderful ensemble thing we shared a common sound 
stage with frances premier communal theater group it was 
wonderful for me doing my first lowrent horror movie to see the 
premier ensemble company of the world sit in awe at this perfect 
hollywood movie for them to witness englund said 
we had gorgeous teenage girls fire stunts and monsters they 
were doing twelfth night in french with silk backdrops and 
embroidered costumes 
surprisingly englund wasnt much of a fan of horror movies 
growing up but he does admit to being affected by frankenstein 
i remember watching the original frankenstein with my 
mother it began at 1115 at night i was obsessed with that movie 
i couldnt sleep for a week 
freddy has probably caused a few sleepless nights as well not 
just for the audience but for englund who must endure the daily 
routine of having the makeup applied 
it gets harder it doesnt get easier he said when you 
start the movie you havent done makeup in a year so its no big 
deal towards the end i would feel my skin tingling in 
anticipation its not fun 
freddys appeal isnt just his appearance but what he says a 
typical line comes in nightmare iv when he turns a girl into a 
roach and mutters you can check in but you cant check out 
englund says freddys penchant for such oneliners comes from 
another popular movie figure clint eastwood 
there is a certain clint eastwoodism that freddy does use 
he said throwing culture in the face of an audience that made 
him part of the popular culture 
how popular is freddy englund says hes known all over the 
world 
theres a huge following in london there are freddy 
knockknock jokes in yugoslavia the producers in india got mad and 
thought the movie was calculated for india they have some evil 
god like freddy 
can englund who grew up admiring such actors as michael caine 
and alan bates accept being remembered as a horror movie star yes 
if i have to go as a footnote with boris karloff and bela 
lugosi thats ok he said i have no choice now i grew it i 
chew it

it was a horrible senseless thing to happen 
please accept my apology and my heartfelt sorrow i share your 
grief and outrage may god be with you 
such are the sentiments of americans in letters to families of 
the 290 people killed july 3 when the uss vincennes mistakenly 
shot down an iranian airliner over the persian gulf 
our crying extends across the oceans wrote ginger smith of 
honolulu 
the us outpouring was typically grass roots initiated 
unofficially reflecting varied emotions and attitudes but 
overwhelmingly expressing sympathy and regret 
my heart goes out to you in your loss of a loved one wrote 
virla jean lynk of saginaw mich maria keeling of norman okla 
wrote i wish i were there to hold your hand during your sorrow 
wrote lauri jo pietila of san francisco i grieve for all of 
you and the terrible injustice that has been done please dont 
hate the entire united states 
many of the letters spoke of the common humanity of all people 
whatever their nations or conflicts between them 
we are brothers and sisters wrote michele gallery of studio 
city calif paul j piccard of talahassee fla wrote since we 
all share the same humanity it is also my loss 
the project was begun by the rev w canty a new york episcopal 
priest who says some of the letters have caused me to weep the 
love and compassion expressed by americans for people half a world 
away is quite extraordinary 
once the collection is accumulated he plans to have the letters 
translated into irans language farsi and languages of other 
victims and bound he then is to deliver them personally to the 
bereaved families 
several mainline denominations have endorsed the project as has 
the rev lawrence m jenco a roman catholic priest held hostage in 
lebanon for 19 months before his release in mid1986 
those wishing to write should address letters to po box 6122 
grand central station new york ny 101636019 
i hope that you will accept the love in my heart wrote 
brent haug of las vegas nev he said a best friend in college was 
an iranian and wished all of us could have the benefit of meeting 
each other on friendly terms 
a new york jew brynna c bloomfield wrote that she formerly 
regarded nonjewish middle easterners as an impersonal mass 
but the accident has caused her to think about you humanely for 
the very first time 
your losses have caused me to see husbands and 
mothers and sisters and children then i think you must love and 
despair as i do 
andrew cohen a houston student wrote that my government and 
your government are enemies but every mans life is equally 
important all people are the same ill be thinking of you and 
your pain god bless you 
only about 100 letters have been received so far but theyre 
still coming mainly from ordinary people but also from congress 
members judges mayors governors ministers and movie actors 
a few letters criticized us policy but most avoided assessing 
blame the pentagon attributed the accident to stress and human 
errors in reading data only two letters denounced iranians and 
also the project 
canty said gathering the letters was nonpolitical all people 
are victims of this accidental tragedy in one way or another 
empathizing with grief and sharing these condolences allows the 
healing process to start 
some letters voiced shame at the incident i love my country 
but at this time i feel great sorrow and shame for the terrible 
horror it has caused you wrote lucile sealander of fayetteville 
ark 
some letters came from parents who who had lost loved ones in 
american airplane crashes a new york woman lois spark whose son 
was killed in an 1986 crash in detroit that killed 157 wrote 
i know your anger and feel your pain along with mine my 
hope for us as survivors of these victims is that they did not 
die in vain that out of this tragedy will come a new desire to 
live together on this earth in peace 
many of the letters express hope for greater international 
friendship and trust 
regardless of what happened between our countries in the 
past wrote james e ponder of easling sc i love you as a 
child of god i hope that someday soon iran and the united 
states can become friends 
wrote stephanie lee of san francisco 
it is not my place to ask your fogiveness nor do i expect it 
for our militarys fatal action i do ask you to please keep your 
hearts and minds open to the american people may you find 
strength and love in each other and in your god

of the 2684 law school graduates who 
took the bar exams his year only 480 passed the result left many 
filipinos in shock and dramatized the state of the countrys 
americaninspired eductional system 
once a model for asia it has slumped into mediocrity 
the results of the bar exams announced by the supreme court in 
may were the lowest in the history of the philippines bar 
it is an indication of the deteriorating quality of the 
education we have especially in the preparatory courses said 
emilio rebueno a lawyer who has administered the exams for the 
last 11 years a lot of them examinees could not even express 
themselves 
in july president corazon aquino told the nation that unless 
the decline in educational standards was checked generations of 
filipinos would be doomed to a future of rampant functional 
illiteracy 
critics attribute the decline to low teacher salaries and a lack 
of classrooms books and other teaching aids they also cite 
outdated curricula poorly trained teachers and inefficient use of 
funds already scarce 
many of those who graduate from public high schools cannot 
afford to attend elite private colleges or are unable to compete 
for places at the staterun university of the philippines because 
of inferior secondary education 
they wind up in privatelyowned diploma mills which churn 
out thousands of teachers nurses and other professionals who 
cannot qualify for jobs when they graduate 
after the barexam results were announced ernesto jaurigue 
director general of the professional regulation commission 
reported a similar decline in examination results for other 
professions such as medicine engineering and nursing 
it was not always that way 
amado dizon secretary general of the coordinating council of 
private educational associations recalled that several decades 
ago the quality of education was so high that a sixthgrade 
student could qualify as a substitute teacher for the lower grades 
today education officials acknowledge that many teachers 
especially in the countryside are not qualified to teach and serve 
only to pass on their own ignorance to their students 
when the united states colonized the philippines at the turn of 
the century it introduced a public school system patterned after 
its own and shipped in thousands of american teachers 
in a few decades the demand for higher education was so strong 
that the handful of existing private and state colleges could not 
cope private schools flourished 
the philippines still claims one of the highest literacy rates 
in asia at 89 percent but many question the figure because it 
includes people who can read and write only their names 
dr victor ordonez undersecretary of education attributes the 
slide to lack of money neglect of the education sector during the 
20year rule of the nowdeposed president ferdinand e marcos and 
on the systems own inflexibility 
our country has had so many dramatic turns in its history 
but our education system has remained the same as when the 
americans introduced it he said in a recent interview it 
continues to move in the same fixed direction and it may fall off 
the cliff of irrelevance we are giving our children the tools of 
the past 
how many of them after school will need to diagram a 
sentence or solve a reallife problem with simultaneous algebraic 
equations or to remember a date in history 
the philippines system emphasizes rote drills at the expense of 
analysis or group discussions which experts say enhance 
problemsolving skills classes of 50 or more pupils are common 
even during the marcos years education officials recognized the 
problem with a 100million loan from the world bank they 
launched a program in 1980 to reform the public elementary school 
system the program ends this year 
a 200million program financed by grants from various 
countries and loans from the asian development bank is to be 
launched next year to upgrade public high schools 
both programs involve intensive retraining of teachers 
rewriting books and revamping curricula elementary curricula were 
reorganized to emphasize basics reading writing and arithmetic 
public school teachers salaries have also been increased 
recently the national average salary for a new teacher was 
increased this year to 2400 pesos 120 a month from 1500 pesos 
75 
this has increased the prestige of the teaching profession and 
applications for teachers schools have increased threefold ordonez 
said many of the applicants have graduated from quality schools 
according to ordonez the effect of the reforms will not become 
apparent until 1994 when students who entered the first grade in 
1980 begin graduating from fouryear colleges 
ordonez said results of achievement tests indicate that progress 
is being made filipino public school students normally spend six 
years in elementary grades and four in high school

captain james t kirk of the starship enterprise 
looks skyward from a lonely windblown planet and says 
entapuraizu riku kara tenso shite kure 
for those listening to the english version of star trek 
captain kirk would have said enterprise beam me up 
dubbed in japanese star trek is just one of many vintage 
american tv programs boldly exploring the latenight tokyo airwaves 
during a typical week insomniastricken viewers in the tokyo 
area can watch burkes law the 1960s adventure show starring 
gene barry as a debonair los angeles police chief rod serlings 
the twilight zone the acclaimed science fiction series 
bonanza one of televisions longest running westerns starring 
lorne greene the beverly hillbillies the antics of a 
backwoods family in los angeles elitist neighborhood mission 
impossible the acclaimed bruce geller adventure series and 
the addams family a sitcom based on charles addams bizarre 
magazine cartoon characters 
i dont have any statistics on this said yoshihiro mishima 
of the tv tokyo network but we think the people who stay up to 
watch these programs are looking for a bit of the good old days 
when they might have been too young to watch the original 
broadcasts 
mishima said the viewers are mainly college students or adults 
in their 30s its part of the retro boom he said referring 
to a recent trend among some japanese to seek out things from the 
past 
but american tv shows are nothing new to the japanese audience 
there have been american programs on japanese tv for decades 
going back to ben casey and rawhide mishima said theyve 
lost popularity to domestic programing but people still watch them 
to get a look at america 
yuji tagami an editor with tv station magazine added they 
can develop devoted fans but ratings for latenight american 
programs in general are not very high 
limited viewership did not stop the tokyo broadcasting system 
from putting the nostalgic american tv series on its schedule 
last october since march the series has included surfside 6 
a 60s detective series set in miami beach starring troy donahue 
and van williams combat the longest of the world war ii 
adventures starring the late vic morrow and superman 
starring george reeves 
ratings arent a good way to judge latenight television 
shows popularity in that time slot viewership is small and more 
personal viewers are more attached to what they watch said 
masato ueda tbs producer of the series 
to young viewers the appeal of the rejuvenated old programs is 
in their newness ueda said 
we decided to go with the series when we went on the 24hour 
broadcasting schedule and though the retro boom was a part of 
the decision we wanted to give young people something completely 
new which to them these programs are 
many of the american programs also feature bilingual broadcasts 
with the original englishlanguage dialogue simultaneously aired on 
a subchannel available on specially equipped tv sets

television is assuming the role previously held by 
religion in shaping culture says the head of communications for 
the national council of churches 
the rev william fore told the convention of the religion public 
relations council 
television rather than churches is becoming the place where 
people find a worldview which reflects what to them is of ultimate 
value and which justifies their behavior and way of life 
television today whether the viewers know it or not and 
whether the television industry knows it or not is competing not

when sen dan quayle was baptized a presbyterian 
as an infant his father james c quayle recalls that the baby 
tried to grab the rose used by the pastor in sprinkling him 
that touching scene from the past is part of the religious 
chronology of the current vice presidential candidates 
their religious attachments scarcely have been reported compared 
to those of the presidential contenders republican george bush an 
episcopalian and democrat michael dukakis a greek orthodox both 
lifelong members of their faiths 
dukakis running mate sen lloyd bentsen was reared a southern 
baptist but is a longtime active member of the presbyterian church 
in the usa the mainline denomination of that tradition 
republican quayle a cradle presbyterian was put on an 
inactive list six years ago for prolonged nonparticipation at 
first presbyterian church in huntington ind also part of the 
mainline denomination 
although it says his membership has not been transferred 
elsewhere he lately has attended congregations of conservative 
offshoot presbyterian bodies espousing biblical fundamentalism 
without formal membership 
an independent bible congregation in indiana also says he still 
participates and congressional biographies list his affiliation as 
bible church 
he has maintained his relationship with us said the rev 
william t pauley pastor of parkview bible church in fort wayne 
ind you could say hes still a member quayle participated 
regularly in the mid1970s 
he is anxious that he lives his life in accordance with the 
scripture pauley said he takes his stands on the position of 
the bible 
since early this year in washington he has attended mclean 
presbyterian church in mclean va which also insists on bible 
inerrancy that its free of error 
he has started worshipping with us over the last several 
months said the churchs pastor the rev stephen smallman 
noting quayles family also participates his children attending 
sunday school 
the congregation is among conservatives that broke from mainline 
presbyterianism in 1973 to form a separate denomination the 
presbyterian church in america it does not ordain women as does 
the main body 
asked about quayles commitment smallman said i really dont 
know him very well other than to shake hands with him at the door 
and exchange chitchat 
quayle previously attended fourth presbyterian church in the 
capitals suburban bethesda md part of another conservative 
breakaway group that in 1980 formed a small separate denomination 
the evangelical presbyterian church 
he and his wife took part in an adult sunday school class 
said the assistant pastor the rev jeffrey jeremiah noting they 
and their children attended there for about five years until 1986 
im certain the bible informs him on how he lives his life 
jeremiah said 
in washington quayles wife marilyn takes part in friday 
bible study with a score of congressional wives in the home of rep 
jack kemp rny 
bentsen is a longtime member of houstons first presbyterian 
church part of the mainline denomination and takes part in its 
life and worship when in town 
he has a strong christian faith said the pastor the rev 
john william lancaster he was reared in a very strong christian 
tradition and is a man of genuine christian commitment 
before bentsen was nominated for the vice presidency in july he 
had agreed to speak in a lenten series at the church early next 
year on the subject of translating your faith into daily life 
he is not one to use his faith for political purposes but 
its important in how he thinks and in his value system 
lancaster said 
bentsens wife a daughter tina and son lloyd iii also are 
active in the congregation the son ushering and teaching a sunday 
school class 
bentsen was reared a southern baptist in his native mcallen 
texas but has been a presbyterian through most of his adult life 
in washington he attends national presbyterian church or new york 
avenue presbyterian 
his brother donald of mcallen who is a baptist said bentsen 
doesnt carry his bible out in front of him but is attuned to 
it privately he doesnt use religion in his politics 
quayle had transferred his membership in 1964 from the 
scottsdale ariz valley presbyterian church in which his father 
had been a charter member to the huntington church it put quayle 
on the inactive list in 1982 
both are part of the mainline denomination 
quayle and his family had participated regularly in the mid70s 
in grace bible church in leo ind it moved to fort wayne in 1984 
changing its name to parkview bible church he came to give our 
inaugural address pauley recounts 
pauley said the independent congregation unaffiliated with any 
denomination was bibically fundamentalist but not like some 
fundamentalists were not legalistic saying you cant do this or

the diver jacques mayol believes dolphins are 
the smartest animals around and he tries to emulate their way of 
life 
that is my hobby to see how we are related to the dolphins 
said mayol the inspiration for the film big blue 
its examples should always be followed by man its purity and 
simplicity its respect of its own behavior with nature he who 
lives in harmony with nature can only do good 
big blue directed by luc besson chronicles mayols life 
from his childhood mayol however points out that the film 
differs greatly from what actually happened 
you cant make a movie totally based on my own life it could 
be a little boring he said it would be too much like a 
documentary too scientific too philosophical 
in big blue he grows up in greece and has a diver for a 
father however mayol was actually born in the orient and later 
went to greece to study his father was not a diver but an 
architect and did not like to swim 
besson made a psychological transfer of his youth in greece 
he said he distorted everything which doesnt matter because 
its a movie i just accept it like dolphins do 
much of big blue is devoted to mayols friendly rivalry with 
enzo maiorca an italian free diver maiorca whose name was 
changed to molinari in big blue is determined to dive deeper 
than mayol and dies at the end of the film the real enzo maiorca 
is alive 
hes very proud very much like hes depicted in the film 
mayol said he claims he hasnt seen it but i knows hes seen 
it he was irritated to the point where hes going to attempt to 
beat me again 
the truth is that this rivalry after 22 years still exists 
the actor jeanmarc barr portrays mayol in big blue 
hes almost like a son to me mayol said i admired his 
desire and his total sincerity in trying to supplicate the little 
he knew about me it was fantastic what he did physically he dove 
day after day 
mayol says it was bessons idea to make the movie 
luc went to see me and i thought it was a fabulous thing i 
couldnt believe it he was just a kid 
the film has already been released in europe and has brought 
renewed interest in mayols career but mayol is not interested in 
being a celebrity i dont need the glory i have it already 
mayol was born april 1 1927 in shanghai which he points out 
means on the sea 
i was a very mischievous child and extremely stubborn and very 
badtempered he said the hospital where i was born was being 
attacked by the chinese communists they wanted to chase all the 
white people out i presumed this marked me 
from an early age mayol had an interest in the sea 
its just something that came from within totally 
unexplained as if it was predestined i remember as a kid dreaming 
i was hanging on to whales 
mayol says his childhood in shanghai influenced his approach to 
diving you go into the sea humbly its a very weird feeling 
its completely another level of conciousness another reality 
in the 1950s he worked as a journalist in the united states and 
was encouraged by friends to competitively test his diving skills 
mayol and maiorca began competing against each other in 1966 
taking turns as the world record holder but when they reached 249 
feet in 1970 the international federation ruled that the depths 
were too dangerous and refused to accept any further records 
in big blue maiorca continues to dive and eventually dies 
from going too deep mayol says a similar incident although 
nonfatal actually occurred 
in 1974 he beat me by one meter 33 feet except when he 
came back he was dead at 20 meters from the surface he fainted 
completely he was blue foam in his mouth mayol said 
he was brought back to life and solemnly swore that he was 
giving up the career that man is really stubborn 
mayol continued to dive reaching 345 feet in 1983 but only for 
scientific purposes 
i went on because i felt a joy a total awareness of a new 
feeling a symbiosis with the sea he said

holy men in their traditional saffron 
robes will hand over 4 million guava saplings and papaya seeds to 
hindu pilgrims at a religious fair in january in a unique effort to 
get people to plant trees as a way of saving their land and 
improving their livelihood 
the idea is that of an american volunteer group called trees for 
life in wichita kan 
it is something very new very original very challenging 
said deepak nirula the indian representative of the organization 
which aims to plant 5 million tress in poor countries to provide 
food and fuel for needy people 
the group is headed in wichita by balbir mathur who was born in 
india but is now a naturalized american mathur plans to raise 15 
million in small contributions in the united states to finance the 
effort 
the organization is hiring indian holy men and volunteers to 
distribute the saplings and seeds at kumbh mela a threeweek fair 
to be held in allahabad in central india beginning jan 14 the 
religious fair is held every 12 years and attracts more than 10 
million hindu pilgrims who bathe in the holy ganges river during a 
particularly auspicious configuration of the planets the sun and 
the moon 
we figured out that if we can give it a holy touch to the tree 
plantation drive it can work nirula said in an interview 
the saplings and seeds will be part of the holy offering which 
no hindu ignores so we hope when they go back to their respective 
villages they will plant the saplings and the seeds said nirula 
who runs a chain of fast food restaurants in new delhi 
we may be accused of exploiting the religious sentiments of 
the people but it is for a good cause 
trees for life is one of the 175 organizations in india trying 
to save the fast depleting forests each year the country loses a 
total of 37 million acres of forest 
it is a very serious problem said joyce shankaran a 
director at the national wastelands development board the official 
body that oversees the work of the volunteer organizations 
it is estimated that at the current rate of deforestation india 
will lose nearly 10 million acres of woodlands an area equal to 
the size of switzerland in the next five years 
until a few years ago the indian government was saddled with 
misleading statistics from forest guards that all was green it was 
thought that 22 percent of the countrys 812millionacre land mass 
was under forest cover ecologists say that the ideal forest cover 
should be 33 percent of the land mass but 22 percent was 
considered acceptable in a nation of 800 million people 
from satellite photographs of india however the government 
determined that only about 10 percent of the land mass was under 
good forest cover 
the entire himalayan ecosystem is threatened as a consequence 
with snow lines moving higher and perennial springs drying up 
because of lack of precipitation 
vanishing forests also affect wildlife government reports say 
that some of the 350 species of mammals 1200 species of birds and 
2000 species of insects in india are threatened some may have 
been lost already 
government alone cant save the forest it has gone beyond the 
control of any government said akhil chander a volunteer 
working in new delhi 
there has to be a massive peoples movement including 
individuals voluntary organizations schools and private and 
public institution chander said 
the trees for life group is working in five indian states the 
most visible project is in allahabad where the group is planting 
papaya saplings 
our aim is 700000 papaya tress in allahabad we have already 
planted 200000 nirula said the group wants to plant 27 
million trees and set up 800 beehives in india by the end of 1989 
this will mean an extra 135 million tons of fruit fuel and 
fodder 88000 pounds of honey and save 5000 tons of wood from 
being used as fuel for cooking nirula said 
the need for firewood and fodder or coarse food for cattle in 
india is about 133 million tons a year but only 36 million tons 
are available in staterun stores the rest comes from illegal 
felling of trees government investigations indicate 
the trees for life group spends about 3 for planting a fruit 
tree 
our message is very clear and loud nirula said plant 
fruit trees and you will not go hungry 
a 3 apple tree produces 10000 pounds of apple in its 
lifetime can you imagine going to your grocer and asking him 
to give you 10000 pounds of fruit for 3 
the grocer cant but trees for life can

sales of the suzuki samurai broke a monthly 
sales record by 459 percent in august as sharp price cuts helped 
it stage a comeback from the damage done by allegations that it was 
an unsafe vehicle 
samurai sales plunged by 706 percent in june after consumers 
union charged that the small boxy fourwheeldrive vehicle was 
dangerously topheavy and prone to rolling over 
august sales totaled 12208 up from the 2199 sold in june the 
sales were 544 percent ahead of the 7905 sold in august 1987 and 
459 percent ahead of the previousrecord 8365 sold in july 1987 
certainly consumer confidence is back in the samurai said 
douglas mazza general manager of the automotive division of 
american suzuki motor corp 
consumers union publisher of consumer reports stood by its 
criticism of the samurai which it has rated not acceptable 
in essence deep discounts and advertisements for fun and 
excitement do not make this a safe car marnie goodman a 
spokeswoman said tuesday 
the swift turnaround restored suzukis winning image just in 
time for the fall introduction of two new vehicles a bigger 
fourwheeldrive vehicle named the sidekick and a small hatchback 
named the swift 
suzuki is predicting samurai sales will drop off now that the 
dealer incentives have ended but it is counting on the sidekick 
and swift to more than pick up the slack 
analysts said american suzuki the us arm of japans suzuki 
motor co is in a much better position than it was three months 
ago 
momentum tends to feed on itself said scott merlis an 
analyst for morgan stanley amp co 
merlis said he could not comment on the samurais safety but 
said it was obvious that customers were willing to shed any 
lingering doubts raised by television news clips of the samurai 
tipping over while zigzagging on a consumers union test course 
its sometimes quite ironic how cash rebates can be the 
antidote to safety concerns merlis said occasionally you see 
sales incentives work like magic 
on july 13 suzuki announced 2000 incentives to dealers that 
made it possible for them to slash 25 percent from the samurais 
7995 base price that helped july sales to rebound somehwat to 
6327 
suzuki had piqued curiosity about its august results by saying 
they would be a record but kept its estimates low to enhance the 
surprise 
mazza told the wall street journal on thursday that august sales 
would top 9000 he told the associated press on friday he hoped 
sales would exceed 10000 but did not want to predict they would 
be as high as 11000 it was better than even we forecast and 
were pretty optimistic he said tuesday 
suzuki steadfastly has defended the samurais safety and its 
contentions were supported last thursday when the national highway 
traffic safety administration turned down petitions to investigate 
and recall the vehicle the agency said the samurai was no more 
dangerous than similar vehicles made by other companies 
the samurais success was mirrored by the success of chrysler 
corps jeep wrangler a competitor whose sales rose 12 percent to 
2465 from 2114 the jeep line as a whole had record sales in 
august 
in another sense the samurais experience is similar to the 
rebound experienced by chryslers dodge omni and plymouth horizon 
which were rated not acceptable by consumer reports in june 1978 
their sales fell by a third but began to rebound after the united 
states and canadian governments said the charges of unsafe handling 
could not be substantiated both cars are still on the market

us sales of cars and trucks were off 107 
percent last month compared with august 1987 when shortterm 
incentives enticed consumers to showrooms automakers and analysts 
say 
chrysler corp was the only one of the big three car makers 
reporting sales tuesday to show increases in late august and in 
monthly car and truck sales although one analyst said chryslers 
incentives were hurting its profits 
for the month foreign and domestic vehicle makers reported they 
sold 125 million cars and trucks last month compared with 135 
million during august 1987 sales by foreign car and truck makers 
fell 211 percent and domestic vehicle makers reported a 67 
percent decline 
for the aug 2131 period this year chrysler said it sold 
32214 usmade cars compared with 31388 cars during the same 
period last year a 26 percent increase 
general motors corp reported a 139 percent sales decrease to 
108986 from 126629 cars in late august 1987 ford motor co said 
its sales dropped 14 percent to 65500 in late august this year 
from 66515 in the same period last year 
for the month gms sales were down 207 percent and ford showed 
a 62 percent decline chrysler posted a 55 percent increase in 
monthly sales 
all three carmakers reported increases in yeartodate figures 
with chrysler leading the way at 132 percent this year over last 
year followed by ford at 93 percent and gm at a modest 04 
percent 
there were nine selling days in the late august periods of 1988 
and 1987 and 27 sales days last month compared with 26 days in 
august 1987 
a year ago with just one month left in the model year 
carmakers offered buyer incentives including cutrate financing as 
low as 19 percent for gm vehicles to lure customers into 
showrooms and shrink inventories this year the incentives are 
different 
chrysler has been more aggressive than the other two in using 
incentives to stimulate sales said donald descenza an industry 
analyst with nomura securities inc of new york they have the 
biggest sales gain and the worst operating performance in the 
second quarter theyre cutting into their profits 
theres an implication that theyre buying the sales with 
incentives descenza said those gains are maybe difficult to

creditors are not happy about 
lending argentina another 4 billion to help pay interest on its 
foreign debt through the end of 1989 but probably will do it 
anyway officials say 
i think they argentina will get new funds it will be harder 
because of the circumstances but theyll get it an economist 
for a usbased bank said tuesday 
a spokesman for the economy ministry said the ministry also 
believes that commercial banks and institutional lenders are 
reluctant but nevertheless will commit new funds 
an international monetary fund mission opened talks this week 
with the economy ministry and central bank about argentinas 
antiinflation plan and suspended interest payments on its 56 
billion foreign debt 
the nation reportedly is seeking loans totaling 42 billion 
from the imf and commercial banks plus a 500 million bridge loan 
to cover its foreign debt interest payments until it gets the imf 
money 
interest payments on argentinas foreign debt the thirdlargest 
in the developing world behind brazil and mexico will total about 
46 billion this year of which the government wants to borrow 
half 
the economy ministry spokesman acknowledged the government is 
behind in interest payments but would not say by how much 
the daily newspaper ambito financiero reported tuesday that 
arrearages totaled about 800 million including 450 million 90 
days or more overdue 
argentina is seeking a standby loan of about 12 billion from 
the imf to run through the end of the administration of president 
raul alfonsin in december 1989 according to the economy ministry 
the government doesnt want to have to negotiate anything in 
1989 the ministry spokesman said speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
national elections are set for next may and the opposition 
peronist party stands a good chance of ousting alfonsins radical 
civic union 
the ministry spokesman declined to comment on how much argentina 
wants to borrow from commercial banks citing the delicate nature 
of the talks but the us bank economist and the newspaper la 
nacion in an article published tuesday citing unnamed commercial 
bank sources said argentina is seeking approximately 3 billion in 
new bank funds 
central bank director daniel marx is to meet thursday with a 
steering committee of 11 us canadian european and japanese 
banks which represents the 250 to 300 banks holding about 39 
billion in outstanding loans to argentina 
the commercial loans were rescheduled last year giving 
argentina a 7year grace period on repayment of principal and 2 
billion in new funds the imf also agreed to contribute 13 
billion in standby funds 
but the imf and the banks withheld a combined 450 million that 
was to be disbursed this year because the alfonsin government did 
not meet agreedupon economic targets including levels of 
inflation and the budget deficit 
inflation in august probably will exceed julys 256 percent 
increase which brought the rise in the cost of living to 178 
percent for the first seven months of this year 
on aug 3 the alfonsin government devalued the austral by 114 
percent against the us dollar pledged to reduce the budget 
deficit lifted restrictions on imports and arranged with 
producers a program of voluntary price controls 
in a separate development argentina is seeking 750 million 
from the world bank that money would be used to help finance the 
reform of the banking system and reorient trade policy 
the world banks vice president for latin america shamid 
husain issued no statement before departing last week nor did the 
central bank but the economy ministry spokesman said tuesday 
there is not the slightest doubt the loan will be approved 
argentina also is seeking a 500 million bridge loan from a 
consortium led by the us treasury to cover interest payments on 
the foreign debt until argentina receives new funds from the imf

they were schooled in corporate buyouts by master 
dealmaker donald p kelly but two proteges of the beatrice co 
chairman say they also plan to actively manage their newly acquired 
stiffel co as they add to it 
james m snodgrass said tuesday he and steven s lindblad are 
a little more operationally oriented and a little less dealmaking 
oriented than kelly 
they plan to prove it as chairman and vicechairman 
respectively of stiffel a chicagobased manufacturer of 
brassplated lamps formerly owned by beatrice 
we both want to grow the stiffel co and do other acquisitions 
but we want to be more involved in running the business 
snodgrass said in a telephone interview 
snodgrass and lindblad did not disclose the amount their 
investor group paid to buy stiffel from american brands inc 
american brands based in greenwich conn acquired stiffel 
earlier this year in its 27 billion purchase of stiffels parent 
eii holdings inc a beatrice offshoot also headed at the time by 
kelly 
snodgrass 51 said one reason he and lindblad chose stiffel as 
their first acquisition was that as former executives of beatrice 
and eii they already had some knowledge of the companys 
operations 
the 50yearold stiffel has about 500 employees he said 
the men said kelly who will resign as chairman of chicagobased 
beatrice effective oct 1 played no direct role in their venture 
but snodgrass and lindblad who met while working for kelly at 
esmark inc in the early 1970s acknowledged his influence on this 
new direction in their professional lives 
i suppose since i worked for the man from 1971 forward if i 
wasnt influenced by him id be kind of dumb snodgrass said i 
suppose the common tie is the entrepreneurial orientation that don 
kelly brought to beatrice for those of us who worked for him 
lindblad 48 said he and snodgrass absorbed lessons in 
conglomeratebuilding during their 15 years of working together 
under kelly 
we have both done a lot of acquisitions and corporate 
divestment work in that period of time and it cant help but have 
some ruboff he said 
snodgrass and lindblad stayed with esmark for about a year after 
beatrice acquired it for 28 billion in 1984 leaving kelly on the 
outside 
in 1986 kelly won a takeover of beatrice taking the company 
private in a 62 billion deal backed by the new york buyout firm 
kohlberg kravis roberts amp co snodgrass and lindblad came back on 
board later that year 
snodgrass served as executive vice president of bci holdings 
corp and president of beatrice consumer durables group a nonfood 
division that went public as a part of eii in 1987 with stiffel as 
one of its holdings kelly made snodgrass president and chief 
executive officer of eii consumer products co eiis major 
operating subsidiary 
lindblad served with snodgrass as senior vice president and 
chief financial officer of eii consumer products before that he 
held the same titles in the beatrice consumer durables group

the 2 billion federallyassisted bailout of 
american savings amp loan association will not be the last such 
rescue in california home to 13 of the nations 20 biggest sampls 
but experts said most of the states large thrifts are in far 
better shape than american 
the trouble at american object of a bailout announced monday 
is more an indication of poor management and lax regulation than a 
sign that california thrifts overall are especially endangered 
analysts said tuesday 
however as in the industry nationwide more mergers and buyouts 
are expected among the states thrifts particularly smaller 
institutions that proliferated in the wake of deregulation in the 
early 1980s 
i think theres a trend toward consolidation said william 
davis chief deputy commissioner of the california department of 
savings and loans we have what i would consider to be an 
overcapacity in terms of the number of institutions to serve the 
public in california 
stocktonbased american the nations biggest insolvent thrift 
and secondlargest overall will be acquired by the robert m bass 
investment group of fort worth texas under a rescue orchestrated 
by the federal home loan bank board 
bass will inject 550 million into american and the bank board 
will put up 500 million in notes and an estimated 15 billion in 
cash over the next 10 years the bank board which will own 30 
percent of the new american pumped 250 million into the company 
tuesday 
the board also put american into a temporary receivership 
erasing the value of the 359 million shares of stock in 
irvinebased financial corp of america the holding company that 
owned american 
business continued uninterrupted at americans 180 california 
branches and federal insurance remained in force for all deposits 
william popejoy who has headed american and fca since 1984 
will leave fca but remain at the helm of american according to 
announcements by the bank board and the company 
fca directors scheduled a meeting for today to determine the 
companys future 
american is the nations secondbiggest sampl with more than 30 
billion in assets california boasts 13 of the countrys 20 sampls 
ranked by assets including no 1 home savings of america 
california also is home to 14 sampls troubled enough to be under 
direct supervision of the bank board and others that are being 
monitored for possible future action additionally 12 california 
thrifts have been sold or combined with stronger institutions since 
1985 according to the bank boards san francisco office 
most analysts emphasize that the problem institutions represent 
a minority of the industry nationwide in california the 14 
institutions under control of regulators have combined assets of 
46 billion while statewide industry assets total 350 billion 
american foundered analysts said largely because of toorapid 
growth and millions of dollars in loans on real estate in 
california texas and elsewhere that other institutions would not 
touch in contrast other big sampls lean far more heavily on 
socalled quality mortgages those on single family homes 
by and large the people running the major savings and loans 
in the state have gone through a number of cycles and on the whole 
are pretty conservative people said donald crowley who follows 
the industry for keefe bruyette and woods inc in san francisco 
the california industry is on a stronger footing than that in 
texas and oklahoma where the collapse of oildependent economies 
has been followed by wholesale sampl bailouts analysts said 
california they said continues enjoying a housing boom that has 
continued essentially unchecked since the 1950s and largely is 
responsible for growth of the states huge thrifts 
its sort of like the difference between standing on rock and 
standing on quicksand crowley said comparing the economies that 
support sampls in california and the oil patch

came amid low trading volume 
the last couple of days have been a false market said one 
dealer 
in addition weakness in the us dollar sparked worries that 
wall street might move lower later wednesday the new york markets 
performance tuesday gave little direction to london shares 
sharply lower crude oil prices triggered falls in oil shares

the six oil ministers of the gulf cooperation 
council nations four of whom represent key arab nations in opec 
will meet next month to review ways of stabilizing the world oil 
market a government news agency reported wednesday 
the meeting is scheduled for oct 16 the kuwait news agency 
said but gcc officials while acknowledging the ministers would 
meet declined to confirm the date 
earlier reports had said the meeting would take place sept 17 
and 18 
kuna said production by the 13nation organization of petroleum 
exporting countries and the restoration of quota discipline would 
be key topics at the gcc talks in advance of an opec ministerial 
session scheduled for nov 21 in vienna 
the gcc includes saudi arabia kuwait qatar and the united arab 
emirates which are opec members and bahrain and oman which are 
not 
kuna said the four opec members would coordinate stands on a 
number of issues of concern to opec especially with respect to 
the future production level of opec and the necessity of member 
states adhering to individual production quotas to guarantee 
preservation of stability of the official price per barrel of oil 
on the world market 
overall opec production in august was estimated at 20 million 
barrels a day nearly 35 million barrels over its selfimposed 
output ceiling this has helped depress prices below opecs 
benchmark of 18 dollars a barrel 
the uae has refused to accept a quota of 948000 barrels a 
day and demanded a 15 millionbarrel quota that is about the 
level of its current production 
kuwait backed by saudi arabia rejects venezuelas wish to keep 
condensate gases liquids condensed from natural gas during 
production out of oil quotas 
the gcc group along with other opec members hope to settle the 
issue of production by iraq and iran now that their 8yearold war 
has ground to a halt 
tehran has reportedly rejected proposals that iran and iraq be 
allotted equal production quotas in a bid to curb iraqs unbridled 
output of around 28 million barrels a day 
iraq has refused to accept a quota of 15 million barrels a day 
and demanded parity with irans 23 millionbarrel quota 
opec secretarygeneral subroto recently visited baghdad and 
tehran and indicated that the issue could be solved through a 
revamped opec production policy aimed at pushing up oil prices to 
around 18 a barrel 
subroto has also visited other opec states including kuwait 
saudi arabia the uae and qatar

a 130000 rollsroyce corniche convertible 
turned out to be a lemon but a federal judge ruled the british 
carmaker owes the detroit lawyer who bought it only legal fees and 
court costs no refund 
rolls wasnt privy to the contract a robert zeffs signed with 
the dealer tamaroff buick of southfield us district judge anna 
diggs taylor ruled a week ago she ordered rolls to pay zeffs 
5530777 in court fees and costs 
zeffs bought the 1981 tudor red car in march 1983 it came with 
300 miles on the odometer an english leather interior circassian 
walnut on the dash and a paint job advertised as glowing more like 
marble than metal 
but after zeff added the car to his classic collection he began 
to notice problems with flaking paint 
repairs by tamaroff were followed with complaints about 
additional problems such as a nonworking gearshift indicator light 
zeff took the car to florida in december 1983 and got 
rollsroyce and a palm beach dealer into the picture 
finally a rolls official commissioned a new finish for the car 
to be done in florida the corniches 14 to 20 coats of paint 
primer and filler were removed to bare metal but without zeffs 
consent 
when he learned of the job he told rolls in effect to keep 
the car he wanted his money back 
because the car was inadequate to start with and a proper 
refinishing could only be completed in england taylor found that 
rolls had violated its limited warranty and committed fraud 
however zeff could not sue rolls alone to revoke his acceptance 
of the car because he bought it from tamaroff taylor ruled 
because the judge ordered rolls to pay tamaroffs legal bills 
too the dealership feels vindicated said tamaroff general manager 
tony jerome 
we werent the problem jerome said 
zeff meanwhile said he expects rolls to keep the case alive 
i cant see them not appealing this he said they cant 
let a judgment of fraud stand

two companies allegedly controlled by the 
taiwanese businessman charged with insider trading in the united 
states asked a judge wednesday for release of 12 million from 
their hong kong bank accounts 
standard chartered plc a british bank has refused to release 
the deposits at its local branch claiming the money was paid to 
us authorities last month to comply with a new york court order 
attorneys for the bank said 
taiwanese businessman fred c lee was charged by the us 
securities and exchange commission in june with trading on inside 
information allegedly provided by stephen wang an analyst at the 
new york investment bank morgan stanley amp co 
the two men allegedly made 19 million from illegal trading 
the court hearing was scheduled to continue thursday 
lee is president of nanus asia co and southridge international 
inc two companies based in the british virgin islands according 
to solicitor charles wong 
in a hearing before hong kong supreme court justice gordon 
cruden a lawyer for the two companies argued that the new york 
court order was not enforceable in hong kong and that the bank 
should pay them the money in their accounts 
the new york orders have no effect whatsoever on the 
plaintiffs right to have their money back attorney martin lee 
said the accounts were opened in hong kong and hong kong law is 
clearly the proper law 
lee also argued that if the hong kong court failed to order 
standard chartered to hand over the companies funds overseas 
investors would lose confidence in the british colonys banking 
system 
arguing for standard chartered attorney michael thomas said the 
bank couldnt turn the deposits over to nanus and southridge 
because the charges of insider trading filed against lee indicated 
the funds may have been obtained through a breach of trust and 
therefore did not legally belong to the taiwanese businessman 
thomas said that if standard chartered had turned the money over 
to the two companies instead of the us court the bank could have 
become liable for claims from any victim of alleged insider trading 
standard chartered has been caught up in a certain amount of 
crossfire between courts in the united states and hong kong 
thomas said adding that there was a serious risk of the bank 
falling victim to double jeopardy 
thomas said funds held in the name of nanus and southridge had 
been treated as belonging to lee because the companies were 
incorporated cash boxes serving solely as the businessmans 
nominees 
quoting from the testimony of a standard chartered officer 
thomas said that prior to opening the company accounts lee had 
used a number of personal accounts to finance his us securities 
trading 
lee did not appear in court one of his solicitors said the 
businessman was in taiwan

the 43000 white marble panels covering the 
outside of the 80story amoco corp headquarters building will 
temporarily be strapped down until tests determine if they must be 
replaced because of buckling officials say 
after a buckling problem was revealed in march the company 
attached a pair of twoinch stainless steel straps to each panel on 
the southwest corner of the skyscraper 
that corner experiences the toughest beating from wind and 
weather changes and buckling found in some panels caused concern 
they could fall off officials have said 
some architects said that all building panels would have to be 
replaced but amoco officials said they want more time to find a 
solution 
if the building is to be reclad it will be covered with a 
material as close to the color of the original marble as we can 
get said shelby pierce amocos manager of engineering in charge 
of the project 
some materials the company might consider are granite a heavier 
marble or aluminum officials said 
right now we plan to keep all of our options open said 
pierce well strap the building get the test results evaluate 
them and then decide whats the best longterm solution the 
building does not pose a shortterm safety problem 
the straps are not visible to the casual observer thompson said

overriding the wishes of their 
leadership trade union delegates wednesday voted narrowly to 
boycott a new government program to train the unemployed for other 
jobs 
the vote at the annual conference of the trades union congress 
the umbrella organization of 84 trade unions was 4577 million to 
4042 million a tiny margin that reflected the split in british 
organized labor over the controversial government program union 
chiefs wield huge voting blocks based on membership 
neil kinnock leader of the opposition labor party had joined 
the tuc leadership in appealing against a boycott saying it would 
portray the labor movement as uncaring about the jobless 
but the proboycott camp claimed that the 15billionpound 
255 billion employment training scheme launched monday was 
designed to exploit the jobless as cheap labor 
persons joining the program will get a weekly bonus of 10 to 20 
pounds 17 to 34 dollars a week on top of their unemployment 
checks plus money for books transport and equipment and a 
taxfree 200pound 340dollar bonus if they complete the 
sixmonth course 
the basic weekly unemployment payment is 3275 pounds 5560 
plus subsidized rent the new program is aimed primarily at 
retraining the 600000 longterm unemployed among britains 23 
million jobless 
supporting a boycott ron todd leader of the transport workers 
union said the government is looking for a hole to hide half a 
million unemployed to remove them from the unemployment court 
before the next election 
engineers union president bill jordan backed the program 
saying it was imperfect but the only one we have got 
we have no alternative to offer the unemployed no training 
to offer no jobs to offer only our help we cannot turn round and 
say that we the trade union barons decree that you cannot join 
these schemes said jordan 
the resolution adopted at the weeklong conference in this 
seaside resort called for an immediate boycott but the tuc 
leadership later said it would take effect over two years to 
accommodate unions already cooperating with retraining programs 
some intepreted the vote as a slap to kinnock especially since 
the proboycott lobby included powerful union chiefs such as todd 
whom kinnock is counting on to back him against a challenge to his 
leadership at next months labor party convention 
but kinnock said the twoyear stay of execution would allow 
unions to press for improvements 
the vote was not a bad result at all he told reporters 
these two years can have a very productive outcome

federal attorneys say they have no objection 
to limited participation by the arkansas democrat in a court case 
involving a proposed joint operating agreement between detroits 
two daily newspapers 
in a court filing tuesday attorneys for the civil division of 
the justice department said the department did not object to 
participation by little rock newspapers inc the company that 
publishes the democrat provided that participation is limited to 
issues already raised 
but the attorneys asked that an affidavit submitted by democrat 
publisher walter e hussman jr be stricken from the record because 
it goes beyond the scope of this case 
at issue in the litigation is an injunction issued aug 17 by 
us district judge joyce hens green that bars a joint operating 
agreement between the detroit news owned by the gannett co and 
the detroit free press owned by knightridder 
gannett owns the arkansas gazette the democrats competition in 
little rock the democrat last week submitted a brief in the 
detroit case as a party with an indirect interest in the outcome 
arguing against the joa 
attorneys for the detroit news last week urged the federal court 
to ignore the democrats arguments saying the brief by little rock 
newspapers wasnt filed on time raised questions outside the scope 
of the case and would involve the court in an analysis of pricing 
practices by the two little rock newspapers 
hussman said the company he heads filed the brief because he 
believes gannett is trying to stifle competition in newspaper 
markets through the use of joas 
hussmans affidavit contended approval by meese of the detroit 
joa altered the nature of such agreements from a vehicle for 
preserving journalistic competition where it would otherwise not 
exist into a vehicle to assist in eliminating competitive 
newspapers even where both newspapers could otherwise survive 
according to the justice department brief little rock 
newspapers filings show the company seeks to address legal and 
factual issues well beyond the scope of this litigation including 
matters pertaining to what it portrays as the competition between 
its newspaper the arkansas democrat with the arkansas gazette 
owned by gannett 
these matters have no bearing on this case and the facts which 
little rock newspapers seeks to introduce form no part of the 
administrative record the brief said 
the detroit joa approved by former attorney general edwin meese 
on aug 8 would be the largest such agreement in history the 
temporary injunction against the agreement was requested by 
michigan citizens for an independent press a group of advertisers 
readers and employees 
the agreement would merge the production and business operations 
of the news and free press while keeping the newspapers news and 
editorial departments separate 
the newspaper preservation act allows such partial mergers when 
one of the newspapers involved is in danger of failing

market pessimism about opecs ability to 
restrain its production has pushed oil futures prices to nearly a 
twoyear low but experts say american drivers should see little 
benefit at the gas pump because of strong demand for the refined 
product 
on the new york mercantile exchange today the october contract 
for delivery of west texas intermediate the benchmark grade of 
us crude was down 9 cents a barrel at 1415 at late morning 
the contract dropped 55 cents a barrel on tuesday crude prices 
have not traded that low on the exchange since october 1986 when 
they reached 1373 per barrel 
responding to the drop several major us oil companies 
announced tuesday and today that they were cutting the official 
price they pay for west texas intermediate in the spot market 
futures contracts for refined oil products traded on the 
exchange also continued tuesdays decline wholesale unleaded 
gasoline for october delivery had fallen 033 cent a gallon to 
4220 cents at late morning while wholesale heating oil for 
october was down 023 cent at 4148 
the markets skepticism about the ability of the 13nation 
organization of petroleum exporting countries to trim its output 
has deepened in recent days after initial optimism about 
cooperation within the cartel resulting from the ceasefire between 
members iran and iraq 
opec secretarygeneral subroto recently capped off a series of 
meetings with oil producers by visiting officials in iran and iraq 
and tried to persuade iran to allow iraq a higher production quota 
but subroto made little headway in his efforts to win cooperation 
among opec members for curbing overall output 
there just doesnt seem to be any hope right now said linda 
simard an oil futures broker at the investment firm drexel burnham 
lambert inc subroto didnt seem to be getting anywhere 
the middle east economic survey an influential weekly published 
in nicosia cyprus reported last week that total opec production 
was estimated at 20 million barrels a day more than 35 million 
barrels over the cartels official ceiling 
the ceasefire between the persian gulf rivals after eight years 
of fighting frees iran and iraq to rebuild their wardamaged oil 
industries raising the prospect of a fresh surge in oil production 
and a fall in crude prices 
a key to controlling any increased production analysts say is 
opecs ability to bring iraq back under its discipline 
iraq during the war past ignored its opec daily production quota 
of 154 million barrels demanding a share equal to irans 237 
million barrels a day iraq pumps an estimated 28 million barrels 
a day analysts say 
theres too much oil right now opec is showing a complete 
lack of discipline said peter beutel assistant director of the 
energy group at elders futures inc 
the price slide will not necessarily mean a break for drivers 
filling up at the pump while crude oil price declines often bring 
price cuts in gasoline that is refined from crude gasoline demand 
now is unusually strong in the united states and supplies are 
fairly tight analysts say 
we really dont expect a significant impact to be felt on 
gasoline prices said william veno director of oil market 
analysis at data resources inc a consulting firm based in 
lexington mass 
several big oil refiners meanwhile cut the prices they are 
willing to pay for west texas intermediate exxon corp and chevron 
corp reduced their posted price by 25 cents a barrel to 1450 
texaco inc sun co phillips petroleum co marathon petroleum 
corp diamond shamrock rampm inc conoco inc and citgo petroleum

grain and soybean futures opened mostly lower 
today on the chicago board of trade in a slight technical 
correction after five straight days of rising prices analysts said 
despite the early selloff experts said underlying fundamentals 
remained bullish for the crop futures especially for the wheat 
market which faces tightening world supplies 
the floor leader is wheat said richard feltes director of 
commodity research with refco inc a large chicagobased futures 
brokerage firm 
wheat futures are approaching the years highs set on july 5 and 
many observers expect prices to rally through those levels 
soybeans and corn also may rally in the long term but 
increasing harvest pressure should keep a lid on those markets 
during the next month or two feltes said 
i think the mood of the soybean trade is described as 
cautious nearterm bullish longterm he said 
in early trading wheat was 1 cents lower to cent higher with 
the contract for delivery in september at 408 a bushel corn was 
1 cents to 1 cents lower with september at 292 a bushel oats

industrial designer j gordon 
lippincott says he and his wife of 51 years edith often play a 
game when they travel abroad 
on the way in from the airport they see how quickly they can 
spot some corporate symbol that lippincott had a hand in designing 
the game seldom takes very long 
the lanky 79yearold lippincott who left the consulting firm 
that still bears his name 20 years ago for an assortment of other 
pursuits says he had a hand in developing symbols known the world 
over for companies such as cocacola co american express co 
general mills inc and campbell soup co 
but these days lippincott recalls his firms work on a car that 
has all but disappeared from the landscape his company helped with 
the styling of the tucker automobile 41 years ago only about 50 of 
the models were ever built 
lippincotts role in the project surfaced as attention has been 
drawn to the cars by the recentlyreleased movie tucker the man 
and his dream 
lippincott said his firm was about 4 years old when the aspiring 
automaker preston tucker stopped by one morning in 1947 tucker 
wanted a professional design firm to help him style an auto for 
the future one that had an engine in the rear and safety 
features like seat belts and popout windows and could travel 120 
miles per hour 
i didnt let on at first but wow did we ever lippincott 
recalled recently as visitors pored over the scrapbooks he keeps at 
the modern breezy house he built 16 years ago on a 40acre estate 
beside the farm river 
in those days every designer wanted to design a car he said 
the movie recounts how tucker developed the car and his travails 
with the securities and exchange commission over how he financed it 
the movie makes no reference to outside designers but 
lippincott said he doesnt mind he liked the movie adding that 
actor jeff bridges did a good job of capturing tuckers spirit 
in playing tucker in the movie 
lippincott said tucker already had a good idea of what he wanted 
to do by the time he came by for help he said tuckers chief 
designer alex tremulis had drawings and a small scalemodel of 
what the car would look like 
it included a front headlamp that swiveled as the wheels were 
turned 
lippincott said tucker wanted some advice from a design firm on 
the outer styling of the car he said he never knew precisely what 
led tucker to the firms midtown new york offices 
tucker showed up alone he brought no drawings of the car on 
which a lot of work had already been done he had no appointment 
but lippincott saw him anyway and liked his brashness his 
selfassurance his energy 
he was an immensely likable and persuasive person 
lippincott said 
lippincotts partner walter margulies insisted on being paid 
every week in advance and tucker agreed the decision meant the 
firm was one of the few associated with the automobile that made 
money from the venture tucker lost more than 20 million making 
the cars 
lippincott sent half of the offices 10 designers hal 
bergstrom phil egan read viemeister bud steinhilber and tucker 
madawick to chicago to work on the project they created a 
fullscale clay model in nine weeks beside another fullscale model 
tremulis was working on himself 
once the models were finished lippincott said it was left to 
tucker and tremulis to assemble the prototype and the cars 
themselves lippincotts involvement was over 
there is some disagreement about the extent of the lippincott 
contribution to the final version 
lippincott said his teams contribution is evident in the 
styling in the both the front and back of the car but conceded it 
is hard to pinpoint responsibility when many designers have a hand 
in a project 
tremulis who lives in california said the design team was good 
but that the car was 95 percent complete before the outside team 
began working on it 
egan who was part of the lippincott team and later returned to 
work for tremulis on interior design said from his home in 
california that tremulis deserves most of the credit for the car 
design but said the front and back of the car reflect the 
lippincott teams work 
lippincotts design advice was avidly sought by companies 
ranging from flashlight producers to steelmaking giants he helped 
chrysler corp with a corporate logo years later he sold his 
interest in lippincott amp margulies in the late 1960s 
he said he learned his most important design lesson in the 
mid40s when the bacardi rum makers asked his firm to redesign 
their label 
the firm proposed a festive approach that used a different color 
for each letter of the name 
lippincott said family politely listened to the presentation 
but offered no response pressed for a reaction the head of the 
family said it had been most helpful 
we have gone to the best package designer in the united 
states and you have confirmed my belief that we should not change 
our label the man said 
lippincott said the lesson was clear and he never forgot it 
when you have an entrenched brand identity proceed with great 
caution

what has the surge of american exports 
meant to tom collier who runs a small company that makes and sells 
screws 
im taking aspirins every day now he said 
but hes not complaining his company camtech industries inc 
has doubled its sales this year increased its employment to 15 
from 12 and become somebody in the world of international trade 
at sentry group a leading maker of fireresistant safes and 
containers the boom has made a longoverdue foray into foreign 
markets a resounding success sales there doubled last year and are 
expected to triple this year said company vice president doug 
brush 
our international business has become our top priority he 
said 
there are many similar stories in rochester which has become 
one of the busiest export centers in the country and the leading 
exporting city in new york 
the city is the home of eastman kodak co the nations 
ninthlargest exporter and other large exporters like xerox corp 
which has its largest plant in the area and bausch amp lomb inc 
but its the small to mediumsize companies that get the most 
gain from current economic conditions 
it never ceases to amaze the number of new companies getting 
into exporting said martin wilner of leading forwarders of 
rochester a company that finds overseas shipping space for 
exporters 
ive been in the business 28 years and we are always coming up 
with new clients especially this year wilner said 
commerce secretary c william verity said in july that for the 
first five months of this year american exports have jumped 31 
percent compared with the same period in 1987 
in june the most recent month for which statistics are 
available the federal government said exports totaled 268 
billion the third highest monthly sales figure on record 
last year rochester and the surrounding area exported a record 
63 billion worth of products which is more than the overall 
totals from 30 different states 
only 10 states had higher export sales than rochester last year 
california led the nation with 275 billion followed by texas at 
197 billion and new york at 155 billion 
exports are more than just a good thing or a nice thing 
said colby chandler kodaks chairman and chief executive officer 
i think it the export boom means that theyre an integral part 
of business a vital part 
he said that the current business conditions and emphasis on 
exporting and foreign trade in rochester and beyond will not 
turn backwards because exporting and importing have become 
household terms in business planning 
two sure signs that the exporting boom is in full force at 
least in rochester according to fritz grasberger director of the 
center for governmental research are an increase in workers 
logging overtime and in a shortage of workers for lowpaying jobs 
workers are in demand because manufacturers are trying to take 
advantage of new opportunities overseas said grasberger who 
heads the notforprofit local research firm 
the average work week in march in the rochester area climbed to 
a record 454 hours its highest level in at least 30 years the 
national average for hours worked in a week is about 39 grasberger 
said 
this is the best economic environment ive ever seen said 
bill ramage a labor economist at the state labor department in 
rochester hes been following the rochester economy since 1978 
he said the areas manufacturers have stopped tightening their 
belts and trimming work forces partly because of the weak dollar 
and the areas service sector continues to grow 
kodak rochesters largest employer by far offers a good 
illustration of how the value of the dollar can affect main street 
usa 
when the dollar began to rise in the early part of this decade 
kodaks profits were pared by lost pennies and then nickels and 
then dimes on nearly every roll of film it sold overseas 
the dollars rise meant kodak would have to charge more money 
for its products in foreign markets in order to make the same 
profit but raising prices in yen marks or pounds would send 
customers away from kodak film to competitors brands 
so in an effort to hang onto its customers kodak didnt raise 
prices and hoped the dollar wouldnt keep getting stronger and keep 
costing the company money 
from 1981 into early 86 we estimate that we lost 4 billion 
in profits said kodak spokesman henry kaska 
in addition the company was forced to lay off more than 10000 
employees nearly half of them in rochester and suffer the first 
quarterly financial loss in company history 
the cutbacks were difficult for this city to cope with 
especially since rochesters conventional wisdom included thata 
job at kodak was a job for life 
but in 1986 the dollar began to fall and kodak began making 
more money from its overseas sales simply converting foreign 
profits into dollars at more favorable exchange rates meant 90 
million in extra profits in 1986 195 million in 1987 and a 
projected 260 million this year if the dollar remains at its 
current level

the giant washington public power supply 
system fraud trial opened today as defense attorneys argued 
unsuccessfully that the judges trial rules would favor the 
plaintiffs 
defense attorney kenneth kieffer took issue with a portion of 
us district judge william brownings trial protocol that says 
once the examination of a witness has begun it will continue 
until direct and crossexamination by all parties on all issues 
has concluded 
keiffer said he feared the defense would be unable to put its 
case in front of the jury in a logical manner if plaintiffs have 
the ability to set the order in which witnesses will appear 
plaintiffs attorney tom barr representing chemical bank of new 
york noted the judges protocol allowed an exception if the 
witness elects to appear at the trial rather than be questioned via 
a direct television hookup 
browning has allowed the use of a satellite hookup in the case 
because many witnesses are in the northwest the judge denied the 
defense motion asking for a change in the protocol 
browning has ordered that 20 jurors be seated in the trial 
which could last more than a year because it is a civil case only 
six jurors may eventually be called upon to issue a verdict jury 
selection is scheduled to begin thursday 
the case shifted for trial from washington state to tucson 
because of pretrial publicity arose out of the sale of 225 
billion in bonds to build two nuclear power plants 
the plants wppss nos 4 and 5 were scrapped in january 1982 
after being only partially built in 1983 wppss defaulted on the 
bonds after the washington supreme court ruled most of the 88 
northwest public utilities investing in the projects had signed 
illegal contracts with the power project consortium 
the default with 40000 bond buyers left holding the bag was 
the biggest in the history of the municipal bond market of those 
bond purchasers more than 24000 have filed claims including 
current bondholders represented by chemical bank of new york and 
original buyers who retain a fraud claim though they have sold 
their bonds 
in addition to the number of plaintiffs other big figures in 
the case include the more than 100 attorneys the length of time to 
trial and legal fees preparing for trial more than 150 million 
the case could have been even bigger 
dozens of defendants originally numbering more than 100 have 
dropped out during the past year with settlements totaling about 
350 million much of that was paid by insurance companies 
left are one oregon and 20 washington public utilities which 
own a 67 percent share in the two nuclear plants two engineering 
firms and a financial advisory firm 
the 21 utilities serve about 650000 customers who would 
possibly have to bear the brunt of a jury ruling against 
defendants utilities representing 500000 other homes in the 
northwest have settled 
settlements were being made almost up to the time of trial 
holiday or not an agreement between plaintiff attorneys and the 
seattle engineering firm of rw beck was announced labor day by 
settlement master junius hoffman a university of arizona law 
professor appointed by browning more than 18 months ago to try to 
encourage settlements 
the case also lacks some of the big money defendants in the 
original lawsuits wall street bond underwriters paid 92 million 
to settle their share 
the bonneville power administration a federal power marketing 
agency in the northwest was reluctantly dropped from the case by 
browning he said the law was clear that bpa officials had acted 
properly in encouraging construction of wppss plants nos 4 and 5 
wppss attempted to build five nuclear power plants in the 1970s 
to serve northwest customers of those one plant wppss no 2 at 
the hanford nuclear reservation is operating 
two others wppss nos 1 and 3 were mothballed under 
construction delays five years ago 
bonds sold to build those three plants are paid for through bpa 
however plants nos 4 and 5 never enjoyed bpa protection

getting a banker to sign what essentially is a standstill 
agreement is dicey because the banking community staunchly 
resists becoming involved in exclusive arrangements 
its extremely difficult to get them to sit on their hands 
because theyre all looking for business and theyre not satisfied 
to do business with just one company because tomorrow theyll be 
out on the street looking for more deals said katarincic the 
lawyer 
amoco corp vice chairman james cozad who sits on usgs board 
noted that the acquisition and leveraged buyout business has 
been a financial bonanza for investment banks obviously the desire 
or opportunity to make substantial profits puts a lot of pressure 
on ethics 
investment bankers bristle at the suggestion their moral fiber 
may be compromised 
bankers have been hammered at for quite some time for being 
fee chasers but the critics lose sight of the fact that we are in 
the client business and our integrity and credibility are the 
things we sell said one investment banker who asked not to be 
identified because of the sensitivity of the issue well have a 
short life if we get a reputation of not honoring our commitments 
investment bankers also argue that a good portion of the 
information they get from a company is in the public domain anyway 
but in addition to crucial nonpublic information talks with 
company executives provide bankers with a more subjective view of a 
company their market position their own assessments of their 
business strategy and personnel their own valuation of assets 
theres nothing like speaking to a ceo and hearing whats 
really going on said securities lawyer paul fischer a 
halfhour conversation can be very illuminating 
as amocos cozad can attest in certain instances investment 
banks need a lot of private information and that information 
indeed would be of great benefit to somebody outside our company 
besides investment firms commercial banks are surfacing more 
frequently in mampa deals as they try to expand beyond their 
traditional yet decreasingly profitable role as lenders 
this new set of players has outraged some companies interco 
inc for example assailed chase manhattan bank in august for 
agreeing to help finance a hostile takeover bid 
chase had served as intercos primary international banker and 
had participated with other banks in providing the company with a 
150 million revolving credit agreement among other services 
while interco did not file a lawsuit a spokeswoman said the 
company feels abandoned by chase and is in the process of 
severing its ties with the bank 
banks and investment firms are not the only alleged culprits 
lawyers have also been accused of using confidential information 
about previous clients earlier this year murray ohio 
manufacturing co found itself the target of a hostile bid by ab 
electrolux of sweden advising electrolux was the new york law firm 
sullivan amp cromwell the same firm that helped murray ohio fashion 
its antitakeover strategy a year earlier 
john l duncan murray ohios president and chief executive 
officer said in a court hearing that he learned about sullivan amp 
cromwells involvement when he received a letter from electrolux on 
the law firms stationery 
i was absolutely shocked i couldnt believe that they would 
be representing electrolux he said 
while a threejudge panel agreed sullivan amp cromwell had a 
conflict of interest it ruled there had been no transfer of 
confidential information 
the conflict problem takes a new twist when advisers take equity 
positions in companies and becoming investors themselves 
koppers co spearheaded a public campaign against shearson 
earlier this year because the investment house was participating as 
an equity partner in a hostile bid with britains beazer plc 
officials from pennsylvania rallied round and terminated what 
they said amounted to a 7 billion business relationship with 
shearson ultimately the pittsburghbased company agreed to be 
acquired by beazer for 18 billion 
katarincic who represented koppers called it a casebook 
situation that already has had an impact 
i know a number of deals where people were thinking of taking 
an equity position in hostile tender offers who have backed away 
in the wake of koppers confrontation he said 
to avoid conflicts in mergers and acquisitions securities 
lawyer john stoppelman suggests a code of professional 
responsibility or ethics similar to what governs lawyers he said 
a code would establish benchmark standards to guide relationships 
and therefore serve as a stronger test for liability 
congress is considering legislation meanwhile that would 
shorten the length of time investors have to disclose significant 
stakes in companies 
several executives said the recent highprofile confrontations 
may be what is needed to send a warning signal to bankers 
i dont know if it will deter them but i think all investment 
banking firms are becoming more sensitive to the issue of 
conflicting interests usgs miller said

a former junior securities analyst pleaded 
guilty today to the first criminal charges stemming from what the 
government has called the secondbiggest insider trading scandal in 
wall street history 
stephen suikuan wang jr 24 a onetime intern of the 
prominent brokerage morgan stanley amp co also pleaded guilty to a 
single charge in connection with his role in a previously 
undisclosed insider trading scheme 
wang wearing a charcoal gray suit and spectacles entered his 
guilty pleas before us district judge kevin duffy in manhattan 
who set sentencing for oct 19 if convicted of all three counts 
wang faces a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison and 750000 in 
fines 
was there any doubt in your mind that what you were doing was 
wrong duffy asked wang who stood during the proceeding in 
manhattan federal court he replied there was no doubt in my 
mind 
the charges were announced earlier today by us attorney 
rudolph w giuliani who said that from june 1987 to july 1988 
wang participated in an insider trading scheme with taiwaneseborn 
businessman fred c lee 
giuliani said the scheme involved trading in the securities of 
more than 14 companies involved in mergers and takeovers where 
morgan stanley played a role 
lee who has residences in taiwan hong kong and the united 
states has been said by the securities and exchange commission to 
have traded stocks on the tips provided by wang and netted at least 
19 million in illicit profits he allegedly shared at least 
200000 of the money with wang 
the sec has frozen the assets of both men and sought repayment 
of the 19 million plus triple damages for a total of 76 million 
that would be the secondlargest amount seized by the sec in an 
insider trading case since master speculator ivan boesky 
surrendered 100 million nearly two years ago 
giuliani also said that in addition to the scheme with lee wang 
was charged with participating in an earlier scheme to engage in 
insider trading with an individual living in the chicago area 
starting in june 1986 when wang started working at morgan stanley 
the us attorney declined to further identify the individual in 
the second scheme but said the person was not one of wangs 
relatives 
giuliani said wang would cooperate with the government and that 
the investigation is continuing an indication that others might be 
charged 
earlier today wang pleaded innocent to one count each of mail 
fraud wire fraud and securities fraud before us magistrate 
barbara lee in manhattan but the move was a technical prelude to 
his subsequent guilty plea 
under federal criminal procedure guilty pleas cannot be entered 
before us magistrates and the move is often an indication that a 
defendant has negotiated a plea agreement with prosecutors 
the us magistrate set wangs bail at 250000

grain and soybean futures prices closed mixed 
wednesday on the chicago board of trade as profittaking and 
harvest pressure weakened markets buoyed by rumors of new export 
demand analysts said 
wheat finished slightly higher but below the days highs which 
matched the years top prices for december and march deliveries 
rumors that the soviet union had purchased 2 million metric tons of 
subsidized us wheat supported the market analysts said 
the wheat shows excellent strength its acting very well 
said john frazier grain specialist with balfour maclaine corp in 
chicago 
soybeans ended mixed due to pressure from the advancing harvest 
many farmers are cleaning out their bins and selling last years 
soybeans to make room for the new crop analysts said soybeans for 
november delivery hit 905 a bushel during the session but closed 
below 9 
corn finished mostly lower in the absence of influential news 
but rumors of export sales limited losses frazier said 
at the close wheat was 1 cents to 2 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in september at 412 a bushel corn was 3 
cents lower to cent higher with september at 292 a bushel oats 
were unchanged to 1 cents lower with september at 269 a bushel

the irish high court on wednesday confirmed an 
injunction obtained by pernod ricard sa preventing fii fyffes plc 
from disposing of its 2004percent holding in takeover target 
irish distillers group plc 
the high court sitting in dublin said it would reach a final 
decision on the matter oct 6 
irish distillers irelands largest distiller is the target of 
competing takeover offers from friendly suitor pernod ricard a 
french liquor concern and hostile bidder grand metropolitan plc a 
british liquor company 
grand metropolitan has made a sweetened offer of 332 million 
irish punts the equivalent of 479 million or 525 irish pence a 
share for irish distillers 
pernods offer which has been approved by the irish distillers 
board of directors is for 285 million irish punts or 450 irish 
pence a share 
the stake that fii fyffes an irish fruit importer holds in 
irish distillers is seen as crucial to the outcome of the takeover 
battle 
pernod claims a pledge by fii fyffes last week to sell pernod 
its irish distillers shares should stand although grand 
metropolitan subsequently came back with its higher offer 
irish distillers said in a statement its shareholders should 
know that if the high court upholds pernods injunction the french 
company will have above 50 percent of irish distillers stock 
including the fii fyffes stake 
in the meantime the board is not yet in a position to advise 
shareholders as to what action they should take in connection with 
their shares irish distillers said 
irish distillers stock shot up 49 pence to 415 pence a share on 
londons stock exchange wednesday afternoon after trading resumed 
following a twoday suspension at irish distillers request 
irish distillers products include irish whiskey brands

banks and debtor nations should renegotiate 
existing loans rather than seek new ones to help ease the 1 
trillion third world debt problem a panel of top bankers 
economists and labor leaders urged in a report released wednesday 
the 39page report by the economic policy council of the united 
nations association departs from the plan of former treasury 
secretary james a baker iii which suggested pumping more money 
into struggling nations to get them back on their feet and attract 
foreign investments 
the baker plan had helped bring more money into a number of less 
developed countries over the past two years but una panel said 
that was mainly because interest rates were lower making 
debtservicing costs more manageable 
large newlending programs may be difficult to secure under 
current market conditions the report said 
many commercial banks have become reluctant to issue more loans 
after some debtor countries such as brazil stopped making loan 
payments banks suffered huge losses last year after adding to 
their loanloss reserves to cover the shaky third world debt 
in addition many banks are now faced with new capital adequacy 
requirements and a large block of problem loans to debtor 
countries makes raising capital difficult and expensive the 
report noted 
the report said restructuring loans so payments are reduced will 
not only reduce outstanding claims against a country but aid in its 
economic recovery 
the report also urges debtor countries to undertake domestic 
reforms to sustain economic growth 
economic success over a period of time also requires a level 
of public confidence that grows out of efficient uncorrupt 
leadership and a political system that is reponsive to the popular 
will it said 
among its other suggestions the una panel strongly urged 
congress to increase the us contribution to the multinational 
world bank which provides funding to third world countries 
the bank wants the united states to pledge about 70 million a 
year over the next six years for a badly needed increase in its 
capital so far about 140 of the 151 governments that own the bank 
have decided to contribute 
the una panel said talks should continue regularly between 
multinational institutions like the world bank commercial banks 
and debtor countries 
its been an impression that there is more and more debt 
fatigue on the part of the key players said anthony salomon 
former president of the new york federal reserve bank and 
cochairman of the una panel you will not see or hear one 
concrete blackandwhite plan 
besides salomon others serving on the 27member panel which 
began reviewing the international debt problem eight months ago 
included rodney wagner vice chairman of morgan guaranty trust and 
panel cochairman tom johnson president of chemical bank pedro 
malan executive director of the world bank frederick getzelman 
executive vice president of philadelphia national bank henry 
kaufman economist and president of henry kaufman co and albert

members of congress expressed concern 
wednesday that americas electronics industry could suffer 
irreparably if it is left behind in the race to develop a new 
highquality television system 
the result they said could cost the country in many ways an 
even higher trade deficit and thousands of jobs lost as well as 
the loss of potential military medical consumer and other 
applications that are expected to come with development of the 
technology 
rep edward j markey dmass chairman of the 
telecommunications subcommittee asked electronics industry trade 
associations to submit reports to the panel by january outlining 
steps the government could take to ensure american involvement in 
highdefinition tv 
suggestions have ranged from antitrust exemptions for us 
companies involved in research and development on highdefinition 
tv to appropriating pentagon funds for research on it because of 
the potential military applications of the technology he said 
over the last decade the united states has shifted from a major 
supplier to a net importer of electronics products he noted 
hdtv could make a bad situation worse markey said at the 
final of three hearings on highdefinition tv called hdtv 
highdefinition tv produces clearer brighter images on a wider 
tv screen with highquality sound the japanese have been 
developing hdtv for nearly 20 years and the europeans have been 
working on their own system for several years both systems are 
incompatible with us television broadcasting 
the federal communications commission last week set preliminary 
guidelines that will allow research to proceed toward establishing 
an american hdtv system under the fcc guidelines a us system 
must be able to be received on existing tv sets so current 
equipment would not become obsolete but to receive improved 
picture quality viewers would have to buy a new tv set 
richard elkus jr chairman of the prometrix corp and 
testifying for the american electronics association said advanced 
tv offers the us electronics industry an opportunity to rebound 
in a market projected to reach 20 billion in us sales and 40 
billion worldwide by the year 2007 
it also will have ripple effects in other areas he said for 
example hdtv products will use a large supply of advanced 
semiconductors and hdtv will have applications in military and 
medical fields he said in testimony submitted to the panel 
he added however that regardless of what standard the united 
states selects it wont stop the japanese from entering the us 
market 
more important than selecting a standard he said is government 
and industry coming up with a strategy to put american companies 
back on the electronics manufacturing track and to develop 
marketing and distribition systems that will rival the japanese 
about 20 advancedtv systems are under development and competing 
to be designated as the us hdtv standard 
richard wiley a former fcc chairman and chairman of the fccs 
advisory committee on advanced tv technologies said his panels 
testing of the systems could begin by the end of the year and will 
take a year and a half to complete 
this is not going to be something youre going to solve 
overnight he said referring to the selection of a standard 
system the involvement of us electronics companies in the 
emerging industry and the gradual replacement of tv sets by 
american viewers 
wiley estimated that the united states had a year or two to 
establish a national hdtv policy but markey said im not as 
optimistic as you are in the time we have before us

shareholders of trans world airlines inc on 
wednesday overwhelmingly approved chairman carl c icahns proposal 
to buy their shares and take the nations seventhlargest airline 
private 
but opposition to the move mounted among twa employees as the 
3300member pilots union sued icahn in new york state supreme 
court to block the privatization 
at a special meeting twa shareholders not affiliated with icahn 
voted 3714740 shares in favor of his privatization plan and 
146061 against icahn voted his shares with the majority making a 
final vote of 27159478 for and 146061 against 
the approval had been widely expected by financial analysts and 
twa employees 
weve gone through quite a bit together icahn told 
shareholders before the vote was taken we of course were beset 
by problems but i left my money in to keep the company 
running 
icahn a wily takeover specialist who took the reins of twa a 
little more than two years ago controls the airline through a 
complex myriad of financial entities that own around 77 percent of 
its 305 million common shares outstanding 
he dropped a similar proposal to go private after last octobers 
stock market crash then came back with a revised bid in april 
under the plan shareholders not affiliated with icahn would 
receive for each share of common stock 20 in cash and 30 in face 
amount of 12 percent notes due in 2008 
airline industry analysts estimate the bid puts a value of 
around 40 a share or 3048 million on the twa shares that icahn 
doesnt already own twa stock closed at 3675 wednesday on the 
new york stock exchange up 37 cents a share 
entities controlled by icahn would receive for each common 
share 20 in cash and a new issue of preferred stock and a 
retained share of common stock 
after completion of the transaction expected in a month or so 
icahn and the entities controlled by him would own about 90 percent 
of twas stock the remaining shares would be owned by an employee 
stock ownership plan 
twa also has said that upon completion of the deal it intends 
to pay off at least 645 million of its 23 billion debt and 
seek the consent of holders of some preferred stock to eliminate 
voting rights on that stock and to exchange other preferred issues 
for 12 percent notes 
icahn said twa will have about 1 billion in cash after the 
deal an unspecified portion of which will be used to purchase new 
aircraft to upgrade the international carriers fleet 
at the start of the meeting capt thomas ashwood master 
chairman of the twa pilots union attempted to serve icahn with 
legal papers related to the unions suit against the privatization 
the papers were accepted by twa general counsel mark buckstein as 
some attending the meeting applauded 
in its suit the pilots union alleges that icahns plan to go 
private is a breach of the agreements it made with him during his 
takeover of the carrier as part of those agreements the pilots 
accepted a 26 percent pay cut work rule changes and other 
concessions they say amount to 300 million over three years 
the pilots are seeking an injunction blocking the privatization 
and a court order enforcing their contracts 
we wont stand idly by while carl icahn strips our airline of 
assets and keeps it from growing financially stronger from buying 
airplanes and from improving service to our passengers because of 
heavy debt ashwood said in a statement 
the pilots action intensified union opposition to icahns plan 
last week the union representing twa flight attendants asked the 
department of transportation to block the privatization and freeze 
the airlines assets while it investigates icahns fitness to 
continue managing the airline 
the machinists and flight attendants at twa also plan to file 
lawsuits similar to that brought by the pilots union ashwood said 
icahn bristled at criticism leveled at him during the meeting by 
a representative of the flight attendants 
we will not be dictated to by employees concerning how to run 
this airline he said 
after the meeting icahn told reporters he was disturbed by the 
pilots lawsuit

coffee futures prices rose sharply for the second straight day 
wednesday on fears that a dry spell in brazil could lengthen into a 
drought in the worlds largest coffeeproducing nation 
on other markets cocoa futures were sharply lower energy 
futures were mixed precious metals gained livestock and meat 
advanced and grains and soybeans were mixed 
the brazilian drought talk that has driven up coffee futures 
prices on new yorks coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange may be 
premature but there was little other information to trade on 
wednesday analysts said 
fears of drought damage have underpinned a dramatic rally in the 
coffee market in the past month coffee for delivery in september 
has risen more than 21 cents a pound since falling to about 108 
in early august 
but its still fairly early to be worried about drought damage 
to the brazilian crop said sandra kaul an analyst with shearson 
lehman hutton inc in new york 
to put this in perspective in 1985 when drought trimmed the 
crop back sharply people had not begun to focus on the drought 
until the second or third week of october and it wasnt until 
thanksgiving that they began noting damage to the crop she said 
but kim badenhop an analyst with merrill lynch capital markets 
inc in new york said conditions were becoming a little more 
critical as the coffee crop approaches its flowering stage 
badenhop said brazil had an early dry spring this year 
resulting in unusually low soil moisture 
brazilian weather conditions could continue to determine the 
markets direction before the sept 19 opening of the international 
coffee organizations semiannual meeting in london 
coffee settled 332 cents to 379 cents higher with september at 
1295 a pound 
cocoa futures skidded to new 12year lows on the coffee sugar 
amp cocoa exchange as producer and consumer nationmembers of the 
international cocoa organization meeting in london began tackling 
issues that threaten the existence of the pricesupport group 
cocoa was 20 to 28 lower with september at 1173 a ton 
oil futures finished mixed on the new york mercantile exchange 
surprising many who had expected a continution of tuesdays sharp 
selloff 
reports that saudi arabia kuwait and the united arab emirates 
had increased their crudeoil production last month caused panic 
selling of futures tuesday on fears that the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries was in complete disarray 
but cooler heads prevailed wednesday said michael rothman 
senior energy analyst with merrill lynch capital markets inc in 
new york 
almost everybody in opec is producing at their quota so 
youre not seeing a widespread erosion of discipline he said 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 8 cents lower to 13 
cents higher with october at 1416 a barrel heating oil was 09 
cent lower to 07 cent higher with october at 4163 cents a gallon 
unleaded gasoline was 13 cent lower to 10 cent higher with 
october at 4259 cents a gallon 
the steadying of oil prices and the weakening of the dollar 
contributed to a modest rally in precious metals futures on new 
yorks commodity exchange analysts said 
gold settled 70 cents to 140 higher with october at 43020 a 
troy ounce silver was 6 cents to 61 cents higher with september 
at 6546 a troy ounce 
livestock and meat futures posted strong gains on the chicago 
mercantile exchange in a technically inspired reversal of tuesdays 
steep losses analysts said 
frozen pork bellies for august 1989 delivery advanced the 
permitted limit of 2 cents a pound following tuesdays limit 
decline in the may contract 
live cattle were 15 cent to 120 cents higher with october at 
7217 cents a pound feeder cattle were 15 cent to 92 cent higher 
with september at 8165 cents a pound hogs were 40 cent to 115 
cents higher with october at 3835 cents a pound frozen pork 
bellies were 137 cents to 2 cents higher with february at 4810 
cents a pound 
grain and soybean futures finished narrowly mixed on the chicago 
board of trade as profittaking and harvest pressure weakened 
markets buoyed by rumors of new export demand analysts said 
wheat finished slightly higher but below the days highs which 
matched the years top prices for december and march deliveries 
after the close the agriculture department announced a sale of 
300000 metric tons of us corn to the soviet union 
wheat settled 1 cents to 2 cents higher with september at 
412 a bushel corn was 2 cents lower to 1 cent higher with 
september at 291 a bushel oats were unchanged to 1 cents lower 
with september at 269 a bushel soybeans were 5 cents lower to 
5 cents higher with september at 882 a bushel

percent from 32 billion in the yearearlier period 
regarding the shareholder rights plan gulf amp western said it

price not reflective of its fair value

gulf amp western shareholders to purchase shares of a hostile 
acquirer at a deep discount price or to purchase gulf amp western 
shares at a discount if a hostile suitor acquired 15 percent or 
more of the companys outstanding shares

us monetary authorities sold 29 billion in 
the foreign exchange markets to restrain the dollars rise in the 
mayjuly period the federal reserve bank of new york said 
wednesday 
all of dollars were sold to buy west german marks a currency 
that was under heavy selling pressure during the period 
the new york fed said it did all of its dollarselling in the 
final 24 business days of the period from june 27 to july 31 when 
it intervened on 16 days in coordination with other central banks 
during the three months the dollar rose about 12 percent 
against the mark returning the dollar to its level of about a year 
ago the dollar also rose about 65 percent against the japanese 
yen and 98 percent against the british pound but remained below 
its yearago levels against them 
the new york fed buys and sells currencies on behalf of both the 
federal reserve and the treasury department 
the bank does not comment on what it has done in the currency 
markets since the end of the reporting period it also does not 
comment on the activities of other central banks 
however during the mayjuly period and in a number of trading 
sessions since then there has been wide speculation in the markets 
that the fed and other central banks were intervening against the 
dollar

a decade ago drexel burnham lambert inc was an 
alsoran among investment banks dismissed as an underachiever by 
its stronger competitors 
today drexel remains an outsider on wall street but for a 
different reason the firm became one of the streets biggest and 
most aggressive firms by capitalizing on markets ignored by its 
rivals and in the process revolutionized corporate finance in 
general and takeovers in particular 
now drexel is in trouble 
the securities and exchange commission said wednesday it has 
filed civil insider trading charges against drexel and michael 
milken head of drexels junk bond trading unit 
drexel traces its roots to the founding of burnham amp co in 
1935 although the pedigree of drexel firestone which burnham 
acquired in 1973 goes back to the 1830s and once counted jp 
morgan among its partners 
by the mid1970s drexel was languishing in the second tier of 
investment banks when it decided to pursue a business largely 
ignored by its competitors the market for junk bonds 
junk bonds refer to corporate debt that creditrating agencies 
consider more speculative than topranked investment grade 
bonds with respect to the companys ability to meet the debts 
payments 
drexel did not invent junk bonds but the junk bonds that were 
around originally had been issued with a higher credit rating and 
had since slipped to junk fallen angel status 
drexels novel plan was to sell junk bonds as original issues 
and to reward investors who bought the bonds by paying them higher 
yields than they could get on investmentgrade securities 
the junkbond market then exploded in large part because drexel 
cultivated ties with a stable of investors willing to buy the 
securities companies in turn rushed to have drexel sell their 
junk bonds with the knowledge those investors stood as ready buyers 
in addition many companies avoided or were unable to borrow 
huge sums because despite being relatively healthy they did not 
qualify for an investmentgrade rating but drexel specialized in 
finding companies that could profitably support junk bonds even if 
the creditrating agencies deemed the securities to be below top 
grade 
leading the drexel underwriting effort was frederick h joseph 
a relaxed softspoken boston native who was then head of corporate 
finance and is now drexels chief executive 
drexel simultaneously became the premier trader of junk bonds 
under the leadership of michael r milken a publicityshy and 
intense californian who moved drexels junkbond trading operation 
to beverly hills from new york in 1977 
the pair led drexel to a near monopoly on the mushrooming 
market but it was not until the early 1980s that drexel hit on the 
idea that made it one of top investment banks and simultaneously 
revolutionized the mergers and acquisitions business using junk 
bonds to finance takeovers particularly hostile ones 
suddenly a bidder with relatively few dollars could go after a 
multibilliondollar company armed with drexels ability to quickly 
raise most of the financing by floating more junk bonds 
corporate raiders such as carl icahn sir james goldsmith 
saul steinberg and t boone pickens jr did just that by enlisting 
drexels help and by 1985 drexel had become the most feared 
investment bank in corporate america 
yet incumbent managers at many companies also used drexels 
junkbond expertise to finance leveraged buyouts in which the 
managers acquired the companies and took them private 
the result is a junkbond market that has burgeoned 
dramatically to 159 billion in 1987 from 24 billion in 1977 it 
grew 27 percent last year from 125 billion in 1986 in spite of 
unfavorable publicity 
along the way drexel has earned enormous fees for underwriting 
and trading junk bonds and for its takeover advice 
drexels capital as of dec 31 1987 totaled nearly 22 
billion up from 18 billion the previous year and up more than 
tenfold from 1981 that made the privately held company the fifth 
largest firm on wall street 
although drexel still is the dominant player in junk bonds the 
markets huge growth drew competition from other investment banks 
drexels influence in the takeover game began to diminish 
somewhat amid the insidertrading scandal on wall street which 
erupted with the arrest of a drexel investment banker dennis r 
levine and then led to a government investigation of drexels 
tactics 
still drexel had denied suggestions that the probe severely 
impaired the firm claiming its junkbond business and its other 
investment banking operations remained strong

the washington public power supply system 
fraud trial opened wednesday with lawyers making lastminute 
motions before thursdays planned start of jury selection 
the proceedings gave some idea of what could become important 
arguments in the giant civil case 
attorney kenneth kieffer representing some of the defendants 
said wppss operated in a fish bowl of publicity in the 1970s and 
it therefore would have been difficult or impossible for his 
clients to commit fraud 
but attorney paul bernstein of new york representing thousands 
of claimants in the class action lawsuit said that while some 
wppss meetings were open to the public and the media other 
gatherings of utility officials were regularly closed making fraud 
indeed possible 
to say the supply system operated in a fish bowl is not 
true bernstein told us district judge william browning 
wppss had signed a contract with 88 utilities to build two 
nuclear power plants but the plants were terminated when they were 
partially built and the subsequent 1983 default on 225 billion 
in bonds issued to finance the project was the biggest in the 
history of the municipal bond market 
wednesdays arguments came during discussions on what 
information should be presented to jurors to help them understand 
the complicated case 
the wppss case was shifted for trial from washington state to 
tucson following arguments that jurors from the northwest might be 
prejudiced because of the possibility they would pay for an 
eventual jury award through their electricity rates 
in the case more than 24000 people who bought bonds on the two 
plants have filed suit alleging there was fraud in planning and 
construction of the plants 
named as defendants were wppss its member utilities the 88 
participating utilities bond underwriters and engineering and 
financial advice firms 
settlements totaling 351 million to date have left among the 
defendants only 20 washington utilities one oregon utility two 
engineering firms and a company that gave financial advice to wppss 
the default occurred after energy projections for the northwest 
showed the electrical output of the partiallybuilt plants wppss 
nos 4 and 5 was more than the region needed 
the plants were terminated in january 1982 and default came in 
1983 after the washington supreme court ruled most of the 88 
utilities investing in the projects had signed illegal contracts 
with wppss 
wednesday the defense argued unsuccessfully that the judges 
rules for trial would result in a playing field tilted in favor 
of plaintiffs 
youve put the hammer the firing mechanism in plaintiffs 
hands kieffer said in arguing that plaintiffs would be able to 
control the trial 
keiffer said he feared the defense would be unable to put its 
case in front of the jury in a logical manner if plaintiffs have 
the ability to set the order in which witnesses will appear 
jury selection is expected to take two days browning has 
ordered that 20 jurors be seated in the federal multidistrict 
litigation which could last more than a year 
because it is a civil case only six jurors eventually may be 
called upon to issue a verdict 
wppss attempted to build five nuclear power plants in the 1970s 
to serve northwest customers of those one plant wppss no 2 at 
the hanford nuclear reservation is operating 
two others wppss nos 1 and 3 were mothballed under 
construction delays five years ago 
bonds sold to build those three plants are paid for through the 
bonneville power administration but the terminated plants nos 4 
and 5 never enjoyed bpa protection

the senate shrugged off charges it was 
reverting to shameless trade protectionism wednesday and moved 
to force a vote on imposing new curbs on textile apparel and 
nonrubber footwear imports 
this is about the survival of the textile industry the 
sponsor sen ernest f hollings dsc told the senate before it 
voted 6829 to limit debate on the bill to 30 hours and thus avert 
any filibuster 
the action represented a step forward for the textile apparel 
and shoe industries but prospects for the housepassed bill remain 
clouded with a month to go before congress adjourns to campaign 
full time 
had the senate not acted to invoke cloture or limit debate 
freetrade forces seeking to prevent a vote on the bill itself 
almost certainly would have staged a filibuster preventing that 
required threefifths support 
the bill would freeze this years textile and apparel imports at 
1987 levels and permit growth of one percent annually in the years 
ahead it would bar increases in the level of nonrubber footwear 
imports 
the president would be authorized to negotiate tariff cuts to 
compensate countries hurt by the tightened restrictions 
president reagan vetoed an earlier version of the legislation in 
1985 to the dismay of manufacturers and a number of labor unions 
he called the measure protectionism that would raise prices narrow 
consumer choices and actually cost more jobs that it would save in 
the textile apparel and shoe industries 
the industries were rocked by a wave of imports in the early 
1980s and have been pushing ever since for congressional 
restrictions 
critics have been complaining however that the textile 
industrys distress is a thing of the past and that in large 
measure thanks to competition from asian manufacturers american 
companies are more productive and competitive than ever before 
after voting to invoke cloture the senate spent most of 
wednesday afternoon debating amendments designed by critics to 
sidetrack the bill lawmakers planned to resume action on the bill 
thursday 
in each case lawmakers voted to table or kill amendments 
offered by freetrade critics of the textile bill 
sen phil gramm rtexas sponsored an amendment to exempt 
workers coveralls uniforms work shoes and work boots he said 
it would help the workingman 
this amendment is ludicrous retorted hollings it was 
tabled 6228 
both sides also got onto a familiar merrygoround over just how 
much the nations textile companies earn the claims and 
counterclaims have become a regular feature of textile debates 
sen bob packwood rore a critic of the proposed new curbs 
told the senate that pretax earnings of us textile companies 
zoomed 26 percent last year that brought sen strom thurmond 
rsc an industry champion to the floor with figures suggesting 
a 12 percent drop in profits thus far this year 
packwood retorted that industry efforts to win new relief from 
foreign competition were shameless 
textilestate senators sat stony faced through the remarks but 
retorted afterward that the textile industrys problems were a 
serious matter 
the textile and apparel industries will be extinct in a few 
years unless the flooding of our markets is stopped said 
thurmond 
american apparel makers have not fared as well as textile 
manufacturers whose plants have undergone a broadscale facelift 
in recent years 
automated machinery that has drastically reduced the manpower 
needs of fabric makers still has no parallel in the clothing 
industry thus asian apparel plants where wages are low by us 
standards in many cases remain able to turn out products with price 
tags well below those of american products

federal bankruptcy law a filing is to be made this week 
also wednesday william popejoy fca chairman and chief 
executive officer resigned his position to head a new american 
savings under control of the federal home loan bank board 
both actions stem from a bank board decision tuesday to place 
american savings into a temporary receivership part of a 2 
billion federal bailout plan that will turn control of american 
over to an investor group led by texan robert m bass 
in effect the receivership creates a new federally chartered 
american savings and severs all ties between the sampl and fca 
deposits at american savings continue to be insured up to 
100000 by the federal savings and loan insurance corp 
additionally federal regulators several months ago took the 
unusual step of guaranteeing deposits larger than 100000 in 
effort to bolster confidence in the longtroubled sampl 
while depositors and some creditors are protected stockholders 
in fca saw their investments wiped out by the federal action which 
does not provide for compensation from american to fca or its 
shareholders 
the bank board agreed monday to turn control of the new american 
over to the bass group bass agreed to pump 550 million cash into 
american 
the deal the biggest rescue of a troubled thrift calls for the 
bank board to inject an estimated 15 billion in cash into 
american over the next 10 years and to provide 500 million in 
promissory notes the first cash infusion of 250 million was 
made tuesday 
popejoy 50 was brought in by the bank board to head american 
in 1984 at the start of an extended attempt to let the sampl wok its 
way out of trouble 
american faltered after several years of rapid growth under the 
former management its problems include billions of dollars in 
loans made to shaky real estate ventures in california texas and 
elsewhere many of those loans are delinquent or in foreclosure

the federal reserve board on wednesday granted 
bank of new york co up to an additional 90 days to complete its 
effort to acquire irving bank corp 
the ruling was a new blow to irvings nearly yearlong struggle 
to avoid an unfriendly takeover by bank of new york 
irvings hopes to fend of bank of new york faded last week when 
banca commerciale italiana dropped its friendly offer of 840 
million 84 a share for 51 percent of irvings stock the 
milanbased bank pulled out after an unfavorable fed ruling on aug 
19 
before bank of new york can press on with its 14 billion 
offer valued at about 70 a share it must win a ruling from a new 
york appeals court affirming a lower court decision in late july 
that overturned irvings antitakeover defense the appeals court 
has received briefs from the two sides and has scheduled a hearing 
for friday 
the fed in a letter to h rodgin cohen an attorney 
representing bank of new york gave the bank until 30 days after 
the court ruling to wrap up the deal but it said the extension 
would expire within 90 days whether or not the court rules 
the fed on feb 25 originally granted bank of new york until 
may 24 to finish the deal and has now extended the deadline three 
times 
after the court ruling bank of new york is required to consult 
with the fed before acquiring more than 5 percent of irving it 
already has a 49 percent stake the fed said it would give the 
case expedited consideration 
the letter also rejected an irving bank contention that could 
have forced bank of new york to make a new application to the fed 
for permission to acquire irving 
because of new york state law bank of new york may be forced to 
maintain irving as a separate subsidiary rather than merge the two 
organizations irving had argued that bank of new yorks 
application to the fed was for a merger only and would be invalid 
if irving remained intact as a subsidiary 
were very pleased at the extension and we extend an 
invitation to irvings board to enter into substantial and 
meaningful negotations with no preconditions said owen brady a 
bank of new york vice president 
the two banks are both based in new york city and both have 
about 23 billion in assets

the securities and exchange commission filed a 
massive enforcement action wednesday against investment giant 
drexel burnham lambert inc and the head of its junkbond trading 
unit accusing them of a systematic fraud violations ranging from 
insider trading to falsifying books 
the 184page civil complaint filed in manhattan federal court 
marked the governments most aggressive move against a securities 
firm in a twoyearold crackdown on wall street corruption stemming 
from the ivan boesky insider trading scandal 
the complaint alleged fraudulent conduct involving insider 
trading stock manipulation fraud on drexels own clients failure 
to disclose beneficial ownership of securities and numerous other 
violations 
the sec said it would seek to have the defendants give up the 
profits made on the affected stock trades and pay a penalty of 
triple the profits the agency offered no specific figure but sen 
william proxmire chairman of the senate banking committee said 
the sec was seeking 100 million 
frederick h joseph chief executive officer of drexel 
reiterated the companys position that it would be absolved of the 
charges while michael milken head of drexels junk bond 
operations also denied any wrongdoing 
the sec had said previously that it planned to file a civil 
complaint against drexel but had not released details of its case 
the secs move capped months of speculation that the government 
had assembled an extensive case against the firm as a result of the 
investigation into wall street abuses spawned by the ivan boesky 
scandal 
according to the complaint drexel and milken of encino 
calif had a secret arrangement with boesky involving at least 
16 series of illegal securities transactions 
under that agreement the sec claimed that boeskycontrolled 
companies secretly bought sold or held securities for drexel or 
other individual defendants and that sometimes drexel reciprocated 
with secret transactions for boesky 
the sec alleged that employees of drexel and boesky companies 
kept secret offthebooks records of securities positions taken as 
part of the arrangement boesky was forced nearly two years ago to 
surrender a record 100 million in penalties and illegal profits 
from trading on insider information 
the sec also charged that drexel and milken in at least two 
additional transactions traded in securities using confidential 
information misappropriated from drexel clients 
federal law bars corporate executives investment bankers and 
others with access to confidential corporate information from using 
it to trade in securities 
us attorney rudolph giuliani whose office prosecuted boesky 
and other wall street criminals declined to comment on whether 
criminal charges would be filed against drexel milken or any of 
the other defendants 
there had been speculation the sec delayed filing its civil 
complaint to avoid interfering with the criminal investigation 
we disagree with the charges filed by the sec and in due 
course we expect to be vindicated joseph said in a statement 
he added hundreds of transactions have been reviewed yet as 
shown by the charges and as we have been predicting there is 
little in the filing that is not based on ivan bosekys 
allegations 
in a separate statement milken also predicted he would be 
vindicated in court 
for the past 22 months i have been the subject of a shadow 
trial of systematic leaks and innuendo based upon false 
accusations no one likes to be sued but i welcome the 
opportunity to have at long last a full and open hearing of the 
allegations in an unbiased forum he said 
also included among the defendants were milkens brother lowell 
j milken of los angeles cary j maultasch of livingston nj 
and pamela monzert santa monica calif all drexel employees 
also charged were victor posner of miami beach fla president 
of pennsylvania engineering corp of pittsburgh which also was 
named as a defendant and posners son stephen posner a director 
and vice chairman of the board at pennsylvania engineering a 
spokeswoman renee mottram said the posners had not seen the 
complaint and therefore had no comment posner who was the 
nations highest paid corporate executive in the mid1980s pleaded 
guilty earlier this year to federal income tax evasion charges 
gary lynch the secs director of enforcement said in a 
telephone interview that the allegations involve 18 series of 
transactions including 16 involving boesky the former stock 
speculator now in prison 
boesky was charged with violating insidertrading related 
securities laws in november 1986 and settled charges by agreeing to 
return profits and pay fines totaling 100 million 
sec charges against drexel with whom boesky worked had been 
widely expected since then 
in midjuly frederick w joseph drexels chief executive told 
the firms employees to expect charges possibly soon and with 
little warning published reports quoted the firms officials at 
the time as saying settlement talks with the sec had broken down 
lynch declined to comment regarding efforts to settle the 
charges with drexel or on whether boesky would be called as a 
witness

contract offer wednesday to teamster drivers and related unions 
raising the possibility of another entertainment industry strike

crafts unions concluded early wednesday morning without a

separately if any union rejects the terms a strike will not begin

statement if we do not accomplish that more jobs will be lost 
at the studios our records show that in 1987 teamsters lost more 
than 14 million in wages and benefits as compared with employment 
levels in 1985 we must reverse that trend so that we can recapture 
work and jobs at studios 
television and film production has only recently returned to 
full speed after a fivemonth scriptwriters strike producers 
contend they could hire enough replacement drivers to keep 
hollywood rolling in the event of a strike 
the teamsters have been working without a contract since july 30
