security forces wednesday night 
shot and killed one of three gunmen converging on an army 
checkpoint close to the border with the irish republic police 
said the two other men escaped 
the irish national liberation army a marxist offshoot of the 
mainly roman catholic irish republican army said in a statement to 
news organizations that the dead man was one of its guerrillas and 
was on active service at the time 
active service is a guerrilla euphemism for a shooting or 
bombing mission 
belfast police headquarters said the three men converged on the 
checkpoint at the village of clady near strabane 65 miles west of 
belfast 
but it made no mention of the gunmen firing and gave few 
details except to report that security forces later found a loaded 
gun and a guerrillastyle ski mask at the scene 
it said the slain man was in his twenties and was from the 
strabane area 
protestant guerrillas earlier wednesday claimed responsibility 
for the submachinegun killings of two catholics in belfast monday 
an anonymous telephone caller told the belfast telegraph 
newspaper that gunmen of the protestant action force shot peter 
dolan 25 and seamus morris 18 to avenge the shooting deaths of 
two protestant workers by the ira five days earlier 
the shadowy protestant action force is reportedly linked with 
the better known protestant paramilitary ulster volunteer force 
hundreds of mourners attended wednesdays funeral for dolan a 
beer deliveryman catholic bishop cahal daly appealed for factions 
on both sides of the sectarian divide to lay down their arms 
for the love of ireland for the sake particularly of the 
catholic community for the good of the nationalists you claim to 
represent bring an end to this slaughter daly told mourners 
as in other years hundreds of catholic youths rioted monday and 
tuesday to mark the 17th anniversary of britains nowabandoned 
policy of detaining guerrillas without trial police said street 
violence wound down by wednesday 
in an acceleration of ira attacks guerrillas last week killed 
six people one was a soldier killed in a bombing at a barracks in 
north london the other five a policeman two parttime soldiers 
of the ulster defense regiment and two protestant civilians working 
on a police station died in separate attacks in northern ireland 
the ira is fighting to end british rule in northern ireland and 
unite it with the overwhelmingly catholic republic of ireland under 
socialist rule protestants form a majority in northern ireland 
the death of the guerrilla slain wednesday night brings the 
overall toll since sectarian and political violence flared in 
northern ireland in august 1969 to at least 2673

a witness testifying wednesday at the trial 
of men charged in the torturemurder of drug enforcement agent 
enrique camarena testified that he saw one of the defendants at the 
scene of the killing 
george gomez espana gonzalez who cut a plea bargain with the 
government testified that he picked up rene verdugo urquidez at 
the villa of a mexican drug kingpin in guadalajara mexico during 
the time camarena was held there 
gonzalez a real estate salesman said he drove his boss to the 
home of rafael caro quintero on either feb 7 or feb 8 1985 
camarena was abducted feb 7 1985 from outside the us 
consulate in guadalajara the government says he ws taken to caros 
house where he was tortured and killed during a 24hour period 
gonzalez said he waited in the kitchen of the villa where he saw 
several semiautomatic weapons and heard caro talking with a group 
of men in the back yard 
when he departed he said verdugo hitched a ride bringing 
with him a man he referred to as commandante 
he said verdugo appeared tired he added that he needed some 
sleep and spoke of having solved a problem with the help of the 
commandante 
in a tape recording of camarenas torture and inquisition one 
of his interrogators is referred to as commandante 
gonzalez said he met verdugo once before in 1984 in connection 
with a financial transaction in which a suitcase full of about 1 
million in cash from caro was transported to san diego for deposit 
in a bank 
verdugos role in the money laundering transaction was unclear 
other than that he was present 
gonzalez testimony was interrupted frequently by defense 
objections that it constituted hearsay his comment that the 1 
million came from caro ultimately was stricken from the court 
record 
gonzalez told jurors he struck a plea bargain with the 
government to testify in the trial to avoid going to prison for 
making false statements about the importation of money the 1 
million and offering a bribe to a federal officer 
verdugo 36 and raul lopez alvarez28 are charged with the 
torture murder of camarena whose body was found buried at a remote 
mexican ranch along with that of his pilot alfredo zavala avelar 
both had been severely beaten and camarenas skull was crushed 
the government alleges that caro33 head of a powerful drug 
cartel orchestrated the killings he was charged in mexico and is 
being tried there along with other defendants 
a third defendant in the los angeles federal court trial jesus 
felix gutierrez 38 is charged with helping caro flee mexico after

parts per million not the 24 ppm contained in the list

the battle of the bare bodies has heated up in italy 
this summer with several towns and resort islands ruling that men 
and women must wear shirts in public or face penalties 
a belgian man was even reported beaten up after he refused a 
request by a rome subway attendant to cover his naked chest 
one southern town has made a notable break with the trend 
guaranteeing that people can walk around topless agropolis 
tourism chief has called on women to bare all but the local priest 
is fighting back 
topless bathing popular in italy for some time now appears to 
be on the decline onepiece suits unthinkable a few years ago 
have now become fashionable 
its necessary to return to the good taste of the past 
capri tourism commissioner giuseppe massa told the italian news 
agency ansa 
the famous island put into effect a new coverup ordinance 
tuesday that bars anyone from walking the streets with a bare chest 
or just a swimsuit penalties for offenders range from 70 to 350 
according to mayor saverio valente the law was necessary for 
reasons not only aesthetic but hygienic 
on the island of ponza about 65 miles to the north in the 
tyrrhenian sea bathers are also barred from strolling the streets 
in swimsuits 
mayor francesco ferraiuolo acted this month after receiving a 
note from local roman catholic priest worried about the practice 
according to italian press reports 
in venice meanwhile a former director of tourism augusto 
salvadori is organizing patrols to advise tourists on how to dress 
and eat properly in the canal city travelers in shorts or 
tooskimpy sundresses are barred from the main section of st 
marks basilica 
frustration with toplessness boiled over on a subway in the 
italian capital monday according to romes il messaggero newspaper 
a subway worker advised 23yearold daniel serge meuree of 
belgium to put on a shirt the paper said and the youth replied 
with a shrug of his shoulders 
he even began to spit on the pavement muttering it appeared 
not very pleasant epithets about the italians and therefore 
someone filled with the love of his country reacted the paper 
said 
several subway passengers slapped and punched the belgian who 
subsequently pulled on a blue shirt the paper said 
a clash of a different sort has broken out in agropoli where 
the tourism commissioner seeking a new image for the town has 
called on women to go topless whenever possible 
the parish priest claims the law will transform the town into a 
modernday sodom and gomorrah 
to admire the beauty of a body helps to elevate the spirit 
said tourism commissioner vincenzo pepe 
tourism is going through a worrisome slow phase he added 
what can we do allow agropoli to become a colony for old 
people 
pepe gave his support for a topless fashion show scheduled last 
sunday in the village 60 miles south of naples 
but the rev armando borrelli vowed that if the girls take 
their clothes off i will toll the funeral bells 
about 5000 people turned out for the show but the women 
decided to wear clothes pepe has promised a topless show this 
sunday and borrelli has said he will counter with a solemn mass 
we have defeated sodom and gomorrah and bare chests in 
agropoli will be defeated too he told the rome newspaper la 
repubblica

roll down the car window anywhere near 
the plant where louisianas most famous hot sauce still is made 
from a centuryold recipe and your head just fills up with the 
scent a little tomatoey a little spicy a lot hot 
the odor is so much a part of the place that paul cp 
mcilhenny whose family has been making tabasco sauce from the 
start doesnt even notice it unless hes up close to the pulp 
barrels 
hot sauce in southern louisiana is like that smell its 
everywhere on every table in every restaurant two dozen or so 
varieties louisiana hot sauce is a tourist attraction its on 
posters and coffee mugs and key chains and people take tours of 
hot sauce factories 
in the river parishes where the acadians first landed its 
hard not to find a bottle of louisiana hot sauce on the table 
said john folse a chef and restaurateur in donaldsonville who 
introduced cajun food to moscow during the summit meeting earlier 
this year its almost like salt pepper and louisiana hot 
there is of course the theory that people who live in such 
steamy heat eat hot foods to perspire and cool off 
my mothers people and my fathers people grew hot peppers 
because they thought they were good for you said televisions 
downhome cajun chef justin wilson 
but theres much more than science at work in a land where what 
to eat for dinner is often the focus of luncheon conversation and 
what to eat tomorrow is the dinnertable talk good food really 
matters here 
when someone asks what are you doing this afternoon you 
say oh i dont know maybe a crawfish boil they always think in 
terms of cooking said folse 
and most everything even to a bloody mary sorbet says folse 
gets a dash or two of hot sauce 
i dont think anythings worth a darn unless its seasoned 
well said wilson who is partial to cayenne peppers 
mcilhenny 44 vice president of the mcilhenny co figures he 
goes through a 2ounce bottle a month of tabasco which by the 
way is not a generic name though mcilhennys pleased if you think 
so 
hot sauce is addictive he said ive had friends use it out 
of loyalty and then say hey this is good as if it was a 
surprise they say they get addicted 
so its no surprise there are so many kinds tabasco 
trappeys tony cacheres creole hot sauce crystal hot sauce 
cajun chef louisiana gold durkee sauce panola red cajun power 
hot sauce you get the idea 
a premium sauce its agreed uses only the pepper pulp no 
seeds or skin most contain just salt vinegar and peppers 
although some labels say it fancier crystal for example lists 
fresh ripe aged peppers and cajun chef contains select 
louisiana cayenne peppers 
so can connoisseurs distinguish among them 
sure said folse noting that most chefs stock four of five 
varieties 
ive got items in my kitchen i use tabasco on however i also 
really like louisiana gold he said i dont find that its 
quite as hot as tabasco and when you have five or six chefs on 
the line you want to have a little control if they put one shot 
or two shots you dont want to change the flavor competely 
they all have a little different flavor and they all use a 
little different amounts of vinegar salt said wilson there 
are certain ones i prefer its just a question of experience 
and god knows i have a lot of that 
the mcilhenny co too has plenty of experience tabasco is 
sold in 100 countries its been on space missions 
we end up in strange places said mcilhenny i understand 
two or three sherpas in nepal will use a bottle at a single meal 
nepal is a long way from tiny avery island 18 square miles that 
are home to 700 people the tabasco plant and fields a salt mine 
and oil wells there also are 100000 snowy egrets 30000 azaleas 
and 17000 irises 
avery island is not really an island but a salt dome that rises 
from the marshes and bayous on louisianas gulf coast at 152 feet 
above sea level the island is the highest point along the gulf 
from mexico to florida it sits 150 miles from new orleans 
separated by sugar cane rice and oil fields 
in 1818 john craig marsh obtained rights to part of the island 
and later a louisiana judge daniel dudley avery bought part in 
1837 avery married marshs daughter and eventually obtained the 
entire island 
in 1859 edmund mcilhenny married an avery daughter the story 
is told though not verified that the family fled avery island in 
the civil war and returned to find everything destroyed except 
one defiant pepper plant grown from a seed or seedling given to 
edmund by a friend returning from mexico 
what is known is that edmund mcilhenny came up with a sauce to 
perk up the bland food available during reconstructionin 1868 he 
packed his invention in ladies perfume bottles and sent samples 
off to 350 wholesalers two years later he had a patent and in two 
years more a london office to handle all the european orders 
his sauce used a variety of capsicum frutescens a small 
fireenginered pepper of which the mcilhenny co today is the 
worlds largest producer tabasco is an indian word for damp earth 
which mcilhenny apparently chose because he liked the sound of it 
one hundred twenty years later little has changed mcilhenny is 
still a family company with paul mcilhenny and two cousins in 
charge and avery island is their kingdom 
this is an ideal site said mcilhenny part of the 
mystique is that only the soil only the climate only the nimble 
fingers of avery island could pick tabasco 
the peppers are harvested in summer by hand and must be 
processed the same day 
but today only 10 percent of the peppers needed are grown on 
the island to protect against disease pests hurricanes and labor 
troubles seeds for the rest of the peppers are sent to central and 
south america the mash is returned to avery island 
paul mcilhenny inspects every white oak barrel of mash for 
aroma color particle size he rejects one barrel in 100 
the pulp is mashed with salt eight pounds to 100 pounds of 
peppers and aged three years the mash is then mixed with a 
strong white vinegar and stirred mechanically for 28 days finally 
it is strained and bottled 
and even then its not just a bottle of sauce 
hot sauces in louisiana are almost a religion said folse 
you go to church on sunday hot sauce on monday through friday

while they werent exactly hollering 
lights camera action aides to george bush were doing some 
directing at the republican platform sessions 
leaving nothing to chance in making sure no stray language crept 
into the platform the aides were seen standing at the back of 
subcommittee hearings tuesday giving nods and signals to panel 
members on how to deal with votes 
in the subcommittee on family and community the staff activity 
was particularly noticeable during the discussion of language on 
aids the plank says aids victims should be encouraged to seek 
early diagnosis and remain at their jobs or in school as long as 
they are physically able 
one bush staffer gave thumbs up and down signals as well 
nodding his head up and down and maintaining eye contact with 
panelists 
the orchestration by the bush staff was not at all 
machiavellian said deborah steelman campaign director of 
domestic policy 
noting confusion voiced by subcommittee members over platform 
tax language she said the proposals are not very well 
understood by the committee many of them are much more informed 
than others 
we just have to make sure that everybody understands what 
bushs position is and where we stand in terms of what they have on 
the table steelman said 
she noted that the vice president had addressed the platform 
delegates monday seeking to make sure that the platform is very 
specific thats what were involved in here today to make sure 
that that happens she said 
during one break in the family subcommittee meeting panelists 
huddled with the bush staff before coming back to withdraw a motion 
that called for weakening of agency shop rules on mandatory payment 
of union dues 
steelman said new aids language submitted by subcommittee 
cochairman rick montoya and approved unanimously by the panel 
was instigated by the campaign and is consistent with bushs 
position 
in presenting it montoya said it showed sensitivity to the 
needs of aids victims as well as concern mentioned in earlier 
language about the spread of the deadly disease 
the gay community for years has criticized president reagan as 
being insensitive to the aids crisis the partys 1984 platform 
contained no mention of the disease 
as a member of the reagan administration bush engenders the 
same suspicion from gays 
in the foreign policy subcommittee hearing former sen john 
tower of texas a top bush supporter made no bones about 
representing the campaign when he stood up to urge the committee to 
leave language on israel intact 
he told the committee he was speaking as a representative of the 
bush campaign

glasnost has come or 
returned to czechoslovakian art with the first freewheeling 
exhibit by hundreds of artists held in prague since 1969 
twentyfive thousand people filed past more than 2700 works by 
882 artists in the first two weeks of the prague salon staged 
at a city stadium and in the park of culture and recreation 
following demands for such a show at a meeting last year of the 
staterun union of artists the salon is free of the rigid 
restrictions imposed on most art exhibits since the prague 
spring reforms of 1968 were crushed 
picking up on a tradition started with a salon in 1968 but 
abandoned after 1969 works are shown in alphabetical order each 
artist gets the same space regardless of rank and is free to fill 
it with any work completed in the last five years 
the result is a chaotic mix of abstract expressionist and 
surrealist styles competing sidebyside for the visitors 
attention 
despite the freedom however there is no explosion of 
previously unknown talent 
nonetheless some artists make bold steps into the political 
sphere premysl vanicek for example hung a kitsch portrait of 
mikhail and raisa gorbachev close to a portrait in identical style 
of franz kafka the author whose full works are still unpublished 
in his native prague 
another picture by vaclav sramek consists entirely of the 
letters p and a and is entitled perestroika a variation on 
somebody elses theme a possible allusion to the similarity 
between gorbachevs reforms and those introduced in czechoslovakia 
in 1968 by alexander dubcek 
elsewhere in the exhibit olga berekova displays a portrait of 
pope john paul ii while rock star mick jagger graces the sculpture 
section 
the exhibit is limited to members and candidates of the artists 
union in the past the union was often accused of giving 
preferential treatment to some members and failing to promote young 
artists who have a chance to show at the salon 
one idea behind the present exhibit seems to have been an 
official desire to show that the alleged restrictions were not 
preventing great young talents from coming forward 
gone is the era when socalled forbidden fruit tasted good 
just because it had the odor of something forbidden unwelcome and 
outlawed the political and arts weekly tvorba said 
the possibility of such a broad exhibition prevents the 
birth of wronged artists and even martyrs because of an insensitive 
and entirely unnecessary administrative intervention all were 
given the same chance and only the future will show who will win 
official support for the salon went all the way up to communist 
party leader milos jakes who praised it as a chance for artists to 
compare works 
but not everybody was so enthusiastic czechoslovakias graphic 
artists highly ranked internationally did not take part and not 
one professor from the academy of arts chose to display works 
the communist party daily rude pravo chafed at the low standard 
of many works shown and took issue with at least one sculpture 
criticizing a torn chaise longue with a figure made out of tree 
fungi as a work that had nothing to do with contemporary art 
the exhibit was preceded by a handful of much smaller shows that 
were tolerated but not officially sponsored in prague last year 
the soviet drive for glasnost or openness in the arts and 
staterun media has produced nothing like the outstandingly frank 
films plays and articles now seen in moscow but a few previously 
banned films have been shown and the media has printed articles on 
previously taboo topics such as drug addiction and prostitution

although the drought is reducing crop 
production sharply agriculture department analysts do not expect 
it to have much effect on us commodity exports this year 
on may 26 before the droughts impact was apparent the usda 
forecast agricultural exports at a value of 335 billion in the 
fiscal year that began last oct 1 up from 279 billion in 
198697 the volume of shipments was forecast at 1455 million 
metric tons up from 1292 million 
exports in 1988 are primarily crops harvested during the 
198788 crop year says the departments economic research 
service the drought will affect next years exports more than 
this years 
the agency report which was by economist stephen a macdonald 
was in the august issue of agricultural outlook magazine it did 
not include projections for 198889 exports however those are 
scheduled to be released by usda on aug 25 
the droughts impact on exports during fiscal 1989 will depend 
both on how much us production drops and on how overseas 
competitors and consumers react to higher prices the report 
said previous droughts in 1980 and 1983 provide useful 
indicators 
for example in the 198081 crop year us corn and soybean 
supplies declined 10 percent and 12 percent respectively from the 
previous year at the same time export prices averaged 18 percent 
higher for corn and 16 percent higher for soybeans 
and in 198384 corn and soybeans supplies dropped 29 percent 
and 19 percent while export prices rose an average of 23 percent 
and 24 percent 
meanwhile the actual volume of corn exports fell by less than 4 
percent following the 1980 and 1983 droughts while soybean exports 
dropped 17 percent following the 1980 drought and 19 percent after 
1983 
but with higher prices the value of agricultural exports rose 
after each drought year the report said 
in 198081 the value of us farm exports rose to a record of 
438 billion before declining the export value after sliding to 
348 billion in 198283 jumped to 38 billion in 198384 
reflecting the higher prices and shorter supplies 
although droughtreduced supplies and higher prices will help 
cut the us share of world agricultural trade in 198889 there is 
no reason to believe that the drought will permanently constrain 
the us share of the world market the report said 
exports dropped sharply in the early 1980s and still have not 
recovered their former glory but the report said conditions were 
substantially different then 
for one thing the early 1980s were marked by global recession 
and severe contraction in the ability of developing countries to 
pay for imports the global economy was recovering by 1984 but the 
dollar and us price supports had risen for several years 
prompting foreign producers to increase output and take advantage 
of higher prices 
today world economic growth is expected to remain near 3 
percent in 1989 and us price supports which tend to dominate 
international commodity prices are lower as a result of the 1985 
farm law also the report said the dollar has been declining for 
three years and is unlikely to rebound 
these conditions suggest a better postdrought outlook for 
us agricultural exports after fiscal 1989 than existed after 
fiscal 1981 and 1984 the report said 
further the continued strength of highvalue exports such 
as meat and horticultural products is a major factor in the 
overall outlook those items declined less than grain oilseed and 
cotton during the mid1980s and recovered sooner beginning in 1986 
this year the report said horticultural products are expected 
to rise 550 million to a record 37 billion while exports of 
animal products are projected to rise 600 million to a record 56 
billion overall exports of highvalue products are expected to 
reach 153 billion in 198788 matching the 198081 record 
highvalue exports go mainly to developed countries where 
financial constraints are almost unheard of and where local 
currencies have risen against the us dollar in recent years the 
report said in all sales to those countries are expected to climb 
17 billion this year to 167 billion the biggest surge in four 
years 
agricultural exports to the european economic community rose 
594 million during the first eight months of 198788 and are 
expected to total 72 billion for the entire year a 6 percent 
increase 
the report said the rise in eec purchases stems from moderate 
income and employment growth in the 12nation bloc and the 
inexpensive dollar which allows europeans to get more for 
their currencies

lauro cavazos father always stressed the 
importance of education to his three sons growing up in the untamed 
brushland of the huge king ranch 
the strength of that message took cavazos all the way to the 
white house where president reagan tuesday nominated him to 
succeed william j bennett as secretary of education 
cavazos 61 is the president of texas tech university and its 
medical school and the first hispanic to hold that post the 
24000student school is the largest in the country run by a 
hispanic 
i am convinced education is the key to many things if you 
have sufficient education you can solve most any problem in the 
world famine ecological problems nuclear problems racism 
theyre all solved with education he said 
at texas tech cavazos paid special attention to minority 
education overseeing the creation of a special office to handle 
minority student problems and increasing efforts to recruit and 
retain minorities he spoke out regularly on the importance of 
curtailing the dropout rate of minority students 
during his tenure hispanic enrollment increased from 36 
percent in 1980 to 63 percent in 1987 while black enrollment 
edged up from 185 percent to 24 percent 
cavazos received the national hispanic leadership award of the 
league of united latin american citizens in july for his efforts to 
reduce the dropout rate among hispanic youth 
despite his softspoken friendly demeanor and good 
organizational skills cavazos was sometimes criticized for being 
stretched too thin in running both the university and its medical 
school 
dr bernhard mittemeyer executive vice president of techs 
health sciences center said cavazos was easy to work with but 
occasionally difficult to track down 
he basically is a delegator mittemeyer said he works 
best in an atmosphere where people are able to solve problems 
through communication 
cavazos also aroused opposition from the faculty by proposing 
fiveyear performance reviews of all tenured professors the 
faculty passed a vote of no confidence in his presidency in 1984 
but cavazos eventually succeeded in getting the tenure plan adopted 
known informally as larry cavazos is one of a trio of 
remarkable brothers who left the king ranch where their father was 
a cattle foreman to attend what was then texas technological 
college 
his brother bobby was an allamerican running back who now has 
his own ranch while dick became a fourstar army general 
cavazos earned a bachelors degree in zoology and a masters 
degree in cytology at tech before getting a doctorate in physiology 
from iowa state university in 1954 he is not a medical doctor 
he first taught as an instructor of anatomy and later as an 
associate professor at the medical college of virginia in 
richmond later he was dean of the school of medicine at tufts 
university in medford mass before becoming the first alumnus to 
be named president at texas tech in 1980 
cavazos has continued the family tradition at the university he 
and his wife peggy ann have 10 children seven of whom hold tech 
degrees 
cavazos announced in may that he would resign as president in 
july 1989 and after a leave return to teach anatomy in the 
medical school where he has tenure 
one needs to leave the presidency when you think perhaps 
youve given direction to the institution and strong leadership 
cavazos said at the time i really believe things are in good 
shape here 
cavazos will take a cut in pay from his current salary of 
143800 plus allowances and benefits cabinet members are paid 
99500 annually plus 10000 for expenses which are tax 
deductible 
mittemeyer said that cavazos experience in both academia and 
administration will serve him well in his new post 
i think that dr cavazos while he is mild mannered also has 
convictions about the needs of education and will speak up when he 
needs to speak up he said

legislation that would subject most of the 
nations 300000 railroad workers to mandatory random drug and 
alcohol testing is moving through the house after many months of 
delay 
the house energy and commerce committee sent the bill to the 
full house on tuesday by a voice vote the house should ave a 
chance to vote on the measure shortly after lawmakers return to 
washington in september after a recess that begins this week 
the bills future is in doubt however because the senate 
favors a more extensive measure that also would cover airline and 
trucking industry employees 
the public safety demands action in this congress on random 
testing of not only railroad employees but of employees in the 
motor carrier and aviation industries as well said sen john 
danforth rmo the leading sponsor of the senates drug and 
alcohol testing legislation 
congress started working on drug testing legislation in january 
1987 shortly after 16 people died and 175 were injured when an 
amtrak passenger train collided with a conrail locomotive in chase 
md two conrail crewmen later admitted to having smoked marijuana 
shortly before the accident 
railroad unions had opposed the legislation arguing that it was 
an invasion of privacy and could result in workers losing their 
jobs because of inaccurate test results they dropped their 
opposition this spring after the department of transportation 
proposed testing regulations the unions considered less fair 
the legislation would apply to most of the nations 300000 
railroad workers including management but it would not cover 
clerical workers 
it would require that the workers undergo not only random 
testing considered a deterrence but also examinations after 
accidents before hiring for reasonable cause and as a part of 
annual physical examinations 
workers found to be using illegal drugs or abusing alcohol would 
be suspended without pay and required to undergo a rehabilitation 
program they would be given their old jobs back if they 
successfully complete the program 
among the amendments the committee approved was one allowing 
workers to continue being paid if they volunteer to take the 
rehabilitation programs 
the bill contains provisions designed to protect workers against 
harassment and to certify the laboratories that would conduct the 
testing 
rep john dingell dmich chairman of the energy and commerce 
panel complained that laboratories often conduct enormously 
slovenly work and said he would introduce legislation that would 
set standards for lab work 
those people with false positives are going to lose jobs 
opportunity theyre going to lose their good name dingell said

urban chinese parents are pushing their children 
to learn too much too fast in their attempt to get the kids on the 
fast track according to studies reported in a newspaper 
the guangming daily said tuesday that if such a tendency 
continues china will soon be confronted with a family education 
crisis 
it said parents have stopped teaching their children values 
like morality and the joys of labor because they are spending too 
much time cramming their childrens heads with facts 
a study of 2294 elementary students in beijing indicatea the 
children help out in the house for an average of just 12 minutes a 
day the paper said american children help out for about 72 minutes 
every day 
another study in zhejiang province in central china found that 
more than 80 percent of families in one county do not make their 
elementary school age children to do any housework as long as their 
grades are good 
one teacher reported that in his class of 32 children 20 cant 
dress themselves and more than 10 have their feet and hair washed 
by their mothers 
the paper said a third study of children in shanghai ages 4 to 
6 found that 27 percent have psychiatric abnormalities linked to a 
poor family environment 
the guangming daily is a leading paper for intellectuals in 
china its report made reference only to children from urban areas 
where competition for access to the few good high schools and 
universities is most intense 
in the countryside where 75 percent of chinas 107 billion 
people live the opposite situation occurs peasants are often 
loathe to send their children to school because the youngsters can 
be put to work making money for the family 
the paper said parents should not turn their homes into a 
classroom for their children 
i parents see their childrens arent learning quickly enough 
and then get mad at them the children will lose all interest in 
studying even before they enter school the paper said 
in recent years the paper said the chinese press has been 
filled with reports about child prodigies 
here a 3yearold can memorize 100 tang dynasty poems there a 
5yearold can handle integral equations it said but in their 
goal to create an early genius many families dont take into 
account whether the child is interested or whether he has a 
superior intellect 
the paper cited the case of a 7yearold boy in liaoning 
province who cut off his fingers because he didnt want to practice 
piano 
these families dont realize it but theyve taken the golden 
years of childhood and turned them into bitter years for their 
children the paper said

the house soon should get a chance to vote on 
a bill that would crack down on insider trading but the rapidly 
dwindling congressional calendar is clouding the legislations 
future 
the house energy and commerce committee approved the measure on 
a voice vote tuesday the house is expected to vote on the proposal 
shortly after lawmakers return in september from their next recess 
similar legislation has yet to progress very far in the senate 
with congressional leaders hoping for adjournment in early october 
dramatic movement would have to occur for the measure to have any 
chance of becoming law this year 
sponsor rep edward markey dmass called the legislation a 
tough common sense bill and said it was justified because of 
the stunning stories of greed that continue to emanate from 
wall street in the form of insider trading cases 
under the legislation securities firms would be required to 
construct mechanisms for detecting insider trading by their 
employees companies could face fines if they do inadequate jobs of 
preventing the release of confidential financial information by 
their workers 
the bill would boost the maximum penalty for criminal insider 
trading from 500000 to 25 million per violation for companies 
and from 100000 to 1 million for individuals 
people who provide the government with information about illegal 
insider trading could receive bounties which would be a portion of 
the profits that were earned illicitly 
the maximum jail term for insider trading convictions would be 
lengthened from five years to 10 years 
another section would authorize the securities and exchange 
commission to cooperate with foreign countries that are 
investigating insider trading cases in hopes that this would 
encourage the other nations to help us authorities pursuing 
similar cases abroad 
securities companies have unsuccessfully sought inclusion in the 
bill of a definition of insider trading so firms would know when 
the law was being broken currently the courts and government 
agencies make their own interpretations of when insider trading 
occurs 
opponents of putting such a definition in the law have argued 
that including that language would enable violators to skirt the 
prohibition 
the measure has drawn support from republicans as well as 
democrats rep matthew rinaldo rnj said the bill shows that 
insider trading will not be tolerated in our securities markets

a wide variety of hazardous industrial wastes 
will have to be rendered harmless before being dumped in landfills 
under new rules announced by the environmental protection agency 
the congressionally mandated landdisposal regulations are 
expected to cost industry up to 950 million a year according to 
j winston porter assistant epa administrator for solid waste and 
emergency response 
todays action will require that nearly a third of all 
hazardous wastes be detoxified or restricted in some way when 
disposed of on land porter said tuesday in a prepared statement 
the requirement to neutralize hazardous wastes before putting 
them in landfills will affect an estimated 861 million gallons of 
waste each year according to the epa statement 
it said the new rules would cover among other things some 129 
million gallons of waste from electroplating and about 83 million 
gallons of furnace dust produced by mills that recycle scrap metals 
the rules are effective immediately except for the petroleum 
industry which produces about 172 million gallons of refinery 
waste annually that industry was given two years to comply with 
the regulations 
steve weil chief of epas land disposal restrictions branch 
said the extra time is necessary to allow the industry to develop 
facilities to incinerate the wastes or extract harmful materials 
for reuse 
as part of tuesdays action epa rescinded a twoyear variance 
it granted last year for waste containing halogenated organic 
compounds hocs which are made up of substances like chlorine 
bromine and fluorine 
the agency said it believes the nation now has sufficient 
incineration capacity to neutralize hocs

the federal reserve board by raising a key 
bank lending rate is reassuring nervous financial markets that it 
has the political will to fight inflation in an election year 
economists say 
investors particularly foreign investors such as the japanese 
who are avid buyers of federal debt issued by the treasury have 
been wondering whether fed members all appointees of president 
reagan are willing to mete out the potentially painful medicine 
needed to cool an overheating economy 
now they should know said lyle e gramley a former fed 
member who is now chief economist of the mortgage bankers 
association of america 
on tuesday the board voted 60 to hike the discount rate the 
fee it charges for shortterm loans to member banks from 60 
percent to 65 percent analysts said a variety of other interest 
rates including those on home mortgages auto loans and credit 
cards are likely to climb in response 
changing the discount rate is the most dramatic move in the 
federal reserves arsenal for controlling the nations money supply 
since early march the board has made a series of less overt 
tightening moves pushing up the federal funds rate the interest 
banks charge each other for overnight loans by more than a 
percentage point to 775 percent 
many analysts noting that gop chances of keeping control of the 
white house are better if people are feeling prosperous had 
expected the fed to continue nudging up the federal funds rate as 
necessary while avoiding the abrupt action of raising the discount 
rate until after the elections 
ironically economists expectations may have played a role in 
prompting the fed to suprise them by acting sooner gramley said 
those sorts of comments certainly have not gone unnoticed 
at the federal reserve he said its not a situation they can 
afford to take lightly they need to convince markets that theyre 
operating with the longterm health of the economy in mind they 
are sending that signal with what they did 
the board in a statement said its decision reflects the 
intent of the federal reserve to reduce inflationary pressures 
although inflation of consumer prices for the first six months 
of the year was at 44 percent the same as last year there are 
signs of trouble ahead 
unemployment at 54 percent last month is near its 14year 
low also factories straining to meet both domestic and foreign 
demand are operating at their highest capacity levels in eight 
years 
the worry is that the scarcity of labor will push up wage rates 
it is also that the growth in jobs by putting money in peoples 
pockets will keep consumer demand high at the same time that 
factories are trying to produce more goods for export to meet 
overseas demand fueled by the devalued dollar 
the feds move is aimed at curbing this demandpull 
inflation the kind of price and wage increases that occur when 
there arent enough goods to go around or enough workers to perform 
needed services 
but the cure has its cost consumers will have to pay more to 
finance home auto and other purchases and as they slow their 
buying fewer new jobs will be created 
people with loan payments pegged to interest rate fluctuations 
such as adjustable rate mortgages and home equity loans will be 
among the first to feel the effects as their loan payments rise 
theyll have less money to pay for other goods and services 
i think the fed proved beyond any reasonable doubt that it 
does have a backbone and that it is willing to fight inflation even 
in an election year said david jones an economist with aubrey 
g lanston amp co a government securities dealer in new york 
but tightening the money supply now jones argued could be 
both good politics and good economics moving now rather than next 
week avoids imposing bad news on the republican national 
convention in new orleans and moving now may avoid a more 
wrenching action later 
if they had not done it now they may have been forced to 
tighten right in the teeth of an election jones said the 
timing is just about right we may now at least have a shot at a 
soft landing which is the way we can have sustained 
noninflationary growth 
tuesdays discount rate increase was the second rate hike since 
alan greenspan became fed chairman a year ago in september the 
central bank boosted the rate from 55 percent to 6 percent the 
first increase in three years 
last years increase was seen by analysts as greenspans 
attempt a month after succeeding the respected paul volcker to 
establish his inflationfighting credentials but some later 
criticized it as one of the factors precipitating the october stock 
market crash

the reagan administration says education and 
guidance should be sufficient to halt the waves of dirty needles 
and other infectious debris that have made east coast beach 
closures routine this summer 
jeffrey d denit of the environmental protection agency said 
tuesday that the agency has no plans to impose regulations for 
medical waste disposal despite a chorus of congressional criticism 
and public complaints 
he told a house subcommittee that educational efforts will 
remain the administrations key to fighting the medical waste 
problem and federal regulations will be used only if those fail 
but the congressional office of technology assessment said 
continuing reports of hospital waste floating up on shores from 
massachusetts to north carolina are graphic reminders of a 
beleaguered system that lacks federal standards 
no federal standards exist which comprehensively address the 
handling transportation treatment and disposal of biomedical 
waste said kathryn d wagner an analyst for ota the technical 
research arm of congress she added that less than a handful of 
states have truly comprehensive regulations 
ota in a preliminary assessment of the nations biomedical 
waste problem said the debrisridden beaches are symptoms of a 
deeper problem of inconsistency confusion and a lack of 
coordination both at and between every level of management 
rep ron wyden dore chairman of the house small business 
subcommittee on regulation and business opportunities called the 
hearing in the wake of a recent spate of beach closings 
beaches in new jersey and new york have been the hardest hit 
but hospital debris also has been reported in connecticut rhode 
island massachusetts maryland north carolina and on the lake 
erie shore in ohio 
this summers medical waste problem is far more serious than 
the bloody syringes and vile specimens that have washed up wyden 
said these foul products are only the residue of a national 
waste management system that is broken and overloaded 
wyden accused federal agencies of bungling the medical waste 
problem and attacked epa for failing to set minimum standards for 
handling transporting and disposing of medical wastes under the 
resource conservation and recovery act 
he also said the federal centers for disease control have failed 
to recommend guidelines for waste handling and that the 
occupational safety and health administration has not acted to 
protect health care workers from exposure to aids and hepatitis 
but denit said epa rejects mandatory regulations 
epas ongoing educational and technical assistance efforts 
should be sufficient to resolve these issues said denit deputy 
director of the office of solid waste epa will consider 
regulations only if education and guidance fail to improve current 
management practices 
denit added that studies indicate hospital waste is generally 
less virulent than typical domestic waste 
nevertheless congress is considering a variety of measures to 
toughen penalties and create a system to track hospital waste 
the senate voted 970 tuesday to ban the dumping of sludge off 
the new yorknew jersey coast after 1991 the measure included an 
amendment by sen christopher j dodd dconn banning the 
disposal of medical waste in oceans and streams and another by sen 
frank lautenberg dnj providing a fiveyear prison sentence for 
anyone caught violating the ban 
ota researchers plan to issue a report early next year on solid 
waste issues including medical waste but in a preliminary 
briefing given by wagner to the subcommittee the agency concluded 
lack of federal regulation has created a situation in which 
states fearful that a neighboring states more stringent law would 
bring added medical waste to their jurisdictions are 
leapfrogging one another to adopt the most stringent 
regulations 
evidence exists that hospitals and other healthcare employers 
in an attempt to limit liability are requiring workers to sign 
forms stating they have been trained in handling infectious 
materials after receiving only minimal training 
the majority of biomedical waste is now incinerated onsite 
but increasing state emission control regulations may lead more 
hospitals to hire waste haulers creating the potential for more 
transportation hazards and abuse by contractors trying to save 
money by dumping the waste in the ocean 
rhode island attorney general james e oneil showed the 
subcommittee a respirator tube a colostomy bag a bloodencrusted 
needle and other hospital waste that state officials have collected 
in recent weeks from rhode islands shores 
brooklyn district attorney elizabeth holtzman called for strict 
federal penalties and jail sentences for illegal dumpers and a 
manifest system to track the route of hospital throwaways 
infectious waste is essentially a loaded gun and should be 
legally recognized as such holtzman said

are you catholic do you know what penance 
means thats what its like to be a republican in massachusetts 
the words come from an aide to a top republican state 
legislator but they sum up the sentiments of most massachusetts 
republicans long the political minority in the state 
the ascendancy of the states top politician democratic 
presidential nominee michael s dukakis isnt making life any 
easier for the states republicans who are outnumbered by 
democrats 4 to 1 
republicans have not won a statewide election since 1972 of the 
states 11 congressmen one is republican only 33 of 160 members 
of the state house of representatives are republican and unless 
republicans win two state senate seats this fall they wont have 
enough votes to demand a roll call 
recent figures show that only 128 percent of the states voters 
are republican compared with 467 percent who are democrats 
well say lets have a caucus is there a phone booth 
available said former state rep and current white house aide 
andrew card 
still republicans like joe malone act optimistically malone 
has to because he may be the gops ultimate longodds guy as the 
challenger of edward m kennedy this november for the us senate 
seat kennedy has held since 1962 
when youre bucking a wellentrenched establishment you have 
to be tenacious persistent and look for areas of growth said 
malone 33 
all state republicans hope that 1988 will begin to erase the 
embarrassment of two years ago when a pair of republican primary 
candidates for governor were forced from the ticket in disgrace 
one had falsified his resume and it was reported that the 
secretary of the other candidate walked into his office one morning 
and found him nude a third had to be called in at the last minute 
to run against the heavily favored dukakis 
i compare us to the red sox we have all this potential 
said polly logan the republican national committeewoman and 
legendary fundraiser who comes from a family of powerful 
massacusetts democrats 
state republicans first lost their footing at the turn of the 
century when irish immigrants realized their political potential 
and began their domination of state politics 
many of the traditional boston brahmin republicans like former 
ambassador to the united nations henry cabot lodge jr former sen 
leverett saltonstall and former sen sinclair weeks sr are dead 
others like former gov francis sargent former us attorney 
general elliot richardson former state sen william saltonstall 
and former state committee chairman john sears are no longer very 
active in the party 
malone is an example of the new massacusetts republican one of 
seven children born to italian immigrant parents he was raised in 
workingclass waltham west of boston and a world apart from the 
tiny suburbs of the north shore that spawned many oldline 
republican stalwarts 
his father owned a trucking company and traveled to the boston 
docks every day for shipments the elder malone changed his name 
from mulone on the advice of a friend who suggested he would get 
better treatment from predominantly irish longshoremen and police 
though harvard educated malone sticks close to his roots and 
still lives in waltham 
white ethnics like malone are not unknown in the republican 
party in massachusetts in 1966 john volpe an italianamerican 
republican was elected governor party chairman ray shamie a 
conservative millionaire who entered state politics fairly 
recently is of syrian and french descent 
but for the most part malone said the republican party was 
viewed as representing the haves and the democrats the havenots 
he said some traditional yankee republicans have distanced 
themselves from his candidacy and prefer to concentrate on george 
bushs presidential campaign 
saltonstall the former state senator and son of leverett 
saltonstall said thats untrue we think hes great he said 
were glad to work with him

the financially strapped united nations 
created a 74 million observer corps tuesday to monitor a truce 
between iran and iraq but the secretarygeneral said i simply 
do not have the money to pay for it 
marrack goulding undersecretarygeneral in charge of 
peacekeeping operations said the general assembly probably would 
be summoned to special session this week to assess funds from the 
membership 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar told an american 
reporter you should advise your government to participate fully 
in these efforts for peace 
the united states which supports un peacemaking in the 
persian gulf and afghanistan has fallen 467 million behind in its 
un payments over several years it is assessed more than 200 
million annually onequarter of the regular budget 
us ambassador vernon a walters said i think the united 
states will meet its obligations and make its payments 
the new york times reported in wednesday editions that the 
united states is asking arab countries of the persian gulf to pay a 
higher share of the cost of the peacekeeping force and that such a 
sum could amount to 20 million 
it quoted assistant secretary of state richard s williamson as 
saying the us asked the arab countries for a special voluntary 
contribution toward the cost of the monitoring force since they 
are the chief beneficiaries 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the 
administration welcomed the ceasefire announcement and would bear 
its fair share of the cost of the observer force including 
transportation and equipment 
it is our understanding that there will be neither us nor 
soviet troops in the observer force he added it has been a 
major aim of the united states to bring this war to an end 
perez de cuellar announced monday that a ceasefire will begin 
aug 20 in the 8yearold war which has killed or wounded more 
than 1 million people and cost hundreds of billions of dollars the 
security council created the observer group which is part of the 
truce agreement 
twentyfive countries will provide the 350 unarmed observers 
paying the members they assign the 74 million including 47 
million in startup costs will cover the initial sixmonth 
authorization 
goulding told the associated press some observers already were 
on their way to the persian gulf he would not say how many or what 
countries they represented 
canadian foreign minister joe clark announced tuesday in ottawa 
that canada will contribute 385 military personnel to the 
peacekeeping force mostly communications specialists they are 
expected to start arriving in the region wednesday 
a un naval force the first in its history also may be 
created to patrol the disputed shatt alarab waterway that forms 
the southern border between iran and iraq 
defense secretary frank c carlucci said the united states will 
withdraw most of its naval forces from the gulf only when it is 
convinced the ceasefire has taken effect 
this will be the seventh un peacekeeping or observer group 
created by the 159member organization the others operate in 
afghanistan cyprus lebanon india pakistan syria and jerusalem 
the last two resulting from arabisraeli wars in 1973 and 1948 
respectively 
in iraq state television announced the ceasefire declaration 
after midnight declaring victory in the war and three days of 
celebration fireworks exploded over the tigris river and tens of 
thousands of rounds of ammunition were fired into the air 
tehran radio reported the truce at 7 am tuesday and iranians 
generally greeted it with relief tempered by skepticism about 
prospects for a lasting peace the military commander and 
parlimament speaker hashemi rafsanjani said iran will not attack 
but its soldiers will be prepared to repel the enemy 
perez de cuellar is expected to ask the general assembly for a 
special assessment on members in proportion to their regular 
contributions that means washington would be expected to pay the 
largest share 
i proceed on the assumption that the united states will come 
up with its full assessment of 25 percent or more goulding told 
a news conference 
walters said in his remarks to reporters after the security 
council meeting this proves definitively that the united nations 
has a purpose that it is useful to all peaceloving countries 
including the united states of america it has stopped the biggest 
war since world war ii 
goulding would not identify the 25 countries that will 
contribute soldiers and other personnel to the un iraniraq 
military observer group he said the list might be announced 
wednesday after approval and diplomatic formalities 
the five permanent security council members the united states 
britain china france and soviet union wont provide personnel

in a ceremony as old as their legislative 
body senators have sworn to do impartial justice in the 
impeachment trial of us district judge alcee l hastings but the 
trial wont happen until next year 
it was like a page of history tuesday as senators became judges 
and jurors in an impeachment case for only the 13th time in their 
history 
but the proceeding did more for history buffs than for advancing 
the impeachment case as senate majority leader robert byrd 
dwva announced that time constraints in the 100th congress will 
make a trial impossible until next year 
hastings who was not present at the senate session is the 
first defendant to be impeached after winning acquittal on similar 
charges at a criminal trial he also is the first black impeachment 
defendant 
the house formally presented 17 articles of impeachment along 
with its recommendation that the miami jurist be ousted for 
committing high crimes and misdemeanors 
language in the oath used to swear in senators and in a 
proclamation ordering them to keep silent on the pain of 
imprisonment was adopted for the first impeachment case in 
december 1798 
the senate at that time dismissed charges against sen william 
blount of tennessee saying a senator could not be impeached 
the house voted 4133 on aug 3 to impeach hastings accusing 
him of participating in a bribery conspiracy lying about the 
conspiracy at his criminal trial leaking confidential wiretap 
information and discrediting the federal judiciary 
impeachment is the way congress removes federal officials from 
office especially federal judges who are appointed for life after 
the house votes for impeachment akin to an indictment the senate 
conducts a trial in which conviction requires a twothirds majority 
of those present and voting 
senators approved a summons directing hastings to answer the 
impeachment articles by sept 8 
the rules committee was asked to report by sept 23 on whether 
the senate should use a committee to hear the evidence before the 
case is presented to the full chamber that system was used for the 
first time in the last impeachment trial which resulted in the 
conviction of harry e claiborne and his removal as a us district 
judge in las vegas nev 
the committee also is to report on the authority of the senate 
to receive impeachment articles in one congress and conduct a trial 
in another house precedents show it has been done twice before 
on tuesday house managers who function as prosecutors 
were led into the chamber by the house and senate sergeants at 
arms with chief manager peter w rodino jr dnj at the head 
of the line 
rodino chairman of the house judiciary committee was followed 
by fellow committee members hamilton fish of new york the ranking 
republican on the panel john conyers dmich chairman of the 
subcommittee that investigated hastings george gekas of 
pennsylvania the ranking republican on the subcommittee and rep 
john bryant dtexas 
while they sat at tables at the front of the chamber senate 
sergeant at arms henry giugni intoned a traditional proclamation 
hear ye hear ye hear ye all persons are commanded to keep 
silent on pain of imprisonment while the house of representatives 
is exhibiting to the senate of the united states articles of 
impeachment against alcee l hastings judge of the united states 
district court for the southern district of florida 
rodino then read every word of the 17 impeachment articles and 
when he finished traditional words were heard again as senators 
were sworn in 
you do solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the 
trial of the impeachment of judge alcee l hastings a judge of the 
united states district court for the southern district of florida 
now pending you will do impartial justice according to the 
constitution and laws so help you god 
the second most senior senator strom thurmond rsc first 
swore in the senior senator john stennis dmiss stennis then 
swore in thirdranking sen william proxmire dwis proxmire then 
swore in the rest of the senate 
the house has impeached 15 federal officials in its history 
twelve cases have gone to trial in the senate two officials 
resigned prior to senate proceedings and five all federal judges 
have been convicted by the senate and removed from office

woodstock the rock festival that came to 
symbolize the 1960s for a generation of americans is again at the 
center of a controversy this time over how big its 20th 
anniversary celebration should be 
on one side is the bethel town board which meets tonight to 
discuss whether to allow voters decide what to do about next 
augusts anniversary if a referendum is agreed upon it would be 
placed on novembers ballot town supervisor alan scott said 
tuesday 
on the other side are concert promoters who want to recreate 
the original woodstock which wasnt actually held in that ulster 
county town but miles away on max yasgurs farm in bethel sullivan 
county 
scott said his town is against any rock extravaganza on the 
scale of the first woodstock which drew nearly a half million 
people and endured heavy rains lack of food and sanitation 
facilities drug overdoses and massive traffic jams 
scott said the town wants to recognize the anniversary but in a 
lowkey manner the problems created during the 1969 festival are 
still fresh in the minds of residents he said 
it really raised havoc in this area scott said it was a 
thorn in the side of many many residents at the time 
he said that as a result of the threeday concert held aug 
1517 1969 the town passed a mass assembly law that prohibits 
gatherings of more than 10000 people 
in august 1986 town officials did erect a roadside marker at 
the site of the concert 
scott said at least five promoters have approached the town 
board this year about staging another woodstock festival 
some have talked about bringing back such woodstock performers 
as country joe fish and richie havens scott said 
other performers such as crosby stills amp nash and santana 
still draw large concert crowds today 
the general feeling is that we certainly dont want any 
massive gathering anywhere near the proportion of what we had 
scott said 
scott said the board already has rejected a promoters offer of 
200000 to allow the concert to be staged 
we recognize the importance of the event we realize the 
historical significance but we are looking for something tasteful 
not more than a oneday event and not more than 10000 people he 
said 
in august 1984 the 15th anniversary of woodstock was celebrated 
at the posh grossingers resort and country club in grossinger 
ny about 5 miles from yasgurs farm 
about 700 people showed up including abbie hoffman and 
woodstock performers john sebastian and david clayton thomas

blueprints for abolishing most tariffs and 
many other barriers to trade with canada are headed for a senate 
vote this week after winning a strong endorsement in the house 
this is the crowning achievement of this president and this 
administration on the trade front rep philip m crane rill 
said as the house voted 36640 to approve the pact signed in 
january by president reagan and canadian prime minister brian 
mulroney 
the bill would authorize the president to phase out most tariffs 
on canadian imports over the next decade it also envisions ending 
an array of other trade restrictions 
the senate is expected to act on the measure this week and send 
it to reagans desk it won approval tuesday from the senate 
finance committee 
but canadian counterpart legislation is stalled in that nations 
appointive senate where it is running into liberal party 
opposition 
lawmakers here are saying the agreement is needed in part as a 
balance to rising protectionism within the european economic 
community 
many europeans are talking about free trade as being something 
for europeans within that bloc i hope they dont go that way 
said democratic vice presidential candidate lloyd bentsen dtexas 
the chairman of the senate finance committee 
the agreement would not set up a common market between the 
united states and canada that would mean adopting the same set of 
tariffs for products produced in third countries 
the freetrade agreement allows the united states and canada to 
maintain their own set of thirdcountry tariffs while dropping most 
tariffs on the annual 166 billion in goods and services traded 
across their common border 
the united states already has a freetrade agreement with israel 
tariffs currently apply to about 25 percent of uscanada trade 
advocates claim the pact will result in increased us exports 
and resulting jobs while lowering consumer prices but some 
industries are complaining that they are likely to get hurt 
the blueprint immediately would drop 10 percent of existing 
tariffs applying to goods ranging from telecommunications gear to 
whiskey and rum the rest would be phased out over 10 years 
under the pact it would become easier for americans to invest 
in canada and canadians to invest in this country barriers to a 
wide array of exports of services would be swept away but 
transportation and cultural services would be exempted 
the agreement would eliminate barriers to import and export of 
crude oil petroleum products natural gas coal electricity 
uranium and other nuclear fuels 
tariffs on autos and auto parts which account for a third of 
trade between the two countries would be eliminated ninetyfive 
percent of such trade between the two countries already moves 
without tariffs 
to get the dutyfree treatment however autos and auto parts 
would have to be 50 percent manufactured in north america the 
provision is aimed at japanese and korean auto assembly plants in 
canada 
autostate lawmakers for the most part supported the measure 
based on a promise that us trade officials would try to negotiate 
a provision under which dutyfree treatment would be restricted to 
automotive products with a minimum of 60 percent north american 
content 
rep byron dorgan dnd said the agreement would leave us 
with canadian agricultural markets that are largely closed to 
american agricultural producers and american markets that are 
largely open to canadian agricultural producers and im concerned 
about that 
a chief problem he said have been canadian rail subsidies for 
grain shipped throught that countrys big port at thunder bay ont 
american producers receive nothing comparable and thus are at a 
disadvantage he said 
under the pact the canadians agreed to end rail subsidies for 
grain shipped through their west coast port of vancouver 
rep hal daub rneb said he was confident that the measure 
would protect not only wheat but corn sugar and dry edible beans 
from a wave of canadian imports 
he also said the agreement would raise the prospects of success 
in the current uruguay round of trade talks and thus end the 
subsidy shootout in which the only winners are the giddy greedy 
buyers happily snatching up agricultural commodities at prices 
below the cost of production

nasa began the final countdown 
tuesday for firing the space shuttle discoverys huge main engines 
a hotfire test that must be passed before the craft can make its 
longdelayed return to space 
the 22second firing of discoverys three engines was set for 
730 am edt wednesday weather conditions appeared favorable 
kennedy space centers countdown clocks frozen at the 11hour 
mark after a similar test was scrubbed last week began ticking at 
610 pm as scheduled the countdown included three hold 
periods totaling two hours and 20 minutes for any timeconsuming 
tasks that might crop up 
at 1150 pm the launch team began pumping 385000 gallons of 
liquid hydrogen and 143000 gallons of liquid oxygen propellant 
into discoverys 154foottall external fuel tank 
engineers made a late computer change to avoid a possible 
recurrence of last weeks test shutdown when an electronic sensor 
erroneously indicated that a valve was not closing properly on the 
no 2 engine 
although the offending unit was replaced engineers worried that 
a valve sensor on the no 3 engine might also be error prone and 
repeat the scrub rather than replace the position indicator they 
changed computer instructions to allow more leeway in the report of 
the valves position 
the engines were expected to develop 11 million pounds of 
thrust but use only a fraction of the fuel 
discovery was fastened to its launch pad by eight bolts each 
three feet long and three inches in diameter during the test each 
engine was to fire on a staggered schedule that totals 22 seconds 
the two solid fuel booster rockets that flank the shuttle tank were 
not to be ignited 
the test has been delayed five times because of problems with 
ground equipment and thursday because an electronic sensor 
mistakenly reported a closed valve as open 
the national aeronautics and space administration said it will 
announce a launch date for discovery after the engines and ship are 
certified for flight the date has slipped from july last year to 
february then june then midaugust then late september it 
appears now to be possible no earlier than october 
when discovery finally flies with a fiveman crew it will end 
a 2year nearhiatus in american space activity that began with 
the explosion of the space shuttle challenger on jan 28 1986 
nasa normally performs shuttle flight readiness tests only on 
new ships but it is requiring them for discovery which has flown 
six times because of the many modifications on both ship and 
engines and because of the length of time since the last mission

safety tests using aids patients are beginning 
wednesday on a new type of genetically engineered drug which 
researchers hope will open new avenues to attack the virus that 
causes the disease 
the drug called cd4 mimics a protein normally found on the 
surface of certain immune system cells that are susceptible to the 
aids virus 
researchers hope the experimental drug will in effect fool the 
deadly virus into harmlessly attaching itself to the injected 
substance rather than latching onto similar receptors on immune 
system cells 
approval for the tests beginning on aids patients at the 
national cancer institute was obtained several months ago similar 
studies are to begin in a few days at san francisco general 
hospital and new england deaconess hospital in boston 
about 50 patients will be involved in the first round of tests 
designed to determine the safety of the drug rather than its 
effectiveness however scientists also will be looking for 
evidence the drug manufactured by genetech inc of san francisco 
counters the growth of the virus by enticing it to attach to the 
cells of the drug rather than to immune system cells

he married a movie actress and now hes 
hollywoodbound but its clear the city that won wayne gretzky 
renown as the greatest ice hockey player of his time has scored 
more than a few points with him 
gretzky said at a news conference tuesday that he wanted the 
trade from the edmonton oilers to the los angeles kings for 
personal reasons for the benefit of wayne gretzky my new wife 
and our expected child in the new year 
then the great gretzky was overcome with emotion 
there comes a time when he said before pausing he 
rubbed bleary eyes trying to regain his composure then seemed to 
give up without continuing he stood up and walked away from the 
microphones 
gretzky said his wife los angelesbased actress janet jones 
did not ask him to seek a trade its my own gut feeling he 
said the two were married july 16 
gretzky led the oilers to four stanley cup championships in the 
last five seasons he holds or shares 49 national hockey league 
scoring records 
the trade involved four other players three firstround draft 
choices and more than 10 million 
oilers president glen sather also with tears in his eyes said 
he hated to trade gretzky but it was a good deal for wayne the 
oilers and the national hockey league 
but oiler fans reacted swiftly to news of the trade callers 
jammed the 21 telephone lines at the team offices some threatening 
to cancel season tickets

behind the facade of nonpartisanship that 
characterized the recent meeting of the nationss governors were 
some highly partisan discussions of michael dukakis role in his 
states economic revival 
among republicans at the national governors association that 
ended tuesday there was clear concern that dukakis has scored well 
among voters with an appeal that emphasizes his tenure as steward 
of the socalled massachusetts miracle 
as republicans prepare to nominate george bush for president 
they hope to use their national convention opening monday in new 
orleans to raise questions about the dukakis record they hope to 
portray a vote for the democrat as risking a reversal of the 
economic and foreign policy gains they claim as the legacy of 
ronald reagans presidency 
among the democratic governors at the bipartisan national 
governors association meeting there was a determination to keep 
the message of competence before the voters in their states 
we have one of our own running one we have consistently 
admired not just politically but intellectually said gov jim 
blanchard of michigan chairman of the democratic governors 
association after a strategy session tuesday with dukakis 
dukakis responded that his democratic colleagues are going to 
be an essential part of this campaign 
as expected voters will get a sharply different picture of the 
dukakis record from his republican colleagues 
at a meeting the same day of the republican governors 
association statistics were distributed designed to show that the 
massachusetts economy is lagging behind other new england states 
all of which are enjoying a boom 
the gop numbers compared employment statistics in 1982 and 1987 
and said that massachusetts ranked last among the six new england 
states in the percentage increase in new jobs 
using the same two years for comparison the gop figures ranked 
massachusetts fourth in the percentage increase in housing starts 
the gop governors also received labor department statistics 
comparing the job growth between january 1983 and january 1988 
numbers that showed massachusetts ranked 33rd in the nation 
but the republicans also were stuck with figures that showed 
dukakis home state ranked first in new england in the increase in 
per capita income and had the regions second lowest unemployment 
rate 
the effort to chip away at the dukakis record was part of a gop 
strategy that became increasingly apparent at the governors 
meeting as well as in new orleans 
in an appearance before the republican platform committee vice 
president bush described his opponent as the stealth candidate 
for keeping his position on issues invisible 
and at the governors meeting republican gov george deukmejian 
of california said the only thing the democrats have going for 
them is their saying its time for a change 
but while republican governors were trying to portray dukakis as 
an unknown quantiy they also were prodding bush to make his vision 
clearer to the voters 
i dont think george bush has been able to articulate his 
vision to the satisfaction of voters in wisconsin said that 
states republican governor tommy thompson 
people are confused about his views on the issues said 
another bush supporter gov tom kean of new jersey 
meanwhile democratic governors clearly were pleased that 
dukakis has made a point of including them in his campaign 
blanchard recalled that four years ago democratic nominee 
walter mondale didnt meet with his partys governors until october 
the fact that we are having this meeting in early august bodes 
well he said

climbed from 14 million to 18 million under his guidance 
wayne williams an executive of first interstate bank said a 
check of records indicated strote had saved the estate 11 million

companion for six years before his death had wanted to take 
control of the foundation

friendship the republican party believes that we must continue to 
encourage the abandonment of political repression in china and 
moves toward freer markets 
middle east republicans reject the concept of a palestinian 
state between jordan and israel such a state would pose a grave 
threat to the security interests of the united states and israel 
serving as a breeding ground for future radical and terrorist 
activities it says the plo should have no role in the peace 
process unless it recognizes israels right to exist 
apartheid republicans deplore the apartheid system of south 
africa republicans call for an effective and coordinated policy 
that will promote equal rights and a peaceful transition to a truly 
representative constitutional form of government for all south 
africa says actions designed to pressure the government of 
south africa must not have the effect of adversely affecting the 
rising aspirations and achievements of black south african 
entrepreneurs and workers 
strategic defense initiative sdi represents americas single 
most important defense program it is the most significant 
investment we can make in our nations future security we are 
commited to deployment of sdi as soon as possible

film critics gave a lukewarm 
reception tuesday to the last temptation of christ a new 
interpretation of the life of jesus that has been denounced 
unseen by some christians and has raised countercharges that some 
of the criticism is antisemitic 
the film which opens to the public friday depicts jesus as a 
troubled guiltridden man uncertain of his destiny and tempted to 
resist what christians believe is his divinity 
the 2hour movie describes jesus career leading to the 
crucifixion then during his agony on the cross he sees a little 
girl she says shes his guardian angel sent by god who doesnt 
want him to die in pain 
she removes him from the cross and takes him to mary magdalene 
who tends his wounds he lives out his life as a man first 
marrying mary magdalene and then another woman after her death 
as an old man dying his disciples come to him judas reveals 
the angel to be satan calls jesus a weakling and tells him that 
god wanted him to die on the cross and that he should do as god 
intended the last scene is jesus smiling death on the cross 
the movie carries an r rating but less for sex than for gore 
although there are shots of bodies naked from the waist up in river 
scenes with john the baptist mary magdalene plying her trade as a 
prostitute and the scene that has most outraged theological 
opponents jesus having sex with mary magdalene 
at the start of the movie is a notice saying that it was based 
on greek author nikos kazantzakis 1955 novel the last temptation 
of christ and not on the gospels 
film critics who viewed the movie in a universal studios 
screening room including michael medved of sneak previews 
charles champlin of the los angeles times and bob thomas of the 
associated press said they were unimpressed overall 
an intellectual exercise of the what if variety thomas 
said at times moving often overwrought and at least 40 minutes 
too long 
its the height of irony that this level of controversy could 
be generated by a movie this awful said medved i can 
understand why the religious groups would be offended as would the 
public by this boredom 
protestant fundamentalists notably the rev donald wildmon a 
united methodist minister who heads the american family association 
in tupelo miss and the rev jerry falwell have been campaigning 
against the movie their protests have escalated since universal 
pictures rejected pleas to destroy the film or sell it to them for 
destruction 
universal responded by accusing protesters of censorship and 
moving up the release date from sept 23 to friday 
as the critics watched tuesday 150 christian protesters none 
of whom had seen the film rallied on another part of the massive 
studio lot to castigate universal and its parent company mca 
incthey held a mock crucifixion with a bloodied jesus screaming in 
agony as a man portraying mca chairman lew wasserman nailed him to 
a 10foot cross 
wasserman encountered later as he walked to the mca commissary 
would not acknowledge a reporters questions about the film and 
controversy 
critics of the protesters have accused some of verging into 
antijewish attacks other christian ministers denounced an earlier 
march led by the rev rl hymers pastor of fundamentalist baptist 
tabernacle at a synagogue where he thought wasserman worshiped 
there was no demonstration outside a new york screening 
the us catholic conference said tuesday that it is urging the 
nations 53 million catholics not to see the film spokesman 
richard hirsch called it a bgrade muddleheaded movie 
however the conference said that although the film is clearly 
contrary to the teachings of the church public protests would 
give it more publicity 
members of other churches such as the episcopal bishop of new 
york said after a preview they would not oppose the films release 
the 65 million movie was directed by martin scorsese taxi 
driver and raging bull and stars willem dafoe platoon 
as jesus barbara hershey hannah and her sisters as mary 
magdalene and rocker david bowie as pontius pilate 
i am not surprised at people being shocked by the idea of 
it scorsese said tuesday night in an appearance on abctvs 
nightline program 
i think there are people out there who want to see it and want 
to have this spiritual experience i believe a moving experience 
scorsese said 
wildmon and falwell complained that they were turned away by 
universal from screenings tuesday in new york and los angeles 
wildmon was refused because you have chosen to speak out 
against mca inc and universal pictures with regard to the film 
without seeing it and because you rejected our earlier offer to 
see the film on july 12 said a letter from universal 
the studio noted falwells criticism in withdrawing its 
invitation to him said falwell spokesman mark demoss the former 
moral majority leader has joined other ministers in calling for a 
boycott of mca universals parent corporation and its 
subsidiaries 
we just thought they would have respected the rights of 
millions and millions of christians who objected to the film but 
obviously all they think about is money said larry poland a 
christian media consultant who helped advise universal on the film 
before withdrawing in protest after a bootleg script was circulated

roy innis the national chairman of the congress 
of racial equality shoved the rev al sharpton to the ground 
during the taping of a nationally syndicated television program 
tuesday 
the two men managed to regain their composure and continue the 
discussion of leadership in the black community said bill boggs 
executive producer of the morton downey jr show 
but sharpton said they will have it out in a benefit boxing 
match next month boggs said 
the incident occurred during taping of the often heated talk 
show at the apollo theatre in harlem 
during earlier taping monday night al sharpton started to 
make some derogatory remarks about roy innis boggs said downey 
then arranged for the two men to come facetoface the next night 
during taping tuesday sharpton made a few statements early in 
the show that basically questioned innis ability and his authority 
as a black leader today and for whom he was speaking and 
criticized him for kowtowing to state attorney general robert 
abrams boggs said 
abrams is the special prosecutor in the case of tawana brawley 
a black dutchess county teenager who claims she was abducted and 
sexually assaulted by a group of white men under the guidance of 
her advisers who include sharpton miss brawley has refused to 
cooperate with the investigation 
innis cited his own appearance on a downey show in june 
according to boggs innis told sharpton that during that show he 
had come to sharptons defense in spite of all those 
shenanigans in the case 
a screaming match ensued with sharpton yelling thats not 
true 
innis stood up and was basically telling sharpton to let him 
speak and towered over him the producer said as the rotund 
sharpton started to get up innis pushed him sharpton fell into 
the chair and toppled over backwards onto the floor 
sharpton was not hurt but he leapt up and a lot of people 
rushed onto the stage boggs said 
downey brought things back under control within about 20 minutes 
and there was no other physical confrontation he said 
boggs said the show is scheduled to air aug 30

leftist law professor rodrigo borja who 
today replaces an archconservative as ecuadors president has 
pledged renewed ties with nicaragua and an end to the nations free 
market economy 
borja leader of the democratic left party succeeds leon febres 
cordero a bitter political rival and president reagans closest 
ally in south america 
a champion of free enterprise during his fouryear term febres 
cordero was barred from reelection by the constitution 
borja who describes himself as a leftist but not a marxist 
defeated populist candidate abdala bucaram in a runoff may 8 
presidents fidel castro of cuba and daniel ortega of nicaragua 
were among foreign leaders who came to ecuador for todays 
inauguration and castro took a swipe at the united states in his 
arrival statement tuesday 
in a brief speech at the quito airport he praised the good 
relations he said exist between his communist country and ecuador 
they are a proof of independence in the face of those who 
would like to see us not so united castro said in an obvious 
reference to the united states 
castro rarely travels abroad and his visit was seen as a sign 
of strong support for the borja government 
borja has criticized ecuadors proamerican foreign policy and 
said he would seek close ties to the nonaligned movement 
nevertheless us officials say they expect to be able to work 
with borja and note that friends and foes consider him a highly 
intelligent and honest political leader 
borja may prove to be a problem for the us at times but he 
is no threat to democracy in ecuador said one us official who 
spoke on condition he not be identified 
secretary of state george p shultz was to represent the united 
states at the inauguration 
this coloradosize nation of 10 million on the northwestern 
shoulder of south america returned to democracy in 1979 after nine 
years of civilian and military dictatorships 
borja said one of his first official acts after being sworn in 
would be to renew diplomatic relations with nicaragua where the 
leftist government has been fighting usbacked contra rebels 
ties were broken in october 1985 after febres cordero accused 
ortega of insulting him by calling him a pawn of us foreign 
policy 
borja 53 is a longtime political foe of febres cordero 57 
and lost a bitterly fought runoff to him in 1984 he vowed to 
dismantle febres corderos freemarket economic program which he 
blames for the countrys bleak economic situation 
the economy shrank by 35 percent in 1987 annual inflation is 
running at nearly 60 percent and less than half the work force is 
employed fulltime 
no payments have been made since january on ecuadors 92 
billion foreign debt the nation is now more than a billion dollars 
in arrears 
the febres cordero government blamed the economic slide on the 
collapse of world oil prices and devastating earthquakes that 
crippled ecuadors oil industry for nearly six months in 1987 
borja said he will respect private enterprise but announced he 
will impose exchange controls restrict imports to save scarce 
dollar reserves and regulate prices of basic consumer goods to 
fight inflation 
he has also announced plans for a more restrictive foreign 
investment policy and a moratorium on foreign debt payments if 
creditors do not agree to negotiate easier terms 
in the present situation of an economic crisis payment of the 
foreign debt is simply not possible he said recently 
the bitter rivalry between borja and febres cordero flared in 
recent weeks creating problems in the transition of power febres 
cordero announced he would boycott the inauguration and not hand 
over the presidential sash to his successor 
borja accused febres cordero of trying to sabotage the new 
government by creating economic problems for him before he took 
office he charged that the outgoing government deliberately fueled 
inflation by running up a budget deficit of 11 percent 
interior minister heinz moeller in turn accused borja and his 
associates of needless whining and said they should instead 
dedicate their time to publicizing the details of their economic 
program to ease fears among business leaders

a massachusetts mother of a disabled child 
says she told george bush his proposed federal program for child 
care is certainly a good beginning but said she had some 
questions as well 
the vice president called kathleen mulligan mother of a 
2yearold with downs syndrome on tuesday 
the woman has worked for change in federal aid programs since 
december 1986 when she was told her daughter was ineligible for 
supplemental security income payments while either the child or the 
childs father lived at home care kenneth mulligan earned more 
than the 22800 income cap at the time 
my direct quote to the vice president was that this program is 
certainly a good beginning mrs mulligan 36 said of the phone 
call 
but mrs mulligan said she remains wary because she has yet to 
learn how the program will work i asked for the cap to be lifted 
so that it could affect all people nationwide she said 
she said she asked him a number of questions about how the 
program would work he said that when he returned to washington 
he would relay those questions to the proper people she said

the best bet for the no 2 spot on the 
republican ticket is a westerner or midwesterner and almost 
certainly not a woman george bushs iowa campaign manager predicts 
and he said pairing bush with former republican presidential 
rival bob dole would be the strongest ticket for iowa 
i think bob dole could probably do more to help the ticket in 
iowa than any other prospective vice presidential candidate said 
george wittgraf i think theres a good chance the ticket will 
include a midwesterner or a westerner 
in any case wittgraf predicted the second spot wont go to a 
woman because that would be viewed by voters as tokenism that 
would hurt certain gop nominee bush 
it would be viewed first as putting a woman on the ticket 
wittgraf said many people would view that as political tokenism 
she wouldnt be judged on her merits she would be judged as a 
woman

a divided appeals panel granted yonkers a 
temporary reprieve from bankrupting fines hours after a state board 
took control of the citys finances in a dispute over housing 
desegregation 
i knew we could find sanity outside judge leonard sands 
courtroom said city council minority leader nicholas longo who 
was found in contempt by the us district judge for refusing to 
endorse sands housing desegregation plan 
three other councilmen and the city also were declared in 
contempt and subjected to fines since the aug 2 council vote that 
defied the desegregation order 
the oneweek stay granted tuesday by the 2nd us circuit court 
of appeals staved off layoffs due to the citys 100aday fine 
which has been doubled daily city officials had predicted layoffs 
would begin as early as next tuesday 
for longo and the three other councilmen the stay halted their 
500aday personal fines which did not double and removed sands 
threat of imprisonment he made had their contempt continued through 
today 
the appellate panel split 21 on whether to grant the request to 
stay the fines the majority decision said the city and council 
members barely satisfied the standards for a stay pending 
appeal the judges set arguments before the full appeals panel 
for aug 17 
earlier the yonkers emergency financial control board created 
in 1984 when the state bailed out yonkers from imminent bankruptcy 
agreed to assume the fiscal powers of the city council and raised 
the spectre of criminal charges against the defiant councilmen 
in short our goal is to save yonkers from itself said new 
york secretary of state gail shaffer who heads the emergency board 
the board has sweeping powers to control spending in new yorks 
fourthlargest city but it cannot enact the zoning changes that 
would allow sands housing plan to go forward 
the board voted 51 to impose a wage and hiring freeze and made 
council members subject to misdemeanor charges if they refuse to 
abide by board rules those rules forbid city officials from 
incurring debts the city cannot pay the target of the vote is the 
four council members who voted against the desegregation resolution 
in 1985 sand found the city liable for intentionally 
segregating its schools and housing over a 40year period the 
council reached a settlement with the judge in january but a 
public uproar followed and officials recanted 
last week the council voted 43 against a resolution endorsing 
construction of 800 units of middleincome housing throughout the 
city of 194000 people by private developers the judge 
specifically asked them to endorse it and the measure also 
contained zoning changes and a package of financial incentives 
mayor nicholas wasicsko who canceled a lastditch council 
meeting he had called for tonight after the stay was granted said 
he did not think the emergency boards actions would have the 
desired effect the only thing that will make any difference is 
the threat of removal of the dissident council members from 
office he said 
only gov mario cuomo can remove an elected official and he has 
said he does not want to get involved until the legal process is 
completed 
lawyers for the defiant councilmen argued that sand exceeded his 
authority by ordering the city council to pass legislation for the 
housing plan 
there are limits to a federal courts authority even to remedy 
an unconstitutional action said james d harmon attorney for 
councilman peter chema 
but michael sussman attorney for the national assocation for 
the advancement of colored people said the appeals court had a 
duty to uphold sand 
the dignity of the federal court is under assault said 
sussman by a group of citizens who think theyre above the law

the controversial movie the last temptation 
of christ sees jesus longing for a woman and family as the 
biggest threat to his calling but that isnt the way scripture 
tells it 
he was tempted and tempted hard by some of the most distorting 
urges of human history the lures of power wealth and glory on 
the threshhold of his ministry as portrayed in luke 4 
the movie previewed tuesday offers an altered representation 
of this episode adding female enticement to it as a main snare 
yet also retaining the tug to worldly power jesus is jolted loose 
from both 
the movie which opens in some theaters friday has stirred a 
storm of protests and condemnations by some christians 
most of them hadnt seen it certain lewd dialogue they reported 
wasnt there although there was much blood and violence common in 
romeruled judea 
some christian leaders who have seen the movie while 
criticizing elements of it cite valid aspects particularly in 
trying to explore tensions between jesus conceived humanity and 
godhood 
he is regarded both fully god and fully man one who in every 
respect has been tempted as we are scripture says yet without 
sin 
in the movie he is depicted as an anxious uncertain and 
wavering individual hardly the strong yet tender and compelling 
jesus of scripture yet in the movie he realizes his special role 
from the start 
one morning he god brushed over me like a cool breeze and 
said stand up jesus relates as he undertakes the movie 
version of his ministry but he is continually beset with 
hesitations and fear 
fear was not unknown to the scriptural jesus although specified 
only on that last night before his arrest and crucifixion when he 
prayed to be freed of the ordeal yet submitted to it 
this also occurs in imagined fashion in the movie which brings 
cinematic suppositions to many biblical episodes ejection from 
nazareth healing of a blind man raising of lazarus saving of a 
loose woman from stoning storming of the temple peters denial 
the movie is explicitly fiction based on a novel by greek 
author nikos kazanzakis and not bound to the scriptural record 
that record sometimes offers possible hints to the movies 
elaborations 
some twists however were sheer conjecture such as theorizing 
that in jesus early days as a carpenter he made crosses for roman 
executions and that he later purposely arranged with judas to 
betray him 
also entirely contrived was a lengthy dream sequence in which 
jesus while dying on the cross envisions himself leaving the 
cross while under the persuasion of an angel and living 
naturally as he often had wanted to do 
he is shown having sexual relations with mary magdalene for 
whom he had suppressed his yearnings in the dream she dies and 
then he is married to mary the sister of the scriptural martha 
and has children 
as an old man his apostles confront him upbraiding him for not 
being crucified and resurrected as he promised for not being 
the door bringing god and man together for not being a 
sacrfice 
he realizes then that the angel that had called him off the 
cross was actually satan jesus crawls back toward reality saying 
i want to pay the price i want salvation i want to be crucified 
and rise again 
back in torture on the cross he smiles and shouts at the end 
it is accomplished 
the movie contains some nudity including women in the crowd to 
which john the baptist was preaching but it isnt erotic however 
the concentration on mary magdalene as jesus potential pitfall 
diverges from the gospel 
jesus liked women scripture makes clear visited with them 
conversed with them in public contrary to custom and had women 
among his followers which was most unconventional for a 
firstcentury rabbi 
in fact women supported his ministry as brought out in luke 
83 and only women friends stayed with him to the end while the 
apostles hid in fear 
but to regard natural sexuality as evil is contrary to the 
biblical world and to imply that the presence of that drive in 
jesus was wrong reflects an ancient christian heresy docetism 
which dehumanized jesus considering his body only a phantom 
kazanzakis apparently influenced by such thinking seemed to 
regard physical instincts in jesus as contrary to godliness

a new type of genetically engineered aids drug 
is being tested starting today on human victims of the deadly 
disease at the national cancer institute 
the first round of tests is designed to assess the safety of the 
drug called cd4 rather than its effectiveness but researchers 
hope the drug will open new avenues to attack the virus that causes 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
the drug mimics a protein normally found on the surface of 
immune system cells that are susceptible to the aids virus 
researchers hope the experimental drug will in effect fool the 
deadly virus into harmlessly attaching itself to the injected 
substance rather than the similar receptors on immune system cells 
similar studies will begin in a few days at san francisco 
general hospital and new england deaconess hospital in boston 
about 50 patients will be involved in the first round of tests 
of the drug which is manufactured by genentech inc of south san 
francisco calif 
aids is a contagious disease that attacks the bodys immune 
system rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and 
infections the virus most often is spread through close contact 
with blood blood products or semen from infected persons its 
chief victims have been homosexual men and intravenous drug users 
as of monday aids had been diagnosed in 70208 americans of 
whom more than half 39620 had died according to the federal 
centers for disease control no one is known to have recovered from 
aids

cia director william h webster says the soviets 
are trying harder than ever to tap into us intelligence and that 
security breaches in the last three years have cost the united 
states billions of dollars 
in a speech tuesday to the american bar association he said he 
has set up a special counterintelligence agency to protect the 
cias foreign operations 
this center was badly needed too many things were falling 
between chairs he told the associations annual meeting about 
12000 lawyers are attending the weeklong convention which ends 
today 
over the past three years we have discovered more 
penetrations of the us defense and intelligence communities than 
at any time in our history said webster who took over the 
central intelligence agency in may 1987 after 10 years as director 
of the federal bureau of investigation 
the costs of these compromises are estimated in the billions 
of dollars he added 
the soviet intelligence services the kgb and gru represent 
by far the most significant intelligence threat despite soviet 
glasnost and perestroika weve actually seen an increase this year 
in soviet atempts to recruit us sources he said 
glasnost is the name of soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs 
drive for greater discussion on selected subjects perestroika is 
his program to make soviet economy more efficient 
webster a former us court of appeals judge said the soviets 
were more aggressive and more sophisticated than ever in their 
search for information on us nuclear strategic forces foreign 
policy nato technology american intelligence sources and 
methods and congressional intentions 
he cited two cases this summer both involving canada the 
arrest of canadian stephen ratkai on charges of trying to pass us 
military secrets to the soviet union in newfoundland and the 
expulsion or barring from canada of 17 soviet officials for 
allegedly attempting to steal us military and commercial 
technology in montreal 
webster said the cia and fbi were working closely together in 
offensive and defensive measures to counter foreign spies 
he said the cia collected information on 253 terrorist threats 
around the world over the past 3 years and he cited one success 
and one failure when warnings were relayed into the field 
in one such case the agency received a report that terrorists 
planned to assassinate the senior american diplomat in a major 
eastern country when he arrived for a meeting he arranged for 
the meeting to be held elsewhere and escaped the attempt on his 
life 
sadly just a few days ago a similar warning was issued to 
another figure in south america the warning was not heeded and he 
was assassinated 
cia public affairs director william baker said the director 
intentionally did not name the two people involved and that the 
agency would not comment further 
webster said terrorism was again on the increase from 500 
incidents in 1981 to almost 800 in 1985 and a projected 900 this 
year 
about half of these terrorist incidents worldwide are directed 
against us persons and property he said 
however he credited fbi intelligencegathering with checking 
terrorist bombings and other attacks within the united states down 
from 100 a year to less than a dozen in the last two years

amnesty international today accused india of 
covering up alleged human rights abuses by its security forces and 
said there are credible reports that indian police have murdered 
scores of religious minorities 
the indian government accused the international human rights 
organization of biased and distorted reporting 
in a 26page report on india amnesty international said it 
heard of dozens of prisoners being tortured and dying in police 
custody the londonbased organization also said an investigation 
into an alleged police massacre of 80 moslem villagers had been 
kept secret 
amnesty cited an official failure to clamp down on lawlessness 
by indias national and state security forcesand called on the 
government of the worlds largest democracy to investigate 
many victims were involved in violence themselves and have 
killed civilians and security personnel notably in punjab 
amnesty said in a statement accompanying the review which covered 
the past 18 months but action taken against them has 
transgressed international human rights standards 
the group said the report was sent to indian prime minister 
rajiv gandhi in june but that gandhi did not reply 
the report says most of the alleged victims were political 
activists or members of poor underprivileged groups 
it says amnesty was told by a punjab civil rights group which 
it did not identify that security forces killed more than 70 sikhs 
in fake or staged encounters between may 12 and aug 22 last year 
in the northern states amritsar district 
sikhs a religious minority in india are fighting for a 
separate homeland in punjab where they have slight majority they 
claim discrimination by the majority hindus 
amnesty said the group claimed another 50 sikhs were killed in 
similar encounters in punjabs faridkot district between may 12 and 
july 29 of last year 
there certainly has been too great a pattern of encounter 
killings over the years for it to be dismissed as the odd isolated 
case said amnesty international spokesman sean stiles 
similar killings by military and police forces have been 
reported in bihar andhra pradesh and manipur states with security 
forces having shootonsight powers granted in 1986 the report 
said 
they the reports of killings have gained in credibility 
through circumstantial evidence the report said 
on the alleged massacre of 80 moslems amnesty said a civil 
rights group claimed to have detailed evidence that police carried 
out the killings including of children as young as 3 during 
hindumoslem clashes in uttar pradesh in may 1987 
the report said witnesses testified that security forces dumped 
bodies in rivers and canals or burned them 
authorities in uttar pradesh where moslems are a 15 percent 
minority have denied there was a police massacre 
in new dehli a foreign ministry official said amnesty 
international presents happenings in the country in a very 
onesided and distorted manner 
the official was not identified under briefing rules he said 
the report tended to highlight stray incidents of human rights 
violations but minimized the numerous rights and freedoms enjoyed 
by indians 
wherever charges were proved exemplary action was taken 
against the guilty he added

a major earthquake shook the vicinity 
of the solomon islands in the south pacific today seismologists 
said there were no immediate reports of damage or injury 
the quake which registered 73 on the richter scale was 
centered 60 miles east of guadalcanal said the bureau of mineral 
resources 
the pacific tsunami warning center in honolulu reported no 
threat of a destructive pacificwide tsunami or tidal wave but 
said some areas could experience small sea level changes 
mineral resources spokesman trevor jones said the quake hit at 
238 pm 1238 am edt in tokyo japans central 
meteorological agency recorded the quake slightly later 
the solomons a double chain of six large islands and many 
smaller ones is 1000 miles east of port moresby papua new 
guinea and 1600 miles northeast of sydney australia 
the islands have a mainly melanesian population of about 
160000 the capital honiara was built near the famed guadalcanal 
battleground of world war ii and has about 20000 residents 
the richter scale measures the magnitude of a quake at its 
epicenter according to ground motion as recorded on seismographs 
an quake of 5 on the scale is considered very strong and a 6 
severe capable of widespread damage near the epicenter 
a 7 reading is a major earthquake capable of widespread 
heavy damage 
every increase of one digit represents a tenfold increase in 
magnitude thus a reading of 75 would be 10 times stronger than 
one of 65

a federal judge accused by a higher 
court of being hardened against the government in favor of the 
ku klux klan has set a hearing to determine his own fitness for 
trial in us government cases 
no one from the justice department plans to be at the hearing 
scheduled for friday by us district judge william m acker jr 
but an attorney for klansmen said hell be there to state that 
acker has been good and fair 
acker a 60yearold yale law school graduate appointed to the 
bench by president reagan in 1982 delivered rulings against the 
justice department in litigation involving the klan that prompted 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals to remove him from the case 
during the course of this litigation wrote circuit judge 
frank m johnson of montgomery judge ackers position has become 
hardened against the government and he has evidenced a commitment 
that clearly reflects that he is no longer able to view these cases 
impartially 
acker had ruled that the actions of several klansmen accused of 
violating the rights of marchers in a violent confrontation at 
decatur in 1979 did not justify what acker said were improper 
tactics used by the southern poverty law center in montgomery 
which acker branded a countervigilante group 
the center had sued the klansmen then gave their testimony in 
that case to the justice department which used it to obtain 
indictments against the klansmen acker ruled the testimony 
inadmissible and then did not follow 11th circuit instructions to 
admit it 
the government appealed and the 11th circuit ruled that the 
klansmens testimony should not be suppressed 
the appeals court ordered ackers removal from the case in june 
when the government filed a second appeal arguing he had failed to 
follow the directions 
afterward acker scheduled the hearing on his own fitness 
saying 
this court is neither seeking praise nor condemnation but 
feels it is necessary that it create a forum for frank and serious 
discussion of a very serious subject namely should a judge whose 
position is hardened against the government sit on the governments 
cases 
the us attorney for northern alabama frank donaldson said 
tuesday that no one from the justice department will be at the 
hearing 
the united states has at this time insufficient information to 
determine and no reason to believe that judge ackers proposed 
general recusal is either necessary or appropriate donaldson 
said in a legal response to the hearing 
donaldson said a decision to recuse acker or legally challenge 
his competence to preside as judge is better left for 
consideration on a casebycase basis 
kenneth j gomany one of the attorneys for the klansmen said 
he plans to attend the showcause proceeding to submit any kind 
of briefs in support of the acker 
i think he is a good and fair judge and hes ruled against our 
clients and against the government on occasion more often than 
not hes ruled against our clients all in all hes been 
impartial said gomany 
morris dees director of the poverty center said his 
organization would take no position on ackers qualifications to 
preside over government cases 
weve never had any experience with judge acker in any other 
case dees said during nearly two decades the center has 
handled several highly publicized civil rights and death penalty 
cases

the hunger strike by a bedridden cesar 
chavez headed into its 25th day today as it matched the length of 
his fast 20 years ago to gain recognition of the united farm 
workers 
the 61yearold union leader has given no indication that he 
plans to stop his wateronly fast for union contracts and a boycott 
of california table grapes because of five pesticides used on them 
chavezs levels of uric acid remain constant but high 
threatening to cause kidney failure and his blood pressure is 
rising union spokeswoman lorena parlee said tuesday quoting dr 
fidel huerta 
the union said chavez has lost at least 20 pounds during the 
fast an effort to gain support for a 4yearold boycott of 
california grapes that has been virtually ignored by the public 
on monday a caravan of hollywood film and television stars 
trekked to this community 200 miles north of los angeles to give 
the boycott a publicity boost they visited the labor leader six 
at a time at his bedside and then issued a strong public plea to 
support the table grape boycott 
among the celebrities were actors martin sheen eddie albert and 
robert blake and comedian and political activist dick gregory 
but their pleas have had absolutely no effect on sales 
whatsoever said bruce obbink president of the calfornia table 
grape commission state officials and growers deny that table 
grapes contain dangerous pesticide residues as the union contends 
chavez united farm workers union has no contracts among 
california table grape growers and the union has lost 30000 
duespaying members during the last decade 
in 1968 chavez fasted for 25 days to gain recognition of the 
union and to make a plea for nonviolence during bitter union fights

a senate vote to ban dumping sludge in the 
atlantic ocean brings the nation closer to the day when well 
stop using the ocean as a sewer a key sponsor of the measure 
says 
the senate spurred by fears about sludge and medical waste that 
has washed up recently on east coast beaches voted 970 on tuesday 
to bar the practice 
a similar bill is awaiting action in the house 
the senate measure bans the dumping of municipal sludge off the 
coasts of new york and new jersey after 1991 and orders the closing 
of a sludge dump site 106 miles off the new jersey coast the only 
site where sludge can currently be legally dumped 
the site is used by six sewage authorities in new jersey and 
three in new york including the city of new york 
we need a firm deadline in the law to ban the ocean dumping 
of sewage sludge said frank lautenberg dnj one of the 
cosponsors only then will alternatives be put in place only 
then will the dumping stop 
the senate added an amendment by sen christopher dodd dconn 
which bans the disposal of all medical waste in oceans or streams 
it also approved another amendment by lautenberg providing a 
fiveyear prison sentence for anyone caught violating that ban 
last week virtually every connecticut beach was shut down 
because of medical waste during one of the hottest spells in the 
states history dodd told his colleagues 
were moving closer to the day when well stop using the ocean 
as a sewer said lautenberg sludge dumping is a throwaway 
approach to our waste problem and contributes to the overall ocean 
pollution problem 
congress first ordered an end to the ocean dumping of sludge in 
1972 five years later congress directed that the dumping be ended 
by 1981 but the nine municipalities in new york and new jersey 
successfully sued in federal court to ignore that deadline

an official human rights commission called on the 
government to release soviets jailed for violating laws limiting 
religious activity and said most of the prisoners have embraced 
mikhail s gorbachevs reforms 
at the same time religious activists in the western ukraine 
reported a new crackdown on the banned ukrainian catholic church 
which operates underground 
in its appeal tuesday the commission on international 
cooperation on humanitarian questions and human rights said it 
seems to us that today these people do not represent any social 
danger for our society we propose that it would be an act of great 
humane meaning to forgive them 
no figures were available on how many prisoners might be 
affected in a report on the appeal the official tass news agency 
said such an amnesty would affect only a few people 
it likely would not affect most of the 200 people who religious 
activists estimate were convicted under different laws and remain 
jailed or exiled 
the appeal to the presidium of the supreme soviet did not touch 
on the strictest laws governing religious activity which require 
registration of religious groups sharply limit religious education 
and prohibit charitable activity 
the appeal concerned those convicted under two articles of 
soviet law one on violations of the separation of church and 
state which carries a maximum oneyear sentence and one against 
directing religious activities judged to be harmful to others 
which carries a maximum five years in prison or exile 
the commission headed by prominent journalist fyodor burlatsky 
said the majority of believers have accepted perestroika and 
have made a significant contribution to realizing plans for the 
socialeconomic development of the country all this testifies to 
the new approach to governmentchurch relations in the era of 
perestroika and democratization of soviet society 
perestroika is the term gorbachev uses to describe his 
wideranging economic political and social reform program 
ivan gel a member of a committee seeking legalization of the 
ukrainian catholic church said in a telephone interview from lvov 
that a police crackdown began in the western ukraine after several 
church services attracted thousands of people in july 
there is without a doubt a sharp increase in pressure on the 
church and not only on the church but on the whole society he 
said 
police have broken up some religious services prevented rural 
residents from reaching other villages for services and levied 
heavy fines on unauthorized services he said 
because officials have refused to recognize the church it does 
not have permission to hold services 
authorities regard the services as violations of the law against 
unauthorized gatherings and warned church groups they face a 
maximum 480 fine for their first offense and up to 1600 for a 
second gel said 
gel said up to 20000 people gathered in a village of the 
ternopol region july 17 to celebrate the 1000th anniversary of the 
coming of christianity to the ukraine six days later about 5000 
people gathered for a service devoted to the victims of stalinism 
he said 
much of the western ukraine was outside soviet territory until 
after world war ii when the nations border expanded the 
ukrainian catholic church was forcibly united with the orthodox 
church and officially ceased to exist 
activists say several million believers remain in the western 
ukraine

the former tropical storm known as beryl drifted inland today 
packing less punch but raising hopes of a hard rain for the 
droughtstricken midwest as hundreds of evacuees on the mississippi 
coast returned home 
other thunderstorms hit nebraska missouri illinois and 
colorado where flooding was reported 
an alabama teenager remained missing as beryl was downgraded to 
a tropical depression tuesday the coast guard suspended a search 
for the 15yearboy who fell overboard monday when a fishing boat 
capsized in the gulf of mexico 
the coast guard also rescued six people who endured two days of 
wind and rain on an island 10 miles off the mississippi coast after 
high seas prevented them from returning to the mainland 
i think we missed the forecast said randy gibson of 
gilbertown ala captain of the 17foot boat 
its just a miracle that we survived said his wife denvia 
god took care of us and brought us home 
the storm had little impact on new orleans or south louisiana 
which was preparing to host next weeks republican national 
convention 
the beneficial aspects of this tropical storm are probably 
much greater than any negative effects from this system and 
thats rain said bob sheets director of the national hurricane 
center in coral gables fla 
in colorado springs colo a storm tuesday dumped more than 3 
inches of rain and golfball size hail turning streets into 
rivers numerous motorists had to be rescued from floating cars 
firefighters were dispatched to homes and businesses where 
rising water poured under doors and through electrical wall 
outlets lightning knocked out power to 2400 customers and an 
electric transformer exploded during the storm 
beryl drifted toward the westnorthwest at about 5 miles an hour 
early today leaving behind higher than usual tides and some 
thunderstorms but hundreds who evacuated their coastal mississippi 
homes on monday began returning tuesday when the weakened storm 
moved inland 
the national weather service placed the storms center near 
lafayette la early today the storm with maximum winds of 35 
mph was expected to take a more northwesterly direction later 
today 
we think its going to turn toward the northwest up over 
the midwest area said sheets we dont think its going to go 
back out over the water so theres not much chance of it ever 
strengthening again 
however flood warnings remained along the mississippi coast 
because of the threat of heavy rains overnight 
damage was confined mostly to lowland flooding scattered tree 
limbs and power outages that have since been restored 
the alabama youth whose name was not given was reported 
missing tuesday by a survivor found clinging to the hull of a 
vessel that capsized monday in the mississippi sound searchers 
believe the boat was swamped by 7foot waves 
thousands of workers who had been flown in from offshore oil 
rigs on monday also began returning tuesday

a journalist has cleared the fbi of wrongdoing in 
acquiring some of his confidential notes which he previously 
believed had been stolen from his home in costa rica a newspaper 
reported today 
tony avirgan told the boston globe he learned last weekend that 
the fbi got the material indirectly through a cbs news colleague 
carroll dougherty 
avirgan said dougherty told him he gave copies of the notes to 
jack terrell a former mercenary who was giving the fbi information 
on alleged illegal activities connected with a private nicaraguan 
rebel aid network and that terrell gave the fbi access to some of 
them 
avirgan said doughertys passing along of the material was 
unauthorized and unethical 
doughtery said he thought he had avirgans permission to share 
the notes with terrell 
obviously i had no idea the material would end up in the 
hands of the fbi dougherty said 
two weeks ago the globe said 39 pages of avirgans material 
found in the files of the fbis field office in washington 
apparently were obtained through two breakins at avirgans home in 
costa rica the fbi later confirmed the notes were in its files 
following the report rep don edwards dcalif chairman of 
the fbi oversight committee in congress announced an investigation 
into the matter 
avirgan said at the time that there was no other way the 
material including notes of interviews and private memos to his 
editor could have been acquired and given to the fbi 
but after investigating this incident thoroughly we now 
realize that the fbi did not obtain the documents as a result of a 
breakin or any other unethical or illegal action avirgan said 
we did suffer two breakins in 1985 and 1986 in which files 
were rifled and perhaps photocopied he said were still 
looking for an explanation of those breakins 
doughterys role was discovered last week when his handwriting 
was found on one page of the material released by the fbi the 
globe said 
avirgan said doughtery was sent to costa rica by cbs news in 
1985 to help him and his journalist wife martha honey investigate 
the attempted assassination of dissident contra leader eden 
pastora 
avirgan and his wife have filed a 24 million damage suit in 
miami accusing us and nicaraguan contra officials of 
responsibility for the bombing the lawsuit was dismissed in june 
for insufficient evidence 
avirgan said dougherty told him last weekend he provided copies 
of avirgans notes to terrell in exchange for terrells material on 
the private network aiding the rebels fighting to overthrow 
nicaraguas leftist government 
but terrell told the globe the material was not used in a trade 
the fbi got copies of avirgans material when agents interviewed 
terrell in 1986 the globe said terrell told the newspaper he gave 
the fbi fewer than 39 pages but said his memory might not be 
accurate 
john mattes a florida lawyer said when terrell was approached 
by the fbi i advised terrell to cooperate fully with the fbi and 
to give them everything he had thats how cbs material got into 
their files 
greg jones a spokesman for the fbi said tuesday that fbi 
director william sessions has maintained throughout that the 
materials came to us from an individual who voluntarily provided 
them to us the fbi did not solicit the information nor did we know 
how it was obtained

a bad connection somewhere in the 
telephone company has apparently caused thousands of customers to 
be listed with the wrong street number in the new phone book 
south kingstown streets were renumbered late last year as part 
of the states new 911 emergency telephone system officials 
delivered a list of the new street numbers to new england telephone 
co in february four months before the deadline for address 
changes in the new book 
but arthur jones a spokesman for the telephone company said no 
one from the phone companys 911 division passed along the new 
addresses to the division that publishes the telephone books 
i believe that the left hand doesnt know what the right hand 
is doing at the phone company said jack carney the engineer in 
the town department of public works who coordinated the street 
number changes 
town council president harold smith urged the phone company to 
publish a supplement to make the corrections instead of waiting 
until next years book 
it is a big mistake a significant mistake i dont think we 
can go a year without it being rectified smith said if there 
is any place that needs to have the correct address it is the 
telephone directory 
officials said the problem affected a significant number of the 
towns 20968 residents although they did not have exact figures

two royal air force tornado jet fighters collided 
during a night training flight over northwest england and the raf 
said today that three airman were killed and the fourth was missing 
and presumed dead 
the raf said in a statement that two bodies were found before 
dawn in wreckage strewn over the countryside near the village of 
milburn and the third body was later found in the same area 
the village in the cumbrian hills is about 240 miles northwest 
of london 
rescue helicopters with powerful lights and a hill rescue team 
on foot rushed to the remote sparsely populated area after the 
twoseater fighters collided tuesday night 
the area is regularly used for lowlevel training flights with 
military jets skimming just a few hundred feet over hills and farm 
buildings as pilots practice avoiding radar detection by flying 
under the beams 
an eyewitness alan knell landlord of the stag inn in milburn 
told the british broadcasting corp in a radio interview 
a big red ball of fire came in the sky i didnt know 
whether it was the sun coming up it was just a mass of bright red 
and then rockets and flares went off and then there was another 
sort of explosion the noise was absolutely tremendous 
knell said the planes narrowly missed the pub he said there had 
been a lot of lowlevel flights earlier in the day 
the raf said this year that it would modify its tornado fighters 
because of earlier collisions but gave no date for completion of 
the modifications the decision followed a defense ministry report 
in may on a december 1986 nighttime incident in which one raf 
tornado flew into the back of another 
the report called for improved exterior lighting and other 
changes so pilots can assess distances better all the crewmen 
involved in the 1986 collision survived 
currently 220 tornados are in service in britain and another 
165 are being built for the raf at a cost of 30 million each 
the tornado was jointly developed and built by britain west 
german and italy and first came into service in 1979 
in the previous most recent accident involving a tornado two 
raf crewmen were killed when the tornado they were in crashed in 
west germany in may 
legislator dale campbellsavours of the opposition labor party 
said after visiting the scene of tuesday nights collision accused 
prime minister margaret thatchers conservative government of 
ignoring warnings about the dangers of lowlevel training flights 
the whole program is completely out of control he charged

the drought will cut us corn production 
about 40 percent crop analysts say but they hold out more hope 
for improvement in soybeans 
the potential for change in corn is very very small said 
jim quinton of the agrivisor marketing service in bloomington 
soybeans can go up down or sideways 
figures released tuesday by agrivisor put the 1988 corn harvest 
at more than 43 billion bushels and the soybean harvest at less 
than 15 billion bushels respective declines of nearly 39 percent 
and 21 percent from 1987 
the figures followed a recent survey by the american farm bureau 
federation which predicted farmers would harvest 434 billion 
bushels of corn down 40 percent and 144 billion bushels of 
soybeans down 24 percent from last years yields 
much of the crop damage has been done to corn and its too 
late for improved weather conditions to substantially reverse the 
losses said tim price a federation grains specialist 
quinton said farmers in parts of iowa south dakota minnesota 
and nebraska probably can expect better crops than those farther 
east 
the agrivisor estimates are based largely on an examination of 
fields in 10 key farm states by a group of young farmers from 
douglas county ill they drove 11000 miles in late july and early 
august checking crops from nebraska and south dakota to michigan 
and ohio 
the bureau report is based on responses from nearly 1400 
producers surveyed in the major producing states 
illinois was one of the states hardest hit by the drought 
especially in the corn fields 
quinton said farmers in the state probably will average 67 
bushels of corn per acre for a 6365 millionbushel crop that 
compares with 132 bushels per acre in 1987 for total corn 
production of 12 billion bushels 
a 67bushel corn yield would be the lowest since 1959 and the 
6365 millionbushel harvest would be the smallest since 1983 a 
year of drought and of a major government acreagereduction program 
illinois farmers are expected to average 28 bushels of soybeans 
per acre this fall and put 2436 million bushels into their bins 
quinton said they had a yield of 38 bushels per acre in 1987 for 
production of 323 million bushels 
the soybean yield and the harvest would be the smallest since 
1974 
in iowa where the weather has been more favorable in western 
and some northern counties farmers are expected to average 87 
bushels of corn per acre for a harvest of 9483 million bushels 
iowa soybeans are likely to yield 34 bushels per acre with a 
total harvest of 2686 million bushels quinton said 
agrivisor said projected corn yields in the other states were 
indiana 57 bushels per acre michigan 58 bushels minnesota 72 
bushels missouri 62 bushels nebraska 110 bushels ohio 59 
bushels south dakota 70 bushels and wisconsin 64 bushels 
projected soybean yields were indiana 27 bushels per acre 
michigan 25 bushels minnesota 33 bushels missouri 30 bushels 
nebraska 33 bushels ohio 30 bushels south dakota 28 bushels 
and wisconsin 28 bushels 
the us department of agriculture will issue its first yield 
and production estimates thursday for this years corn and soybean 
harvests

reaching the 13520 yen mark in midmorning the highest level 
since july 18 it closed at 13492 yen up 134 yen from tuesdays

discount rate hike by the federal reserve of the united states and 
a 28point fall of the dow jones average of 30 industrials in new 
york overnight 
the stock market has been sluggish to begin with said a 
dealer at a tokyo brokerage then came news of sudden discount 
rate hike in the us and an overnight drop of dow jones industrial 
average in new york the combination of them caused todays sharp 
fall 
the nikkei index was on a three day downward stretch since 
saturday before wednesdays trading began it lost 254 points in 
the past three days hitting the below 28000 mark for the first 
time since july 29

and there was no need for central bank intervention to stem the 
rise 
kyodo news service quoted a bank of japan official as saying 
we will monitor the progress in the us closely but have no 
intention of changing japans current domestic policy stance 
exchange dealers also said that profittaking was taming the 
dollars sharp upward surge 
players who bought the dollar yesterday tuesday especially 
the trading houses and insurance companies are selling it off in

in tokyo 
but active buying from other sources cut in immediately after 
the dollar inches down not allowing it to fall below the 135yen 
level the dealer said speaking on condition of anonymity i 
expect more buying later in the day 
securities dealers said the morning decline in stock prices was 
in response to a 28point loss in wall streets dow jones 
industrial average which fell after the federal reserve board 
announcement that it was increasing the us discount rate to 65 
percent from 60 percent 
an increase of the discount rate the fee the nations central 
bank charges for shortterm loans to member banks would affect 
other interest rates including those on prime rates and mortgage 
rates to be set by commercial banks higher us interest rates 
increase the attractiveness of dollardenominated investments 
they were more concerned about the interest rate hike in 
japan said a dealer at a tokyo brokerage but the worry seems 
to have cleared and i expect share prices will recover shortly

george bush is upbeat about a new poll showing 
him narrowing the lead of democratic presidential rival michael 
dukakis saying its a nice change and i like it i like 
it 
after weeks of trailing dukakis by as much as 17 points in some 
surveys the vice president and his staff took pains tuesday to 
bring attention to a gallup poll that said he was only seven points 
down with dukakis holding a 49 percent to 42 percent edge 
the poll gives bush a better footing for next weeks republican 
national convention where he will be crowned the gop presidential 
nominee by showing him in close contention with the massachusetts 
governor instead of dropping further behind 
things are moving were beginning to get them in focus watch 
and youll see these surveys turn around bush said 
this is dramatic movement its very encouraging its 
a nice change its a nice turnaround he told reporters in 
philadelphia at the end of a daylong trip through pennsylvania 
i told you to be patient he said i like it i like it 
he exulted 
tempering his optimism bush said polls dont matter he 
went on to say i dont believe in polls not even the good ones 
i dont think polls mean anything 
the gallup survey of 1004 registered voters conducted friday 
through sunday had a 3 percentage point margin of error 
bushs trip with stops in erie and pittsburgh as well as 
philadelphia was his last outing before he goes to the convention 
in new orleans 
today and thursday he is taping separate hourlong interviews 
in washington with the four major television networks for broadcast 
during the convention 
bush also continued work on his search for a running mate sen 
arlen specter rpa said the vice president asked him and four 
other guests on air force ii about their recommendations but gave 
no clue to his thinking 
specter said the consensus of the guests was that the no 2 job 
should go to senate minority leader bob dole of kansas who 
unsuccessfully challenged bush for the nomination 
i know dole could do it specter said dole ought to 
appear in front of boston bay and say that dukakis could walk on 
water and the reason is it is full of sludge and solid waste 
disposal 
bush said at a news conference that his decision was not 
imminent im not close in the sense of like tomorrow making a 
final decision the vice president said he has said he wants to 
keep it a secret until the final day of the convention which 
begins monday 
bush also stepped up his attack against dukakis saying his 
opponent was trying to avoid being specific on issues 
he is trying to run away from a record in massachusetts on the 
very very far liberal fringe of the political spectrum and i have 
to pin him down bush said and hes unwilling to do that 
because he thinks he can preempt the middle 
emphasizing policy differences with dukakis bush said when 
he says hes against the death penalty for everything the country 
has a right to know it i happen to think some crimes are bad 
enough you should 
when he says he wants to take guns away from people why then 
the country ought to know that the vice president added 
bush said he was urging speakers at the gop convention to be 
positive and to focus on the issues 
but i cant guarantee that somebodys not going to take a 
swipe at michael dukakis bush said i have a lot of friends 
out there and they didnt like the vicious personal attacks 
against bush at the democratic convention and i did not react to 
them but i cant control everybody but im urging them to stay 
positive as im doing 
bush added theres a lot of people out there that want to go 
after em theres a lot of people that feel it was a very unfair 
totally negative tune there

million shares compared to 650 million tuesday 
securities dealers attributed the drop to the us federal 
reserve boards halfpercentage point increase in its discount rate 
to 65 percent on tuesday and the subsequent 28point fall in the 
down jones average in new york 
the stock market has been sluggish to begin with said a 
dealer at a tokyo brokerage speaking anonymously 
he said news of the federal reserves action and the new york 
stock exchange tumble came as a surprise and the combination of 
them caused todays sharp fall 
an increase in the discount rate which the central bank charges 
for shortterm loans to member banks would in turn affect the 
interest rates the commercial banks charge 
however another tokyo dealer also speaking anonymously said 
investors had been prepared for the interest rate increase for some 
time and were more concerned about any interest rate increase in 
japan but the worry seems to have cleared and i expect share 
prices will recover shortly 
the nikkei index had previously fallen for three straight days 
shedding 254 points and dipping below the 28000 mark for the first 
time since july 29 
on the foreign exchange market the us currency remained 
strong throughout the days trade 
the dollar opened at 13493 yen 135 yen higher than tuesdays 
close and continued to rise after reaching the 13520yen mark in 
midmorning the highest level since july 18 it closed at 13492 
yen up 134 yen from the day before 
finance minister kiichi miyazawa reacting to the dollars 
surge was quoted by japanese newspapers as saying the current 
exchange rate fluctuation was not violent and that there was no 
need for central bank intervention to stem the rise 
kyodo news service quoted an unidentified bank of japan official 
as saying we will monitor the progress in the us closely but 
have no intention of changing japans current domestic policy 
stance 
exchange dealers added that profittaking was taming the strong 
rise of the dollar 
players who bought the dollar yesterday especially the 
trading houses and insurance companies are selling it off in 
profittaking said an exchange dealer at a us investment bank 
in tokyo

mayor edward i koch has announced an 
advertising campaign to encourage people to give money to charities 
rather than to panhandlers because he says most beggars are 
trying to rip people off 
the advertisements on subways will urge people to donate money 
to charities so they will know the money will go not for booze 
not for drugs but to provide maintenance for these people the 
mayor said tuesday 
im concerned that people are giving lots of money 
collectively and in most cases not all its a scam koch 
said people who say they are starving it is simply not true 
in most cases they are demented 
koch added that panhandlers who dont take advantage of the 
citys shelter and welfare system are either mentally disturbed 
or its a scam 
there are no statistics on the number of panhandlers in new 
york but groups who work with the homeless say they number in the 
thousands 
the subway signs will describe the citys public assistance 
programs so that people can make an educated decision about whether 
to give money koch said the signs also may include a phone number 
to offer beggars that would direct them to places where they can be 
assisted 
i dont want new york city to become a city where people think 
its ok to assume the role of beggars as if it were a profession 
the mayor said 
human resources administration director william j grinker who 
is developing the advertising campaign called the beggars an 
increasingly intrusive part of urban life that has gotten to be 
like graffiti 
but christina walker director of the food and hunger hotline 
an association of 600 soup kitchens and food pantries said 
suggestions that people are begging because they choose to or are 
mentally ill or addicted to drugs or alcohol is a useful myth 
people are asking for money because they need money to 
survive 
almost all soup kitchens are closed on weekends and in the 
evenings walker said and the food pantries are aimed toward 
people with homes all food providers must limit the number they 
can serve she said and thousands are turned away daily 
in a survey last year by the legal action center for the 
homeless of 500 men who attend soup kitchens in the city 69 
percent said they receive no public assistance of these 42 
percent said they were forced to panhandle to survive

a review of videotapes of a park confrontation 
between police and protesters in which 53 people were injured shows 
officers may have used excessive force the mayor and police 
commissioner say 
the films that i saw the other day are very disturbing 
mayor edward i koch said tuesday adding that the officers may have 
legitimate explanations for their conduct last weekend 
but police commissioner benjamin ward said he would be surprised 
if some of the officers could justify the actions that caused irate 
residents to file 40 charges of brutality 
there is some behavior that was captured on tape that i think 
the individual officers that are involved are going to have great 
difficulty explaining ward said 
a riot involving 450 demonstrators and 400 officers broke out at 
tompkins square park in manhattans lower east side as police tried 
to enforce a 1 am curfew on sunday in the wake of the riot koch 
suspended enforcement of the curfew to prevent further violence 
police had gone to tompkins square because of complaints from 
residents of the gentrifying neighborhood that the park was a 
nighttime hangout for drug dealers rowdy drunks homeless people 
and socalled punk rockers who dress in black leather and spike 
their hair 
among the 53 injured were 14 police officers 
during the confrontation several officers in one of the tapes 
apparently tried to hide their badge numbers with black bands the 
new york post reported today one officer apparently was not 
wearing a badge it said 
failure to display badge numbers and name plates is a violation 
of departmental regulations 
the civilian complaint review board which is comprised of 
civilians and police representatives appealed to residents of the 
east village area to come forward with their complaints and to help 
identify officers who used excessive force 
this is a priority case it will be given our full 
attention said deputy commissioner sandra marsh who anticipated 
a long investigation because of the number of complaints 
after the panel looks at the evidence it sends its 
recommendation to the police commissioner who can accept it or 
reject it 
the most severe recommendation is to charge the officer with a 
breach of department discipline the officer would face a 
departmental trial which could lead to dismissal

the us navy is investigating 
allegations that the crew of a navy ship refused to rescue some 
vietnamese boat people who later resorted to murder and cannibalism 
to survive at sea officials said today 
navy officials said the sailors reported giving food and water 
to the boat people not considering them to be in dire straits 
weve made all information available to the united states and 
we know they are conducting an investigation and are very serious 
about it said robert cooper local representative of the un 
high commission on refugees cooper said in a telephone interview 
that the probe began last month 
he said the 52 refugees who survived the 37day ordeal charged 
that crewmen of the uss dubuque refused to take them aboard even 
though their boat was disabled and they were dying of exposure and 
starvation 
cooper said the refugees reported that 58 people died during the 
south china sea crossing which began may 22 when the group left 
the south vietnamese port of ben tre aboard a 35foot wooden boat 
its engine failed two or three days later 
by the june 9 encounter with the dubuque according to the 
refugees there was one dead refugee aboard the motor was not 
working they were drifting for 19 days people had died of 
exposure hunger and thirst cooper said 
the refugees claimed to have later killed some of their 
companions and eaten their flesh to survive cooper said the 
great majority of other deaths also occurred after the 
encounter with the dubuque 
officials at subic bay naval base northwest of manila and at 
the us navys surface force pacific fleet office in san diego 
calif confirmed that an investigation was under way 
they said the dubuques commander reported that the refugee boat 
was seaworthy and that they left the vietnamese after giving them 
more than 400 pounds of food 50 gallons of water navigational 
charts and sailing directions 
a navy spokesman cmdr david dillon in san diego said he did 
not think the crew would have turned the refugees away if their 
boat was disabled 
the manila chronicle quoted some of the refugees as saying the 
crew told them the dubuque was on a dangerous mission and could 
not take them aboard 
dillon said the dubuque was headed for the persian gulf but 
that its destination would not have been an excuse not to rescue 
the vietnamese if their boat was in distress 
its not a navy policy not to allow refugees on board he 
said its a policy to render humanitarian assistance whenever 
needed and however possible in this case the commanding officer 
judged their craft to be seaworthy 
dillon said navy policy directs ships to be alert for refugees 
on the high seas and assist them as needed the policy calls for 
ships to pick up refugees if their boat is disabled or in case of 
bad weather 
filipino fishermen rescued the vietnamese off northern luzon 
island on june 27 they were taken to a refugee camp housing more 
than 4000 other vietnamese refugees on palawan island 
cooper said investigators had not determined how many people the 
refugees killed 
some said more than three were killed some said less than 
three he said 
cooper said the alleged mastermind of the cannibalism was in 
protective custody to prevent other refugees from harming him 
the manila chronicle identified the first alleged victim as a 
30yearold man named dao coung who wept and pleaded to be spared 
why not wait until i starve to death coung reportedly said 
before two men grabbed him by the feet and submerged his head in 
the sea until he was dead the paper reported 
cooper said that if the allegations against the navy crew prove 
true it would be the first time the us navy has failed to 
adequately help a group of boat people since they began fleeing 
after the fall of south vietnam to the communists in 1975

an inmate who used a what he thought was 
a smuggled gun in an escape attempt found out two days later that 
he was an unwitting participant in a training exercise and that the 
weapon carried blanks 
he was making statements that hed almost made it umatilla 
county sheriff jim carey said tuesday 
stanley bernson a 52yearold murderer who had tried to escape 
three times from the county jail since 1986 had asked a guard to 
help him break out carey said 
with the sheriffs permission the jailer smuggled a gun and 
bullets into bernsons cell however the firing pin had been 
removed and the gunpowder taken out of the bullets 
our goal was to find out what it would take if it was the real 
thing and how he would react carey said the adrenaline was 
flowing like it was really going down 
bernson pulled the gun on two guards saturday the sheriff said 
when he stepped out of his cell he told them to empty their 
wallets and put their watches on the floor and he ordered them 
into the cell carey said 
then we allowed him from there on into a corridor which we 
had already preplanned then we played it out in a way that made 
sense to him 
bernson was trapped by locked doors at each end of the corridor 
and was forced to negotiate with guards watching him through a 
video camera the escape attempt lasted 22 minutes and ended when 
bernson gave himself up 
we just talked to him and observed him and saw how he reacted 
to things we did carey said he deescalated pretty fast 
bernson did not try to fire the gun during the escape attempt 
carey said 
bernson is awaiting trial in the 1978 slaying of a 15yearold 
girl and is serving a life sentence for murdering a richland 
wash woman in 1979 he was transferred to the jail from the 
washington state penitentiary in walla walla 
hes a big concern for us the sheriff said i used 
unusual measures this time ive really got a unique problem with a 
unique individual 
bernsons attorney dennis a hachler declined to comment on 
the incident because of a judges gag order in the murder case

they were just early

6065100 to thousands of people a record payout for any 
threedigit or fourdigit number in the lotterys history said 
lottery spokesman george j yamin 
on monday the muchawaited 8888 the winning number was an 
unremarkable 218 
enough people carried over their 888 from monday to break the 
previous record payout of 5125000 for the numbers 7777 drawn 
in the last week of august 1987 in the lotterys daily winfour 
game yamin said 
officials were unsure how many individual 888 tickets were 
sold yamin said 
demand for 888 in the numbers game was so great that the 
lottery stopped accepting bets on that number at 1145 am 
tuesday he said on monday bets on 888 were halted at 9 am 
he said 
the lottery limits the total amount that can be bet on any one 
combination of numbers to 10000 capping the maximum total payout 
at 5 million normally yamin said but a special promotion this 
week boosted the prize for a winning 1 bet to 600 from the usual 
500 increasing the total payout to 6 million he said

became the center of a superpower tugofwar during the moscow 
summit emigrated to the west today ending an 11year struggle to 
leave their homeland 
yuri and tanya zieman and their 12yearold daughter vera smiled 
broadly as they stepped off an aeroflot jet from moscow to a warm 
welcome from western friends us embassy officials and hias an 
organization that helps emigre soviet jews 
asked how she felt on arriving in the west at last mrs zieman 
said simply stunned her daughter clutching a welcome bouquet 
from wellwishers giggled excited 
the family will stay in vienna until friday when they will fly 
to boston for a reunion with an older daughter who emigrated in 
1987 with her husband 
several dozen friends and relatives gathered for a champagne 
toast at moscows sheremetyevo airport today to celebrate the 
ziemans departure 
im glad youre all here zieman told the group i invite 
you all to my new home zieman is a former computer specialist 
who has held odd jobs since applying to emigrate and was seriously 
ill earlier in the year 
in vienna he said he now feels much better im so excited 
that it sometimes seems to me that all my sicknesses are behind 
me 
in moscow mrs zieman called her departure one of the most 
difficult moments of ones life 
its like your own funeral in a way because most of the people 
who are here today i wont see again my old teachers relatives 
friends she said 
the family spent a sleepless night clearing customs at the 
moscow airport and saying goodbye to friends she said 
us diplomats said president reagan had planned to visit the 
zieman family at their south moscow apartment during the summit 
meeting may 29 to underscore the united states concern for human 
rights in the soviet union 
but they said a highranking soviet official told the americans 
that if reagan visited the family they never would be allowed to 
emigrate 
reagan did not visit the family and two weeks after he left 
they were told their application had been refused again and that 
they should reapply in 1992 however within weeks they received 
official permission to leave

prime minister yitzhak shamir said today that 
israel would maintain its control of the west bank and crush any 
palestinian attempt to declare an independent state in the occupied 
territories 
shamirs 20minute speech came during a special session of 
israels 120seat parliament it was convened to debate the 
decision by king hussein of jordan to cut legal and administrative 
ties with the west bank which jordan annexed in 1950 and israel 
captured in the 1967 middle east war 
leftwing politicians called for the debate to discuss israels 
response to husseins announcement they argued israel should 
explore peace prospects with the 15 million palestinians in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip 
but shamir referring to a palestinian initiative to declare a 
palestinian state in occupied lands said 
israel will prevent in the most determined way any attempt to 
carry out any idea to the extent that there are madmen who raise 
it of establishing a palestinian government such people will be 
met with an iron fist that will leave no trace of their attempts 
the proposed declaration which was made public last week calls 
for a palestinian state in the west bank gaza strip parts of the 
galilee and east jerusalem shamirs rightwing likud bloc opposes 
trading any israeliheld territory for a peace pact 
shamir said jordans steps were aimed first and foremost 
against the plo and would harm the arab residents and not the 
state of israel which will continue to maintain legal and security 
control as always 
in an interview published tuesday with the saudi arabian 
newspaper alsharq alawsat the chairman of the palestine 
liberation organization yasser arafat was quoted as saying he 
preferred not to say much about jordans disassociation from the 
west bank so as not to explode the situation with jordan 
shamir also appealed to palestinians to end their uprising 
against israel since dec 8 238 palestinians and four israelis 
have died in the uprising 
yossi sarid of the liberal citizens rights movement criticized 
both the likud and the labor party led by foreign minister shimon 
peres saying they had failed to take advantage of husseins speech 
peres had relied on hussein to negotiate on the behalf of 
palestinians and get around israeli opposition to dealing with the 
plo which israel considers a terrorist organization 
gadi yatziv from the socialist mapam party criticized shamir for 
continuing to bomb to explode to deport to arrest and to 
harass the soul of the whole palestinian people 
you must know there is nothing to be accomplished by 
deportations when people are fighting for their freedom yatziv 
said make peace now 
since dec 8 israel has deported 29 palestinians 
also today assailants hurled two firebombs at a military 
vehicle in the west bank town of ramallah wounding one soldier 
the army said 
troops closed and searched the area arab witnesses said 
soldiers rounded up about 300 palestinians and broke into shops 
during the search

plo chairman yasser arafat has criticized 
jordan for failing to notify him before severing ties with the 
israelioccupied lands but he said the plo is capable of taking 
over jordans administrative role 
arafat also expressed anger at other arab countries for failing 
to tell him about jordans plans for the west bank and gaza strip 
where an uprising against israeli rule has been under way for eight 
months 
the remarks arafats first since king hussein of jordan cut 
ties with the occupied lands were published tuesday in the saudi 
arabian newspaper alsharq alawsat copies of the paper were 
obtained in manama today 
in the interview arafat also said his arab allies had failed to 
adequately fund the uprising and he ruled out sending a joint 
palestinianjordanian delegation to a proposed middle east peace 
conference 
the plo was not consulted beforehand and was not officially 
notified until after the measures by jordan were announced when 
it the plo is the party that is directly concerned in all this 
said arafat 
he insisted the palestine liberation organization is capable of 
assuming jordans administrative role in the occupied lands he 
assured the 15 million palestinians living there that the plos 
institutions are capable of absorbing everything 
arafat declined to speak at length he said so as not to 
explode the situation with jordan 
king hussein also recently scrapped a proposed west bank 
development project dissolved the lower house of parliament where 
30 out of 60 representatives were from the west bank and stopped 
paying the salaries of about 21000 teachers health workers and 
civil servants in the west bank and gaza 
hussein whose nation lost the west bank to israel in 1967 said 
he acted because the plo was the sole legitimate representative of 
palestinians 
arafat noted hussein said he had notified some arab capitals 
about jordans plans but that none had in turn told arafat 
the plo leader also commented on an international peace 
conference on the middle east proposed by the united states 
despite several visits to the region secretary of state george 
shultz has won little support for the plan 
arafat rejected sending a joint jordanianpalestinian delegation 
to such a conference because that idea has been erased from our 
dictionary even though jordan has been repeating it he said the 
plo prefers a panarab delegation adding we accept the idea of 
a joint delegation with egypt 
the arab world backed the plo as the sole legitimate 
representative of the palestinian people at the arab summit in 
algiers in june arab leaders also agreed to financially support 
the palestinian uprising with 128 million in aid but arafat said 
they had not fulfilled their commitment 
since dec 8 more than 230 palestinians and four israelis have 
been killed in the uprising in the occupied lands the uprising is 
led by underground leaders with ties to the plo 
arafat was interviewed in bulgaria before returning to the iraqi 
capital of baghdad the trip to bulgaria followed a meeting of the 
plo central council to debate the implications of king husseins 
announcement

radical students staged demonstrations 
across the nation today to call for reunification with communist 
north korea and clashes with police erupted around some campuses 
radicals staged protests in seoul and other cities to prepare 
for a march monday to the border truce site of panmunjom for talks 
with north korean student delegates on reuniting the divided korean 
peninsula the seoul government has banned the march and talks 
march to panmumjom and yankee go home students chanted 
the government mobilized 34000 riot police today to contain 
demonstrations police said they arrested some 200 students in 
seoul for taking part in the demonstrations 
authorities declined to give figures on the number of protests 
but korean news reports said several thousand students took part in 
demonstrations at about 30 universities turnout appeared less than 
radical leaders had called for 
students armed with firebombs and rocks clashed with riot police 
at four colleges in seoul when they were blocked from marching into 
the streets the clashes were sporadic and no injuries were 
reported witnesses said 
some 300 students shouting slogans and brandishing firebombs and 
clubs demonstrated around myongdong roman catholic cathedral in the 
center of seoul hundreds of riot police ringed the area but did 
not try to disperse the students 
about 60 students were arrested by police when they tried to 
march to the blue house presidential mansion 
scattered street clashes were reported in the southern port city 
of pusan where about 500 students clashed with riot police who 
fired tear gas to disperse the demonstrations 
bands of students attacked a police station and an office of the 
governing democratic justice party in pusan police said two 
police officers were injured by rocks and a police bus was set 
ablaze they said 
protesters demanded the seoul government agree to north koreas 
demand to be allowed to be a cohost for the olympic games that 
start sept 17 the international olympic committee has rejected

government 
the government insists it alone can handle contacts with north 
korea it has promised to arrange student meetings with the north 
radical students have seized on the reunification issue to try 
and mobilize public support the radicals a small but powerful 
minority on college campuses have failed to gain support because 
of their violent tactics and open advances to the north 
most south koreans fear the totalitarian north is determined to 
conquer the peninsula and recall how the north invaded the south in 
1950 to start the korean war 
the students say they are not communists but insist that the 
peninsula must be reunited immediately with political differences 
being worked out later

windhoek southwest africa ap south african soldiers today 
began their withdrawal from angola in the first phase of a peace 
plan that could lead to independence for southwest africa the 
continents last colony 
military officials declined to discuss details of the pullout 
but said the estimated 2000 south african troops in angola would 
withdraw into southwest africa by sept 1 in accordance with a 
ceasefire agreement south african units are as much as 180 miles 
inside angola 
military headquarters dismissed as ludicrous a london 
newspaper report that several hundred of the soldiers had been 
trapped behind enemy lines and faced death or capture prior to the 
truce accord with angola and cuba 
officials of the three countries are to meet in two weeks to 
negotiate a timetable for withdrawal of the estimated 50000 cuban 
troops supporting angolas marxist government in a 13yearold war 
against the national union for the total independence of angola or 
unita 
if agreement on cuban withdrawal is reached south africa says 
it will set nov 1 as the starting date for implementing a un 
plan to end its 73year rule over southwest africa also known as 
namibia 
the un plan envisions a 7500man un peacekeeping force to 
be deployed in namibia for seven months while south african troops 
gradually withdraw and elections are held for an assembly to draft 
a postindependence constituion 
estimate of the cost of the un operation have ranged as high 
as 1 billion 
if the implementation process begins nov 1 elections could 
take place as early as june 1 1989 
dirk mudge current chairman of namibias multiracial interim 
cabinet said a constitution should be drafted before the elections 
mudge suggested namibian guerrillas known as the southwest 
african peoples organization should join with other namibian 
political parties in negotiating the framework of a constitution 
prior to elections 
mudge at a news conference tuesday said he detected no signs 
of panic among white namibians over the prospect of independence 
he attributed this to changes in the territory over the past 
decade including abolition of residential segregation and 
installation of a government in which six of eight cabinet 
ministers are black 
moses katjiuongua minister of health and welfare suggested 
that elections be held in angola as well as namibia 
free and fair elections in angola are long overdue he said 
endorsing unitas argument that angolas marxist leaders have never 
received an electoral mandate since angolas independence from 
portugal in 1975 
unita is not party to the ceasefire and says it will keep 
fighting until powersharing talks take place 
in namibia most political experts believe the southwest 
african peoples organization will win a nationwide election it is 
the largest independence movement and its guerrilla wing has been 
fighting south african rule since 1966 
south africas chief representative in namibia louis pienaar 
has urged moderates and conservatives to form a common front to 
oppose the movement in the elections

the last temptation of christ 
a film that is enraging segments of the christian community for its 
reinterpretation of the bible is drawing mixed reviews as art on 
the secular front 
included in the film is some nudity mary magdalene plying her 
trade as a prostitute and the scene that has most outraged its 
antagonists in which the crucified jesus hallucinates he marries 
her and has sex with her 
film critics who viewed the rrated movie in a universal studios 
screening room tuesday including michael medved of sneak 
previews charles champlin of the los angeles times and bob 
thomas of the associated press said they were unimpressed overall 
its the height of irony that this level of controversy could 
be generated by a movie this awful said medved 
an intellectual exercise of the what if variety thomas 
said at times moving often overwrought and at least 40 minutes 
too long 
daily variety raved about the film 
a film of challenging ideas and not salacious provocations 
the industry papers review said 
and time magazines richard corliss wrote in this weeks 
edition those willing to accompany director martin scorese on 
his dangerous ride through the gospels may believe he has created 
his masterpiece 
scorsese who also directed taxi driver and raging bull 
defended the film tuesday night on abctvs nightline 
regarding the sex scenes he said it was important to show 
him go through all the steps of an ordinary life to be married to 
make love with his wife for the purposes of having children 
he denied any blasphemous intent 
im a catholic raised catholic he said we have a right 
to explore god in our way 
as the critics watched 150 protesters none of whom had seen 
the film rallied on another part of the studio lot to castigate 
universal and its parent company mca inc 
at the climax of the protest orchestrated by the rev rl 
hymers jr a baptist preacher a mock crucifixion depicted a 
bloodied jesus screaming as a man portraying mca chairman lew 
wasserman nailed him to a 10foot cross 
wasserman encountered later would not acknowledge a reporters 
questions 
earlier protests have drawn charges of antisemitism other 
christian ministers denounced a march led by hymers at a synagogue 
where he thought wasserman worshipped 
there was no demonstration outside a new york screening 
regarding the protests scorsese said i am not surprised at 
people being shocked by the idea of it not everybodys going to 
like it but he added im surprised at the antisemitism 
thats been brought around in the protesting 
its very important that people understand this film is not 
based on the gospels its based on a work of fiction 
scorsese said he was bothered that the us roman catholic 
bishops have deemed the movie objectionable 
it disturbs me i know but i do know the church has to protect 
what they feel is its flock i do know that the book on which the 
movie is based is used in seminaries at times to open 
discussions 
the us catholic conference said tuesday it is urging the 
nations 53 million catholics not to see the film 
the furor is likely to boost the movies fortunes said harold 
vogel of merrill lynch co an entertainment industry analyst 
richard hirsch director of communications for the us catholic 
conference acknowledged that dilemma saying its a case of 
damned if you do and damned if you dont 
the film which opens to the public friday depicts jesus as 
tempted to resist divinity until the point of death on the cross 
protestant fundamentalists notably the rev donald wildmon a 
united methodist minister who heads the american family association 
in tupelo miss and the rev jerry falwell have been campaigning 
against the movie their protests have escalated since universal 
rejected pleas to destroy the film 
universal responded by accusing protesters of censorship and 
moving up the release date 
members of other churches such as the episcopal bishop of new 
york said after a preview they would not oppose the films release 
the 65 million movie is based on the 1955 novel of the same 
name by greek author nikos kazantzakis it stars willem dafoe 
platoon as jesus barbara hershey hannah and her 
sisters as mary magdalene and rocker david bowie as pontius

the american who made her choreographic debut 
with the broadway show oh calcutta plans to add abstract 
dancing to the repertoire of chinas national ballet company 
their repertoire at the moment is tried and true classics like 
swan lake and giselle margo sappington told reporters today i 
can push them beyond what theyre used to 
miss sappington who has choreographed ballets for the joffrey 
ballet the alvin ailey dance theater and the houston ballet is to 
create a contemporary work for 15 to 20 members of the central 
ballet of china the nations most prestigious dance group 
she said her new 25minute work for the beijing troupe to be 
called heliotrope will be set to a violin concerto by du 
mingxin head of the composition department at the beijings 
central conservatory of music it will premiere at the tianqiao 
theater on sept 18 
li chengxiang director of the central ballet said the work 
will be performed three or four times in beijing and then will 
become part of the troupes repertoire 
miss sappington said she hopes this kind of abstract ballet 
will bring in some new people some young people 
the standards of the chinese dancers are very high she said 
and classical ballet will provide the base on which i hope to 
embellish 
the central ballet was founded in 1959 but during the cultural 
revolution of 196676 it was allowed to perform only revolutionary 
works such as red detachment of women 
since then the troupe has expanded its repertoire and won 
international honors for its mastery of western classical works in 
recent years the company toured the united states britain and the 
soviet union with a repertoire that includes chinese and western 
classics as well as works from the cultural revolution 
the dancers like chinese athletes are recruited in elementary 
school and trained in special schools

and maria fay have coached chinese dancers but miss sappington 
says she will be the first to choreograph a ballet from scratch 
she said the chinese are excited about the chance to improvise 
i hope this creative experience will make a lasting 
relationship for cultural exchange not only for me but also for 
other western choreographers and the central ballet she said 
miss sappington made her debut with oh calcutta the 
broadway musical that won notoriety for its nudity she also has 
worked with the harkness ballet the pennsylvania ballet the 
nederlands dans theatre aterballetto in italy and the milwaukee 
ballet

a senior iranian diplomat who will 
participate in direct talks with iraq said today lasting peace will 
result only if iraq is branded the aggressor in the 8yearold war 
and iran receives compensation 
also today tehran radio said iraqi warplanes violated iranian 
airspace in the southwest no bombing was reported the official 
iraqi news agency monitored in cyprus carried no reports of 
fighting 
cyrus nasseri head of the iranian mission to the united nations 
in geneva spoke at an international conference organized by iran 
to discuss aggression and defense direct peace talks between 
iran and iraq are scheduled to begin aug 25 
the talks in geneva are going to be very difficult irans 
rights have to be preserved he said using irans shorthand for 
its repeated demand that iraq be identified as starting the war 
iran also wants compensation for aggression he said he did 
not make any detailed reference to the claims official iranian 
assessments have put the cost of war damage at 350 billion 
if there is a positive response from the international 
community to this key issue then we can hope for lasting peace 
he said 
iraq invaded iran in september 1980 after border skirmishes 
nasseri said iran decided on uly 18 to accept a un ceasefire 
resolution partly because the superpowers and other countries were 
siding with iraq and imposing a full political and economic embargo 
on iran 
to avoid further loss of life and property it was decided to 
give another chance to reconciliation he said 
nasseri said the west and countries around the persian gulf 
rejected conciliatory approaches from iran he said the united 
states wanted iran in trouble because in the back of their minds 
they thought this could resolve their problems such as the hostage 
crisis 
nine americans are among 18 foreigners believed held hostage in 
lebanon by proiranian groups 
nasseri made repeated references to two schools of thought in 
the iranian leadership those in favor of conciliation and those 
who prefer a defiant stance 
at every instance in the past one can see that irans intent 
was to use a conciliatory approach but it was pushed into a 
corner he said that left no alternative we were forced on 
the path of defiance 
tehran radio also said the cabinet discussed postwar 
reconstruction efforts today and reviewed implementing the 
ceasefire accords after a briefing by foreign minister ali akbar 
velayati it did not elaborate 
velayati returned to tehran today after spending three weeks 
negotiating at the united nations 
five members of the un iraniraq military observer group 
arrived today to supervise implementation of a ceasefire the 
official islamic republic news agency reported 
the observers initially will work in the southern and western 
areas of the country to monitor military movements until the 
ceasefire starts officially on aug 20 irna said 
the full contingent of 350 observers from 25 countries is 
expected to be in place within a week well before the scheduled 
ceasefire date according to un officials

rep pat swindall met with the house ethics 
committee investigating whether he violated the law or house rules 
and he gave the panel copies of tape recordings made during a 
federal money laundering probe last year 
swindall met behind closed doors for nearly three hours tuesday 
with the house committee on standards of official conduct 
the committee decided in june to conduct a preliminary 
investigation to determine if swindall violated the law or house 
rules in pursuing an 850000 home construction loan after being 
told it likely would be financed with drug money he would be 
helping to launder 
swindall said he gave the committee copies of tape recordings 
made last year of conversations between swindall and two men 
charles lechasney who later was indicted on money laundering 
charges and michael mullaney an internal revenue service 
undercover agent 
us attorney robert barr in atlanta refused earlier to provide 
the committee with the tape recordings because he said the money 
laundering investigation has not been completed swindall has not 
been charged in connection with the federal probe 
swindall said that among other things he also gave the 
committee a copy of a constituent newsletter listing a summary of 
facts about the case 
all i am doing is turning over information that i promised to 
turn over to the ethics committee so that they can look into my 
request which was that they consider all of the information 
swindall said 
committee chairman julian dixon dcalif and other committee 
members refused to answer questions about the investigation or 
about the meeting with swindall 
swindall requested the ethics committee probe after the atlanta 
journal and the atlanta constitution obtained copies of the tape 
recordings and reported details of the loan negotiations 
swindall at one point accepted a 150000 check from lechasney 
but returned it uncashed several days later the tapes show that he 
broke off the negotiations after mullaney told him he would have to 
accept the loan proceeds in cash and sign a receipt for them

church said the rev john fricke senior pastor 
it drips a little holy honey when it gets hot fricke said 
it comes down a pillar support right onto the floor weve put 
aluminum foil around the pillar to make kind of a drip dish it 
tastes wonderful 
in july the church hired roger miller of miller apiaries to 
remove the bees and honeycombs so workers could safely paint the 
windows and gutter frames 
miller said he vacuumed up about 15000 bees and turned them 
loose and exterminated the remaining 15000 to 35000 bees lodged 
in wall cavities beyond his reach 
i salvaged about 100 pounds of the honey from a twoinch 
slot miller said im going to bottle it and put these little 
gold crosses on them ill give it back to the church and weve 
talked about selling it with a slogan like honey from on high 
the church has not decided whether to sell the honey said 
fricke but any proceeds might go toward rebuilding trinitys 
50yearold pipe organ

the government has cut off funding for a 
study on the effectiveness of condoms in preventing the spread of 
aids among homosexuals for fear of infecting study participants it 
was reported today 
the los angeles times said about 26 million was halted for the 
study by the university of california at los angeles tests 
involving people had not yet begun 
the combination of high aids infection rates and the possibility 
of condom failure prompted the cutoff said dr jeffrey perlman 
chief of contraceptive evaluation for the national institute of 
child health and human development 
what has happened in the last two years is that gays in los 
angeles became supersaturated with the virus so that to go ahead 
with this study would mean that there is going to be a large 
proportion of the recruits who would have become infected said 
perlman the grants project officer on that basis it really 
came to an ethical issue 
dr roger detels the head of the ucla study refused to comment 
on the cancellation of the projects funds 
the money would have been used to study how effective condoms 
are in stopping the spread of the aids virus during anal sex 
project workers already have spent 1 million in federal funds 
on laboratory tests to determine the abilities of different kinds 
and brands of condoms to inhibit aids transmission

the skull referred to in yale universitys 
secret skull and bones society belongs to mexican revolutionary 
pancho villa a group of history buffs believes 
a lawyer for the society which vice president george bush 
joined in his yale days says the story is unfounded 
the group of about a dozen history and archaeology enthusiasts 
has tried to persuade villas widow and the mexican government to 
sue to recover the skull and return it to villas grave in mexico

invasion of the united states mainland when his forces raided 
columbus nm in 1916 he was assassinated in 1923 and grave 
robbers stole his skull in 1926 
the el paso group members who discuss their interest over lunch 
every wednesday began the quest for villas skull about 18 months 
ago 
they read the memoirs of arizona native ben williams who said a 
skull and bones member told him the society had the skull said 
alex apostolides curator of el pasos wilderness museum and a 
member of the group 
enidcott p davison a connecticut lawyer who says he speaks for 
the secret yale society said it does not have villas skull 
the el paso group also wrote an appeal to bush asking him to 
persuade the club to surrender the skull if it has it bushs 
office in washington confirmed the letter had been received but 
said no reply had been written 
neither the mexican government nor villas 92yearold widow has 
expressed interest in suing the el paso group cannot sue because

done nothing wrong bakker said 
the combses had charged that ptl sold more lifetime partnerships 
than the hotel could accommodate and that they couldnt get a

exactor ben jones who played a mechanic on the dukes of 
hazzard dismantled his opponents in a bid to face an embattled 
republican congressman in georgia this fall while a 44year 
illinois incumbency ended by death was returned to democratic hands 
in other primaries tuesday georgia voters picked a young 
democratic attorney to take on republican rep newt gingrich a 
fiveterm congressman who has led efforts to force an investigation 
of house speaker jim wright 
colorado had primaries in six congressional districts but only 
one pitched battle state rep david bath defeated former secretary 
of state mary estill buchanan who lost to gary hart in the 1980 
senate race in a race scarcely noticed by voters 
elsewhere ralph david abernathy iii son of the civil rights 
leader decisively won the democratic nomination for a state house 
seat in atlanta abernathy will meet republican john e thompson in 
the fall 
jones 47 had been rated the democratic favorite against rep 
pat swindell in georgias 4th district race both as a result of 
his 1986 campaign effort and his role as the mechanic cooter on 
the dukes of hazzard television show 
they laughed at us when we got in the ring two years ago 
theyre taking us seriously now jones told cheering supporters 
at his headquarters tuesday night 
his opponents sought to counter that advantage by portraying 
jones as too liberal attacking jones after he told a college group 
in may he would be willing to consider legalizing drugs 
he acknowledged making the statement but insisted that he also 
told the group he would consider that as an option only after a 
massive effort to eradicate drugs 
with all 220 precincts reporting unofficial totals jones had 
32637 votes or 62 percent lawyer nick moraitakis 10832 or 21 
percent and theater executive john stembler 8814 or 17 percent 
jones said stemblers attempt to trash him played into 
swindalls hands on the other hand he praised moraitakis for 
taking a high road 
in southern illinois democrat jerry costello won a special 
election to fill the final 4 months of the late rep mel prices 
term but republicans say the race was close enough to merit their 
continued attention in november 
were extremely encouraged by all this said kenny klinge 
chairman of the national republican campaign committee despite the 
narrow defeat of gop candidate robert gaffner a college 
administrator 
so was costello who expressed confidence about winning a full 
twoyear term in november 
were going to take the republicans and the republican 
national congressional committee in the november election too 
he told supporters were going to grab them by the nose and kick 
them in the feet and make them like it 
costello chairman of the st clair county board and one of the 
most powerful democratic party leaders in the region won the race 
with 33247 votes or 515 percent to gaffners 31279 or 485 
percent according to unofficial returns 
price a democrat died in april after nearly 44 years in 
congress 
in georgias 6th district race to oppose gingrich unofficial 
returns from 211 of 218 precincts showed david worley a 
30yearold attorney with 32134 votes or 56 percent to 
businessman clyde owens 25411 or 44 percent worley had the 
backing of georgia house speaker tom murphy 
worley focused more on gingrich than on his democratic rival 
during the primary campaign saying at one point that gingrichs 
five terms in congress represented 10 years of doubletalking 
doubledealing and deceit 
gingrich accused worley of running a remarkably negative and 
inaccurate campaign and said he would debate the challenger in 
every county of the district 
in all eight of georgias 10 congressmen won renomination 
without opposition in the primary election both of those opposed 
were victorious

a former nazi concentration camp guard 
arrested in northern italy was deported today to west germany 
police said 
officials in west germany said anton maloth 76 could be freed 
when he arrives in munich because no criminal charges are pending 
against him 
maloth was sentenced to death in czechoslovakia in 1948 for war 
crimes but italy and czechoslovakia have no extradition treaty 
west german citizens cannot by law be extradited to a foreign 
country 
a police official in bolzano who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said maloth left verona this afternoon on a plane bound 
for munich 
the official said maloth held an expired west german passport 
which was why he was being sent to that country he said maloth had 
been expelled to west germany from italy twice before in 1965 and 
1972 
czechoslovakia submitted an extradition request tuesday but 
even if the two countries had an extradition treaty italian law 
forbids extraditing someone facing the death penalty because italy 
has no capital punishment 
maloth was arrested last week at his wifes home in merano 
viennabased nazi hunter simon wiesenthal said maloth had been 
hiding with his family in italy for 15 years maloth was a member 
of the nazi ss and a guard at the theresienstadt concentration camp 
in wartime czechoslovakia 
in west germany the foreign ministry today confirmed that 
maloth was being deported and would arrive in munich today 
a ministry spokesman peter rothen said in bonn that he did not 
know whether maloth would be taken into custody in munich 
we have determined that he is a german citizen and therefore 
under the constitution cannot be extradited rothen said 
klaus schacht a west german prosecutor in charge of the maloth 
case said investigators intend to question maloth when maloth 
comes to munich i will have the border police ask him where he 
intends to settle in west germany and then we will question him 
schacht said 
so far there are no criminal charges against him the 
prosecutor said

civil rights groups are condemning a new 
police department policy of stopping and questioning groups of 
black teenagers in the citys old west end in an attempt to curb 
racial violence there 
police chief marti felker in a july 8 letter to leaders of the 
old west end association said he has instructed a deputy chief to 
pay special attention to groups of black juveniles in the 
racially mixed neighborhood 
officers are to stop and identify these youths so that in the 
event an occurrence does take place investigators will have the 
names of the juveniles to work on felker said 
the order resulted from complaints by old west end residents 
who reported thrree instances of violence involving black youths 
felker on tuesday defended his action saying it was used two 
years ago to stop whites from harassing blacks on the citys south 
end 
but leroy williams president of the toledo chapter of the 
national association for the advancement of colored people said 
while police watched white teenagers in 1986 they never stopped 
them 
he added that his organization will try to set up a meeting with 
felker to discuss the policy 
certainly police need to be vigilant but stopping black 
youths because they are congregating in the area of town and not 
stopping youths congregating in other areas of town is 
unconstitutional he said 
harland britz general counsel of the american civil liberties 
union said the policy violates constitutional protections against 
illegal search and seizure 
i dont think police have the right to stop any youths just 
because they are standing around that sounds very questionable to 
me he said

mayoral challenger zev yaroslavsky has 
disavowed memos from campaign consultants disparaging mayor tom 
bradleys intelligence 
they are not my consultants nor are they any longer under 
consideration the city councilman said i do not agree with 
many of their ideas and i find many of their statements to be 
insulting insensitive and not reflective of my views 
the memos published in tuesdays los angeles times came from the 
consulting firm bad 
the reason why bad thinks you can beat bradley is youve got 
50 iq points on him and thats no compliment but your iq 
advantage is of no electoral advantage if you dont use it the 
consultants wrote 
the consultants also predicted bradley will excite black 
voters to outvote the white electorate especially if there is a 
runoff where his mayoral office is seen as jeopardized by a 
perfidious jew 
bradley is black and yaroslavsky jewish 
bradley said of the memos the background quality by which 
they propose to start the campaign is so offensive 
yaroslavsky aide ann hollister said the memos were stolen her 
office the newspaper said the documents were delivered anonymously 
to a reporter 
yaroslavsky who plans to challenge bradley in the nonpartisan 
mayoral primary in april said he did not ask for the memos 
i have a very high personal regard for tom bradley he said 
tuesday i would not in any way countenance demeaning his 
personal stature his intelligence or his commitment to what he

the us navy is investigating 
allegations that a navy ship refused to rescue some vietnamese boat 
people who later resorted to murder and cannibalism to survive at 
sea officials said today 
navy officials said the sailors reported giving food and water 
to the boat people not considering them to be in dire straits 
weve made all information available to the united states and 
we know they are conducting an investigation and are very serious 
about it said robert cooper local representative of the un 
high commission on refugees cooper said in a telephone interview 
that the probe began last month 
he said the 52 refugees who survived the 37day ordeal charged 
that crewmen of the uss dubuque refused to take them aboard even 
though their boat was disabled and they were dying of exposure and 
starvation 
cooper said the refugees reported that 58 people died during the 
south china sea crossing which began may 22 when the group left 
the mekong delta town of ben tre aboard a 35foot wooden boat 
its engine failed two or three days later 
by the june 9 encounter with the dubuque according to the 
refugees there was one dead refugee aboard the motor was not 
working they were drifting for 19 days people had died of 
exposure hunger and thirst cooper said 
the refugees claimed to have later killed some of their 
companions and eaten their flesh to survive cooper said the 
great majority of other deaths also occurred after the 
encounter with the dubuque 
officials at subic bay naval base northwest of manila and at 
the us navys surface force pacific fleet office in san diego 
calif confirmed that an investigation was under way 
they said the dubuques commander reported that the refugee boat 
was seaworthy and that they left the vietnamese after giving them 
more than 400 pounds of food 50 gallons of water navigational 
charts and sailing directions 
a navy spokesman cmdr david dillon in san diego said he did 
not think the crew would have turned the refugees away if their 
boat was disabled 
the manila chronicle quoted some of the refugees as saying the 
crew told them the dubuque was on a dangerous mission and could 
not take them aboard 
dillon said the dubuque was headed for the persian gulf but 
that its destination would not have been an excuse not to rescue 
the vietnamese if their boat was in distress 
its not a navy policy not to allow refugees on board he 
said its a policy to render humanitarian assistance whenever 
needed and however possible in this case the commanding officer 
judged their craft to be seaworthy 
dillon said navy policy directs ships to be alert for refugees 
on the high seas and assist them as needed the policy calls for 
ships to pick up refugees if their boat is disabled or in case of 
bad weather 
filipino fishermen rescued the vietnamese off northern luzon 
island on june 27 they were taken to a refugee camp housing more 
than 4000 other vietnamese refugees on palawan island 
cooper said investigators had not determined how many people the 
refugees killed 
some said more than three were killed some said less than 
three he said 
cooper said the alleged mastermind of the cannibalism was in 
protective custody to prevent other refugees from harming him 
the manila chronicle identified the first alleged victim as a 
30yearold man named dao coung who wept and pleaded to be spared 
why not wait until i starve to death coung reportedly said 
before two men grabbed him by the feet and submerged his head in 
the sea until he was dead the paper reported 
cooper said that if the allegations against the navy crew prove 
true it would be the first time the us navy has failed to 
adequately help a group of boat people since they began fleeing 
after the fall of south vietnam to the communists in 1975

house and senate negotiators have agreed to a 
years prohibition on oil and gas drilling off the northern coast 
of california rep leon panetta dcalif said today 
panetta said the action came tuesday as a joint conference 
committee continued to negotiate differences in the fiscal 1989 
interior department appropriations bills passed by the two chambers 
the language would bar any sales of offshore petroleum leases in 
area 91 through oct 1 1989 as well as prohibit any test drilling 
in the area according to panetta 
he said the renewed ban would represent the end of eight years 
of tussling over the northern california waters with interior 
secretary donald hodel and his predecessor james watt 
we can finally declare victory over the watthodel effort to 
put our coast up for sale panetta said as hard as this

secretary of state george p shultz 
called for renewed nicaraguan peace talks after meeting with 
president oscar arias who said he thinks washington is more 
interested than ever in a diplomatic solution 
shultz is on a mission to involve the united states more closely 
in the yearold central american peace initiative which arias 
authored 
after meeting with the costa rican leader he flew to 
tegucigalpa for talks with honduran president jose azcona hoyo and 
later to el salvador for a visit with acting president rodolfo 
castillo claramount he flies home thursday 
shultz left costa rica at 819 am 1019 am edt on a 
fourhour flight to ecuador the last stop of his latin american 
tour to attend the inauguration of presidentelect rodrigo borja 
shultz said today that other central american governments view 
nicaraguas leftist sandinista government as way out of step with 
everybody else 
from the standpoint of the people of nicaragua their 
government is a complete failure he said on nbctvs today 
show around them is freedom there is democracy asserting itself 
more and more 
the visit to quito gives shultz a further opportunity to talk 
with latin and central american leaders among those attending the 
inauguration are presidents fidel castro of cuba and daniel ortega 
of nicaragua 
shultz is scheduled to meet privately with the new president in 
addition to president virgilio barco of colombia but he ruled out 
meeting with ortega or castro 
castro doesnt deserve it he told nbc he hasnt done 
anything for his people and he is part of the problem here in 
central america 
on tuesday shultz said the usbacked contra rebels are ready 
to return to peace negotiations with nicaragua but not in managua 
the capital 
the most recent round of talks broke off june 9 
i hope there will be another round of negotiations not in 
managua but in another country like for example costa rica 
he told reporters after meeting arias 
the contras insisted on another more neutral location before 
the last round of talks but then agreed to return to managua 
the talks are aimed at establishing a permanent ceasefire in 
the nearly 7yearold war a temporary truce took effect march 21 
and has been extended several times by the sandinistas who accuse 
the contras of numerous ceasefire violations 
arias himself left for quito shortly after meeting with shultz 
and told reporters at the airport washington is attaching more 
importance to central american problems 
i believe washington is convinced now more than ever that 
it is worthwhile to attempt peace through dialogue and 
negotiation the costa rican president added arias has long been 
critical of us support for the nicaraguan rebels 
it was arias who conceived the regional peace plan that was 
signed aug 7 1987 by himself and the presidents of nicaragua el 
salvador honduras and guatemala the effort brought him last 
years nobel peace prize but peace remains a distant hope in the 
region 
arias said his discussion with shultz involved nothing new 
mainly i was informed of his visit to some of the south 
american countries and i told him my impression of events in 
recent days arias said but really ive heard nothing new 
because between the last time i saw him and now nothing special 
has really happened 
they last met in june 
arias noted that he recently wrote ortega asking the nicaraguan 
president to reopen closed news media release about 40 people 
arrested at a recent antigovernment demonstration and renew 
negotiations with the contras he offered costa rica as a site for 
new talks 
shultzs 10day ninenation visit to latin america is his third 
in a little more than a month he began with a stop in guatemala 
city for a meeting with the foreign ministers of costa rica el 
salvador honduras and guatemala 
on monday a bomb damaged three cars of shultzs motorcade in 
bolivia but caused no injuries 
that incident only underlined what were fighting for and 
against shultz told nbc were fighting for decency and 
democracy and freedom and those who are against those things are 
willing to use violent tactics against us that should only 
underscore our resolve

district of columbia mayor marion barry says 
theres no truth to a published report that an aide offered 
columnist carl rowan lenient treatment in his shooting of a 
trespassing teenager if rowan promised to stop criticizing barrys 
administration 
neither i nor mr herbert o reid would ever interfere with 
or attempt to influence prosecutorial decisions by the corporation 
counsel to prosecute the rowan case barry said in a statement 
tuesday 
the legal times newspaper on monday quoted two sources it did 
not identify as saying reid the mayors counsel and confidant had 
tried to make a deal through the columnists son carl rowan jr 
rowans son on tuesday said he was prepared to testify that 
barry and reid had hinted in separate telephone conversations that 
city officials would give his father such treatment if the 
journalist would write columns more favorable to the city 
barry called the younger rowans statement a distortion of the 
truth 
rowan a syndicated columnist is scheduled to go to trial sept 
22 on a charge of using an unregistered handgun and unregistered 
ammunition to shoot benjamin smith 18 of chevy chase md on 
june 14 the columnist had discovered the youth and at least one 
companion taking a latenight dip in rowans backyard pool rowan 
told police he shot smith in the hand because he thought the teen 
was lunging for him 
if found guilty of both charges rowan could be sentenced to two 
years in jail and a 2000 fine 
barry said in his statement its idiocy to even suggest that 
anybody in my administration would want to trade leniency for mr 
rowan for a positive column 
reid charged that the rowan family was trying to divert 
attention from the charges 
its a discretionary tactic and its successful reid told 
the washington post they were able to divert the attention from 
whether or not he had a gun to how the citys being run and whether 
theres corruption in the district 
rowan in a july 1987 column criticized the district government 
for accusing us attorneys of racism whenever they pursued charges 
against corrupt black officials 
enough members of the administration of mayor marion barry 
have pleaded guilty and gone to jail to make it clear that 
corruption exists rowan wrote

white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
today that the reagan administration will have to reconsider its 
opposition to a democraticsponsored contra aid plan if a rival 
republican package fails 
fitzwater told reporters the administration still hopes that a 
rival measure sponsored by senate minority leader bob dole will be 
enacted but if not and something else happens well go to 
plan b the bill sponsored by senate majority leader robert 
c byrd 
the spokesman said that if the administration is forced to 
reassess its opposition to the byrd bill thatll be a hard 
decision 
we have a lot of problems with the byrd bill a lot of 
reservations about it we dont like it it doesnt do the job 
plan b at the moment is to consider the byrd bill 
the byrd plan would provide the contras with 211 million in 
nonlethal humanitarian assistance beginning oct 1 to sustain 
them through next march this would include 10 million for 
relocating contra soldiers into nicaraguan society a feature hotly 
protested by some conservatives 
it also sets up possible house and senate votes this fall on 
releasing 163 million in already approved military aid from 
warehouses in central america if president reagan certifies that 
nicaraguas government has disrupted peace efforts 
an alternative proposed by dole rkan includes the 211 
million in nonlethal aid provides for the release of the 163 
million in warehoused military supplies and adds 20 million in new 
arms assistance dole is being urged to drop that proposal and 
support the byrd plan 
the administration has said it believes the byrd bill provides 
inadequate mechanisms to get aid delivered to the contras 
fitzwaters latest statements came a day after democratic and 
republican senators appeared close to a grudging agreement on a new 
us aid plan for the resistance fighters although they accused 
each other of seeking political advantage 
after days of inconclusive negotiations some republican 
senators said many of their number appeared ready to accept the 
democraticdrafted compromise contra aid plan that package holds 
out the possibility of releasing stockpiled arms to the rebels 
opposing nicaraguas leftist sandinista government 
if agreement is reached it will be because a majority of 
republicans realized that the alternative may be no aid at all 
these senators said 
i go home with high hopes byrd dwva said tuesday at 
the end of another long day of repeated conferences on and off the 
senate floor 
but he added time is running out the sands in the hour glass 
are falling one by one 
byrd made clear that if there is to be a unified senate position 
on contra aid including the possibility of renewing some military 
assistance the concessions will have to be made by the gop 
on my side of the aisle its a fragile coalition and im not 
going to tamper with it byrd said theres just no more give 
on this side our coalition would just fall apart 
several key republican senators most of them moderates urged 
that a compromise be reached saying the alternative might be no 
contra aid of any kind 
the democratic plan would provide immediate humanitarian 
assistance but would not provide military aid unless both house and 
senate approved a subsequent request from president reagan 
sen warren rudman rnh appealing to his colleagues to rally 
behind a single unified package that would be sponsored by both 
byrd and dole told the senate its far more important than any 
political consideration that if even in this election year we can 
speak with one voice to nicaraguas marxist sandinista rulers 
were so close rudman said its almost at the point 
where we ought to join together it would take only a small 
concession from the majority and minority leaders to do it 
sen david boren dokla a strong contraaid supporter accused 
republicans of playing politics with the issue and said the 
reluctance of gop senators to embrace the democratic aid package is 
a real test of their sincerity 
if they really want aid to the contras i dont see how in the 
world they can turn their backs on this proposal boren said 
adding that it represents the only way to get aid to the contras 
through congress without a filibuster by aid opponents 
contra aid has become more sensitive for democrats as the 
campaign for the presidency unfolds 
democratic presidential candidate michael dukakis opposes contra 
aid sen lloyd bentsen dtexas his vice presidential running 
mate has voted for it 
some democrats say their gop counterparts want a clear 
upordown senate vote to dramatize that difference and embarrass 
dukakis 
some republicans see byrds contra aid proposal as a means to 
provide political cover on the issue insulating dukakis and 
bentsen 
but some disagreed that politics is a central element 
its not giving dukakis and bentsen cover or to give our 
side cover dole said were trying to help the contras

the pilot of a twa jet airliner hijacked in 
1985 said today the admitted hijacker of the plane could be telling 
the truth when he testified that he didnt kill a us navy diver 
its possible that he didnt pull the trigger but he and his 
partner were certainly in full concert throughout that whole 
ordeal said pilot john testrake in an interview on cbs this 
morning west german law like us law makes accomplices 
responsible for a crime committed by the other 
testrake said he could not say whether mohammed ali hamadi who 
testified in his trial in frankfurt west germany on tuesday that 
he had taken part in the hijacking was the ringleader 
i think that he was but its been three years now and i 
recognize that memory plays tricks said testrake who is to 
testify in hamadis trial 
i remember that he was the one who spoke german and seemed to 
be in command of the situation in the cockpit at the time diver 
robert dean stethem was murdered and he was conducting the radio 
conversations with the tower and demanding that they comply with 
their wishes testrake said 
hamadi testified that he pleaded with his partner not to kill 
stethem testrake was not asked about that part of hamadis 
testimony 
the pilot said the united states should shoulder a a good 
share of blame for a lot of the conflict thats going on in the 
middle east 
but he said hijacking is a violent desperate act that we have 
to stop he said tightened security has diminished the threat 
testrake said he would like to see hamadi put away quietly for 
a good long time until his attitude improves but he said no 
useful purpose would be served by putting him to death hamadi 
faces a mandatory life sentence if convicted of stethems death

theme that reporters are obligated to help the police 
this has happened again in california where an appellate court 
ruled that a reporter and photographer had a duty to disclose their 
unpublished information about an arrest they witnessed 
taken at face value the judicial rationale may seem persuasive 
newspeople are as much obliged as anyone else to testify about what

the commercial appeal memphis tenn on the trade bill 
after three years of struggle congress has passed the most 
sweeping revision of us trade law in decades 
the bill started out dangerously protectionist but president 
reagan and freetrade lawmakers got rid of the worst parts 
nevertheless one should be wary of a 1100page piece of 
congressional handiwork such monster bills traditionally are 
studded with favors to special interests 
the law had overwhelming support because it had something 
for almost everybody 
perhaps we missed it but we saw nothing there for consumers 
the group without a pac political action committee and thus 
without a loud voice in the corridors of power 
the bill is notable for the damage it will not do no major 
tariff increases new quotas or trade barriers

but at the same time nasa and its congressionaloversight

the baltimore sun on judge hastings impeachment 
the house vote to impeach us district judge alcee hastings 
represents a first it is the first time a federal official has 
been impeached after a jury acquitted him of similar charges 
judge hastings was accused in 1981 of conspiring with a 
washington attorney to solicit a bribe in a racketeering case he 
was acquitted but two judges pursued the case by filing a 
misconduct charge against him 
that led to a recommendation of impeachment by the judicial 
conference of the united states and the congressional inquiry 
the fact that judge hastings was pursued vigorously raises 
suspicions about another first the judge represents he was the 
first black federal judge in florida and now becomes the first 
black judge impeached 
at a time when some blacks believe black elected officials are 
targeted for special harassment the proceedings against judge 
hastings might raise troubling questions 
but blacks in the house didnt seem to think racism was 
involved the house approved a 17count resolution to impeach 
which is tantamount to an indictment that the senate must now act 
on by a nearunanimous 4133 vote

the rapid city sd journal on dukakis health rumors 
the mental and physical wellbeing of a presidential candidate 
is a matter of legitimate public concern 
but the recent episode of the rumored mental problems of 
democratic candidate michael dukakis was mean and petty 
the rumors apparently first surfaced in the form of handbills 
slipped under reporters hotel room doors at the democratic 
national convention in atlanta 
the handbills were signed by the national democratic policy 
committee an arm of political extremist lyndon larouche 
the democrats need not be surprised they are trying hard to 
paint vice president george bush as a wimp 
if they take delight in that kind of character assault it 
should not surprise them when the opposition returns the favor 
if someone has proof that dukakis is unfit lets see it and 
if anybody has evidence that bush is a weakling lets see it 
until then those issues are not worth considering

portland maine press herald on pending legislation calling for 
a sevenday waiting period for handgun sales 
polls show that more than 90 percent of the american people 
favor a waiting period in the purchase of handguns 
even president reagan whose antigun control credentials are 
impeccable recently announced his support of a waiting period 
but the national rifle association which automatically opposes 
even the mildest of gun regulations as an assault on the 
constitutional right to bear arms is predictably fighting this 
amendment as well and the nra still has considerable clout in 
washington 
twenty years ago in the aftermath of a series of political 
assassinations in this country congress passed a law prohibiting 
felons minors illegal aliens drug addicts and those adjudicated 
mentally ill from acquiring handguns 
in states where there is a legal waiting period hundreds of 
such persons are stopped from buying guns every year 
clearly a national law is needed

increasingly farm and rural are not one in the same

rural america is not farms alone it is people who live in the 
country but who dont farm for a living 
the gap between rural and metropolitan america is widening much 
of rural america is dying of an empty heart 
people must stop equating farm policy and rural policy 
politicians must stop trying to solve rural problems with farm 
programs 
in recognition of the new thinking the us department of 
agriculture should be reorganized refocused and reconstituted as a 
department of rural affairs 
it should be cabinet level and explicitly dedicated to the 
wellbeing of all 63 million rural americans not just the 5 
million who live on farms 
it should concentrate less on commodities and more on people and

indications are that it will be a close election are the black

the republicans havent counteracted the jesse jackson 
phenomenon yet but will come up with something 
they have offered a similar day care proposal to that of the 
democrats and the president has agreed to let the labor bill 
proposed by the democrats pass unchallenged to get labors support 
the republicans could have a strong issue if their public

mathias rust 
the improbable odyssey of mathias rust ended aug 3 when the 
20yearold pilot was expelled from the soviet union 
rust stunned the world in may 1987 when he flew a rented cessna 
across the soviet border without permission evaded pursuing jets 
and batteries of antiaircraft missiles and landed safely in red 
square 
this prank exposed surprising vulnerabilities in russias 
defenses and led to the sacking of the soviet defense minister 
convicted of hooliganism and other crimes rust was to spend 
four years in a labor camp 
once sentenced though he remained in the relative comfort of a 
moscow prison there he was treated well and given a chance to 
learn russian and a trade 
the soviets presumably didnt want rust to leave with any hard 
feelings or any inclination to join the west german air force

the daily journal international falls minn on dukakis health 
rumors 
gossip is rarely pleasant and it can be downright hazardous 
when rumors find their way into the pages of a newspaper 
an example is the lyndon laroucheinspired rumor that democratic 
presidential candidate michael dukakis had sought psychiatric help 
to overcome depression 
although larouches minions produced no evidence to document 
their claim the rumor somehow made it to the front pages of 
several of the countrys newspapers 
dukakis has since denied that he has ever sought psychiatric 
treatment and the evidence bears him out 
its unsettling that the media responded to the rumor and 
granted it substance by publishing the story 
seeking psychiatric help to deal with an emotional problem is no 
less responsible than seeing a doctor to help cure a physical 
ailment 
in what we assume to be a more enlightened age the larouche 
rumor should have been quickly dismissed as a nonissue by the 
media

los angeles times on dukakis health rumors 
it is too early to tell whether a physicians report giving gov 
michael dukakis a clean bill of health will dispel the persistent 
rumors that he sought psychiatric treatment 
but amid all the rumors and the innuendoes and the planted 
stories the only question worth raising is should a politician 
who sought psychiatric care be considered unfit for high office 
the answer we submit is no that there should be no more 
stigma attached to seeing a doctor about depression than about shin 
splints or hernias or cancer 
where psychiatry is concerned the issue should not be whether 
someone once received treatment or not but whether he or she is 
currently fit to hold office

kansas city mo star on dukakis health rumors 
implicit in the badgering of michael dukakis about his health 
records is a notion that if he had psychotherapy which he says he

the simple fact is that its just the opposite 
seeking professional help for an emotional impasse is as 
rational as getting a broken leg set by a physician 
if the american people stop to think about it wouldnt it be 
preferable to depend on a leader who corrected a personal problem 
rather than one who denied or ignored it letting it impair

the worldwatch institute in washington dc says that no more 
than a 54day supply is on hand that compares with a 100day 
supply a year ago 
the institute warns that food scarcity may dominate the next 
decade constituting a reversal of the problem to which the united

officials raising money for costs of the

mayor sidney barthelemy said he was pleased the city had gotten 
the money through fundraising and 800000 from the state instead 
of using a hotel tax such as atlanta used to help pay for the 
democratic national convention 
we are often criticized because we do not have our act 
together this shows we are getting our act together the 
mayor said 
new orleans pledged to raise the money as part of its agreement 
with the republican party to land the convention according to a 
final report the city raised nearly 56 million 
as of last night we had 5589000 and contributions are 
still coming in said ron jones chairman of the new orleans 
special events fund 
contributors included all seven parishes in the new orleans 
metropolitan area and some outside of the region jones said 
corporate contributions ranged from 100 to 250000 said jones 
during an appearance last week before the state joint 
legislative budget committee which approved the use of state funds 
for the convention jones said the convention would give louisiana 
an opportunity to attract new business and industry to the state 
this is not just a message about fundraising its a message 
about economic development the convention has given us the

reviewing the document anew line by line after seven subcommittees 
spent tuesday putting their imprint on 158 pages of staffproduced 
working papers 
that draft is largely a distillation of policies from the 1984 
gop platform and stands that bush has staked out on such issues as 
child care and education 
it includes new planks on aids and the homeless as well as the 
gops hard and fast line against abortion and higher taxes 
orr said the subcommittees were not making major changes but 
emphasized until were done on friday its not a done deal 
its not over with 
the subcommittees taking advice from such bush campaign 
emissaries as former texas sen john tower resisted most moves to 
push the platform to the left or right 
the defense subcommittee called for rapid and certain 
deployment of sdi as technology permits the original draft 
echoing bush campaign language had just spoken of deployment as 
soon as possible 
in the family subcommittee lynn glaze a delaware delegate was 
rebuffed three times when she sought to soften the antiabortion 
language her motions were tabled without discussion as was her 
call for support of the equal rights amendment 
bunny chambers a member of the conservative eagle forum from 
oklahoma city who moved to table glazes amendments said i felt 
like wed discussed enough in the past i didnt want to spend 
all the time on it 
the family subcommittee also killed a plank on the special needs 
of little persons dwarfs committee members expressed 
confusion about the term little persons and what the plank was 
doing in the draft 
on aids not addressed in 1984 the draft promises to not only 
marshal our scientific resources against aids but protect 
those who do not have the disease it is silent on the civil 
rights legislation for aids victims recommended by a presidential 
commission 
the family subcommittee did amend the aids plank to say victims 
should be encouraged to seek early diagnosis and to remain on the 
job or in school as long as they are functionally able 
the defense subcommittee balked at an amendment by its 
cochairman angela bay buchanan to declare a goal of us 
space dominance buchanan the former us treasurer from 
irvine calif said she was satisfied with compromise language 
that space must be kept free and secure for all nations 
gone from the draft documents was the 1984 gop declaration that 
we shall keep the peace by keeping our country stronger than any 
potential adversary 
on taxes the draft says republicans unequivocally reiterate 
the notax pledge we have proudly kept 
like the 1984 platform the draft calls for the appointment of 
judges who respect traditional family values and the sanctity of 
human life 
sen lowell p weicker jr of connecticut skipped tuesdays 
session to return to washington but planned to be back today to 
wage his uphill battle for liberal amendments 
the draft documents back a lineitem veto a balanced budget 
amendment to the constitution and a flexible freeze on current 
government spending 
they endorse a childcare tax credit for families of modest 
means bush recently proposed a 1000perchild credit for 
families with incomes up to 20000 
the draft speaks of the importance of imparting to children 
the judeochristian values of western civilization and our ideals 
of liberty the family subcommittee rejected an amendment to 
change judeochristian to traditional 
on abortion the draft declares the unborn child has a 
fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed 
and calls again for a constitutional amendment to ban abortion 
it says republicans deplore the apartheid system of south 
africa but warns against economic pressures that harm black 
workers and entrepreneurs there 
the foreign policy panel added a plank declaring that 
republicans are strongly committed to obtaining the freedom of 
all americans held captive by terrorist elements in the middle 
east

a judge today extended until thursday afternoon the 
deadline for maria desillers to give up a bmw car jewelry and 
other items allegedly bought with money donated for her sons liver 
transplants 
ms desillers who missed an earlier deadline tuesday vowed to 
defy the judge on at least one item the deed to a cemetery plot 
beside that of her son ronnie a 7yearold who died last year 
while awaiting his fourth transplant 
ill be damned if ill turn over the cemetery plot where i was 
supposed to go next to my son mrs desillers said if they 
want it theyre going to have to take me with it 
probate judge francis christie had earlier ordered ms desillers 
to turn over the luxury items by tuesday afternoon but he gave her 
an extension today because she replaced her attorney with johnson 
her attorney frank johnson said he had not decided what steps 
to take 
the judge was to rule later on whether to charge ms desillers 
with contempt for withholding financial records sought by the 
curator 
ms desillers is accused of misusing some of nearly 689000 
donated for her sons transplants including 1000 from president 
reagan she claims the money is hers as ronnies heir 
after ronnies death in 1987 his mother spent 11000 on 
jewelry gave a total of 40000 to her brother exhusband and 
exboyfriend and paid herself an 88000 salary to head her 
nowdefunct ronnie desillers national foundation according to the 
curator of the boys estate 
ms desillers has refused to pay a 262000 bill from pittsburgh 
childrens hospital which she faults for her sons death a charge 
doctors there vehemently deny 
christie has ruled that the 243000 remaining in the boys 
estate will pay his outstanding hospital bills and may also be 
given to other needy ill children 
ms desillers contends that she bought the disputed items with 
her own money but robin gievers curator of ronnies estate says 
that after the boys death ms desillers had no job or income 
source besides the donations

the federal reserves unexpected jolt to its key 
bank lending rate to a 2year high likely will push other 
interest rates higher including those on home mortgages 
economists predict 
the fed announced tuesday it was raising its discount rate to 
65 percent from 6 percent to help curb inflation and to account 
for the recent rise of openmarket interest rates 
the discount rate is the interest the central bank charges on 
loans to member banks a change in the closelywatched rate is the 
most dramatic move the fed can make in signaling its credit 
policies 
because the banks set their interest rates based on how much it 
costs them to borrow money many economists predict other rates 
will edge higher due to tuesdays action that likely will mean 
consumers will have to pay more for credit on houses cars and 
items charged on credit cards 
i wouldnt be surprised if we had another bank prime rate 
hike by friday said david resler chief economist for nomura 
securities inc 
financial markets reacted quickly to tuesdays move with the 
dollar soaring and stock and bond prices falling sharply 
the dollar jumped to 13515 japanese yen in new york from 
133725 yen late monday and rose sharply against other major 
currencies 
on wall street the dow jones average of 30 industrials fell 
2827 points to 207913 amid speculation of further rate 
increases it was down 33 points more by midday today 
in the credit markets the treasurys bellwether 30year bond 
fell by about 10 per 1000 face amount while its yield jumped to 
919 percent from 910 percent late monday 
a month ago major banks boosted their prime lending rates to 
95 percent the highest level in more than two years from 9 
percent in response to rising interest rates in the credit markets 
which had boosted the banks cost of borrowing 
the prime is a key rate used to calculate a range of fixed and 
adjustablerate corporate and consumer loans 
many economists had expected the fed to tighten its reins on the 
money supply this week but few were expecting a discount rate hike 
the credit markets have been screaming for a discount rate 
increase for quite some time the surprise was in the timing of 
it said irwin kellner chief economist for manufacturers hanover 
trust co 
not only is the republican convention coming up but were in 
the middle of a treasury refunding in which the government is 
auctioning off 22 billion in new notes this week to pay off its 
old debts kellner said 
i dont think inflation is any worse today than it was last 
year said kellner 
robert a brusca chief financial economist for nikko securities 
co international inc defended the discountrate hike 
its the feds job to throw cold water on the economy when it 
starts overheating and thats what it appears to be doing right 
now he said 
among recent signs of economic strength was the july 
unemployment rate which at 54 percent was near its 14year lows 
tuesdays increase brings the discount rate to its highest level 
since april 1986 when it was lowered to 65 percent from 7 percent 
the hike was the second since alan greenspan replaced paul a 
volcker at the feds helm a year ago on sept 4 the central bank 
raised the rate for the first time in three years to 6 percent 
from 55 percent 
while septembers increase also was taken in response to 
inflationary fears some analysts later cited it as a contributing 
factor to the oct 19 stock market crash

postmaster general anthony frank said today 
that his agency is shelving a major portion of its controversial 
contract with texas billionnaire h ross perot and will seek 
competitive bidding 
one portion of the deal to help improve postal efficiency has 
drawn sharp criticism because of its seemingly openended payment 
structure and the fact that it was negotiated without competitive 
bidding 
we are now aware of concerns and believe we can overcome 
them by modifying the contract frank told two senate 
subcommittees 
frank said he hopes to be able to resume one part of the deal a 
sixmonth 500000 agreement for perot systems inc to analyze 
various postal operations and recommend ways to save money 
but the second part in which the savings would be implemented 
will no longer be the sole scope of perot frank said 
the original contract gave perot the exclusive right to 
implement its recommendations and would have based payment on a 
percentage of any savings 
under a renegotiated deal these moneysaving projects said 
frank would be done on a fully competitive basis and perot 
systems would not compete for this business 
the contract has been suspended at the recommendation of the 
general services administration board of contract appeals although 
the postal service contends that the board doesnt have 
jurisdiction over it 
once that dispute is settled other modifications to the perot 
contract can also be worked out frank said including its length 
and the ability of the government to terminate the agreement 
franks testimony came at a joint hearing of the senate 
governmental affairs subcommittees on federal services post office 
and civil service and on oversight of government operations

the mayor of edmonton members of parliament and 
even wayne gretzkys father bemoaned the loss of the hockey 
superstar to the united states but its a path pioneered by many 
other canadians from mary pickford to michael j fox 
the decision tuesday by the edmonton oilers to trade gretzky 
the great one to the los angeles kings touched the most 
sensitive nerve in this northern culture the fear that canadas 
best and brightest inevitably end up in the united states 
the expatriates include economist john kenneth galbraith and 
anchorman peter jennings but its hollywood that has brought the 
most fame to canadians such as miss pickford fox glenn ford 
raymond burr lorne greene raymond massey ruby keeler yvonne de 
carlo rich little john candy and margot kidder 
its like ripping a heart out of a city said dejected 
edmonton mayor laurence decore who credits gretzky with putting 
his bluecollar city of 574000 people on the map 
it is not just for the four stanley cups and his numerous 
records that gretzky will be missed his sincerity and quiet charm 
made him a goodwill ambassador for the city 
the tabloid edmonton sun carried a simple sad headline 
wednesday 99 tears referring to the number on gretzkys 
jersey 
telephone lines to local radio stations were jammed 
weve had literally hundreds of calls said rod phillips 
playbyplay announcer for edmonton radio station cfrn everyone 
we talked to said thats it im never going to see another 
oilers game 
callers blamed gretzkys departure on the american he married 
july 16 actress janet jones who has a home in los angeles 
although 3000 fans lovingly greeted the newlyweds when they 
were married in a lavish ceremony in edmonton many people have now 
turned against the bride she was likened to john lennons widow 
yoko ono blamed by some fans for the breakup of the beatles 
an edmonton sun editorial disagreed the great one owes 
edmonton nothing it is edmonton who owes gretzky and all we 
can do it seems in repayment is label gretzky a traitor and call 
his new wife a jezebel 
many fans were bitter because the trade came one day after the 
deadline for renewing season tickets and one irate supporter 
burned an effigy of oilers owner peter pocklington in front of 
national tv cameras 
in ottawa parliament member nelson riis of the new democratic 
party made a tongueincheek demand for government intervention 
wayne gretzky is a national symbol like the beaver riis 
said the edmonton oilers without wayne gretzky is like apple pie 
without ice cream like winter without snow like the wheel of 
fortune without vanna white 
prime minister brian mulroneys office stayed out of the 
controversy 
we wish mr gretzky well and were sure he will be a great 
representative of canada and all thats finest in canadas national 
game no matter where he plays a spokesman for mulroney told the 
associated press 
one official pointed out that bobby orr gordie howe and bobby 
hull three other canadian hockey legends also played for 
american teams 
legislators in alberta province demanded an investigation of 
government loans given pocklington on the basis of his contract 
with gretzky as collateral 
the government should hold up the deal until theyve 
investigated to make sure the taxpayers arent being honked said 
liberal party leader nick taylor 
gretzkys father walter who trained his son on a backyard rink 
in brantford ontario said he was as patriotic as any other 
canadian and was sorry to see the move 
hes a canadian institution and had been in edmonton for nine 
years but if its what wayne wants and it makes him happy then 
im delighted for him he said 
if there was one bright spot on the canadian landscape it glowed 
in calgary the southern alberta city whose team the flames are 
locked in a bitter rivalry with the oilers 
this should be a civic holiday here said calgary fan david

japan which imports nearly all its oil from the gulf region 
already has donated 20 million this year to un peacekeeping 
efforts earmarking half of the amount for the iraniraq peace 
effort

ceasefire monitoring effort un spokesman francois giuliani said 
today

next week the general assembly will reconvene in special

group said un spokeswoman nadia younes the special session 
begins tuesday and is expected to last two days 
the un financially ailing mainly because america has been 
withholding a large part of its assessed contribution for several 
years is due to run out of funds in october or even earlier if

350member un iraniraq military observer group a day after 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar announced a ceasefire 
effective aug 20 
direct peace talks between iran and iraq are scheduled to begin 
five days later in geneva

if iraq is branded the aggressor in the war and iran receives 
compensation

the southwest no bombing was reported and the official iraqi news 
agency carried no reports of fighting 
more than 24 hours after receiving word of a truce in the

had a more subdued reaction the nations acting commanderinchief 
and parliament spearker hashemi rafsanjani said soldiers should 
remain vigilant in the face of iraqi mischief

the united states which is assessed more than 200 million a 
year a quarter of the annual un budget is 467 million in 
arrears the total of unpaid contributions to the un budget by 
member nations is 602 million

reform in the budgetmaking process personnel cuts and changes in 
practices that allow soviet un employees to remain under their 
governments control 
i think the united states will meet its obligations and make 
its payments said us ambassador vernon a walters 
this un peace effort proves definitively that the united 
nations has a purpose that it is useful to all peaceloving 
countries including the united states of america he said it 
has stopped the biggest war since world war ii 
perez de cuellar announced the ceasefire date after iraq gave 
up its demand for facetoface talks with iran as a precondition to 
a truce

accepting the ceasefire resolution july 18 a full year after the 
security council passed it

internationally recognized borders exchange of prisoners peace

michael dukakis today defended his firstterm 
decision not to begin cleaning up boston harbor and shrugged off 
polls showing that george bush has cut into his lead in the 
presidential race 
the massachusetts governor at a groundbreaking ceremony at the 
site of part of the harbor project said those who blame him for 
delaying the cleanup are preaching revisionist history 
in his first term in the mid1970s dukakis decided against 
proceeding with a cleanup plan shortly after he was voted out of 
office in 1978 the state applied for a waiver from the clean water 
act 
he stood by that decision today saying there were very 
respected people experts in the field who disagreed on what 
needed to be done to rid the harbor of pollution 
the federal environmental protection agency eventually rejected 
the waiver request and a subsequent appeal and the state is now 
under federal court order to complete the cleanup by 1999 it is 
expected to cost at least 6 billion 
dukakis responding to reporters questions at the ceremony 
said he was not surprised to see that his lead in the polls has 
been cut by the republican vice president 
this is going to be a very tough competitive 90 days 
dukakis said of his race with bush heading into the november 
election 
dukakis was spending most of today at the statehouse before 
heading back out to campaign thursday and friday 
on tuesday dukakis turned back bushs latest salvo with a line 
nearly copied from the presidents political phrasebook 
there he goes again dukakis responded to bushs accusation 
that he is on the liberal fringe president reagan used a 
similar line in 1980 as he debated jimmy carter 
the vice president renewed his attack while dukakis joined 
fellow governors at a national gathering in cincinnati and 
attended a second private session with democratic governors who 
emerged praising his candidacy and promising to support it 
the governors are going to be an essential part of this 
campaign they are going to be an essential part of the next 
administration said dukakis governor of massachusetts 
bush in pennsylvania charged dukakis was on the very very 
far liberal fringe and that his lead was evaporating 
with less than a week to go before the republicans hold their 
convention in new orleans where dukakis can expect to come under 
intense attack dukakis aides maintained they were unconcerned by 
the new gallup poll showing a 10 point decline in dukakis 
advantage over the vice president 
the survey showed his 17point lead had declined to a 
sevenpoint margin of 49 percent to 42 percent 
campaign spokesman mark gearan called the decline 
understandable and attributed it to a public shift in focus to 
the republicans in advance of the republican national convention 
which begins monday in new orleans 
after the republican convention it could be very very 
close gearan said it could be dead even if not showing 
george bush taking the advantage 
he said the 1984 democratic nominee walter mondale rose 
dramatically in the polls during his convention week that year a 
rise that proved only momentary 
at the national governors association dukakis went to the site 
of a housing development project to call attention to a resolution 
passed on a unanimous bipartisan vote calling for a new national 
housing policy 
the proposal calls for a 28 billion increase in government 
spending on housing to help states and cities expand the supply of 
affordable housing through grants and tax measures it would 
provide rent subsidies and address what dukakis called the 
problem of home ownership for young families 
whats missing these days is any sense in the white house that 
there is a national commitment to affordable housing to the people 
of this country dukakis said i dont just mean families of 
low and moderate income i mean young families who ought to have 
an opportunity to own their own home at a price they can afford

democrat michael dukakis said today the fall campaign against 
george bush is going to be a very tough competitive 90 days 
as new poll numbers and big dollar figures gave republicans a boost 
in advance of next weeks convention 
a gallup poll released tuesday put dukakis margin at seven 
points over bush less than half of the 17point edge the 
massachusetts governor enjoyed coming out of the democratic 
national convention last month in atlanta 
i like it i like it bush said tuesday night in 
philadelphia 
althought bush was quick to say he doesnt trust the polls he 
did agree that things are moving were beginning to get them in 
focus 
dukakis said in boston today that he was not surprised by the 
swinging numbers in the polls 
this is going to be a very tough competitive 90 days 
through the nov 8 election the democratic presidential nominee 
said 
bush still has the republican national convention to come 
beginning monday in new orleans with its four nights of prime time 
partisanship designed to boost his standing with the voters he was 
spending today in washington and working on his acceptance speech 
the republican national committee got good news from its finance 
officials today hearing that the party has 135 million cash on 
hand toward a goal of more than 70 million toward election of 
republican candidates at all levels this year 
with dukakis and bush staying close to home today former 
democratic hopeful jesse jackson lashed out at both men for their 
recent campaign styles 
this campaign ought to focus on direction and not on dirt 
jackson told reporters after having breakfast in washington with 
democratic house members this campaign boils down to bush 
attacking dukakis with oneliners every day and dukakis is 
becoming preoccupied with the bushnoriega connection the 
bushirancontra connection of exchanging drugs for arms 
if it gets warped into sleaze then there will be no hope left 
for the people jackson added 
dukakis moved to blunt a stinging republican attack on his 
support for a clean environment 
the massachusetts governor took part in the groundbreaking for 
a new sewage treatment plant on boston harbor the first step in a 
6 billion effort to clean up what the environmental protection 
agency has called the filthiest harbor in the nation 
in his first term as governor dukakis opposed committing 
massive resources to the cleanup today he defended that decision 
saying there were very respected people experts in the field 
who disagreed on what needed to be done to rid the harbor of 
pollution 
he fired back at those who blame him for the pollution problems 
saying they are guilty of revisionist history 
bush had been getting some political mileage out of the harbor 
pollution 
he goes down to new jersey and talks about the pollution off 
of new jersey and look over his shoulder is boston harbor one of 
the most seriously polluted bodies of water in this country bush 
said sunday 
tuesday brought good news for bush in a new poll 
the gallup survey put dukakiss support at 49 percent and bushs 
at 42 percent in telephone interviews with 1004 registered voters 
aug 57 
only two weeks ago dukakis was sporting a 17point margin over 
bush a 5437 result in a gallup poll each survey had a 3 
percentage point margin of error 
that would mean that the bump dukakis gained from the 
democratic convention had essentially evaporated 
larry bathgate of new jersey gop national finance chairman 
said the committee had raised 349 million in the first seven 
months of this year the second largest amount the rnc had ever 
raised in such a time period in addition he said the convention 
gala a luncheon scheduled next thursday is expected to raise 
between 5 million and 6 million 
the democrats also arent doing badly in the money department 
house speaker jim wright said in washington noting the party 
raised about 12 million at this point compared to a 9 million 
debt in 1984 
we are somewhat stunned we just dont know how to take that 
prosperity we have a selfidentify problem we never had money in 
the bank weve always been in debt wright said after a private 
meeting with dukakis campaign manager susan estrich 
tuesday also brought another round of charges and countercharges 
between the majorparty presidential candidates on themes that may 
well dominate the fall campaign 
each sought to raise questions about just where his opponent 
stands on the issues 
hes trying to run away from a record in massachusetts on the 
very very far liberal fringe bush said of dukakis he thinks 
he can preempt the middle 
there he goes again replied dukakis recalling the line 
ronald reagan used to cut down jimmy carter in a 1980 presidential 
debate 
bush had labeled dukakis the stealth candidate on monday 
but the democratic nominee came straight back at the incumbent vice 
president 
i dont think bushs positions are clear on much of 
anything dukakis said before the national governors association 
meeting in cincinnati 
in fact dukakis took the unusual position of claiming that 
president reagan is closer to his position on a range of important 
issues than he is to bush 
its an administration thats growing dukakis said 
frankly theyre coming a lot closer to where i am the 
interesting thing is the president and i are closer together on 
ussoviet relations than he is with bush 
the republican nomineetobe said he is still not ready to talk 
about his choice of a running mate the remaining piece of the 
puzzle to set up the fall election campaign 
im not close in the sense of like tomorrow making a final 
decision the vice president said adding he is holding to his 
plan to announce this choice on the conventions final day

american airlines today announced plans to base up 
to 700 pilots and flight attendants in southern florida home of 
embattled eastern airlines 
american based in fort worth texas is deeply committed to 
the florida market and believes florida will play a critical role 
in our future expansion said robert w baker senior vice 
president for operations 
american one of the industrys fastestgrowing large airlines 
also announced it will add a flight attendant crew base in 
nashville tenn the miami and nashville sites bring americans 
total crew bases to 12 
by january american will base 160 flight crew members in miami 
fort lauderdale and west palm beach baker said the total will 
reach 700 within a few years he said 
baker said several hundred american employees already live in 
south florida 
american officials said that the move will help in expanding 
service to the caribbean that began with establishment of a hub in 
san juan puerto rico but that it was too early to estimate the 
number of new flights that could be added 
american over the past two years increased its daily flights in 
florida from 29 to 78 and boarded nearly 1 million passengers in 
florida in the first six months of 1988 compared to 412000 the 
first half of 1986 
americans growth comes as miamibased eastern airlines is 
cutting back and could put american in position to capitalize on 
the problems of eastern and pan american world airways 
eastern and pan am the two most active carriers at miami 
international airport are seeking major labor cutbacks and there 
has been speculation they are considering selling off their 
lucrative south american routes 
baker said americans expansion to southern florida is based on 
longterm plans not on competitors possibly temporary problems 
i dont think it will have any effect eastern spokeswoman 
paual musto said american is in a growing mode and if miami is 
their choice i say more power to the miami community and economy 
eastern with its corporate headquarters here has some 850 
pilots and 1800 flight attendants based in miami she said 
texas air corp on monday announced it lost 2559 million in 
the second quarter with operating losses at both its major 
carriers eastern and continental airlines 
americans new flight attendant crew base in nashville will have 
75 flight attendants in october and perhaps as many as 600 in the 
early 1990s the airline said

two members of congress presented their first 
globe rotter award to the department of energy on wednesday 
putting the agency in their environmental hall of shame for a 
leaking radioactive waste dump 
sen harry reid dnev and rep mel levine dcalif cited 
the department for its callous disregard of the environment and 
its leaking of plutonium at one of our countrys oldest and largest 
nuclear waste dump idaho national laboratory 
they said the award was based partly on a recent energy 
department report that said volatile organic chemicals from 2 
million cubic feet of waste at the facility have reached an 
underground water supply 580 feet below the dump 
the report said radioactive material had migrated downward to at 
least 110 feet and may have reached 240 feet the report estimates 
it will cost 6332 million through 1995 to clean up the facility 
levine said the southeast idaho laboratory is one of 19 
department facilities that the agency estimates could require 100 
billion to clean up 
at least twothirds of these sites are experiencing critical 
contamination or storage crises levine told a news conference 
doe may be underestimating the cost of cleanup by as much as 50 
percent 
reid said the environmental records of some federal agencies are 
a disgrace 
some of the worst hazardous waste problems in the united 
states are located at federal facilities he said 
the lawmakers said they created the award to focus attention on 
environmental problems around the country in the hope of spurring 
the executive and legislative branches to take stronger corrective 
action 
reid said the globe rotter is modeled after the monthly 
golden fleece award that sen william proxmire dwis has 
presented for years for waste and inefficiency in federal programs 
reid said he was unable to get anyone from the department to 
accept the first globe rotter certificate 
but in lieu of an acceptance speech energy department spokesman 
doug elmets said we are aware of the problem in idaho we found 
it this is residue from operations that stopped almost 20 years 
ago the radioactive problem is not near the water table weve 
implemented a cleanup plan

the communist party daily 
newspaper launched an unusually strong attack wednesday on 
alexander dubcek accusing him of causing the invasion that 
destroyed the prague spring reforms of 1968 
the newspaper rude pravo charged dubcek with deceiving his 
fellow communists and the people and said he had slowed the 
implementation of reforms since 
the article was the strongest in a series of recent attacks on 
dubcek who won unprecedented national popularity for reform after 
he became party leader in january 1968 
the attacks seem designed to discredit dubcek in the eyes of his 
compatriots the former leader now a retired forestry worker in 
bratislava has received increased attention at home and abroad as 
the 20th anniversary of the august 1968 warsaw pact invasion nears 
dubcek has recently given interviews to western news media in 
which he has praised soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs reforms 
and called for his own rehabilitation and the implementation of 
similar reforms in czechoslovakia 
the partys theoretical and political monthly nova mysl said 
in its latest issue that dubcek and his followers were responsible 
for the crisis of august 1968 when the country was on the 
brink of civil war 
during the night of aug 2021 1968 soviet and warsaw pact 
tanks moved into czechoslovakia to crush the liberal reforms 
introduced by dubcek in what came to be known as the prague spring 
rude pravo and other official media have repeatedly rejected 
parallels between dubceks reforms and those under way in the 
soviet union 
dubcek bears grave personal responsibility that the road 
to implementing reforms took much longer and was much more 
difficult the official ctk news agency quoted the rude pravo 
article as saying 
czechoslovakia is adopting some cautious economic reform in the 
wake of changes in the soviet union but has done little to reform 
either the arts or political structures 
rude pravos attack seemed to be an attempt to blame dubcek for 
the lack of more radical changes 
dubcek was no pioneer of democratic freedoms in the party and 
society the article said he became coresponsible for 
unparalleled autocratic manners and assumed the right to 
decide for the whole party at the most fateful moments it said 
thanks to his lack of reliability the leadership of the party 
lost its credibility and leaders of czechoslovakias east bloc 
allies no longer believed we would be able to handle the 
continuously deteriorating situation rude pravo said 
the czechoslovak leadership has refused to reevaluate the events 
of 1968 
gustav husak the communist leader who took over as party leader 
from dubcek in 1969 was replaced in december but there have been 
few indications the new leader milos jakes is less hardline 
jakes oversaw the purge of half a million communists after the 1968 
invasion

coronary bypass surgery improves the survival of 
highrisk patients with heart disease and the benefits persist for 
at least 12 years a study concludes 
the research conducted in europe found that men with serious 
heart disease who got the operations outlived those who were 
treated with medicines however the difference between the two 
groups faded over time 
coronary bypass operations are often performed to relieve 
symptoms of heart pain called angina whether the surgery helps 
people live longer is controversial 
two other longrunning us studies have found no benefit of the 
common operations on survival however experts say differences in 
the health of patients who took part in the three studies probably 
explain why the european outcome was better 
that followup known as the european coronary surgery study 
group found that after five years 92 percent of the bypass 
patients were alive compared with 83 percent in a group treated 
with medicine after 12 years 71 percent of the surgical patients 
and 67 percent of the medical patients were living 
the reasons for the loss of a beneficial effect of surgery 
after five years are unknown and merit further study the doctors 
wrote 
the latest results of the european study directed by dr 
edvardas varnauskas of sahlgrenska hospital in goteborg sweden 
were published in thursdays new england journal of medicine 
the study was conducted on 767 men all under age 65 who had 
mild or moderate angina most were considered at high risk because 
of abnormal electrocardiograms and other signs of heart trouble 
last year about 230000 coronary bypass operations were 
performed at nonfederal hospitals in the united states in this 
surgery doctors use pieces of blood vessel to detour blood around 
clogged arteries in the heart 
in an editorial in the journal dr thomas killip of beth israel 
medical center in new york wrote that the studies show that 
surgical therapy improves prognosis in highrisk patients but 
the advantage over medical therapy declines with longer followup

the superpower treaty to eliminate medium and shorterrange 
nuclear weapons 
the 20 soviet experts visited the florennes air base about 40 
miles south of brussels and the european repair facility at nearby 
gosselies 
florennes which houses the 485th us tactical missile wing 
has 16 groundlaunched cruise missiles with four spares and four 
missile launchers with eight spares according to us officials 
the gosselies facility run by the belgian defense contractor 
sabca services all us missiles based in europe on june 21 
there were 55 missiles at the plant according to the officials 
the soviets who arrived monday entered the two sites on 
tuesday and returned to brussels on wednesday it was not known 
when they would return to the soviet union 
the inspections are required under the intermediaterange 
nuclear forces treaty signed in december by president reagan and 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev the treaty provides for 
elimination within three years of all us and soviet landbased 
missiles with ranges of 300 miles to 3400 miles 
as part of the 60day inspection process that began july 1 the 
soviets are visiting 30 sites in the united states and five in

a group of veteran south korean climbers 
set out wednesday with hopes of conquering mount everest the 
worlds highest peak to celebrate the seoul olympics 
the climbers will try to scale the 29028foot peak the hard way 
via the steep south pillar route because none of our 
countrymen has ever done it in the past said team leader choi 
changmin of seoul 
although the south pillar route is the most direct path to the 
top of everest only two men one from poland and another from 
czechoslovakia have succeeded in climbing it 
from lukla the 20man team hopes to reach khumbu glacier their 
planned base camp by aug 26 the olympics are to begin in seoul 
south korea on sept 17 
once we are acclimatized we will embark on the mountain 
said choi 45 
one part of the group is to climb everest while another plans 
to climb 27932foot mount lhotse the worlds fourthhighest 
mountain and one of everests sister peaks 
if the korean team reaches both peaks it would become only the 
second expedition to do so following a swiss team in 1956 
but they the swiss did not climb the two peaks on the same 
day we will try on the same day said nam sunwu the teams 
climbing leader 
ko sangdon the first korean to scale everest reached the peak 
in 1977 last year heo youngho became the second korean to 
conquer the worlds highest mountain 
however ko and heo followed the traditional southeast ridge 
route that was pioneered by sir edmund hillary and sherpa tenzing 
norgay in the first climb to everests peak in 1953 
asked why their team wished to climb everest choi said 
because it is the highest so many people all over the 
world have longed to go there it is a dream of every alpinist to 
be on everest

space shuttle discovery roared to 
life on the launch pad today as nasa ignited its main engines in a 
crucial 22second test leading up to the first us manned space 
mission since the challenger disaster 2 years ago 
nasa officials pronounced the test a success 
its a clear demonstration that discovery is a very good 
bird thomas e utsman director of shuttle management said 
after the firing that checked modifications to the engines and 
other systems with groundshaking fury and a vshaped steam cloud 
robert crippen deputy director of shuttle operations said a 
firm launch date would not be set until the test data is thoroughly 
analyzed and a small gas leak in a thruster system discovered 
several weeks ago is repaired 
i still think we have a shot at late september crippen said 
at a news conference 
crippen said the only question mark today was a possible leak of 
nitrogen gas where fuel lines join the external tank but he also 
pronounced the firing a a super test and said we have seen 
nothing today that would delay the march toward launch 
the firing delayed five times in two weeks by leaks and other 
mechanical problems was critical to certifying the shuttle for the 
first postchallenger launch many officials believe the liftoff 
wont come until october 
at the end of todays nearflawless countdown the three main 
liquid fuel engines on the deltawinged spaceship flashed to life 
the launch pedestal was engulfed in steam as the fiery exhaust 
collided with protective water pouring over the base 
a thunderclap rolled across the kennedy space center as the 
engines fed by liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen generated thrust 
equal to the energy output of 23 hoover dams 
super job super team nasa administrator james c fletcher 
told the launch team following the test 
it was a very smooth countdown the team and the hardware all 
worked successfully forrest s mccartney director of the 
kennedy space center told the team its been a long night but 
it sure ended right 
the 85ton spaceship strained against eight 3footlong hardened 
steel bolts holding it down on the pad on an actual launch two 
solid fuel booster rockets would ignite and explosive charges would 
sever the bolts to free the shuttle 
a total of 732 instruments were installed throughout the shuttle 
to take detailed measurements of all system operations thats five 
times more than on any previous shuttle test or launch 
the testfiring followed five postponements including a 
computerordered halt a split second before ignition last thursday 
launch director bob sieck today thanked his crew for making 
our toughest test look easy you should be pleased because it was 
an excellent performance and you should look forward to the launch 
count with confidence 
the 22second burst of power today was just a fraction of the 
more than eight minutes that the engines are to burn in propelling 
discovery into orbit but engineers said the firing was long enough 
to test the entire shuttle system 
well test the hardware and the software and the people 
launch director bob sieck said before the exercise we want to 
demonstrate the readiness of the total system for flight 
nasa spokeswoman cindy buck said a liquid oxygen pump in ground 
support equipment failed early today but crews shifted to a backup 
pump ignition was on time at 730 am 
two of the engines which are reuseable are new the third has 
been flown on three shuttle missions 
a firing attempt last thursday was aborted a fraction of a 
second before ignition when an electronic sensor erroneously 
reported a valve was not closing properly 
engineers replaced the valve containing the sensor and made a 
computer change to lessen the possibility that a bad signal could 
force another shutdown 
earlier delays were caused by problems with ground support 
equipment 
still facing the national aeronautics and space administration 
is a small gas leak in a steering engine system separate from 
discoverys three main engines shuttle managers are expected to 
give a goahead within a few days to a plan for engineers to cut 
through the rear wall of the shuttles cargo bay to reach and 
repair a nitrogen tetroxide leak in a vent valve seal 
the shuttle program also must pass another key propulsion test 
before discovery can be certified for flight a fullscale 
twominute firing the fifth in a series of the redesigned solid 
fuel booster rocket that is scheduled aug 18 at the morton 
thiokol plant in utah 
a faulty booster rocket joint was blamed for the jan 28 1986 
explosion that destroyed challenger and killed its crew of seven 
checked today were modifications to turbopumps valve actuators 
electronic controllers and other engine systems also being tested 
were ground support equipment communications links new countdown 
procedures and personnel 
five veteran shuttle fliers have been assigned to the discovery 
mission during the fourday flight they are to deploy a 
communications satellite conduct experiments and evaluate new 
spaceship systems

political leaders said wednesday they 
would not accept north korean conditions for talks on easing 
tension on the korean peninsula but would agree to a preliminary 
meeting next week

police in seoul and provincial cities wednesday protesting police 
actions blocking a crosscountry march and talks with north korean 
youths on national unification 
about 34000 police were deployed to block demonstrations at 
about 30 universities about 300 students were arrested but police 
said most would be released after questioning 
policymakers of the governing democratic justice party and the 
three main opposition parties met with national assembly speaker 
kim chaesun and proposed that an aug 17 meeting sought by north 
korea be delayed by two days 
our letter stating the points will be sent to north korea on 
friday lee dongbok chief secretary to the assembly speaker 
said after the meeting 
in a letter sent to south korea tuesday communist north korea 
proposed that a joint meeting of the two countries legislatures 
convene before sept 1 to discuss the norths bid to become cohost 
of the olympic games in seoul and draft a nonaggression pact 
north korea also proposed that a working meeting be held at the 
truce site of panmunjom on aug 17 attended by three to five 
delegates from each side to prepare for full parliamentary talks 
the north korean letter also demanded the inclusion of 
representatives of all walks of life in the proposed parliamentary 
talks 
seoul officials believe north korea wants south korean dissident 
groups involved in the talks the officials criticize the north 
korean demand as implying that south koreas legislature does not 
represent the 41 million people in the south 
the oficials also said the aug 19 working meeting if held 
should include the agenda the type of talks and the size of 
delegations in full talks 
north korea said only logistical arrangements such as 
communications and safe passage of delegates traveling to the other 
side for talks should be discussed 
working parliamentary contacts between the two countries broke 
down in 1985 
south korean newspapers said the north korean proposals are 
aimed at stirring social unrest before the olympics which start 
sept 17 
the chosun ilbo daily called the joint parliamentary talks 
nothing but a mass rally that can be politically exploited by the 
north 
north korea has said it will boycott the olympics unless its 
demand is met to be cohost of the games the international olympic 
committee has rejected the north korean demand 
several thousands radical students staged demonstrations in 
seoul and other parts of the country on wednesday protesting a 
police blockade of their attempts at a crosscountry unification 
march 
the students are calling for talks on monday with north korean 
youths at panmunjom on national unification an attempt by students 
to march to panmunjom was blocked by police on june 10

cuban jails where political prisoners have 
been kept naked in windowless rooms are being altered to make them 
appear more humane to outside investigators a us human rights 
official said wednesday 
ambassador armando valladares us representative to the un 
human rights commission made the accusation and released 
photographs of prisoners and their cells he said were smuggled out 
of one prison by cuban dissidents 
valladares who himself was a prisoner of cuban leader fidel 
castro for 22 years before he was released in 1982 and allowed to 
emigrate to the united states said some of the worst jail cells 
have been dismantled in a prison near havana but others remain in 
more than 200 jails throughout the country 
real changes are not possible because that would mean the end 
of the dictatorship said valladares speaking in spanish through 
a translator he was appointed to the genevabased human rights 
commission by president reagan earlier this year castro expressed 
outrage at the appointment labeling valladares a terrorist 
the photos showed a wall of windowless metal doors and the 
interior of dank cells with holeinthefloor toilets valladares 
said the cells including one dubbed the triangle of death 
were all torn down shortly after the pictures were taken 
he pointed out welding equipment used in the destruction in one 
of the photos and displayed two tiny microphones he said were also 
smuggled out by prisoners 
inmates from a group known as the ricardo bofills cuban 
committee for human rights took the pictures at the combinado del 
este prison on the outskirts of havana using a sovietmade camera 
using chinese film valladares said 
a united nations delegation headed by alioune sene of senegal is 
to visit cuba in september other members of the delegation will be 
representatives from ireland nigeria hungary colombia and the 
philippines 
valladares said the commission expects to interview hundreds of 
cubans during an 11day trip he said the cuban government was 
supposed to publish three telephone numbers that people can call 
who want to present information to the commission 
the commission also has a list of 5000 names of people to make 
inquiries about valladares said many cubans are becoming less 
and less afraid and will be willing to talk to the commission he 
said 
he said delegation members have been assured they will have 
freedom to move around the country and interview anyone 
valladares acknowledged it may be difficult to prove that 
prisoners are tortured because governments dont generally 
acknowledge such activities he said the photos of prison cells and 
inmates have been sent to the delegation

the space shuttle discovery 
flawlessly fired its three huge engines wednesday and demonstrated 
it is ready to carry americans into space for the first time since 
challenger exploded 2 years ago 
we proved it works robert crippen deputy director of 
shuttle operations said after the engines spewed 6000degree 
flames for 22 seconds we really had a super test we have seen 
nothing today that would delay the march toward launch 
the first mission might still be possible in late september 
said an elated forrest s mccartney director of the kennedy space 
center wednesdays flight readiness test had been postponed five 
times previously leading to expectations that discovery might not 
fly until october or later 
super job super team nasa administrator james c fletcher 
told the launch team 
thomas e utsman director of shuttle management called the 
test a clear demonstration that discovery is a very good bird 
the only question mark was a possible leak of nitrogen gas in an 
area where fuel lines join the external tank crippen said the gas 
was detected by instruments that had not been there before and 
engineers were not certain the readings indicated something new 
asked how he felt with the hotfire test out of the way 
crippen replied you cant have a major milestone like that come 
out as clean as it was and not feel good about it 
setting of a firm launch date for discovery awaited analysis of 
wednesdays test and repairs to a small gas leak in a thruster 
system that was not involved in the test 
i still think we have a shot at late september crippen said 
the engine firing was a crucial step for resuming space flight 
it is an opportunity to assess the readiness of the launch 
team the ground support equipment and flight hardware said 
national aeronautics and space administration spokesman hugh 
harris reporting on the progress of the test it provides 
another measure of the readiness of people and hardware for launch 
after many months of assessing and improving the entire shuttle 
program 
two other big hurdles stand between discovery and its fourday 
mission with five astronauts a fullscale test of a redesigned 
booster rocket and the sealing of a gas vent line in the shuttles 
space maneuvering system the second task will require cutting a 
hole in discoverys cargo bay for access 
the shuttle its huge fuel tank and two flanking solid rocket 
boosters were bolted to the pad during wednesdays test as its 
engines were started in a 321 sequence separated by 120 
milliseconds during a launch the engines fire more than eight 
minutes with the boosters providing a powerful assist during the 
first two minutes of flight 
discovery which has flown in space six times was treated as an 
untried ship in having to undergo the flight readiness firing a 
total of 732 instruments five times more than on any previous 
shuttle test or launch were installed throughout the shuttle stack 
to take detailed measurements of all system operations 
the test took special note of the strains placed on the booster 
rockets as the engines reached full power the challenger exploded 
while lifting off on jan 28 1986 because of a leak in a joint on 
the right booster near its attachment point on the fuel tank 
the shuttle fleet now numbering three has undergone numerous 
design changes since the accident which killed the sevenmember 
crew the orbiter alone has had 220 design changes the boosters 
145 and each of the main engines 30 
just before ignition water poured into the flame trough beneath 
the shuttle at the rate of more than 100000 gallons a minute when 
the fire hit the water a huge cloud of steam rose toward the sky 
forming a v that must have seemed a symbol of victory for 
firing room personnel who had agonized through the five 
postponements 
the huge stack 18 stories high strained against the holddown 
bolts 35 inches in diameter and 28 inches long during a launch

the environmental protection agency today 
proposed new regulations to reduce levels of lead in the nations 
drinking water supply a move that would curb exposure to a metal 
that can cause mental retardation in children and high blood 
pressure in adults 
this proposal will reduce lead in the drinking water of 138 
million americans and will be especially beneficial to young 
children who are at much greater risk than adults epa 
administrator lee m thomas said in a statement 
the proposed rules would require as many as 53000 public 
drinking water supply systems in the country to treat water so that 
it does not pick up as much lead and to participate in public 
education programs the epa said 
epa spokesman dave ryan said there was no precise date for the 
startup of the new program because the rules must be published in 
the federal register interested parties will then be allowed to 
comment on the proposals 
but ryan said congress has given the government a deadline of 
june 1989 to do something about lead levels in 1986 congress 
amended the safe drinking water act to deal with lead 
high concentrations of lead in the blood have been associated 
with a variety of health problems for example lead can impair 
mental ability in children cause premature births delay physical 
and mental development of babies cause kidney damage interfere 
with hearing and increase blood pressure in adults 
epa said the new regulations could cause the bloodlead levels 
of as many as 700000 children between the ages of 6 months and 5 
years to fall below 10 to 15 milligrams per deciliter the range 
above which adverse health effects begin 
the epa regulations call for several steps 
munipalities with lead levels greater than 10 parts per 
billion would be required to treat water at the plants to reduce 
its acidity acidity is an indicator of corrosive water which 
causes pipes to leach lead before it reaches the consumers tap 
if the average lead levels are greater than 10 parts per 
billion water suppliers must conduct a public education program 
which would include helping consumers get their water tested 
water suppliers would have to reduce lead to a maximum 
contaminant level of 5 parts per billion 
epa said the annual cost of the proposal is about 267 million 
but it said the corrosioncontrol requirements for water could 
prolong the life of plumbing and pipes 
marion sills a spokesman for the environmental defense fund a 
group that has lobbied against lead called epas proposals a 
good first tier of a program to reduce lead

the united states should move ahead with 
development of advanced uraniumfueled reactors because producing 
electrical power from hydrogen fusion is at least several decades 
away physicist edward teller said wednesday 
teller who played a key role in development of the hydrogen 
bomb told a scientific conference that fusion will have no 
impact on electric generation during the next 40 years 
he said that at least for the next 50 years and much longer 
in my opinion the mainstay of nuclear energy i firmly believe 
will be fission 
fission which provides the basis for all of todays nuclear 
power reactors involves the splitting of uranium atoms in a 
controlled chain reaction fusion derives energy from the fusing 
together of hydrogen nuclei under very high temperature and 
pressure 
teller said accelerated development of nuclear power will be 
prompted partly by increasing concern over the greenhouse 
effect global warming caused by atmospheric buildup of carbon 
dioxide and other gases from the burning of fossil fuels 
because of this and other factors he said the united states 
must greatly increase the funding for power reactor development 
advanced fission reactor concepts under study in the united 
states include hightemperature gascooled reactors along with 
units that would utilize liquid sodium metal as the reactor coolant 
also appearing at the conference was dixy lee ray former 
governor of washington and former chairman of the atomic energy 
commission 
asked how she would assess the prospects for achieving 
controlled nuclear fusion ray said in an interview i think it 
is a program that we must support and must continue i believe 
theres a great deal of basic research that still needs to be 
done 
its awfully hard to make predictions but based on experience 
in other areas id say its another 10 to 20 years before we can 
know for sure whether it will work she said and once we know 
it works then its another time to know whether it will be 
economical which is still an open question

austria is coming under increasing 
financial pressure to curtail its postwar role as a haven for 
refugees from neighboring communist states 
the increasing influx of people seeking asylum in the west is 
stirring concern over how much more money neutral austria can spend 
on five main refugee camps and dozens of governmentrented hotels 
and boarding houses 
the number of wouldbe refugees from poland and hungary has 
exploded since the countries loosened travel restrictions earlier 
this year the number of eastern defectors is expected to double 
this year from about 11400 in 1987 
since regaining independence in 1955 austria has prided itself 
on being a refuge for the oppressed 
but austrian authorities are warning new arrivals to think 
carefully before applying for refugee status some might even be 
deported 
in july 66 poles went on a hunger strike and six who refused to 
leave after their applications had been rejected were held for a 
week in custody later escorted by austrian police to the czech 
border and expelled 
such a brutal incident has never before occurred here said 
lawyer eva maria barki who appealed the deportation decision 
but austria now has 20000 recognized political refugees as 
well as about 15000 people seeking asylum both groups are 
supported by the government 
in 1983 austria spent 20 million on refugees this years 
budget is expected to total 82 million 
in july a polish travel agent drove three busloads of poles 
from the czech border to the traiskirchen refugee camp south of 
vienna each passenger asked for political asylum 
alexander hirschfeld an interior ministry spokesman said the 
number of poles seeking asylum has risen from 126 in the first half 
of 1987 to 2271 for the same period this year 
on may 9 the government instituted new rules that reduced the 
handling procedure for those seeking asylum from months to three 
days with the option of appealing within 14 days 
romanian and czechoslovak refugees who arrive in comparatively 
smaller numbers are not covered by the new rules 
hirschfeld said 90 percent of the poles and hungarians seeking 
asylum dont qualify as refugees under the geneva convention 
because they cannot prove political persecution or other personal 
hardships at home 
but poles claim poland still suffers from political repression 
hungarians and poles are given a leaflet suggesting they 
reconsider their decision to defect it says the chances of 
obtaining permission to immigrate to a third country are slim and 
require long waits 
please consider very carefully whether you really want to turn 
your back on your homeland considering the abovementioned 
circumstances the leaflet says 
interior minister karl blecha has said 96 percent of the poles 
and hungarians want to go to the united states canada and 
australia 
but he said their chances are declining because soviet jews and 
soviet armenians often are given priority blecha said this year 
about 6000 armenians 4500 soviet jews and 1500 iranian jews 
were expected to arrive in austria on their way to the united 
states 
but hirschfeld said an east european must wait an average 18 
months until his us immigration papers are approved compared 
with six to 10 months before 
the easiest route for east european refugees to go to the 
west is austria hirschfeld said but its not the easiest one 
when they want to go farther

dead appealed their death sentences wednesday in a petition to 
superior court 
the five were convicted and sentenced july 6 by judge mohammad 
zafar barbar in a makeshift courtroom in a prison west of islamabad 
the judge blamed lax airport security in part for the hijacking 
in which four of the palestinians entered the plane dressed as 
security guards 
an indianamerican was among the 21 people who died during the 
hijacking ordeal and 200 people were injured 
the boeing 747 on a stopover between bombay india and new 
york was seized on the ground sept 5 1986 in pakistans 
southern port of karachi with 400 people aboard including 44

it sat on the tarmac for 17 hours before the palestinians 
fearing an attack when an onboard generator ran out sprayed the 
cabin with bullets and hurled hand grenades and pakistani troops 
stormed the plane 
the defendants said they were innocent and blamed the killings 
on pakistani commandos 
the hijackers claimed they planned to free their hostages and 
blow the plane up over israel in a suicide operation that would 
highlight israeli excesses against palestinians in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip 
in their appeal the palestinians challenged judge barbars 
legal interpretation of hijacking laws they also asked the 
superior court to have their fetters removed and to guarantee them 
proper medical care in prison 
the court will take up the petition on aug 15 the death 
sentences will not be carried until all appeals have been 
exhausted which could take months 
when the guilty verdict was returned mohammad hafiz turk 32 
the only one of the five who was not on the hijacked plane said 
we dont care about the sentence he was sentenced to hang for 
his part in planning the hijacking we care only about the 
millions of arabs and islamic countries 
the other four mohammad ahmed munawar khalil hussain rahayyal 
and saeed abdul rahim of lebanon and abdul latif sairfani of syria 
were sentenced to hang for their role in the hijacking 
they also were sentenced to 10 consecutive life sentences or 250 
years in prison for the deaths of 10 of the 21 passengers 
three of the four men received an additional life sentence in an 
11th death that of the indianamerican 
the four men ranging in age from 1824 also were fined nearly 
2800 in each murder conviction half the money will be given to 
relatives of victims 
during sentencing barbar said security at the airport 
seemed to be extremely lax the judge questioned how the four men 
dressed as security guards could board the pan am flight weighed 
down with weapons and ammunition 
the hijackers he said were able to collect huge caches of 
ammunition unnoticed and unhindered

a letter from nina andreeva to actor mikhail ulyanov answering 
his speech to the communist party conference at the end of june 
appeared in the weekly moscow news 
ms andreevas march 13 letter to the newspaper sovietskaya 
rossiya was regarded by gorbachev supporters as a rallying point 
for conservatives opposed to the soviet leaders reforms 
but her latest letter was less a manifesto of the soviet right 
than a personal rebuke to the actor 
rumors circulating in moscow claimed that kremlin no 2 leader 
yegor k ligachev thought to be more conservative than gorbachev 
was behind the publication and was seeking to undermine gorbachevs 
reforms 
ulyanov said in his passionate speech to the conference which 
was called to review progress on the reforms and chart a future 
path that supporters of gorbachev did not have to answer ms 
andreeva directly but those who stand behind her

freedom on selected topics to publish much material that previously 
would not have been printed said ulyanov did not intend to take

everybody complains that their taxes are too 
high but hundreds of york county residents really had something to 
gripe about 
more than 400 people received personal property tax bills this 
week in excess of 1 million including one woman hit with a 21 
million tab officials said 
the error affected about 5 percent of 8000 property owners and 
kept assessment office phones ringing for two days 
most of the problems have been addressed and weve been 
sending out the correction notices said chief assessor steve 
anderson they can leave their bombs at home 
the annual tax bills cover personal property such as stocks and 
other investments 
anderson blamed the mixup on new employees in the personal 
property tax division entering data incorrectly on a new computer 
system 
a person who had one share or 500 was in some cases 
listed as having 500 shares he said so that person would be 
taxed on 250000 when he really should have been taxed on 500 
county commissioner ron fitzkee called the clerical error a 
shame but said the bills were so outrageous that most people 
didnt take them seriously

conservative lawmakers led by rep philip 
crane rill and sen steve symms ridaho introduced a bill 
wednesday urging abrogation of the 1979 treaty transferring 
ownership of the panama canal to the panamanian government 
crane said the treaty is invalid because it was not ratified 
properly 
he said the constitution prohibits transfer of us property 
unless both houses of congress approve but that the house never 
voted on the canal treaty 
symms said the treaty also is invalid because the senate never 
ratified changes imposed by the panamanian government in 1979 and 
because it was not signed by the president of panama 
the two lawmakers said their resolution urges the president or 
congress to simply announce the abrogation of the treaty 
under the treaty the united states would abandon all rights to 
the canal zone and it would become a part of panama on dec 31 
1999

the man convicted of strangling a young woman in 
the preppie murder case said he will not fight a 25 million 
judgment to be entered against him on behalf of the parents of the 
slain teenager 
my only wish is for the nightmare to end robert chambers 
said in a handwritten note dated tuesday he asked the court to 
enter the judgment against him because i do not wish the levins 
to endure any more pain 
steven and ellen levin parents of jennifer levin 18 filed the 
wrongful death lawsuit against chambers on july 22 on monday they 
sued jack dorrian owner of the bar where miss levin and chambers 
drank hours before he strangled her in central park on aug 26 
1986 
chambers request for the default judgment was filed in the 
triallevel state supreme court on his behalf by his attorney 
brian odwyer who said he had advised his client against the move 
odwyer said he explained to chambers that all his property 
could be attached and sold to satisfy the judgment and that any 
future salary property gift or inheritance he receives also could 
be attached 
but odwyer said chambers 21 hoped this action might be seen 
to others as a symbol of the genuine sorrow he felt about the death 
of jennifer levin and he knew it would live with him every day and 
every hour of his life 
the levins could not be reached for comment arnold domenitz 
miss levins maternal grandfather refused to comment on chambers 
action

the democrats had garrison keillor lynda 
carter and dionne warwick and the republicans will fight back next 
week with charlton heston sandy patti and the oak ridge boys 
political conventions may be serious business but so is 
primetime television a fact not lost on the organizers of the 
upcoming gop parley in the new orleans superdome 
its no secret that a great deal of what you do is designed 
for television we are trying to reach the public here says mark 
goode a washington consultant and former television producer who 
is producing the convention 
a primary task of gop planners has been to turn the 27story 
high 87000seat sports arena into a smaller warmer setting 
unmarred by banks of empty seats or cubic yards of empty air 
last month at the democratic national convention conditions 
were so crowded that legitimate delegates were shut out and the 
atlanta fire marshal was on alert all week 
the republicans by contrast have hung an enormous blue curtain 
across the middle of the superdome cutting it in half and theyve 
hung an equally imposing lighting grid 40 feet above the floor 
which reduces the normally cavernous feel in here goode said 
it is a massive place but it will certainly appear far more 
intimate than under normal circumstances goode said had we 
not felt it was suitable for television we never would have chosen 
it its going to work just fine for television and sensationally 
for the people who will be right here it will be very exciting 
the largest crowd ever for a political convention 
the democrats hired a hollywood production company to 
orchestrate their convention a much more theatrical spectacle than 
the party usually puts on 
goode who lived in los angeles for 24 years is no stranger to 
hollywood production values nevertheless the republicans known 
in the past for their smooth stagecraft are sniffing in scorn at 
the democrats pandering to the entertainment ethic 
this is not a variety show said gop convention spokeswoman 
mary mead the emphasis is on substance not glitz 
well have a little fun some excitement and some color 
goode said but basically we are here to do business 
the convention will kick off monday with a tribute to president 
reagan including a videotape to be shown on eight huge screens 
throughout the new orleans superdome before reagans appearance 
we have a little surprise cooked up goode said he would not 
elaborate 
celebrities will be sprinkled throughout prime time with 
musician lionel hampton and actor charlton heston scheduled to lead 
the pledge of allegiance and the national anthem to be sung on 
various evenings by gospel singer sandy patti soap star shelley 
burch the oak ridge boys and a 10yearold girl from seattle 
the rest of prime time will be dominated by republican 
officeholders including a large number of women rep olympia 
snowe of maine will help preside over the convention while rep pat 
saiki of hawaii will call the roll of the states when george bush 
is nominated 
other prime time speeches are tentatively scheduled for former 
transportation secretary elizabeth dole former un ambassador 
jeane kirkpatrick sen nancy kassebaum of kansas and nebraska gov 
kay orr chairman of the platform committee 
bush has the nomination sewn up but hes hoping to build 
suspense and ratings by keeping his vice presidential choice a 
secret until thursday the final day of the convention 
delegates will be sitting in armchairs upholstered in red part 
of a traditional redwhiteblue color scheme and unlike the salmon 
and azure favored by the democrats forty skyboxes will ring the 
arena at the height of its third floor and four anchor booths will 
be in place for abc cbs nbc and cnn 
some 13500 journalists and technicians are expected to attend 
the republican convention along with 50 to 60 satellite trucks 
sent by tv stations and groups seeking localized coverage 
the rnc is offering gaveltogavel coverage of the convention 
via the rnc network to any station that can pick up a satellite 
feed the proceedings will be accompanied by closed captioning and 
a simultaneous spanish translation

president reagan saying we admit a wrong 
today signed into law legislation providing 20000 payments to 
japaneseamericans kept in us internment camps during the early 
stages of world war ii 
reagan during a signing ceremony in an auditorium of the old 
executive office building next to the white house noted that some 
120000 americans of japanese descent were forcibly removed from 
their homes and placed in makeshift internment camps 
he said the action was taken by the us government without 
trial and without jury it was based solely on race 
yes the nation then was at war he said and its not for 
us to pass judgment today on those who may have made mistakes 
but we must recognize that the internment of japaneseamericans was 
just that a mistake 
reagan said the time was long overdue to right a grave wrong 
he said that scores of japaneseamericans volunteered for our 
armed forces and that the 442nd regimental combat team made up 
entirely of japaneseamericans served with immense distinction 
the legislation provides for a restitution payment to each of 
the 60000 survivors reagan said yet no payment can make up 
for those lost years so whats most important in this bill has 
less to do with property than with honor for here we admit a 
wrong 
i think its a fine day he said 
in addition to providing 20000 in taxfree payments to each 
survivor the legislation includes an official us government 
apology for having forced some 120000 japaneseamericans both 
citizens and resident aliens from their homes and jobs following 
the japanese attack on the us naval base at pearl harbor hawaii 
on dec 7 1941 
the payments will begin in about a year and will total about 
125 billion the administration initially had balked at the 
amount of money to be committed although saying it agreed with the 
concept of reparations and an apology 
individual payments to the surviving internees will be made over 
a 10year period with the most elderly getting priority treatment 
in return for the money those who qualify must agree to drop 
any legal claims against the government stemming from the 
internment

customs service agents in 10 months have 
seized 10 tons more cocaine than they did in all of the last fiscal 
year but officials said wednesday the bad news was that there was 
more cocaine to seize 
this is one of those good newsbad news situations customs 
commissioner william von raab said in announcing that agents had 
stopped a record 108843 pounds of cocaine from being sold on 
americas streets since the fiscal year began last oct 1 
its true that there is plenty of evidence that the amount of 
cocaine being produced has increased significantly during recent 
years von raab said but the amount of cocaine we have been 
seizing shows that we have greatly increased our ability to stop 
it 
von raab credited a new automated system that compares cargo 
manifests with programmed criteria to help customs officers decide 
which shipments to examine 
the system he said helped pinpoint the largest cocaine 
shipment ever seized 9230 pounds found in plastic containers 
concealed in hallowedout lumber shipped in a container that 
arrived in tampa fla on april 28 
von raab said officers have used the automated program to find 
33000 pounds of cocaine in cargo containers since november 1987 
the commissioner said state and local police have helped in some 
of the seizures operations in all of fiscal 1987 brought in 88000 
pounds 
with a boom in cocaine production in south america the amount 
confiscated by federal and state officials has increased every year 
since 1982 when it was only 11150 pounds 
in addition to seizures from commercial shipments air 
operations netted 22000 pounds of cocaine and marine operations 
accounted for another 17500 pounds von raab said the remainder 
came in various operations along the nations southwest border and 
elsewhere in the country he said

the postal service said wednesday it was 
shelving a major portion of a contract with texas billionnaire h 
ross perot that drew fire from congress and private industry and 
spawned a court test of the services purchasing rules 
at stake is a potentially lucrative deal to design and implement 
costsaving procedures for the massive mailcarrying agency a 
contract initially awarded to perot without competitive bidding 
this was clearly a mistake that i hope it is not too late to 
rectify postmaster general anthony frank told a pair of senate 
subcommittees wednesday 
phase two of the arrangemmarch 1 told 
the hearings wednesday he approved the deal because of perots 
proven ability to find innovative solutions to problems 
i attempted to harness the unique talents of ross perot and 
his new company to save money for the postal service for that 
i have no apoligies to make or regrets to express frank said 
following the june announcement congress quickly criticized the 
nobid deal and its payment system for perot critics also said the 
postal service apparently ignored standard procedures for issuing 
contracts 
two companies disappointed at not getting chance to bid on the 
deal filed protests with the general services administration board 
of contract appeals on june 16 they are eds inc perots former 
company now owned by general motors and planning research corp 
on june 22 the senate voted unanimously to call for a 
suspension of the deal until its general accounting office could 
study the contract and issue a report the postal service agreed to 
suspend phase two pending the report 
then the general services appeals panel ordered the entire 
contract suspended on july 8 ruling that it violated federal 
purchasing procedures on aug 4 the panel followed up by ruling 
that the contract was void 
the postal service has appealed to a federal court contending 
that it is exempt from the appeals agency but it suspended work by 
the perot group anyway pending a ruling 
the general accounting office meanwhile completed its report 
saying the deal was signed under very unusual circumstaces and that 
it had serious concerns about it

a brain tumor killed cosmonaut anatoly levchenko 
who was in line to fly the new soviet space shuttle the tass news 
agency said wednesday 
the agency on tuesday reported that levchenko 47 had died but 
did not mention the cause of death other obituaries said only that 
he died saturday of a grave illness 
doctors operated on the test pilot after discovering the tumor 
but were unable to save him the official news agency said the 
obituary was the first confirmation that levchenko was involved in 
the shuttle program 
in recent times he participated in research of space 
technology and could have become a crew member of a future soviet 
reusable spaceship tass said 
his death could set back the fledgling shuttle program 
in an obituary signed by fellow cosmonauts and soviet leaders 
the communist party daily pravda said wednesday that levchenko 
helped improve the effectiveness of his countrys air force 
levchenko born in the town of krasnokutsk in the ukraine 
joined a team of cosmonauts testing space vehicles in 1981 tass 
said 
earlier soviet media reports have said levchenko was preparing 
for the first flight of the soviet space shuttle 
levchenko last entered space on dec 21 when he and cosmonauts 
vladimir titov and musa manarov lifted off aboard a soyuz tm4 
capsule and docked two days later with the orbiting space station 
mir 
he returned to earth on dec 29 along with alexander alexandrov 
who had been aboard mir since july 1987 and yuri romanenko who 
had spent a record 326 days in space 
titov and manarov remain aboard mir and soviet officials have 
said the station will be manned permanently 
soviet space officials concede they are having problems 
developing the space shuttle and have also given conflicting 
indications about whether its first flight would be piloted or 
unmanned 
officials have indicated the soviet shuttle would be similar to 
the us space shuttle that has been grounded since the january 
1986 explosion of the challenger which killed all seven crew 
members 
the kremlin has not announced when the first launch of the 
soviet shuttle will take place but officials had said privately 
that the flight would probably be in the first half of this year 
a timetable that has not been met

american airlines announced plans wednesday to base 
as many as 700 pilots and flight attendants in south florida 
leaving it ready to capitalize on problems facing eastern airlines 
and pan american world airways 
american airlines is deeply committed to the florida market 
and believes florida will play a critical role in our future 
expansion said robert w baker senior vice president for 
operations of the carrier based in fort worth texas 
a spokeswoman for miamibased eastern said americans plans 
shouldnt affect the struggling carrier miamiarea business and 
government leaders expressed delight at americans plans which the 
carriers officials estimate will pump more than 70 million a year 
into the south florida economy 
i am very very extremely pleased said clara oesterle a 
dade county commissioner who attended americans news conference 
this means a lot to this community 
she noted that miami international airport relies heavily on 
user fees eastern and pan am the two largest users of the 
airport have said they need labor concessions to avoid cutting 
back operations 
americans expansion to south florida is based on expectations 
that the florida and caribbean markets will continue to grow not 
on problems competitors are having baker said 
the specific and wellknown problems of eastern really had 
very little to do with our decision baker said but added the 
expansion in miami will give us some additional flexibility in 
case some of the latin american routes now flown by pan am and 
eastern become available 
american based in texas also plans to add a flight attendant 
crew base in nashville tenn one of five american hubs american 
also has hubs in dallasfort worth chicago raleighdurham and san 
juan 
the miami and nashville crew bases bring americans total crew 
bases to 12 american said it will staff a new flight attendant 
crew base in nashville with 75 flight attendants in october and 
perhaps as many as 600 in the early 1990s 
american officials were unsure how many employees might 
eventually be added baker said several hundred american employees 
already live in south florida and commute to the hubs 
by january american will base 160 flight crew members in miami 
fort lauderdale and west palm beach baker said the total will 
reach 700 within a few years he said 
eastern with its corporate headquarters here has some 850 
pilots and 1800 flight attendants based in miami she said 
i dont think it will have any effect eastern spokeswoman 
paula musto said referring to americans move american is in a 
growing mode and if miami is their choice i say more power to the

they returned in triumph from travels half a 
world away 10 black youngsters who overcame considerable odds to 
make their dreams of africa come true 
the children from suder elementary school ages 11 to 14 raised 
30000 in less than 10 months to pay for the twoweek trip that 
took them from one of chicagos poorest neighborhoods to senegal 
ivory coast and togo on the west african coast the ancestral 
homeland of many american blacks 
the excited young travelers stood out tuesday in the bustling 
crowds at ohare international airport with their carved walking 
sticks and identical green knapsacks proclaiming africa 
all had stories to tell 
we just spoke french a little because so many people we met 
knew english but we did say bonjour a lot said yoseanda 
baines 13 
we saw the slave houses where they kept the slaves we saw the 
senegal museum it was wonderful said hardy shorter 12 we 
saw the african sculptures from long ago 
we had food pretty much like we have here said charnae 
harmon 13 we learned to eat like the africans though using 
our fingers 
we had fish and rice a lot and chicken and rice a lot too 
said her twin sister renee 
souvenirs were chosen carefully and imaginatively 
charlene brown came home with a new braided hair style courtesy 
of her senegalese pen pals mother 
it was a souvenir i could take everywhere she said 
most of the boys bought some noisy hand games where you 
clatter wooden balls together and the girls mostly bought tribal 
jewelry and handbags said suder principal brenda daigre whose 
previous travels in africa made her the driving force behind the 
student effort 
we all bought a lot of carved wood but no ivory were poor 
people 
the students prepared for the trip by writing to african pen 
pals taking afterschool classes in african culture and art and 
studying french for a year all three countries are former french 
colonies 
but the big hurdle was the money 
some of the funds came from churches and community groups but 
the students raised much of it by running a candy store at school 
and by putting on a talent show and basketball and volleyball 
games mrs daigre said 
we taught them how to set longrange goals the principal 
said of the youngsters most of whom live in the henry horner 
public housing project 
some parents were skeptical 
i remember last october when they came home from school and 
said guess what were going to go to africa said george 
west as he waited for his sons brian 12 and daryl 11 to clear 
customs 
i just said yeah right but they made a believer 
out of me 
mrs daigre said an earlier visit to africa made her feel she 
had come home and that she wanted her students to have a 
chance to discover their own african roots 
the principal who accompanied the youngsters said the trip 
worked out so well she wants to arrange another one and is working 
on a permanent cultural exchange with a journalist the travelers 
met in senegal 
it was a complete success the principal said nobody got 
sick nobody got lost and nobody spent too much money

american and soviet scientists 
looking for solutions to global pollution are cruising portions of 
the bering sea that long have been offlimits to us scientists 
the sixweek joint research project is the third expedition in 
the last 10 years similar studies in 1979 and in 1984 were 
restricted at soviet insistence to us waters 
this will enable us to fill in a lot of the gaps in our data 
about how the ocean operates on the soviet side said john 
goering an organizer of the us research team before now 
weve had to guess at how the currents and dynamics of that part of 
the bering sea work 
most of the soviet scientists are monitoring pollution levels 
and determining how pollutants are transported in the bering and 
chukchi seas 
alla tsiban the chief soviet scientist on the cruise was a 
member of the 1984 expedition that found trace amounts of toxic 
pcbs in the bering sea 
in my opinion most of it comes from the atmosphere she 
said i expect we will find higher levels this time we will 
combine our efforts this expedition to determine the load capacity 
of the marine ecosystem for these pollutants 
pat roscigno a us fish and wildlife service scientist said 
researchers can figure out how to control the pollution if they can 
determine where its coming from and how much is in the water

irans acting commanderinchief hashemi 
rafsanjani said wednesday a un inquiry must condemn iraq as the 
aggressor in the persian gulf war or the region will face grave 
consequences 
also on wednesday small groups of un officials arrived in 
tehran and baghdad the iraqi capital to prepare for hundreds of 
observers who will monitor a unsponsored ceasefire set for aug 
20 
tehran radio said iraqi warplanes violated iranian airspace in 
the southwest but no bombing was reported iraqi reports monitored 
in cyprus did not mention air activity 
iraq invaded iran in september 1980 after border skirmishes 
in the pursuit of our aggressor we want justice we have no 
territorial ambitions rafsanjani told an international 
conference organized by iran to discuss aggression and defense 
iran wants justice and punishment of the aggressor who has 
violated all principles of international law said rafsanjani 
who also is the speaker of parliament 
he said iraq started the war was the first to resort to 
indiscriminate bombing of civilian targets and to attack ships in 
the gulf and was alone in using chemical weapons 
un security council resolution 598 which iran accepted last 
month calls on the secretarygeneral to explore in consultation 
with iran and iraq the question of entrusting an impartial body 
with inquiring into responsibility for the conflict and to report 
to the council as soon as possible 
the plan also includes the ceasefire withdrawal to recognized 
borders prisoner exchange and peace negotiations direct talks are 
to begin in geneva on aug 25 
we have accepted the resolution with the hope that on the 
committee determining the responsibility of the aggressor they 
the united nations are serious rafsanjani said we hope 
events do not take place that make us think they have told us lies 
if we have such a feeling this might have grave consequences 
for the region 
he said iran would have agreed to a ceasefire seven years ago 
if it had had assurances then that an impartial inquiry would be 
opened to determine war guilt 
rafsanjani also said a us warship acted deliberately when it 
shot down an iran air jetliner last month and killed 290 people 
the united states said the crew mistook the jetliner for an 
attacking fighter 
we think it was a warning to the region to make us 
understand that if you want to continue your defense they 
americans are ready to do anything he said they wanted to 
show us that savagery has no boundary if their interests are 
jeopardized 
cyrus nasseri head of the iranian un mission in geneva said 
iran also wants compensation for aggression in the war but gave 
no details official iranian estimates put war damage at 350 
billion 
five members of the un iraniraq military observer group met 
with officials in the iranian capital to prepare for the arrival of 
the 350 observers who will oversee a truce 
observers will work initially in the southern and western areas 
of iran monitoring military movements until the ceasefire starts 
the official islamic republic news agency reported 
another team of five other un officials arrived in baghdad 
with six more due friday and others in ensuing days sources close 
to the delegation said in the iraqi capital 
all 350 observers from 25 countries are expected to be on 
station within a week well before the scheduled ceasefire date 
un officials said 
the operation will cost 74 million for the initial six months 
the security council authorized including 47 million in startup 
costs un officials say they will have a hard time meeting the 
bill unless members particularly the united states pay arrears in 
dues 
washington has withheld dues to demand personnel cuts budget 
reform and changes in other us practices and owes 467 million 
us officials made clear wednesday they hope gulf arab nations 
will pay a substantial part of the expense 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said in washington we 
do intend to urge the gulf states who are the chief beneficiaries 
of this settlement to share in the cost through voluntary 
contributions well be giving the same message to other countries 
like japan who have an interest in the gulf 
japan has donated 20 million to un peacekeeping efforts 
already this year reserving half for the iraniraq operation the 
japanese import nearly all their oil and get most of it from the 
gulf region

a marine specialist may be right when he says 
mickey mouse birthday balloons can hurt sea creatures but mayor 
edward i said wednesday he still will not rain on mickeys 60th 
anniversary celebration 
city hall koch said was the wrong place for the scientist to 
lodge his grievance suggesting he take it instead to the federal 
government 
the mayor planned to attend a party at the south street seaport 
where the balloons were to be released by the disney organization 
to mark the 1928 debut of animated mickey mouse cartoons 
robert schoelkopf director of the marine mammal stranding 
center at brigantine nj said tuesday that he sent a telegram 
alerting koch to the danger balloons represent to marine mammals 
schoelkopf said deflated balloons that wind up in the ocean can 
kill creatures that mistake them for food and eat them 
schoelkopfs complaints koch said apparently have not had 
much influence on the environmentalists because its never been 
raised before at least with me 
i dont even like the tone of his comments the mayor added 
the fact that someone objects to something that someone else 
is doing doesnt mean that theyre automatically right koch 
said they may very well be but shouldnt he be making his 
complaints to the federal government that would have control over 
the air

swarms of locusts have spread into central and east 
africa and there is an urgent need for money to fight the pests a 
un organization said wednesday 
the necessary funds are not coming in fast enough to help us 
contain this potentially lethal threat said lucas brader head 
of the united nations food and agriculture organizations emergency 
center for locust operations 
money is needed for insecticides equipment and other operating 
costs in part because of late payments by some of the romebased 
organizations major contributors the group said 
the united states which pays a quarter of the agencys budget 
last month paid 25 million of its overdue assessment for 1986 and 
1987 it has not yet paid its 1988 assessment of 607 million 
brader said 75 million acres of land must be treated in chad 
where large swarms have been sighted 
in sudan locusts have covered several hundred square miles and 
are moving east he said the insects were reported to be breeding 
in the eastern region of north darfur and the eastern regions of 
khartoum and kassala 
in ethiopia a dozen swarms of locusts have been seen in the 
asmara area near the red sea major control measures had to be 
adopted before the locusts swarmed south into the central ethiopian 
highland and toward the horn of africa brader said 
he estimated that 90 million to 100 million would be needed in 
sudan chad and ethiopia to prevent large harvest losses

prime minister yitzhak shamir called on 
palestinians wednesday to end their uprising and negotiate peace 
with israel and he vowed he would fight the establishment of an 
arab homeland in the occupied lands 
israel will prevent in the most determined way any attempt to 
carry out any idea to the extent that there are madmen who raise 
it of establishing a palestinian government shamir told 
parliament such people will be met with an iron fist that will 
leave no trace of their attempts 
a declaration of independence published last week called for a 
palestinian state in the west bank gaza strip parts of the 
galilee and east jerusalem 
the proposal came after jordan said it was severing legal and 
administrative links with the west bank and the gaza strip jordan 
had maintained the ties even though israel captured the territories 
in 1967 
king hussein of jordan said he severed the ties because the 
palestine liberation organization is the sole legitimate 
representative of palestinians 
in his first public comments on husseins move plo chairman 
yasser arafat said his group is capable of taking over jordans 
administrative role 
arafat also criticized jordan and the plos arab allies who had 
been forewarned for failing to notify the plo before jordan acted 
the plo was not consulted beforehand and was not officially 
notified until after the measures by jordan were announced when 
it the plo is the party that is directly concerned in all this 
said arafat 
he insisted the plo is capable of assuming jordans 
administrative role in the occupied lands and he assured the 15 
million palestinians living there that the plos institutions are 
capable of absorbing everything 
arafats remarks were published tuesday in the saudi arabian 
newspaper alsharq alawsat copies of the paper were obtained in 
bahrain on wednesday 
shamir responding to leftwing critics told parliament during 
a special session that jordans move would harm the arab 
residents and not the state of israel which will continue to 
maintain legal and security control as always 
the session was called by leftist factions protesting israels 
failure to seek a dialogue with palestinians and its tough tactics 
in quelling the eightmonth uprising in which 238 palestinians and 
four israelis have died 
at this fateful moment what does our government say to the 
palestinians nothing but force them to live in degradation 
said gad yatziv of the socialist mapam party how long will you 
go on deceiving yourselves before you realize the bombings and 
deportations wont do any good 
shamir whose 20minute speech was interrupted half a dozen 
times by catcalls said israel sought a dialogue with palestinians 
but would never negotiate with the plo or countenance attempts to 
create a palestinian state 
it must be clear as the noon sun the state of israel will 
not play this game said shamir head of the rightwing likud 
bloc 
in an earlier closeddoor cabinet meeting shamir argued with 
his coalition partner foreign minister shimon peres of the 
leftleaning labor party about peace policies israel radio 
reported shamir accused peres of siding with arabs who contend 
likud is blocking peace the radio said 
in a related development labor ministers said the party which 
has based its peace strategy on jordan was considering a change in 
its platform for november elections in the wake of husseins latest 
steps 
energy minister moshe shahal told the associated press the party 
may add a plank saying israel would speak either to palestinians 
from the west bank and gaza or jordanians but preferably 
together 
the platform now calls for peace talks with a joint 
jordanianpalestinian delegation and favors territorial compromise 
with jordan 
arafat told the saudi newspaper he opposes sending a 
palestinianjordanian delegation to a proposed middle east peace 
conference because that idea has been erased from our dictionary 
even though jordan has been repeating it he said the plo prefers 
sending a panarab delegation that would include egypt 
in cairo on wednesday us assistant secretary of state richard 
murphy ended his middle east tour after failing to initiate 
arabisraeli peace talks besides egypt murphy visited lebanon 
syria israel and jordan 
on tuesday murphy said egypt failed to arrange a cairo meeting 
between him and palestinian representatives he gave no reason but 
a palestinian source who demanded anonymity said murphy objected 
to two proposed participants because they were closely linked to 
the plo 
also on wednesday an israeli soldier was burned in the face and 
hands by a firebomb thrown at a military jeep in the west bank city 
of ramallah an arab woman also was slightly burned on the leg in 
the attack the army said 
troops meanwhile fatally wounded a 17yearold palestinian in 
a clash with arab protesters who stoned a military fuel tank in the 
village of tubas al ittihad hospital officials said 
the youth ahmed salah darameh died on the operating table at 
the hospital after he was shot in the chest according to a 
hospital official who demanded anonymity his death brought the 
number of palestinian deaths in the eightmonth revolt to 239 four 
israelis also have died 
elsewhere 1st lt orit wolf said the army had begun using 
attack dogs against palestinian rioters in the west bank three 
newspapers reported the army said this was against military policy 
and it was checking the report

the justice department said wednesday it 
opposes provisions of an antiracketeering bill that would curtail 
the role of trustees appointed by courts to run corrupt labor 
unions 
john c keeney a deputy attorney general in the departments 
criminal division said the proposed changes would be disastrous 
to government antiracketeering suits against unions such as the 
case filed in june against the international brotherhood of 
teamsters 
keeney testified before a house judiciary subcommittee that is 
considering legislation to change the rules for civil actions filed 
under the racketeerinfluenced and corrupt organizations act known 
as rico 
the law allows the government and private plaintiffs to file 
suits alleging corrupt business practices and racketeering 
originally intended for suits against organized crime the law has 
been used some say abused as a weapon by private plaintiffs to 
strike at their competitors 
with its provisions for treble damages critics say the law has 
provided unnecessary windfalls to plaintiffs 
legislation in both houses of congress would sharply curtail the 
treble damage provisions although suits filed by the government 
could still seek that penalty 
while the teamsters suit was the first time the justice 
department sought a trustee to run an international union it has 
filed numerous suits to place union locals under trusteeships 
keeney told the subcommittee on criminal justice 
these provisions would set strict limits on the purposes for 
which trustees could be imposed and would set an 18month limit 
on the duration of a trusteeship unless the trustee could satisfy 
a burden to justify one or more sixmonth extensions 
he said such provisions are unworkable and were adapted from 
federal labor law that applies to trusteeships imposed by labor 
organizations on their subordinate unions 
those laws were designed to protect against arbitrary or 
improper trusteeships imposed without due process of law keeney 
said 
such limitations are not needed and have no place in the 
context of a trusteeship imposed by a federal district court after 
full hearings for all parties in order to correct abuses within the 
organization 
keeney said the only permissible purpose for seeking a 
trusteeship under the house legislation would be to correct 
corruption or financial malpractice to restore democratic 
procedures or to carry out legitimate objectives of the labor 
organization 
these purposes are too narrow keeney said for example 
if the union were being used for clearly criminal ends outside the 
context of international labor union affairs such as trafficking 
in illegal drugs the purposes stated in the bill would probably 
not apply and a trusteeship could not be imposed 
he added that the restrictions on the duration of a trusteeship 
would make it very burdensome for a trustee to perform his duties 
effectively as is evident from our experience in at least one 
case where a union local has had a trustee for more than two years

regulatory authorities suspect massive insider 
trading sent stock prices soaring on the tokyo stock exchange 
before a major corporate cooperation agreement was announced 
officials said wednesday 
it was an unusual admission in japan where insider trading has 
been an acknowledged way of doing business until recently 
securities laws have ignored all but the most blatant forms of 
trading based on privileged information 
officials at the finance ministry and the tokyo stock exchange 
said they were investigating a case last month in which the share 
price of sankyo seiki manufacturing co a precision machinery 
maker jumped hours before the announcement of sankyos agreement 
with nippon steel co japans largest steel maker the companies 
did not merge or form a joint venture but agreed officially to 
cooperate in some areas 
the tokyo stock exchange took the unusual move of suspending 
trading in sankyo shares on the afternoon of july 29 but the 
volume of sankyo shares traded in the morning was still nearly 10 
times the previous days level 
securities officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
they suspected a leak 
the national daily asahi shimbun and the japan broadcast corp 
reported that numerous nippon steel and sankyo employees bought 
several thousand sankyo shares early on july 29 both companies 
denied the allegation 
under current laws workers who bought the shares with prior 
knowledge of the tieup will not be subject to criminal punishment 
but the government can warn the companies or take administrative 
action such as prohibiting them from exporting for a while 
a stock exchange official said the body has asked securities 
companies that dealt in sankyo shares to submit lists of investors 
we have obtained information on about 90 percent of the people 
who bought sankyo shares on that day said hitoshi shimakura 
head of the exchanges transaction review section 
the case is the latest in a series of stock scandals that have 
shaken political and business circles in japan it came to light at 
a time when public outcry for stricter controls over insider 
trading has been growing 
this summer aides to some of japans top political and business 
leaders including prime minister noboru takeshita made huge 
profits by buying unlisted shares of a tokyo real estate concern 
and selling them after public trading began 
that incident called recruitgate after the real estate 
firm recruitcosmos grew into a major impediment for takeshita 
when the political opposition used it to block parliamentary debate 
on the governments unpopular tax revision package 
takeshita finance minister kiichi miyazawa and a dozen other 
top politicians admitted their aides were involved and apologized 
for poor supervision 
the deals were legal under japanese laws but highlighted the 
close ties between business and politics and raised questions about 
political ethics 
the finance ministry decided last week to hasten by more than 
two months the implementation of the revised securities exchange 
law which gives authorities power for tighter surveillance and 
control and allows for criminal punishment for insider trading 
the new law announced in february will take effect in stages 
beginning this month instead of november officials said

an oil company is drilling an exploratory well just 
outside paris under a permit that could lead to similar projects 
inside the capital 
the company societe nationale elf aquitaine said drilling the 
6000footdeep hole in the southern suburb of ivrysurseine will 
take about three weeks 
the exploratory well at ivry 1 miles outside the paris is the 
first under the parisile de france permit shared by elf total 
compagnie francaise des petroles and british petroleum 
the permit awarded in december 1985 covers 590 square miles 
and includes the city of paris the area is part of the paris 
basin a 50000squaremile region that stretches from paris 
eastward to the west german border 
it has 40 million tons of known oil reserves 
the drilling at ivry is being done on an industrial site owned 
by the staterun power company electricite de france the 
exploratory well is the culmination of extensive seismic studies of 
the permit area which found several structures that might contain 
hydrocarbons elf officials said 
total has said it will drill a well on its share of the permit 
by the end of the year british pertroleum has not disclosed its 
plans 
jean perrot elfs assistant director of exploration in france 
has said the drilling at ivry which began tuesday will help 
determine the size of the structure there and whether it contains 
oil in marketable quantities 
a success at ivry would encourage more extensive testing inside 
paris where seismic tests were limited and particularly difficult 
because of the subway system sewerage lines and other 
interferences a spokesman for elf alexis poutchkovsky said in a 
recent interview

the reagan administration asked congress on 
wednesday to delay acting on a proposal to require health warning 
labels on alcoholic beverages until a study of the bills impact is 
completed 
william t drake deputy director of the treasury departments 
bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms told a senate commerce 
science and transportation subcommittee that his agency is studying 
the issue and would report to congress by the end of the year 
while the administration is on record as recognizing that the 
health hazards related to alcohol consumption comprise one of the 
nations most serious problems we believe any legislation should 
await the completion of studies on the impacts of alcohol 
labeling drake said 
the bill sponsored by sen strom thurmond rsc would 
require five rotating labels on beer wine and distilled spirits 
they would warn against abuse of alcohol during pregnancy the 
dangers of liver disease hypertension and cancer impaired driving 
ability the danger of combining alcohol with other drugs and the 
addictive nature of alcohol 
not only does common sense tell us that consumers need to be 
more aware of the effects of alcohol experts in the field have 
long been calling for alcohol warning labels thurmond said 
thurmond displayed a pamphlet he said had been recently 
distributed to all senate offices by the distilled spirits council 
of the united states claiming to reflect the latest findings in 
alcohol research 
thurmond said the pamphlet contains not one word about the 
dangers of drinking while pregnant not one word 
a committee spokeswoman said the liquor industry declined to 
testify at the hearing

the drought baked all 420 acres of keith 
salters wheat barley and oats crops but with an inch of rain 
last week and hopes of getting at least 12000 in federal drought 
aid he sees a much brighter future 
its a good buffer and its probably enough to get most 
people over the hump this year the 53yearold farmer said of 
the 39 billion droughtrelief package passed by congress it 
wont be like a crop but its better than nothing 
the most expensive disaster relief measure ever enacted for 
agriculture was approved by house on tuesday after passing the 
senate the day before the white house has said president reagan 
intends to sign the bill 
leaders of north dakotas two largest farm organizations predict 
most farmers in the state will qualify for some payments although 
they admit the aid wont be enough to keep all financially squeezed 
farmers in business 
if a farmer has been struggling these past few years this 
will not allow him income to pay down debt and interest said 
john leininger spokesman for the 33000member north dakota 
farmers union we are definitely going to see some farmers leave 
i am sure 
leininger said the drought program would pump income rather 
than loans into farmers pockets which is what they were 
looking for 
monty burke president of the 24000member north dakota farm 
bureau said many farmers were breathing a collective sigh of 
relief over the drought aid it is going to keep some farmers in 
business it will be that simple he said in a telephone 
interview from his farm near mckenzie other farmers were going 
to stay in business but were going to be in a weakened financial 
position this will give them the financial ability to go into 
another year 
asked whether the package contained enough money for farmers 
the 60yearold farm leader said oh yes i think its all 
that really could be expected out of congress some farmers are 
awfully hardpressed for cash flow and this is what it will 
provide 
the us department of agriculture has labeled north dakota the 
state hardest hit by this summers drought which destroyed an 
estimated 75 percent of the wheat oats and barley crops and forced 
many livestock producers to sell off cattle as hay crops and 
pastures wilted in the unrelenting heat 
the drought relief kicks in for growers who lost at least 35 
percent of their crop with the usda providing payments equal to 65 
percent of lost income farmers with crop losses exceeding 75 
percent of expected yield will be eligible for payments equal to 90 
percent of income lost as a result of crop losses 
exactly how much federal aid will flow to the state is unknown 
but rep byron dorgan dnd projected it would be something less 
than 400 million 
according to the farmers union a farmer with an average wheat 
yield of 30 bushels an acre who harvested nothing this year should 
earn at least 42 an acre in disaster aid the payment would go up 
to about 92 an acre if the farmer had federal crop insurance 
the same farmer harvesting a normal crop would earn about 114 
per acre based on market prices this spring leininger said 
salter a farmer since 1954 said crop insurance adjusters 
considered his smallgrain crops a total loss 
as near as salter can figure it the disaster program should 
pump at least 12000 into his bank account enough to pay most of 
his bills he also has federal crop insurance to fall back on 
still salter said the payments would be about 5000 short of 
what he would have collected had he harvested an average crop 
salter also raises cattle at his farm about 10 miles northeast 
of bismarck and must also figure in the damage to his pastures and 
the loss of hay crops for his 100 head of cows because of the 
losses hell have to buy feed elsewhere 
projecting into the fall and winter and next years spring 
planting season there will be other droughtcaused expenses too 
he anticipates so overall he figures the drought will set him 
back at least 20000 even after disaster payments and crop 
insurance 
you never do fully recover from a drought he said 
surveying countryside that was parched brown in june but has turned 
green from recent rains it always hurts your operation 
recovers but you never recover what income you lost

the north atlantic treaty organization is 
studying a fairly significant cut in shortrange atomic weapons 
that could be announced later this year natos top military 
officer said wednesday 
the cuts will be part of a package aimed at modernizing natos 
arsenal of tactical atomic weapons in which older weapons are 
replaced by newer weapons us army gen john r galvin said 
galvins staff is halfway through a study involving the 
modernization of natos battlefield nuclear weapons he told 
reporters 
my own judgment of it the study is that it will result in 
another reduction in the overall number of warheads and it will be 
a fairly significant reduction but the reduction will be 
contingent on the modernization we can get galvin said 
the study will be finished in december or january galvin said 
he declined to say how many weapons would be involved 
i dont want to quantify now and i cant quantify now because 
i really dont know what the number would be and i dont want to 
make any guess at it i would say its going to be a significant 
number he explained 
the united states and the soviet union now are conducting 
preliminaryround inspections as part of the intermediaterange 
nuclear forces treaty which requires both sides to eliminate all 
medium and shortrange nuclear missiles within three years the 
inf cuts will eliminate weapons with ranges of 320 miles to 3000 
miles but still will leave both sides with large arsenals of 
socalled tactical weapons with ranges of less than 320 miles 
after inf nato still will have about 4200 tactical nuclear 
weapons including bombs artillery shells and the lance missile 
the lance with a range of 70 miles is one of the prime weapons 
nato wants to modernize 
the newest cuts would come out of the 4200 total galvin said 
the soviets do not publish any statistics about their nuclear 
weapons inventory but are estimated to have far more 
tacticalrange weapons than nato for example the soviets have an 
estimated 9100 artillery and missile launchers capable of being 
loaded with atomictipped weapons 
the issue is politically sensitive particularly in west 
germany where many of the tacticalrange weapons are based if 
those weapons are used they are likely to fall upon german soil 
galvin noted 
the upcoming cuts will help express to the germans that we are 
aware of their concerns said galvin he contended that there 
is no political purpose or intention in bringing this up now 
on two other occasions in recent years nato has announced 
unilateral reductions galvin noted including a cut of 1000 
warheads and a second decrease of 1400 
this is going to be a unilateral reduction as the other ones 
were galvin noted 
i dont think weve taken enough credit for the fact that 
weve already made two very large unilateral reductions he said 
the soviets would have made that a massive propaganda campaign 
had they made similar cuts he said 
one of the reasons for the reductions will be the fact that the 
soviets will lose some of their most threatening nuclear weapons 
because of the inf pact galvin said 
it isnt a question of what do we have it is a question of 
what do we have versus what do they have he said

george bush complained wednesday that 
president reagan is being unfairly accused of playing 1988 
politics with recent cabinet and policy decisions and added i 
guess its just that time of year 
bush denied that a host of recent reagan decisions including 
the nomination of a hispanic to be education secretary were 
calculated to bolster the vice presidents election prospects 
in a meeting with reporters he noted that national education 
association officials had ascribed political motives to reagans 
selection of texas tech university president lauro f cavazos to 
succeed education secretary william bennett 
i guess its normal that everything he does people will 
accuse him of playing politics but i certainly wont add any 
validity to that charge bush said 
bush had called reporters to his office complex in the old 
executive office building next to the white house to announce the 
selection of former sen paul laxalt of nevada a close reagan 
confidant as a bush presidential campaign cochairman 
at the same time bush refused to say how many people remain 
under serious consideration as his vice presidential running mate 
saying he had not made up his mind has set no date for 
deciding bush said he was working very prudently and calmly on 
the decisionmaking process 
meanwhile bush worked on his acceptance speech for next weeks 
republican national convention electronically transmitting 
faxing material between his office and speech writer peggy 
noonan working at her home across town 
and with guidance from the bush high command republicans were 
at work a few blocks from their new orleans convention hall 
crafting their platform 
bush chafed at a question of whether a host of recent 
presidential decisions have been geared toward boosting the vice 
presidents position against massachusetts gov michael dukakis in 
public opinion polls 
reagan had filled two cabinet vacancies with people known to be 
on close terms with bush nominating former pennsylvania gov 
richard thornburgh to be attorney general and picking wall street 
investment banker nicholas f brady to succeed treasury secretary 
james a baker iii 
on tuesday the president picked cavazos to head the education 
department a month after bush promised a hispanic audience in 
dallas that he would put a hispanic in the cabinet if elected 
bushs influence also was widely seen in reagans decision to 
allow a plantclosing notification bill to become law and in the 
presidents veto of a 2995 billion defense authorization bill 
referring to the nea comments on cavanos selection bush said 
people jump all over him accusing him of playing 1988 politics 
he said the president was running his office with strength and 
with the same determination that hes had since he was elected 
president 
reagan had scoffed at a similar question tuesday telling 
reporters that im just still working on the job here 
asked whether the administration was nonetheless taking on an 
increasingly bush look the vice president replied i dont think 
theyve ever had a nongeorge bush look to it its just been put 
into a focus of george bush because im the will be the nominee 
of the party 
yes i was asked about the secretary of education job he 
said i expressed my opinion but im not going to start doing 
now that which ive been unwilling to do and that is jumping out 
trying to take credit for or responsibility for what is a very 
important presidential appointment 
but i can understand almost everything the president does 
he gets asked a question are you doing this to help george bush 
or are you doing this because of 88 and i guess its just that 
time of year 
laxalt joins several other people who have the title of bush 
campaign cochairman they include govs john sununu of new 
hampshire bob martinez of florida and jim thompson of illinois 
also included are sen mitch mcconnell rky former sen barry 
goldwater of arizona sen james mcclure ridaho and rep lynn 
martin rill 
bush called laxalt one of the most respected figures in public 
life and certainly in the republican party and said that laxalts 
principal responsibility would be to help bush in the west and to 
help coordinate reagans campaign activities 
laxalt a longtime friend of reagan said that once bush is 
nominated in new orleans next wednesday night hell develop his 
own aura and independence as a result of that

a refusenik family that became the focus 
of a superpower tugofwar left the soviet union on wednesday and 
celebrated the end of an 11year struggle to emigrate with a night 
at the opera 
wearing radiant smiles yuri and tanya zieman and their 
12yearold daughter vera stepped off an aeroflot jet to a warm 
welcome from western friends us embassy officials and members of 
an organization helping emigre soviet jews 
asked how she felt on arriving in the west mrs zieman said 
simply stunned her daughter clutching a bouquet from 
wellwishers giggled excited 
the family will stay in vienna until friday when they fly to 
boston for a reunion with an older daughter who emigrated in 1987 
with her husband 
a woman answering the telephone at their vienna hotel said the 
ziemans went to the palais schwarzenberg one of the citys finest 
restaurants for dinner a waiter at the restaurant said the dinner 
was only a prelude to a true viennese delight a performance of 
mozarts the magic flute at the opera 
it was a rather more stylish celebration of the ziemans 
departure than an impromptu champagne toast with several dozen 
friends and relatives gathered at moscows sheremetyevo airport 
wednesday 
im glad youre all here zieman told the group i invite 
you all to my new home zieman is a former computer specialist 
who has help odd jobs since applying to emigrate and was seriously 
ill earlier in the year 
in vienna he said he now feels much better im so excited 
that it sometimes seems to me that all my sicknesses are behind 
me 
in moscow mrs zieman called her departure one of the most 
difficult moments of ones life its like your own funeral in a 
way because most of the people who are here today i wont see again 
my old teachers relatives friends 
the family spent a sleepless night clearing customs in moscow 
and saying farewell to friends she said 
us diplomats said president reagan had planned to visit the 
zieman family at their moscow apartment during the summit meeting 
in may and june to underscore us concern for human rights in the 
soviet union 
reagan and his wife nancy became interested in the ziemans 
plight after receiving a letter from vera who apparently caught 
their sympathy with her plea to help a lifelong refusenik a 
reference to the refusal by soviet authorities to let her leave the 
country almost since she was born 
a highranking soviet official told us officials however 
that if the president visited the family the ziemans would never 
be allowed to emigrate 
reagan did not visit them and two weeks after he left they were 
told their application had been refused again and that they should 
reapply in 1992 within weeks however they received permission to 
leave 
soviet officials previously had rejected their applications for 
emigration saying the ziemans had access to state secrets 
the zieman family was among the most prominent of those 
remaining in the soviet union in the year since officials began 
granting permission for the bestknown refuseniks to emigrate

new orleans has surpassed the 55 million 
goal set for its share of costs for the republican national 
convention officials announced wednesday 
as of last night we had 5589000 and contributions are 
still coming in said ron jones chairman of the new orleans 
special events fund

raised since may 11 when oilman pat taylor in charge of 
fundraising at first complained that it was going too slowly and 
that big corporations were reluctant to dig into their bank 
accounts 
taylors group the greater new orleans convention fund had 
raised about 620000 in about eight months 
ninety days ago we were several hundred thousand dollars 
short of being halfway to our goal he said wednesday amongst 
the things i had to say then was that i knew this city would come 
together it has come together 
mayor sidney barthelemy said it was significant that new 
orleans money came from donations instead of a tax like the one 
atlanta used to help pay for the democratic national convention 
this day has proven that new orleans is a majorleague city 
that we are all wearing the same jersey we are all pulling 
together he said 
the money was needed for work pledged by the city to bring the 
republican party to new orleans for the conventionn aug 1518 
those costs include 1 million each for the lighting system set 
up for the convention and for electrical work 900000 in 
construction 700000 for security and 630000 for insurance 
the 950 to 960 donors included all seven parishes in the new 
orleans metropolitan area and some outside of the region jones 
said he said corporate contributions ranged from 100 to 250000

prime minister thorsteinn palsson of iceland 
told president reagan on wednesday he hopes the united states and 
the soviet union find agreement on slashing stockpiles of 
longrange nuclear weapons 
palsson who heads the government of a tiny nation of 250000 
with no defense force said that maintaining world peace depends to 
a large extent on the success of the superpowers negotiations in 
geneva 
reagan in a departure statement after hosting palsson for a 
meeting and lunch noted that iceland had hosted his historic 
october 1986 summit with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev on 
such short notice 
in the wake of the moscow summit i must note that the talks 
that the general secretary and i had in hodfi house in reykjavik 
were an important milestone in the development of our current 
dialogue with the soviet union the president said 
reagan credited solidarity in the north atlantic treaty 
organization with helping the united states achieve the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces accord eliminating an entire 
class of medium and shorterrange superpower missiles that pact 
was consummated during the may summit that reagan and gorbachev had 
in moscow 
during the reykjavik summit reagan and gorbachev discussed 
banning longrange nuclear missiles that summit disintegrated amid 
what the united states said was a soviet insistence that reagan 
abandon his star wars missile defense program 
in his salute to the 40yearold palsson head of the 
independence party and head of government since july 1987 reagan 
noted that he was the first icelandic prime minister to make an 
official working visit to the united states 
assistant secretary of state rozanne ridgway who specializes in 
canadian and european affairs said iceland has a special 
interest in the strategic missile talks in geneva in what is 
done about sealaunched nuclear cruise missiles but beyond 
expressing that special interest the prime minister did not go 
into details 
the united states views iceland as a small but highly 
significant nato ally located strategically to monitor soviet 
ships and installations 
also on the agenda of palssons fourday washington visit are 
meetings with congressional leaders and with defense secretary 
frank c carlucci on friday palsson travels to the atlantic 
forces command in norfolk va for a tour of the aircraft carrier

a nearly 13000acre fire at an idaho national forest forced the 
closing of a wilderness area wednesday and fires in wyoming and 
montana threatened campers and a residential area authorities said 
meanwhile a 12500acre fire in oregons deschutes national 
forest was declared 80 percent contained but not before costing 
the state more that 15 million 
in idaho swirling wind pushed the 12500acre battleaxe 
wilderness fire closer to a backcountry guard station and airstrip 
and forced fire bosses to close the challis national forests 
indian creek area for safety reasons 
manpower along the creek was quadrupled as the monthold fire 
continued eluding supression 
weve been having some squirrelly winds in there and the 
fires started to creep around forest spokesman jim james said 
our fuels are extra extra dry 
in northwestern idaho 200 firefighters including a prison 
inmate crew were gaining control of a 200acre fire in the nez 
perce national forest 
at wyomings yellowstone national park fire managers were 
counting on fire retardant and 700gallon buckets of water to keep 
a 30150acre blaze from scorching a campground in the parks 
western section 
park officials said visitors to the 288space madison junction 
campground may have to go elsewhere if the north fork fire moves 
much closer 
spokesman joan anzelmo said winds of 1525 mph were expected to 
fan the fire wednesday afternoon but the 573 firefighters on the 
blaze hoped to hold it about three miles from the campground 
several fires raged in montana on wednesday but the worst had 
more than 200 firefighters battling a potentially explosive blaze 
in the populated droughtparched helena national forest 
the fire raced through 400 to 500 acres of timber within hours 
after it started tuesday afternoon despite attacks by a helicopter 
and four retardant bombers 
the biggest problem is that theres a lot of fuel out there 
thats very dry said dave turner fire information officer at 
the helena interagency fire dispatch center seven or eight years 
ago some late spring storms took down a lot of material trees that 
are now on the ground 
some local residents in the upper end of warm springs creek 
drainage are at risk at the present time turner said adding 
that crews did not yet expect to evacuate them 
the largest forest fire in oregon this year was 80 percent 
contained wednesday 
the paulina fire has cost 157 million to fight so far said 
jill haney a forest service spokeswoman it consumed 12500 acres 
a shift in winds and higher humidity helped crews slow the

heinz usa said wednesday it has donated 
50000 to help cover travel costs of migrant farm workers whose 
season picking tomatoes and cucumbers in the northern midwest has 
been cut short by the drought 
the president of the farm labor organizing committee baldemar 
velasquez praised heinzs efforts but criticized ohio for not 
providing enough emergency relief to migrants 
it is currently recognized that due to the drought there will 
be reduced earnings on the part of the local producers and farm 
workers said ronald brooks midwest agricultural manager for 
heinz usa in fremont a division of hj heinz co 
this program is positioned as a supplement to these reduced 
earnings it will not replace the earnings but it is our 
intent that it will aid them in returning to their homes or their 
next work site brooks told a news conference it is clear that 
this sum of money will not meet all the needs however it is a 
start 
the money will be offered in northwest ohio and southeast 
michigan through the migrant farmworker emergency assistance 
program it will be administered by wsos community action 
commission inc of fremont and ohio farmworker opportunity inc 
of bowling green both agencies have agreed to donate 
administrative costs 
growers are being asked to complete forms about family size and 
income families with incomes at least 25 percent below normal as a 
result of the drought will be eligible for payments of up to 150 
in addition velasquez said the farm labor organizing committee 
has donated 1100 to the fund and is seeking donations from other 
processors in the area 
paul blausey president of the fremont pickle and tomato growers 
association said the program will help retain people to harvest 
crops in a very difficult year 
about 10000 migrant workers come to the region each year to 
pick fruits and vegetables but this year because the drought has 
severely damaged tomatoes and cucumbers many have been unable to 
find work and left before the harvest others have not made enough 
money to return home 
there are about 6500 migrant workers in northwest ohio and 
southeast michigan now velasquez said citing estimates that 60 
percent of them will earn less than 75 percent of their normal 
income 
velasquez said he is disappointed that the state has not 
provided enough emergency help for ohio farm workers who pick 85 
million worth of crops each year 
the union has recommended to the state drought task force that 
money be provided for emergency unemployment compensation to the 
farm workers who are unemployed or underemployed because of the 
drought 
we have not been contacted by the state in terms of the 
necessary needs that are out there and what kind of programs could 
be created to alleviate the situation he said 
we are running out of time we are still in a crisis and a 
race against time pretty soon it is going to be too late he 
said

supreme court justice thurgood marshall said 
wednesday racism is broader and stronger than before and 
america has a long way to go to achieve racial equality 
were not gaining ground my friends we might be losing 
ground marshall the only black ever to sit on the high court 
told the annual convention of the national bar association an 
organization of black lawyers and judges 
one thing im sure of this is no time to stop fighting for 
racial equality he said 
marshall urged his listeners to work toward a goal that is the 
basis of true democracy 
that goal he said is to assure that a negro child born 
in a state like mississippi or any other state like that born to 
the dumbest poorest sharecropper has the same rights of a child 
born to a white parent the wealthiest person in the united 
states 
marshall received an enthusiastic round of applause for the 
remarks and a sustained ovation when he was given a crystal pyramid 
as the justice of the 20th century 
marshall 80 was named to the supreme court by president 
johnson in 1967 for decades his name was synonymous with the 
fight for civil rights he served as chief counsel of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people for 23 years 
marshall recalled that the national bar association which now 
has 12000 members and conducted its annual meeting in one of 
washingtons finest hotels could not always afford such plush 
surroundings 
indeed we couldnt come in the front door he said 
marshall rejected what he said was the suggestion by some that 
the fight for racial equality has been won 
why do we have to have a national bar association today this 
late date as some people would think marshall asked well 
the answer is simple its not that late 
the association was created in 1925 to promote civil rights and 
to provide black lawyers with an alternative to the american bar 
association the nations largest lawyer group

george bush worked wednesday on his acceptance speech for next 
weeks republican national convention while democratic presidential 
candidate michael dukakis forecast a very tough competitive 
campaign as a poll showed his oncemighty lead shrinking to single 
digits 
republicans crafted an antitax hike antiabortion platform a 
few blocks from their new orleans convention hall and voted to 
proclaim themselves the champion of women as well as minorities 
public opinion polls show bush trailing dukakis badly among women 
voters 
lets be honest republican chairman frank fahrenkopf said 
in a speech to the partys national committee last month 
belonged to michael dukakis and the democrats they had their show 
they had their laughs but the last laugh is still the best 
laughthis campaign now belongs to us 
republicans also said they have 135 million cash on hand 
toward a goal of 70 million or more to help elect bush and other 
gop candidates this fall 
the cavernous superdome where republicans will nominate bush and 
his asyet unknown vice presidential running mate was still a 
construction zone thousands of redbacked chairs were installed on 
the floor beneath a huge podium workmen laid what seemed like 
miles of red carpet to cover the temporary walkways 
the most recent public opinion poll gave bush cause for cheer 
a gallup poll gave dukakis an edge over bush of 49 percent to 42 
percent in a survey taken aug 57 that contrasts with a 17point 
dukakis bulge in the days immediately following the democratic 
national convention in july 
there was little doubt that the gop platform committee was 
sketching a conservative blueprint for america and at least one 
participant was unhappy this is the last platform hurrah 
believe me of the far right said liberal sen lowell weicker of 
connecticut 
the platform committee refined one plank to say republicans are 
the natural champion of blacks minorities women and ethnic 
americans in agreeing to the change they overrode an objection 
of james summers of bellevue wash who said the revision amounted 
to absolutely pandering to a single constituency where we appear 
according to the pollsters to be having a problem 
the early platform draft also called for rapid and certain 
deployment of star wars the vice president has urged deployment 
as soon as feasible 
republicans also released what they said was a gop staff 
estimate of the cost of the implicit promises of the democratic 
platform 431 billion in 1989 alone ironically bush has 
criticized the democrats for drafting a platform that lacked any 
specifics

a tired cockpit crew working illegally long hours 
mistook a busy british highway for a nearby airport runway and were 
preparing to land their packed airliner on it aviation experts 
said wednesday 
they said the captain was looking at the m56 highway instead of 
manchester airport when he told air traffic controllers he had the 
runway in sight and would land visually 
the highway landing was aborted at the last moment after the 
copilot realized the error the royal air force institute of 
aviation medicine said the aircraft touched down safely at the 
airport 
the report quoted the copilot as saying he realized the flight 
would mean he would exceed his limit of 11 hours continuous duty 
but the pilot was under commercial pressure and asked him to say he 
came on duty one hour later than he did 
the institute passed the report to the civil aviation authority 
the authority finances the institute program for the discovery and

republican party chairman frank j fahrenkopf 
jr on wednesday defended attacks on michael dukakis as the 
unvarnished truth and said the democratic presidential nominee is 
trying to deflect legitimate criticism by accusing opponents of 
negative campaigning 
in a speech to the republican national committee fahrenkopf 
cited democratic attacks on vice president george bush and said 
see if you can find any better examples of negative campaigning 
and the democrats have the nerve to point the finger at us 
meeting less than a week before the opening of their convention 
gop officials also were told the national committee began the month 
with 135 million in the bank and would spend more than 70 
million to help party candidates at all levels 
larry bathgate chairman of the party finance committee said 
his group raised 349 million during the first seven months of the 
election year and expected to raise up to 6 million at a luncheon 
the final day of the convention 
a sampling of national committee members all cited bushs speech 
accepting the presidential nomination as the most important moment 
of the convention 
we all want to hear a good strong speech issues oriented 
said jennifer dunn washington gop chairman 
spencer abraham michigan gop chairman said bush muist use the 
convention to establish that he has become the head of the 
republican party 
fahrenkopf cited bushs appearance ealier in the week before the 
gop platform committee when the vice president referred to dukakis 
as the stealth candidate and said the massachusetts governor 
was invisible on the issues 
dukakis is already crying foul said fahrenkopf but how 
can dukakis call this negative campaigning and go unchallenged 
yes the vice presidents remarks were critical but the 
vice president used a memorable rhetorical device to make a point 
grounded in fact that dukakis will not discuss the issues 
fahrenkopf said criticism of the massachusetts furlough program 
under which convicted murderers were allowed to spend weekends away 
from prison was not mudslinging because it was the unvarnished 
truth 
the gop chairman also accused dukakis of using negative tactics 
during the democratic primary campaign and said dukakis is using 
the oldest trick in politics he and his people say the most 
outlandish things and then denounce any response as mudslinging

with evangelist jerry falwell on wednesday 57 were arrested for 
blocking clinic entrances and the number jailed since 
demonstrations began rose to more than 300 
asked if he planned to join those being arrested wednesday 
falwell said not today but im willing to be and im sure 
before its over it will happen 
police said 57 people many clutching bibles were charged with 
criminal trespass and giving a false name after they blocked the 
entrances to feminist womens health center 
about 200 people picketed or held signs with graphic displays of 
aborted fetuses they cheered clapped and sang hymns as their 
companions were arrested and taken away in prison buses 
while some protesters blocked entrances others confronted 
patients as they tried to enter the clinic shouting dont kill 
your baby we can help you we can give you anything you need 
several patients were escorted through the protesters by clinic 
workers wearing identifying tshirts and at one point police 
helped lift a patient over seated demonstrators 
wednesdays arrests pushed to 333 the number of people charged 
in seven scattered days of protests which began last month during 
the democratic national convention most of the seven atlanta 
clinics that perform abortions have been targeted during the 
demonstrations which are unannounced but highly organized 
in a related protest in fort lauderdale fla 42 demonstrators 
remained in jail wednesday in the wake of a threeday vigil and 
march to free joan andrews who is serving a fiveyear sentence for 
leading a 1986 raid on a pensacola abortion clinic 
several dozen protesters remain in jail in atlanta because they 
refuse to identify themselves instead giving their names as baby 
john doe or baby jane doe organizers say those still in jail are 
committed to remaining indefinitely 
among those arrested wednesday were ministers and some in a 
busload of people from mississippi who arrived wednesday morning 
pickets said they were from north carolina south carolina

organizing group operation rescue with a check for 10000 to help 
pay legal expenses terry was arrested during a protest last week 
charged with being a party to a crime 
saying he came to atlanta to sanction and endorse the new 
concept in the prolife movement of nonviolent civil 
disobedience falwell promised to use his television ministry to 
rally support for operation rescue and other nonviolent abortion 
protests 
in the next few months this will be breaking out all over 
america said falwell a baptist preacher from lynchburg va 
im challenging my preacher friends everywhere whove stood with 
us on every other issue to stand up now in this one and endorse 
nonviolent civil disobedience 
a clinic spokeswoman said the protests had provided free 
publicity and that the normally competitive clinics have begun 
referring patients to each other when necessary 
these kind of tactics dont dissuade anybody from having an 
abortion it just makes them wait longer said ann rose director 
of community education for midtown hospital which performs 
abortions and other services and has been the site of previous 
demonstrations 
were busier than ever its good publicity for us in a lot of 
ways people now know where we are and they know a lot more about 
abortions than they did before she said when they get 
pregnant they know who to call now they dont have to go looking 
through the yellow pages they heard it on tv

the senate judiciary committee on wednesday 
unanimously recommended confirmation of richard l thornburgh as 
attorney general and set the stage for quick senate approval of the 
former pennsylvania governor and three other top justice department 
nominees 
thornburgh would succeed edwin meese iii who announced his 
resignation after an independent counsel investigating his conduct 
declined to file criminal charges against the controversial 
attorney general 
the committee approved thornburgh by voice vote without debate 
afterwards acting panel chairman edward m kennedy dmass urged 
that the senate act before recessing this week for the summer 
the panel previously recommended approval of harold christensen

thornburgh was a twoterm republican governor of pennsylvania a 
chief of the justice departments criminal division and currently 
is director of the institute of politics of harvard universitys

aftershock from his confirmation hearing last week during that 
hearing he was quizzed repeatedly about a published report that as 
head of the criminal division he had a role in withholding from 
congress a 1975 report on drug trafficking by panamanian leaders 
thornburgh said portions of the report were withheld at the time 
because of pending investigations and he insisted that any 
decision to keep the information from congress would have been made 
by the attorney general at the time edward levi 
thornburgh said an arrangement eventually was made for the 
senate to receive the report 
the nominee also pledged at the confirmation hearing to avoid 
the ethical questions that dogged meese who was constantly dodging 
conflictofinterest allegations 
thornburgh promised senators he would hold the justice 
department to the highest ethical standards and said he would 
not interfere with an internal investigation of meeses conduct 
he also declared im a strong supporter of president reagan 
his agenda is my agenda 
thornburgh said fighting the scourge of narcortics would be 
his top priority he promised a vigorous battle against organized 
crime public corruption and whitecollar crime while safeguarding 
civil liberties 
the predecessors of christensen and dennis former deputy 
attorney general arnold burns and excriminal division chief 
william weld announced their resignations last march to protest 
meeses continued tenure in the face of the independent counsels

more than four of every five people consider 
safety to be a serious problem with air travel according to an 
opinion poll published wednesday by an association of private 
pilots 
the random telephone survey conducted by a washington polling 
firm in early june also showed that people who regarded safety as 
a far greater problem with air travel than flight delays 
the poll was commissioned by the aircraft owners and pilots 
association which represents 270000 people who own or fly private 
aircraft 
aopa president john baker said the poll demonstrated the 
publics widespread concern about aviation safety among the public 
but added that those worries were not justified 
by and large safety is not one of the major problems we have 
in the industry we dont have a major safety problem baker told 
reporters 
instead he said the aviation industry faces serious congestion 
problems that will become worse in years to come 
the air transport association which represents the major 
airlines said the public perception that aviation safety has 
deteriorated was unfounded 
the airlines safety record has continued to improve in recent 
years by any measurement one uses it said this year for 
instance there have been some 4 million flights by major carriers 
with no passenger fatalities and just one crew member fatality 
the poll was conducted june 617 by the washington firm of 
hamilton frederick amp schneiders and involved 1000 people 18 or 
older reached by telephone across the country 
according to the aopa 82 percent of those surveyed said air 
safety was a serious problem and 52 percent said air travel was 
less safe than it was five years ago 
of those polled 16 percent said flight delays were a very 
serious problm and 48 percent said they were somewhat serious 
the survey showed that many people believe the solution to 
flight delays is for airlines to provide more realistic flight 
schedules and for airports to be expanded 
when asked how best to relieve airport congestion 68 percent 
favored construction or expansion of airports and development of an 
improved air traffic control system over limitations on flights 
into an airport 
better than four of every five individuals cited a concern about 
maintenance when asked about air safety with 44 percent saying the 
first step was to improve maintenance practices 
at a news conference pollster greg schneiders said the concerns 
about aircraft maintenance reflected in the poll may have stemmed 
partly from news stories at the time about the aerial breakup of an 
aloha airlines jet and federal investigations into maintenance 
problems at eastern airlines

situation as right as he possibly can 
the defense lawyer declined to say whether burns had agreed to

totaling 475685 he also is charged with filing false claim forms

a clinical study on the effectiveness of 
condom use for prevention of aids has been halted while government 
officials search for a way to do the research without compromising 
medical ethics officials said wednesday 
jeffrey perlman chief of contraceptive evaluation for the 
national institute of child health and human development said a 
panel studying the problem decided to cancel condom tests among a 
selected homosexual population in los angeles because the research 
might encourage some people in the study to not use condoms while 
engaging in highrisk sex 
perlman said the study as originally designed would have an 
intervention group that would be given condoms and spermicide 
and a control group that would not receive these items 
the goal was to later compare the amount of aids infection 
between the two groups 
perlman said a national institutes of health committee worried 
that there might be too many people in the control group who 
were getting infected because they were not using the condoms 
that raised the ethical concern he said the concern was 
not that the condoms were not going to work but what would happen 
to the people who were not going to use the condoms 
perlman said that delaying the test does not mean the federal 
government has changed its official policy that advises the use of 
condoms when engaging in highrisk sex highrisk sex would include 
relations with homosexuals with many partners or with partners who 
are promiscuous or with intervenous drug users perlman said the 
government still recommends the use of condoms and spermicide 
the clinical studies were to be conducted under the direction of 
the university of california los angeles under a 26 million 
contract ucla already has done laboratory quality tests on condoms 
and was to supervise the clinical tests among gay men 
dr roger detels professor of public health at ucla who was to 
direct the study said he agreed with the nih decision 
he said a classical intervention test requires that half of a 
selected group use the device being tested and that half not use 
it 
from other studies its clear that if you engage in 
highrisk sexual activities you are better off with condoms than 
without detels said in a telephone interview based on that 
fact it is not ethical to have a control group in the usual sense 
of a control group the study has to take into consideration 
that the control group has to be encouraged to use condoms as well 
as your intervention group 
perlman said the original study has been withdrawn and is now 
being redesigned to adjust for the ethical concerns he said the 
nih will be asking for bids on the new study and he hopes ucla will 
reapply 
the new study he said probably will be a modified intervention 
test in which both groups in the study will receive education on 
the advisability of using condoms but he said only half of the 
group will receive condoms and spermicide from the administrators 
of the research the control group will be encouraged to use the 
protection but will have to purchase it commercially 
perlman said there also will be a retrospective study in which 
people in highrisk groups will be interviewed to determine how 
their sexual practices including the use of condoms and 
spermicidesm may have affected their exposure to aids 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a 
virus that is spread through semen blood blood products or from 
birthing mother to child the disease destroys the bodys immune 
system causing the victim to contract and die from infection or 
rare types of cancer no one is known to have recovered from the 
disease

faced with the threat of a lawsuit from 
advocates for the homeless the federal government on wednesday 
called off a sales campaign officials hoped would unload 15000 
foreclosed singlefamily dwellings this weekend 
the campaign had been aimed at building up federal housing 
administration funds and helping firsttime homebuyers get homes at 
reduced prices said a housing and urban development spokesman 
the spokesman bill glavin said all hud field offices were 
instructed to cancel a planned weekend promotion of 27000 of the 
properties the agency has taken over because owners failed to make 
payments on them the homes are still on the market but the 
promotion dubbed the coordinated national sales weekend was 
called off said glavin 
the action is being taken as a result of the threat of 
litigation by homeless advocacy groups since any protracted 
litigation could have an adverse affect on the future sales of 
foreclosed properties said a hud announcement 
roberta youmans of the national housing law project said her 
group which is based in berkeley calif had written hud to 
object to the campaign and threaten legal action the group assists 
lawyers helping indigent clients with housing cases 
we received calls from homeless individuals saying hud was 
selling units and they couldnt get them ms youmans said in a 
telephone interview 
she said many hud sales result in homes being sold to 
speculators and sometimes the homes themselves have been taken 
away from people who were originally homeless and couldnt make the 
payments putting them back on the streets others are being rented 
to people who are rendered homeless by the sales she said 
we have a crisis here with three million families out on the 
streets ms youmans said 
she said hud had not formally answered the letter but advocates 
for the homeless hope to meet with officials to discuss ways more 
houses owned by the government might be made available to the 
homeless 
the legal issues raised in our letter still remain she said 
hud said it was reviewing its programs for making its foreclosed 
properties available to the homeless both lease and leasepurchase 
programs are available and about 90 percent of hudowned houses 
can be purchased at a 10 percent discount by local agencies that 
would make them available to the homeless hud said 
foreclosed government properties are generally available through 
bids that are to be opened on a specific date for each property 
before the program was stopped hud had asked its field offices to 
do everything they could to promote house sales this weekend 
including offering incentives holding open houses and placing ads 
for the properties

about 500 guests at the st moritz hotel were 
packed off to other lodgings wednesday after a smoky electrical 
fire left the 33story building without power 
the 792room hotel overlooking central park was evacuated 
shortly after 11 am when fire broke out in a cable leading from 
an electrical transformer into the basement authorities said 
the fire which was controlled in slightly more than an hour 
sent some smoke into the lower floors and cut off power to the st 
moritz and four nearby buildings according to fire department 
spokesman efrain parrilla the cause was not immediately determined 
one woman was taken to a hospital for smoke inhalation she was 
listed in stable condition it was unclear what the woman was doing 
at the hotel 
another woman was trapped in an elevator on the 22nd floor for 
about half an hour after the power outage said robert mason the 
fire departments deputy borough commander for manhattan she was 
not injured mason said 
a spokesman for the hotel executive vice president frowen feld 
said the st moritz was completely booked wednesday but few guests 
were in their rooms when the fire broke out 
a loudspeaker system failed because there was no electricity so 
hotel workers knocked on room doors to evacuate people feld said 
feld said the st moritz is equipped with smoke alarms and 
sprinklers but none were activated because the fire and most of 
the smoke was confined to a subbasement 
dan klores a spokesman for st moritz owner donald trump said 
electricity was expected to be restored wednesday night 
in the meantime klores said the st moritz offered its guests 
lodging at the plaza or grand hyatt hotels and about 500 people 
agreed to be transferred several hundred others remained at the 
st moritz he said

poultry scientists have given chickens new 
genes so they can resist avian leukosis a virus that costs egg 
producers 50 million to 100 million annually the agriculture 
department said wednesay 
the socalled transgenic chickens meaning there has been a 
transfer of genes from one organism to another were developed at 
the departments regional poultry research laboratory at east 
lansing mich 
these are the first transgenic chickens with economic 
potential said lyman b crittenden a poultry geneticist of the 
departments agricultural research service the agency that 
operates the laboratory 
avian leukosis virus cannot infect humans but it can cause 
tumors and other symptoms in chickens reducing egg production and 
quality he said 
the genetically altered chickens not only are resistant to the 
virus but pass on the characteristic to their offspring crittenden 
said 
in tests completed this year transgenic white leghorns 
descendants of the original embryos that underwent genetic 
transplants completely resisted repeated exposures to laboratory 
and field strains of the virus in tests lasting 40 weeks 
crittenden said 
the birds appear normal in growth health and reproductive 
ability the geneticist said even so several years of tests by 
poultry breeders will be required before similar transgenic 
chickens will be laying eggs for consumers

govs mario cuomo and thomas kean reacting to 
the beach pollution which has marred the summer in their states 
said wednesday a cradletograve accounting of all infectious 
medical waste was now required in new york and new jersey 
the purpose is to say to people we will watch you with the 
intent of catching and prosecuting you if this waste is not 
disposed of properly new yorks cuomo told a crowded shipboard 
news conference in new york harbor 
kean speaking with the statue of liberty in the background 
agreed we will no longer tolerate the careless unsupervised and 
often just outrageous way these wastes are being handled 
the plan was announced following a monthlong rash of beach 
closings in both states due to medical waste and raw sewage in the 
water syringes blood vials bandages and other infectious waste 
have washed ashore in new jersey and new york beaches in new york 
also had dead rats on the sand 
beach attendance has been down significantly in both states 
because of the washedup waste officials have said 
the problem has cropped up elsewhere too 
syringes vials of drugs and other medical debris have washed 
ashore from the gulf of mexico onto beaches in floridas panhandle 
during the past several weeks authorities there said wednesday 
but one official escambia county environmental health director 
richard dunlap said there was no cause for alarm from a health 
standpoint 
its medical waste its not infectious waste he said 
the storm has brought in so much stuff in addition to medical 
debris tropical storm beryl churned up the gulf earlier this 
week before dissipating 
twentysix miles of north carolina beaches were soiled by waste 
dumped by offshore navy vessels and since sunday marines have 
been working to clean up the sand 
navy regulations allow dumping of biodegradable garbage within 
12 miles of shore said lt cmdr john lloyd a navy spokesman 
other trash may be dumped 25 miles or more from shore but medical 
refuse that may be contaminated or connected with dangerous drugs 
is held for incineration in port he said 
its not a contamination problem and i can say its 
definitely not related to the beach problems in new york and new 
jersey lloyd said 
as part of the new yorknew jersey plan any facility which 
generates medical waste any company which transports it and any 
place which disposes of it will be required to fill out forms at 
each step of the process 
the hospital will then keep the final form completed at all 
three stops on file for the state providing a record of the 
waste from inception to disposal if the hospital does not receive 
the form within seven days of disposal the state must be notified 
the plan went into effect immediately in both new york and new 
jersey the governors said 
we are powerless no longer as needles and bandages wash up on 
our beaches said kean we will be able to punish the people 
who have been turning so many holidays into horror stories 
but both cuomo and kean acknowledged the new manifest system 
did not carry any stricter penalties for illegal dumpers it 
simply would make it easier to catch them 
and both governors used the occasion to call for tougher fines 
and possible jail terms against violators kean also reiterated his 
request for creation of a new jersey coastal commission to monitor 
the states beachfronts 
the gubernatorial gettogether came one day after the us 
environmental protection agency said it had no plans to regulate 
medical waste disposal kean and cuomo disagreed with that 
we want federal legislation only when its needed and here it 
is needed cuomo said

michael dukakis shrugging off a poll 
showing his lead eroding in the presidential race on wednesday 
defended his decision not to start cleaning up the boston harbor 
during his first term as governor 
the democratic presidential nominee helped break ground to begin 
a major phase of the multibilliondollar cleanup of the harbor now 
considered the nations filthiest and spent most of his day at the 
statehouse tending to state business before heading out on a 
fivestate campaign trip thursday 
he dismissed a cautionary advisory from a watchdog panel that 
said state revenues may not live up to projections in the new state 
budget 
this is massachusetts not washington dukakis said were 
going to balance our budget and pay our bills 
a new gallup survey put dukakiss support at 49 percent and 
george bushs at 42 percent in telephone interviews with 1004 
registered voters aug 57 only two weeks ago dukakis was 
sporting a 17point margin over bush a 5437 result in a gallup 
poll each survey had a 3 percentage point margin of error 
the race has always been tight dukakis said this is 
going to be a very tough competitive 90 days 
dukakis traditionally dismisses polls as meaningless although 
he did offer his interpretation of the latest survey 
the only thing that these numbers tell you is that the 
democratic ticket is competitive in every region of the country and 
in every state of the country he said 
to that end dukakis was readying for a campaign trip that will 
take him to three key states in his effort to break the republican 
stronghold in electoral college politics new york new jersey and 
florida dukakis also was to visit connecticut and virginia before 
heading to cape cod friday night to spend the weekend with his wife 
he left the office at midmorning to attend the groundbreaking at 
deer island in winthrop future site of a massive sewage treatment 
plant included in the harbor cleanup plan construction beginning 
there now is for a giant pier for barges carrying components of the 
plant 
after a speedboat ride across the harbor from boston to 
winthrop dukakis defended his decision not to build new treatment 
plants during his first term 
nobody could really tell us what to do to clean up this 
place dukakis said there were very respected people experts 
in the field who disagreed 
lee atwater george bushs campaign manager said in a 
statement if it takes the governor of massachusetts 11 years to 
clean up his own harbor americans must question his commitment to 
the even larger environmental questions which face our nation 
atwater said the delay will increase the average boston water 
bill from 300 to nearly 1200 over the next eight years 
if i were from massachusetts id say the whole thing stinks 
in more ways than one atwater said 
earlier this year dukakis said that in hindsight it was a 
mistake not to begin the cleanup during the first term but he 
seemed unwilling to go that far wednesday complaining of 
revisionist history about this project that blamed him for 
delays that criticism dukakis said may or may not be connected 
with the presidential campaign 
the harbor cleanup with a current pricetag of 6 billion is 
the largest public works project in massachusetts history dukakis 
as he did last week in california boasted of the jobs it would 
create 
there are jobs and economic opportunity in environmental 
quality dukakis said 
dukakis decided against going forward with the plan in the 
mid70s because of disputes over whether secondary sewage treatment 
was needed to clean up the harbor 
his administration began the process of requesting a waiver to 
clean water act requirements for sewage treatment and the waiver 
request was filed by thengov edward j king shortly after dukakis 
left office in 1979 
the federal environmental protection agency ultimately rejected 
the waiver request and a subsequent appeal and the state now is 
under a federal court timetable to complete new primary and 
secondary treatment plants and to stop dumping sludge into the 
harbor the project is scheduled to be completed by 1999 
dukakis faced with the epa decision and state and federal court 
action has made the harbor cleanup a priority since returning to 
office in 1983

sen carl levin of michigan said wednesday he 
would seek to block confirmation of all executive appointments 
unless the white house releases an fbi report on a former official 
targeted in a pentagon procurement investigation 
levin a democrat and member of the senate armed services 
committee sought the report on melvyn paisley former assistant 
secretary of the navy from the fbi and the white house 
he said both refused to give him the report which was a 
background check the fbi conducted on paisley during his 1981 
confirmation hearings for the navy post levin said the fbi may 
have heard allegations of misconduct on paisleys part but the 
information was not available to most committee members at the time 
the panel considered the nomination 
in light of the white house refusal the integrity of the 
confirmation process has been called into question levin said 
future confirmations are at risk until this particular issue is 
satisfactorily resolved 
levins press secretary willie blacklow said the senator 
intended the statement as a threat 
the senator believes paisleys confirmation may show an 
underlying flaw in the confirmation process blacklow said it 
would only be fair that we hold up confirmations until we find out 
where the flaw lies he said 
senate tradition allows members to block consideration of a 
nomination for reasons they do not have to disclose 
paisley resigned his pentagon post in 1987 and became a 
consultant to major defense contractors federal law enforcement 
officials now are investigating allegations that defense 
contractors and consultants many of them former members of the 
military bribed pentagon officials for contracting details that 
could be vital in winning contracts worth billions of dollars 
it is important to the confirmation process that we 
determine just what the fbi and the white house knew about mr 
paisley at the time of his senate confirmation and the extent to 
which that information was made available to the senate levin 
said 
blacklow said levin intended his threat to apply to all 
executive nominations sent to the senate and believed other members 
would support withholding action on confirmations until the report 
was released 
there is no reasonable justification for either the fbi or the 
white house to withhold from the members or at least the 
leadership of the senate armed services committee information 
about paisley that should have been available during his 
confirmation levin said

marines hit 26 miles of beaches this 
week not to fight an enemy but to collect trash bags and bags of 
medical and other waste dumped by navy vessels and washed ashore 
at the atlantic beach fire station 25 giant trash bags were 
emptied into steel and plastic containers all 25 bags had been 
filled since sunday including two filled wednesday 
much of the medical debris such as syringes and vials that may 
contain blood were taken by state officials for testing said dr 
ron levine state health director charges may be filed if 
regulations have been broken he said 
levine said he was relieved to find that the mess appeared to be 
limited 
today they found virtually no medical refuse of any sort 
he said a second search involving 40 marines in fourwheeldrive 
vehicles started in heavy rain at low tide wednesday afternoon 
levine said he was pleased with the militarys response they 
have conceded their responsibilities he said they will clean 
up the entire situation no matter how long it takes and dispose 
of the waste properly 
it is not clear if north carolina statutes outlaw such dumping 
lt gov bob jordan said at a news conference in raleigh he has 
requested an opinion from the state attorney general on the law 
covering such situations proposing a law to prohibit dumping of 
waste into the ocean if the attorney general rules it is not 
covered by current law 
lt cmdr john lloyd a navy spokesman said most of the debris 
that washed up on the beaches is typical trash some had come 
from the uss newport and the uss nassau both based in norfolk 
va he said 
navy regulations allow dumping of biodegradable garbage within 
12 miles of shore lloyd said other trash may be dumped 25 miles 
or more from shore but medical refuse that may be contaminated or 
connected with dangerous drugs is held for incineration in port he 
said 
its not a contamination problem and i can say its definitely 
not related to the beach problems in new york and new jersey 
lloyd said 
levine said the main danger posed by the refuse is the chance 
that someone might be cut by a piece of glass or broken syringe 
and that chance is very very low considering the amount of 
stuff they found he said 
navy officials are checking the logs of the two ships to 
determine how much waste might have been dumped lloyd said he 
said it was uncertain whether any regulations had been violated or 
what penalty such a violation might incur 
marines were expected to remain on the beaches through friday

a house committee on wednesday approved a 46 
million package calling for federal and state action to combat 
cancercausing radon pollution in houses and schools 
the legislation which cleared the energy and commerce committee 
for floor action by a voice vote would set a national longterm 
goal of making the air inside buildings as free of radon gas 
concentrations as the air outside buildings 
it would require the environmental protection agency to update 
and revise its citizens guide to radon to include information 
about health risks posed by various indoor levels of the naturally 
occuring gas 
currently epa sets 4 picocuries of radon per liter of air as 
the level at which a homeowner should take steps to reduce levels 
of radon which is an odorless radioactive gas produced by the 
decay of uranium deposits 
health experts have warned however that this socalled action 
level is too high because living in a house with a 4 picocurie 
reading is believed to be the equivalent of smoking half a pack of 
cigarettes a day 
epa has estimated that radon may be present in dangerous 
concentrations in one of every eight singlefamily homes and that 
it may be responsible for up to 20000 lung cancer deaths annually 
the legislation would mandate epa to develop model construction 
standards and techniques for controlling radon levels in new 
buildings and to rate the values of various radon measuring devices 
and radonabatement contractors 
the bill would provide federal money to states to survey radon 
levels run public information programs and control radon in 
existing and new structures 
epa would be authorized to spend 15 million to study the 
extent of radon problems in schools propose ways to rid schools of 
radon contamination and carry out remedial work at test schools in 
highrisk areas 
the bill is similar to legislation passed by the senate in july 
1987

archaeologists who dug 
quietly in national forests for about 20 years worked in front of 
campers this week in what officials said is a trend toward public 
involvement 
a team of seven archaeologists scraped dirt wednesday in about 
half a dozen carefully marked shallow pits in the pinecovered 
knolls of boulder lake campground in this northeastern wisconsin 
forest 
the site about 60 miles northwest of green bay is believed to 
have been a seasonal indian settlement about 1000 years ago 
it was neither large nor rare from an archaeological standpoint 
said mark bruhy archaeologist for the nicolet and chequamegon 
national forests in wisconsin but its location provided an 
opportunity to teach people about work that is normally done 
quietly in remote areas he said 
to me theres a little irony that a favorite prehistoric 
campsite has become one of our biggest campgrounds today said 
michael beckes regional archaeologist for the us forest 
services eastern district 
in the past weve been concerned about the security of the 
sites but weve come to the conclusion that this is public 
archaeology he said 
the forest service has normally kept its archaeological 
locations confidential to prevent digging by amateur treasure 
hunters which on federal land is a felony beckes said 
but the forest service began experimenting with opening sites to 
the public a few years ago he said 
in the eastern region which includes 14 forests in 22 states 
from minnesota to new england three excavations were open to the 
public this summer beckes said 
its a national trend toward greater public involvement and 
public awareness he said 
about 100 people have come each day this week to nicolet to 
watch the work at plots about 3feetby5feet and less than 5 
inches deep and talk to the archaeologists 
its an opportunity to see something in action that you dont 
normally see said steve straavaldsen of madison who watched the 
work with his wife and two children you see the finished product 
in museum display cases but you dont normally see this 
for the archaeologists it was an opportunity to recruit 
volunteers 
ive had 50 people who have come out here and asked if they 
could help bruhy said 
since the 1960s the forest service has had archaeologists to 
identify study and help preserve sites that might have historic 
value beckes said 
that however was about 30 years late for the boulder lake 
site which was inadvertently damaged when the 99site campground 
area was developed in the 1930s bruhy said grading work disturbed 
the ground and placement of centuriesold bone and pottery 
fragments as did years of erecting tents and building fire rings 
he said 
bruhy found bandages and bottletops mixed in with the small 
chert and quartz arrowheads pottery shards and burned bone refuse 
left by american indians living in the area around the year 800

jesse jackson urged george bush and michael 
dukakis on wednesday to drop their focus on oneliners and sleaze 
charges and campaign for president on issues not on dirt 
if it gets warped into sleaze jackson the former 
presidential candidate told reporters then there will be no 
hope left for the people this campaign ought to focus on 
direction and not on dirt on the live choices the people must 
vote on in november 
this campaign boils down to bush attacking dukakis with 
oneliners every day and dukakis is becoming preoccupied with the 
bushnoriega connection the bushirancontra connection of 
exchanging drugs for arms jackson said 
i hope the campaign will stay at the level of what can be done 
to begin to build affordable housing to fight a serious war on 
drugs to enforce laws at the justice department to protect 
peoples vital interests he said after a breakfast meeting with 
democratic members of the house 
jackson who battled dukakis all the way to the democratic 
convention said the ticket of dukakis and sen lloyd bentsen of 
texas is in the best interest of the country but jackson offered 
his first public criticism of dukakis since the two men reconciled 
in atlanta last month 
he defended dukakis civil rights record even while suggesting 
the democratic nominee should have made more of a statement about 
the struggle for racial equality during an appearance last month in 
philadelphia miss it was near there that three young civilrights 
campaigners were murdered during the 1960s 
speaking in philadelphia dukakis made only passing mention of 
civil rights 
his staff should afford even more emphasis to philadelphia 
miss because of what it means to people jackson told a 
questioner after all 25 years ago the great problem was around 
the search for the three young people 
dukakis had met a number of black and white leaders even 
before he made the address jackson recalled it would have 
been an opportune time to have spoken about the three youths 
it would have been a profound message to the blacks and jews and 
maybe even a wreath should have been laid 
that said jackson added you must look at dukakis in my 
judgment in the cumulative in the cumulative his commitment to 
social justice his commitment to fairness is wellestablished 
his commitment to civil rights has been expressed rather clearly 
jackson criticized as a rather token gesture president 
reagans selection tuesday of lauro f cavazos president of texas 
tech university to be secretary of education 
reagan was trying to send a signal to the hispanic community on 
the selection of one of their own jackson said but after eight 
years the fact that he did not earlier find a hispanic person to 
be a cabinet officer is a sure measure of their regard for that 
segment of our population he added 
house speaker jim wright of texas hosted the breakfast for 
jackson 
we had a very interesting discussion this morning wright 
said all our members were thrilled and strongly motivated by 
jackson whom the speaker called one of the great thinkers of our 
party not afraid to say what needs to be said 
wright said members and jackson talked about legislation calling 
for expedited voter registration sanctions against south africa 
and underlying problems in the economy 
wright said the issue of aid to rebels in nicaragua a question 
that divides dukakis and bentsen was mentioned only peripherally 
jackson talking to reporters reiterated his position against 
the contras 
the contras have no base in central america he said 
lets pursue now a course of peace that will end the war

the united states has temporarily shut down 
its embassy in burma following antigovernment demonstrations that 
appear to have led to a substantial loss of life the state 
department said wednesday 
all official american personnel and their dependents a total 
of 154 people are safe at their homes spokeswoman phyllis oakley 
said 
she said the united states deplores the shooting of unarmed 
demonstrators by burmese security forces and she expressed concern 
about reports that troops were seeking out groups of protesters and 
firing on them 
on capitol hill meanwhile sen daniel patrick moynihan 
dny introduced a resolution condemning the killings and mass 
arrests by the burmese army and supporting an end to oneparty rule 
in burma 
the measure which will probably be voted on by the senate later 
this week also urges president reagan to raise the question of 
human rights abuses with burmese authorities 
mrs oakley was unable to say when the rangoon embassy was 
closed but she said there is no indication that americans or other 
foreigners have been or might become targets of violence 
widespread antigovernment demonstrations erupted last month 
after the appointment as president of a military commander who had 
been accused by students and others of ruthless suppression of 
dissent 
mrs oakley said an official us notice urging americans to 
exercise caution in burma remains in effect it calls on americans 
traveling to that asian country to seek information from the state 
department or us diplomatic posts to inquire about current 
conditions there there are normally about 80 american visitors to 
burma at any given time 
the spokeswoman said the casualty numbers appear 
substantial citing burmese government reports of 33 dead and 59 
wounded some of the casualties apparently were members of the army 
and security forces 
on tuesday mrs oakley said a us embassy officer driving to 
work became trapped in a demonstration after a bullet struck his 
car demonstrators loaded wounded protesters into the vehicle and 
the officer was forced to drive them to a safe location he left 
the scene unharmed she said

middle east met with president hosni mubarak at the end of his 
current tour wednesday but there was no sign of progress in 
reviving arabisraeli peace efforts 
before coming to cairo on tuesday murphy visited lebanon 
syria israel and jordan to evaluate prospects for peace talks he 
leaves for home thursday 
the murphymubarak meeting took place the day after murphy an 
assistant secretary of state announced that egypt had been unable 
to arrange meeting for him in cairo with palestinian 
representatives 
murphy gave no reason but a wellconnected palestinian source 
said the americans objected to two of six proposed palestinian 
participants apparently because they were closely linked to the 
palestine liberation organization the source spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
mubarak received murphy at the presidential residence where the 
media is barred murphy said later their talks covered regional 
topics and the major issues of the coming months 
murphy also met with foreign minister esmat abdelmeguid and 
osama baz mubaraks chief political adviser 
i am now in a much better position going back and presenting 
my report to president reagans secretary of state george p 
shultz murphy told reporters after his 90minute meeting with 
baz on wednesday 
baz said we the egyptians stressed the need to continue 
moving in an attempt to hold the international conference next 
spring with a us role in issues still in conflict such as 
palestinian representation the preparations for the conference and 
its legal basis 
his statement was the first reference to an attempt at 
scheduling the conference for next spring

an international conference last may including all the parties 
concerned under the auspices of the un security councils five 
permanent members the united states soviet union china britain

movement the plan won qualified egyptian support but israel 
jordan syria and the palestinians balked 
in a chat with reporters tuesday mubarak refused to concur with 
a questioners suggestion that the shultz plan was dead because of 
last weeks decision by king hussein of jordan to sever

the skipper of the uss dubuque is about to be 
relieved from command pending an investigation into whether his 
vessel failed to render sufficient aid to a boatload of vietnamese 
refugees who reportedly survived through cannibalism defense 
sources said wednesday 
the officials who insisted on anonymity said capt alex g 
balian would be replaced at least temporarily as the commander of 
the dubuque an amphibious landing ship now on duty in the persian 
gulf 
the sources said another navy officer was en route to the 
persian gulf to relieve balian a decorated vietnam combat veteran 
the sources indicated wednesday that balian was not being 
relieved for cause in a disciplinary move but rather being 
replaced temporarily on an administrative basis pending 
completion of an investigation 
but they are going to relieve him said one official the 
question is obviously should he have rendered more assistance the 
allegations raise serious questions 
the navy and the united nations high commission on refugees are 
both investigating reports of murder and cannibalism that surfaced 
earlier this week in a filipino newspaper the vietnamese boat 
people eventually were rescued off the philippines and are now in a 
refugee camp there 
the newspaper quoted survivors among the vietnamese as saying 
they killed and ate the flesh of some of their fellow passengers to 
stay alive two of the victims reportedly died of starvation but 
the other three were allegedly murdered through drowning and then 
eaten 
the navys investigation stems from the fact that some of the 
survivors maintain the dubuque refused to take them aboard instead 
providing some food and water and then leaving them because it was 
on a dangerous mission 
under navy regulations us warships are expected to extend 
humanitarian assistance as needed in such circumstances 
in the case of an unseaworthy vessel adverse weather or other 
special circumstances the refugees may be embarked and transported 
to the navy ships next port of call the regulations state 
according to robert cooper local representative of the un 
high commission on refugees in manila 52 refugees survived 37 days 
at sea and are now charging the dubuque refused to take them aboard 
even though their boat was disabled and they were dying of exposure 
and starvation 
cooper said the refugees reported that 58 people died during the 
south china sea crossing which began may 22 when the group left 
the mekong delta town of ben tre aboard a 35foot wooden boat 
its engine failed two or three days later 
according to the navy the dubuque on its way to the persian 
gulf encountered the vietnamese vessel on june 9 
the craft was judged to be in seaworthy condition and was 
under sail the navy said in a statement issued tuesday 
the uss dubuque gave the refugees food water and navigational 
charts before resuming transit to the indian ocean 
cooper said the refugees are claiming that by june 9 there 
was one dead refugee aboard the motor was not working they were 
drifting for 19 days people had died of exposure hunger and 
thirst 
the refugees claimed to have later killed some of their 
companions and eaten their flesh to survive cooper said the 
great majority of other deaths also occurred after the 
encounter with the dubuque 
cooper said tuesday that if the allegations proved true it 
would be the first time the us navy had failed to adequately help 
a group of boat people since they began fleeing after the fall of 
south vietnam to the communists in 1975 
the navy and the defense department declined comment wednesday 
on capt balians status 
balian 48 is a native of the los angeles area who won a silver 
star for heroism in vietnam in 1966 while a young lieutenant 
his navy patrol boat was sunk in a viet cong night ambush on a 
river near vung tau southeast of saigon one crewman was killed 
and balian and other crewmen were wounded but managed to escape to 
safety aboard a makeshift raft 
in a related development the navy said wednesday another of its 
warships the frigate badger had rescued 41 vietnamese boat people 
in the south china sea to the west of the philippines on tuesday 
night the refugees ship apparently became grounded the navy said

the b1b bomber has such serious problems that 
the pentagon should consider halting spending on the new longrange 
plane and using the money for other nuclear weapons a key 
congressman said wednesday 
is it really worth it to spend any more money on the b1b 
said rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee and one of the leading critics of the plane that 
president reagan resurrected in 1981 
we have a very serious problem on our hands aspin said 
if a case cannot be made for the b1b i do not see how we can 
spend any more money on it 
aspins questions and criticisms were posed in a letter to 
defense secretary frank c carlucci and a speech aspin planned to 
deliver on the house floor thursday 
the air force continued to defend the longrange bomber 
although it admitted in a statement that it has been unable to fix 
the problems with the b1bs electronic countermeasures equipment 
which is the computerdriven system designed to keep the bomber 
from being shot down by enemy planes or missiles 
the b1 originally was killed in 1977 by president carter but 
reagan reversed that decision four years later and approved the 
purchase of 100 b1s for a total of 273 billion the chief 
contractor is rockwell international which already has built all 
100 planes 
reagan said the plane was needed to replace the aging b52s in 
the nations longrange bomber arsenal until the stealth bomber 
becomes available that plane named after its intended capability 
to evade enemy radar will be rolled out publicly for the first 
time in november 
the b1b has run into a series of highly publicized problems 
which the air force first said were the types of problems 
associated with any new plane 
but fixing the electronic countermeasures problem is not so 
easy the service said 
here the solutions are not so well defined and the 
uncertainties were much greater its statement said 
two months ago the statement said the air force determined 
that work was behind schedule and the solutions being pursued would 
not provide for the full ecm system maturity the air force 
desired 
there has been progress in the ecm system and it adds 
significantly to the aircrafts capability however that progress 
has not been satisfactory and the management of the ecm system has 
not met our expectations we are currently working out the most 
appropriate action in the face of those facts 
aspin asked carlucci to tell congress how much it will cost to 
improve the b1b whether the additional money will provide 
additional capability and how the planes mission can be changed if 
the money isnt spent 
unless the questions are answered we may well be faced with 
the prospect of parking the b1b aspin said 
he suggested that perhaps the money which would be spent on the 
b1b could be better used for other longrange atomic weapons such 
as landbased nuclear missiles 
from now until the year 2004 the united states will spend a 
projected total of 425 billion for strategic weapons and 242 
billion of that total or 57 percent will go for bombers he said 
we need to ask ourselves if this money would not be better 
spent on systems that do not have as many uncertainties as the b1b 
program he said

granting 633 million to several federal programs running low on 
money a measure that was stalled for nearly a week because of an 
electionyear fight over aid to the nicaraguan contra rebels 
lawmakers approved the legislation on a voice vote without 
objection the senate now must work out a compromise bill with the 
house which passed a different version of the measure july 27 
the measure was touted as a dire emergency spending bill 
because it is supposed to provide money for programs that are in 
danger of running out of funds including programs in the 
departments of justice and agriculture the coast guard and the 
veterans administration 
supplemental spending bills such as this one often become grab 
bags for lawmakers eager to provide pet projects for their 
constituents but last falls budget summit pact between president 
reagan and congressional leaders specified that the bill should be 
limited to emergency spending 
most floor action on the bill was completed last thursday 
final passage was delayed as democrats and republicans spent 
days fruitlessly trying to work out a plan to aid the contras 
just before final passage of the spending bill the senate 
rejected a gop amendment 5739 that could have provided the 
contras with 20 million in military aid beyond what the democrats 
prefer 
the delay frustrated senate majority leader robert byrd 
dwva who complained to reporters that administration 
intransigence on the contra aid package threw a roadblock in front 
of the spending legislation 
they shouldnt hold the supplemental hostage to contra aid 
byrd said 
the bill which also allows the transfer of nearly 200 million 
among the budgets of several government agencies is for the 1988 
fiscal year which ends sept 30 
it contains 530 million in new spending and transfers for the 
veterans administration which needs the money for increased 
benefits and for a higher than expected caseload 
the bill initially contained 297 million for veterans but 
lawmakers added 233 million more on a voice vote after sen alan 
cranston dcalif chairman of the veterans affairs committee 
argued that the extra spending was required by law 
the legislation also would provide 75 million for the 
department of justice mostly to pay for the costs of last years 
uprisings by cuban detainees in federal prisons in atlanta and 
oakdale la 60 million for the coast guard to cover the costs of 
patrols and 55 million to help the agriculture department pay for 
drought programs 
programs paying benefits to people who lose their jobs because 
of imports would get 49 million the governments black lung 
disease program would receive 43 million and the fbi would get 
23 million to help its agents observe soviet inspectors monitoring 
american compliance with the new nuclear weapons treaty 
the house bill contained only 189 million in new spending and 
included no funds for veterans it also has money for state 
unemployment offices and for the costs of processing refugees from 
the soviet union and other countries who want to come to the united 
states the senate deleted those provisions

a senate panel on wednesday approved 
legislation designed to tighten standards for medical laboratory 
testing including pap smear tests to detect cervical cancer in 
women 
the measure approved by the labor and human resources committee 
on a voice vote would require annual inspection and licensing of 
all laboratories which perform clinical lab testing including 
those in physicians offices 
similar legislation passed the house energy and commerce 
committee on tuesday senate and house floor action is expected in 
the fall following the congressional recesses 
the bill also would 
establish a means for testing the proficiency of individual lab 
technicans and judging the overall performance of laboratories 
labs also will be required to limit the workload tests performed 
per day for employees reading pap smears 
require laboratories to bill patients directly for tests 
performed rather than through the physicians to ensure that 
doctors choose laboratories based on quality and not cost 
establish tougher uniform quality assurance standards for all 
lab testing 
the regulations would be enforced by the health and human 
services department 
sen barbara mikulski dmd who along with sen brock adams 
dwash was a chief sponsor said after the committee acted 
there are too many labs out there where overworked 
undersupervised technicians are making too many errors errors 
that mean the difference between life and death we cannot allow 
this practice to continue 
mikulski and adams held a hearing in january in which testimony 
was given that as many as 20 percent to 40 percent of pap smear 
test results are inaccurate resulting in undiagnosed cases of 
cervical cancer 
the testimony indicated that the cause of the inaccuracies was 
unregulated medical labs and pap mills huge labs which 
process thousands of tests a day with virtually no quality 
assurance standards 
now when someone uses a lab whether its for a pap smear a 
cholesterol test or a pregnancy test they will know that the 
results will be accurate and reliable ms mikulski said

residents threw stones at a group of 
hindu untouchables after they entered a temple on wednesday and 
police rushed in to restore order a news agency said eight people 
were reported injured 
the violence followed weeks of religious and social controversy 
over whether untouchables traditionally considered the lowest 
class among hindus should be allowed into the temple 
federal welfare minister rajendra kumari bajpai told parliament 
wednesday that the rajasthan state government had been instructed 
to make sure all people including untouchables or harijans were 
allowed into the shrine 
our object was that the harijans should enter the temple and 
that has happened mrs bajpai said 
the press trust of india news agency said residents attacked the 
untouchables with stones at nathdwara in rajasthan about 330 
miles southwest of new delhi it did provide details of the 
violence 
last month a group of untouchables tried to march to the 
18thcentury temple to protest a hindu priests reported comment 
that untouchables should not be allowed to enter the faiths 
shrines 
police arrested dozens of marchers at the time apparently to 
prevent a clash between them and about 5000 uppercaste hindus 
guarding the temple 
the move described as an attempt to keep untouchables out of 
the temple drew sharp criticism 
the priest sankaracharya niranjandev tirth was quoted by 
indian newspapers as saying that untouchables have no religious 
fitness to go to a temple tirth is regarded as a living saint by 
many hindus 
the untouchables had not been allowed in the shrine in past 
years 
the harijans were traditionally looked down upon and their touch 
was regarded as defiling such practices persist today in many 
places especially in rural areas although discrimination against 
untouchables was outlawed in 1950 under indias constitution 
hindus make up 80 percent of indias 800 million people they 
are mainly divided into four major castes below the castes are the 
harijans a group without caste 
harijan which means children of god in the hindi language 
was given to the community by the hero of indias independence 
movement mohandas k gandhi

the central state of hesse 
strongly objected on wednesday to us military plans to increase 
the number of aircraft stationed at a base outside frankfurt 
state government spokesman alexander gauland told a news 
conference in wiesbaden the increase in aircraft at the us base 
in erbenheim would present increased danger to civilian aircraft in 
the area 
erbenheim is less than 12 miles west of frankfurt airport the 
busiest hub on the continent 
west germanys defense ministry will have the final say but has 
not yet decided about the increase the us military wants to 
boost the number of military aircraft stationed at erbenheim from 
53 to 181 by 1993 
gauland said a national air traffic safety office report showed 
an increase in military aircraft in the area would raise the danger 
of disruption to departing or arriving civilian aircraft 
he said increased air traffic also would raise noise levels and 
increase air pollution 
congested air space has been a topic of controversy after a 
series of us and other military plane crashes in west germany in 
the past four months 
the defense ministry on july 29 announced plans to cut by 2000 
hours the number of nato military flight hours in west germany

a sharply divided house panel on wednesday 
approved the 25 billion act for better child care services but 
like its senate counterpart left some fundamental controversies 
unresolved as the bill headed to the floors of both chambers 
the 1914 vote in the education and labor committee on the 
socalled abc bill the major democratic initiative in the 
politically hot child care arena came during the third day of work 
on the measure 
rep jim jeffords rvt was the only republican to vote in 
favor of the bill two democrats pat williams of montana and tim 
penny of minnesota voted no 
as approved by the panel the bill would authorize 25 billion 
next year to go to states with 75 percent of it to be used to help 
low and moderateincome families pay for child care either through 
vouchers or direct payments to providers 
while most of the money would go to the working poor states 
theoretically could give some help to households earning up to 115 
percent of the states median income over 40000 in some places 
committee democrats beat off two attempts to lower the income 
eligibility level but they accepted an amendment lowering the age 
level of eligible children from 15 to 12 
republicans on the panel tried unsuccessfully to eliminate the 
bills requirement for a commission to develop minimum health 
safety and training standards that would be mandatory for those day 
care homes and centers accepting the federal aid 
as introduced the abc bill would have allowed federal funds to 
churchbased day care centers only if they did not promote religion 
in any way they would have had to comply with federal bans on 
religious discrimination in hiring and admissions 
but the version passed by the committee says only daycare slots 
paid for by the federal government would have to be available to 
all children regardless of religion the ban on hiring 
discrimination was dropped 
committee chairman augustus hawkins dcalif said in a 
statement after the vote wednesday that he is still concerned about 
the churchstate and admissions issues 
while i would prefer more precise language ensuring that 
religious indoctrination will not occur i support the current 
language at this time in order to move the bill forward he said 
i want to make clear that as a general proposition all persons 
should have equal access to day care programs supported in whole or 
in part by federal financial assistance 
the churchstate issue and others debated by the committee were 
discussed in subcommittee and are expected to arise again on the 
house floor 
rep tom tauke riowa sponsor of a rival child care bill 
centered on tax credits and vouchers contended the abc bill 
discriminates against families with a parent at home he also 
claimed it would narrow parental options and raise child care costs 
other republican objections centered on the cost of the bill 
rep bill goodling rpa said there is no way in a 
nonelection year that the appropriations committees would allocate 
more than 1 billion to a new program and rep dick armey 
rtexas proposed authorizing up to 100 billion what he called 
the true price tag for a fiscal time bomb rather than the 
25 billion called for in the bill 
he was voted down 
the senate labor and human resources committee last month 
approved the abc bill after lowering the income eligibility level 
to 100 percent of median income targeting money more pointedly 
toward lowincome families including states in the standards 
development process and giving them two years to comply with 
caregiver training requirements 
however before the senators voted abc supporters agreed to sit 
down with sen orrin hatch rutah and try to work out compromises 
on the cost of the bill and the federal standards issue meetings 
have occurred but there have been no concrete results thus far

a group of dissident republicans and 
supporters of television evangelist pat robertson on wednesday 
gained control of the georgia delegation in a peacemaking deal that 
left party regulars outraged and considering a boycott of the 
national convention 
republican national committee chairman frank j fahrenkopf jr 
said afterward that despite the bitterness in the dispute he hoped 
it would not damage the partys prospects in georgia in the fall 
election 
the national committee approved the deal worked out by the 
committee on contests but even after the decision the two sides 
in the dispute could not agree on exactly what it meant 
georgia gop chairman john stuckey said it gave 28 of the states 
48 national convention delegates to the dissidents while brant 
frost iv chairman of the dissident group said the division was 
2622 in his factions favor 
the division of the delegation caps a bitter sixmonth fight for 
control of the georgia republican party vice president george bush 
won the states march 8 primary but robertson supporters overran 
the partys machinery at caucuses and conventions that followed the 
primary 
national officials of both the robertson and bush campaigns 
became directly involved in negotiations to settle the dispute and 
in the end stuckey said that their will prevailed 
asked if the bush campaign had leaned on him to accept an 
agreement stuckey replied no they fell on me 
negotiators included rich bond deputy manager of the bush 
campaign and mark nuttle who had been manager of the robertson 
campaign 
we are striving to get our family together on this and aim our 
fire at michael dukakis and not at each other bond said 
however stuckey said he doubted that the settlement would 
achieve party harmony in georgia 
if the object of this exercise is to buy peace it will have 
the same effect as mr neville chamberlain to buy peace 
said stuckey referring to the former british prime ministers 
attempt to negotiate peace with nazi germany before world war ii 
stuckey who was picked as a delegate asked the rnc to throw 
out the deal after losing he said he would not appeal the decision 
and would not attend the national convention next week he refused 
to rule out that he would resign as state party chairman 
im going to go home tonight get a good nights sleep get up 
tomorrow saddle my horse and go riding with my daughter stuckey 
said 
the two sides argued their case earlier this week amid 
allegations of death threats and complaints of strongarm tactics 
republicans failed to hold their state convention last may 
because a dispute over who could be seated as delegates disrupted 
the proceedings to the point that stuckey said he feared a riot 
would break out 
the dissidents continued the may convention and chose their own 
delegates while stuckey and other party leaders met later to elect 
delegates although all 48 georgia delegates are obligated to vote 
for bush the fight was over who will cast those votes

the population of asia topped 3 billion on 
wednesday according to united nations estimates 
the report issued by the uns asian forum of parliamentarians 
on population and development estimated that the population hit 
the 3 billion mark wednesday at 1247 am greenwich mean time 
847 pm edt tuesday 
seven babies are born every second in asia and the continent 
accounts for about 60 percent of the global population according 
to the forum which represents 19 asian countries 
the designation of a day marking the birth of the 3 billionth 
baby in asia is very symbolic said shigemi kono director of 
japans national institute of population problems but i 
personally think it is nonsense because there is no way of 
actually knowing when the 3 billionth baby was born 
among asian countries india bangladesh and pakistan face the 
most serious population growth problems kono said 
un figures show that india with 818 million people has an 
annual population growth rate of 208 percent pakistan with a 
population of 115 million has a 345 percent growth rate and the 
110 million population of bangladesh is growing at a 267 percent 
rate according to the united nations by the year 2025 asia will 
have 45 billion inhabitants according to the tokyobased asian 
population and development association roughly equal to the 
increase in the total world population from 1950 to 1980 
the world population passed the 5 billion mark in july 1987 
according to the united nations

the fbi obtained a journalists confidential notes 
indirectly through a cbs news colleague and not by breaking into 
his home in costa rica the reporter said 
tony avirgan said he learned last weekend that the fbi got the 
material indirectly through carroll dougherty of cbs 
avirgan said dougherty told him he gave copies of the notes to 
jack terrell a former mercenary who was giving the fbi information 
on alleged illegal activities connected with a private contra aid 
network and that terrell gave the fbi access to some of them 
avirgan told the boston globe that doughertys passing along of 
the material was unauthorized and unethical but dougherty said he 
thought he had avirgans permission to share it with terrell 
obviously i had no idea the material would end up in the 
hands of the fbi dougherty said he said he and avirgan were 
working together on a story in costa rica in 1985 when they shared 
their notes 
both tony and i were victimized by jack terrell who was 
working with the fbi and we had no knowledge of that he said 
dougherty said he had introduced avirgan to terrell at avirgans 
request 
i did so many things for tony dougherty said for him to 
turn around and call me unethical after i created the whole 
terrellavirgan nexus at his request i find shocking and a bit sad 
i think they needed to find a scapegoat after the first story 
about the fbi breaking in i dont think it was good enough for 
them to just say the fbi didnt break in they needed a scapegoat 
so im taking the hit 
two weeks ago the globe said 39 pages of avirgans material 
found in fbi files apparently were obtained during two breaks into 
avirgans home in costa rica 
avirgan said at the time there was no other way the material 
including notes of interviews and private memos to his editor 
could have been acquired by the fbi 
but after investigating this incident thoroughly we now 
realize that the fbi did not obtain the documents as a result of a 
breakin or any other unethical or illegal action avirgan told 
the globe 
we did suffer two breakins in 1985 and 1986 in which files 
were rifled and perhaps photocopied he said were still 
looking for an explanation of those breakins 
doughertys role was discovered last week when his handwriting 
was found on one page of the material released by the fbi the 
globe reported wednesday 
avirgan said cbs news sent dougherty to costa rica in 1985 to 
help him and his journalist wife martha honey investigate an 
assassination attempt against dissident contra leader eden pastora 
avirgan said dougherty told him last weekend that he provided 
copies of avirgans notes to terrell in exchange for terrells 
material on a private contra aid network 
terrell told the globe the material was not part of a trade 
john mattes a florida lawyer said that when terrell was 
approached by the fbi i advised terrell to cooperate fully with 
the fbi and to give them everything he had thats how cbs material 
got into their files 
greg jones a spokesman for the fbi said tuesday that fbi 
director william sessions has maintained throughout that the 
materials came to us from an individual who voluntarily provided 
them to us the fbi did not solicit the information nor did we know 
how it was obtained 
avirgan and terrell said the fbi should have followed up on 
material indicating illegal activities by members of the private 
contra aid network 
we always said we wanted the fbi to carry on our investigation 
and act on information we had uncovered avirgan said we even 
contacted the fbi in new york and they showed no interest now we 
know there is evidence of crimes sitting in their own files and 
still the fbi took no action 
the fbis field office in miami declined to release material on 
the attempted assassination of pastora because it is part of an 
investigation the globe said

radar operators watched two royal air 
force tornado jet fighters heading for a collision but couldnt 
warn them because the planes were keeping radio silence in 
simulation of wartime conditions the raf said wednesday night 
four airmen three britons and a west german trainee navigator 
were killed in the tuesday night collision while on separate 
flights in lowlevel night training exercises over the cumbrian 
hills of northwest england 
the defense ministry launched an inquiry 
rescuers on wednesday recovered the four bodies wreckage from 
the 30 million twoseater jets was scattered over a wide area 
round the village of milburn 240 miles from london 
hill rescue teams guided by helicopters with powerful lights 
searched for the victims through the night in the remote sparsely 
populated area 
fifteen members of a local branch of the round table business 
club were being shown around the raf base at spadeadam in cumbria 
as guests at the time of the collison the base operates an 
electronic warfare range against which the tornado crews test their 
skills 
the business people told wednesday how radar operators at the 
base monitored the two planes up to the moment of collison without 
being able to warn them of the impending disaster 
george beattie one of the 15 said there were two lines on 
the screen representing the planes suddenly one disappeared and 
the other changed to a dotted line which indicated a distress 
signal from that point on everyone knew something was amiss 
there was a stunned silence the only sound was the voice of a 
controller at another base trying to make contact with the two 
missing aircraft then there was nothing there was a feeling of 
shock and total disbelief among everyone 
the ministry identified the victims as three raf flight 
lieutenants pilots colin oliver and john watts and navigator 
anthony cook and west german air force lt ulrich sayer 23 who 
had been on retraining with the raf since may 
the raf said in a statement that one plane had taken off from 
the raf base at cottesmore in the english midlands piloted by 
watts an instructor at the tornado training unit there sayer was 
the navigator 
the other plane piloted by oliver with cook as navigator had 
taken off from the raf base at marham in eastern england 
accompanied by a third tornado 
the crew of the third tornado saw the collision but their craft 
was not involved unable to help they returned to marham 
a big red ball of fire came in the sky i didnt know 
whether it was the sun coming up said witness alan knell 
landlord of the village pub the stag inn 
it was just a mass of bright red and then rockets and 
flares went off and then there was another sort of explosion 
knell said in a radio interview 
he said the planes narrowly missed the pub 
the armed forces minister roger freeman said in a bbc radio 
interview lowflying training which is mostly at day with a 
small proportion at night is absolutely essential for our air 
crews 
they file a flight path with their station and it is logged 
centrally but there would be no reason why a single aircraft would 
know another military aircraft was in the vicinity 
the raf said that in simulation of wartime conditions the 
lowflying tornadoes traveling at more than 400 mph maintain radio 
silence and that the only way to avoid a collision in such 
circumstances is visually to spot the other plane coming 
the area is regularly used for such flights in which the jets 
skim a few hundred feet over hills and farm buildings practicing 
flying under radar search beams 
the accident was the 10th involving raf jets this year and 
provoked demands from lawmakers that safety measures be tightened 
the raf has 220 tornados its main fighter in service in 
britain and 165 on order 
the tornado was jointly developed and built by britain west 
germany and italy and first came into service in 1979 
last may two raf crewmen were killed in the crash of a tornado 
in west germany last may

japaneseamericans said wednesday that a 
newly signed reparations law giving 20000 each to those banished 
by the us government to internment camps during world war ii is a 
token payment but meaningful 
in our eyes todays passage of the japaneseamerican redress 
bill marks a major achievement the achievement of a measure of 
justice long denied and so long overdue said jim kajiwara a 
former internee the japaneseamerican internees and their 
families have waited a long lifetime for this vindication 
kajiwara joined several other former internees and their 
descendants at a packed news conference inside the headquarters of 
the japaneseamerican citizens league which began a campaign for 
redress 10 years ago 
the law signed wednesday by president reagan in washington also 
provides an apology and a 50 million trust fund for educational 
projects related to the 1942 mass internment of 120000 
japaneseamericans who were held in camps surrounded by barbed 
wire and armed guards 
i would like to emphasize that the 20000 awarded to each 
surviving internee must be considered a token amount only said 
former internee ben takeshita twenty thousand dollars could not 
begin to compensate a person for his or her lost freedom for the 
loss of property for the loss of livelihood for the stigma of 
disloyalty 
but the 20000 means that our government is sincere in its 
apology it is a token payment yes but it is a meaningful one 
dale minami who heads the state attorney generals asian 
pacific american advisory committee said the law confirms what 
japaneseamericans knew all along that the internees were not 
disloyal or dangerous and that there was no justification for their 
internment 
japaneseamericans did not fail the government the government 
failed japaneseamericans said minami 
this bill will restore at least some of the dignity of 
japaneseamericans he said 
the happiness and relief were echoed elsewhere 
in southern california dorothy shundo took a copy of her birth 
certificate from her purse saying her brother gave it to her when 
her family was forced to leave its west covina home 
i carried it for 45 years i hope no other group of americans 
feel they have to prove their citizenship she said 
the japaneseamericans were rounded up and sent to internment 
camps after the japanese attack on pearl harbor hawaii plunged 
the united states into world war ii about 60000 people remain 
alive and eligible for the payments

us secretary of state george shultz met 
wednesday with rodrigo borja ecuadors new president and 
criticized an antiamerican mural that hangs in the hall where the 
countrys congress meets 
shultz was among numerous international dignitaries attending 
the inauguration of borja a moderate leftist who has promised a 
nonaligned foreign policy 
the secretary was booed by part of a crowd of several hundred 
people waiting outside the congress building wednesday evening 
prior to the inauguration shultz guarded by two policemen armed 
with submachine guns had no reaction 
shultz met with borja before the inauguration and later said the 
45minute meeting was cordial and served to reaffirm the good 
relations that exist between ecuador and the united states 
we discussed our joint interests in doing everything possible 
about the narcotics problem the terrorism problem we discussed 
economic issues the debt problem shultz said 
in an apparent reference to borjas announced plans to impose 
controls on ecuadors freemarket economy shultz said 
i think that one of the things that is just crystal clear in 
the world these days is that the method of running an economy by 
central control as advocated by the left simply doesnt work 
shultz speaking to reporters after the meeting also criticized 
a huge mural hanging in the meeting hall of congress 
i have been told there is a mural and that the mural has two 
messages in it one is a message of insult to the united states and 
the other is a message about the desirability as the painter sees 
it of the programs of the far left shultz said 
the mural 30 yards long and 10 yards high is painted on the 
wall behind the speakers podium a skull with a nazi helmet that 
contains the letters cia is depicted prominently in the mural 
the highly impressionistic mural contains scenes of children 
sleeping in the street the struggles of landless peasants and many 
scenes and symbols that reflect class struggle 
shultz denied local press reports that said us officials had 
considered boycotting borjas inauguration ceremony because of the 
mural 
shultz said the mural may have been designed to cause him not to 
go to this inauguration and join in celebrating democracy 
i have come here to pay my respects to democracy and freedom 
and the rule of law shultz said this is an occasion when a 
man is inaugurated as a result of an election in the democratic 
tradition so i am here to honor that 
the mural was painted by ecuadors leading artist osvaldo 
guayasamin it was unveiled last week and immediately sparked a 
controversy because of the antiamerican symbolism 
the us embassy refused comment on local press reports that 
said us ambassador richard holwill had complained to borja whose 
democratic left party controls congress and was told by borja the 
mural was solely the responsibility of the painter 
guayasamin who says he is a leftist defended the mural in an 
interview in the quito newspaper hoy he said his mural depicted 
the political violence that is part of ecuadors history and that 
the us central intelligence agency is largely to blame for the 
violence

selectmen have turned to the state for help 
in banishing billboards featuring green dinosaurs in their long 
battle with the owner of a dinosaur footprint museum 
the board voted monday to ask the highway department to survey 
all road signs along state highways that run through the town to 
see whether they are legal 
what is this when they go surveying every sign in town 
asked carlton s nash owner of dinosaur land which has four 
billboards along routes 202 and 116 its nothing but 
harassment 
owen p jacobsen chairman of the board of selectmen said the 
request was prompted by the signs that advertise the quarry and 
dinosaur museum but said the town has not singled out dinosaur 
land 
its not only enforcement of the law but were trying to make 
our business district more presentable jacobsen said 
nash has owned the quarry for nearly a halfcentury and the 
signs have stood almost that long for 20 years or so the signs 
have also advertised what nash calls his cancer research on 
chickens 
youd be surprised the number of people who came into my shop 
this weekend and said mr nash im surprised the town is getting 
into such smallness about the signs he said 
nash maintains his signs are legal even though they are 12 feet 
too close to the road because a grandfather clause permits signs 
that were erected before local laws were changed in 1974 
but under a state law that supersedes town law there is no 
grandfather clause jacobsen said state law requires billboards to 
be 660 feet from a state highway said administrative officer 
donald kjelmyr

an 800pound man was evicted by 
forklift wednesday hoisted onto a flatbed truck and trundled off 
to a hospital as officials searched for a new home for him and his 
400pound mother 
youll be fine michael youll be fine arlene edelman 
assured her 24yearold son after their dilapidated bungalow was 
torn apart and he was extricated 
edelman secured to a mattress by leather straps and covered 
with a blue blanket replied from the truck i dont want to go 
to the hospital 
authorities had been trying since april to evict the edelmans 
from their bungalow the last one occupied in an old summer colony 
here but various legal procedures had delayed the action until 
wednesday 
the landlord ronald fish wants to redevelop the property 
edelman first entered the public eye in december when a tow 
truck was used to help him after he fell out of bed 
the eviction began about 7 am as rockland county workers tore 
down a wall of the blue house the edelmans have occupied for more 
than two years edelman who has long been confined to bed has not 
left the house in that time 
medical teams from good samaritan and nyack hospitals were on 
hand as were edelmans personal physician and the head of 
emergency room services at good samaritan 
edelman was rolled from his mattress onto a second mattress atop 
a slab of plywood on the forklift the machine lifted him onto the 
truck as neighbors friends and reporters looked on and his mother 
comforted him 
ill see you soon michael she assured him 
asked how he felt edelman said he wasnt the only homeless 
person in rockland 
he said he was reluctant to leave his mother and didnt know why 
the county department of social services hadnt been able to find 
him a new home the edelmans live on supplemental security income 
of 714 a month 
county officials spent the last several months combing through 
real estate ads and contacting 2000 real estate agents in the 
region to find a new home that can accommodate edelman 
the county has even sought property for a trailer fish agreed to 
donate but with no success 
edelman who has been getting weightloss assistance from 
exercise expert richard simmons and walter hudson the former 
1200pound long island man who has lost half his weight was 
accepted into an obesity program at downstate hospital but refused 
to be separated from his mother 
the county will house edelman at the dr robert l yeager health 
complex in pomona for a few days said county spokesman kenneth 
seltman this is very temporary said seltman he needs to be 
in a specialized program 
seltman said the cost of wednesdays eviction had not been 
tabulated 
mrs edelman 47 who weighs 400 pounds said her son would only 
be at the center for shelter for a few days 
she said she and edelmans girlfriend brenda bedell 30 would 
stay in a motel and continue to look for a place to live 
the county commissioner of social services noah weinberg said 
a landlord in garnerville had agreed to rent edelman an apartment 
but needed time to make the necessary renovations for the man and 
his mother

national mourning for arnulfo arias madrid the defiant former 
president ousted three times by military coups who died in exile in 
miami on wednesday 
the panamanian flag will be flown at half staff for eight days 
starting monday the day of mourning arias madrids family said he 
will be buried in panama city on that day when the former 
president would have turned 87 
arias madrid had been living in exile in miami and died 
wednesday of a heart attack panamanian consul roberto dominguez 
said there 
opposition leaders in panama meanwhile expressed sorrow over 
the death 
ricardo arias calderon president of the christian democratic 
party said the former president represented the figure of a 
great rebel who had a social conscience and was concerned about 
those who have less and for those who suffer more he is not 
related to arias madrid 
arias calderon ran as a vice president on arias madrids 
presidential ticket in 1984 for the opposition authenic panamanian 
party 
the government partys candidate narrowly won that election 
which the opposition labeled fraudulent many also felt the 
military stole a 1964 electoral victory from arias madrid 
arias madrid was president of panama in 194041 194951 and for 
11 days in 1968 each time he was ousted by the military 
however he continued to speak out against the defense forces 
in 1986 charging them with killing opposition leader hugo 
spadafora who had accused the government of involvement with drugs 
gen manuel antonio noriega panamas de facto ruler as head of 
the 15000member defense forces was indicted last february in 
florida on drug trafficking charges he denies the accusations 
guillermo endara undrsecretary of the panamanian authentic 
party said arias madrid was the indisputable leader of panama 
for the past 57 years 
carlos ivan zuniga president of the popular action party said 
there is no doubt that his death is going to constitute a 
tremendous uncertainty leave a vacuum a very interesting era in 
national life has closed 
the last coup against arias madrid marked the beginning of the 
militarys domination of panamas government first under gen omar 
torrijos who died in a 1981 plane crash and then by noriega 
arias madrid feared returning to panama because of his 
opposition to noriega dominguez said

president reagan signed a bill wednesday 
providing 20000 reparations to japaneseamericans interned during 
world war ii conceding that no payment can make up for those 
lost years 
at least one family among the approximately 250 veterans of the 
internment camps who attended the eightminute signing ceremony 
said no payment is necessary because of the opportunity they have 
enjoyed as americans 
reagan told the audience that tens of thousands of 
japaneseamericans lived in internment camps not for a matter of 
weeks or months but for three long years 
the bill signed by the president provides for a 20000 taxfree 
payment to each ofthe 60000 survivors among the approximately 
120000 japaneseamericans who were interned 
yet no payment can make up for those lost years reagan 
said so what is most important in this bill has less to do with 
property than with honor for here we admit a wrong 
dr walter emori 47 an arthritis specialist in medford ore 
speaking for himself and the other five members of the family who 
were interned told a reporter earlier i dont feel animosity 
and i dont feel a sense that the country owes this to me 
all six members of the family now living in california 
georgia and oregon attended the signing ceremony to dramatize 
their intention to use the money to repay the country in emoris 
words for the good that came out of the awful 
the japaneseamericans were rounded up and sent to internment 
camps after the japanese attack on pearl harbor hawaii plunged 
the united states into world war ii 
many japaneseamericans lobbied for the legislation for years 
it finally cleared congress by a 257156 vote in the house on aug 
4 
reagan originally objected to some features of the bill saying 
it would be too costly but he backed the final version it calls 
for a trust fund of 12 billion with appropriations in any one 
year limited to 500 million legislation providing the actual 
money must still be enacted 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the president always 
endorsed the purpose of the bill 
asked whether the large number of japaneseamerican voters in 
california a crucial state in the forthcoming presidential 
election was a factor in reagans decision to support the measure 
fitzwater said no that was not a factor in any way 
the internment order issued by president franklin d roosevelt 
in 1942 required all people of japanese ancestry living in 
california washington and oregon and some in hawaii to be 
relocated it affected 77000 us citizens and 43000 legal and 
illegal resident aliens they were taken to camps in western and 
southern staes 
susumu and sumi emori and their four children then living on a 
potato farm south of stockton calif were taken to a camp in 
rohwer ark 
it was a real hard experience for us said walter emori who 
was 3 years old when the family was interned 
but he added in an interview i dont feel animosity and i 
dont feel a sense that the country owes this to me i dont feel 
that and i think many japaneseamericans dont we see this as a 
healing process which says the country recognizes that a wrong was 
being done and in one small way perhaps is trying to make amends 
for this 
and we as a family would like to take this gesture the next 
step further and say wed like to give this back to the country for 
the good that came out of the awful 
for the emori family there has been a lot of good after they 
left the camp the seventhday adventist church gave the parents 
jobs at the churchaffiliated loma linda university in california

rodrigo borja a socialist who has 
promised a nonaligned foreign policy and an end to ecuadors 
freemarket economy was sworn in wednesday as ecuadors new 
president 
borja received the oath of office and presidential sash from 
wilfrido lucero president of congress 
leaders ranging from us secretary of state george shultz to 
president fidel castro of cuba were present for the ceremony 
we have received a country in moral and economic bankruptcy 
with a worrisome degradation of ethics in the highest government 
circles borja said in his inaugural speech 
he also announced an emergency economic program to combat 
ecuadors fiscal crisis but gave no details 
we cannot speak of democracy where there are impoverished 
masses forced to beg for bread in the streets or sleep beneath 
bridges borja said 
he charged that the free market economic policies of outgoing 
president leon febres cordero had fueled inflation and impoverished 
this south american nation 
you dont have to be an economist to know that it is enough 
to go to the market walk along country roads or visit shantytowns 
to feel the daily drama of poor people borja said 
castro is making his first visit to south america since he 
traveled to chile in 1971 as the guest of marxist president 
salvador allende who was ousted in a military coup two years later 
other presidents attending the inauguration wednesday night were 
oscar arias of costa rica jaime lusinchi of venezuela virgilio 
barco of colombia raul alfonsin of argentina julio sanguinetti of 
uruguay and mario soares of portugal 
president daniel ortega of nicaragua had to delay his arrival 
until thursday morning ecuador and nicaragua do not have 
diplomatic relations 
ties were broken in october 1985 by febres cordero an 
archconservative who championed free enterprise and was the reagan 
administrations closest ally in south america 
borja a 53yearold law professor who is a vice president of 
the socialist international and head of ecuadors democratic left 
party has said that one of his first official acts will be to 
restore ties with nicaragua 
shultz said he would not meet with castro us officials have 
said washington can work with borja and that he is no threat to 
democracy in ecuador 
earlier wednesday shultz met for 45 minutes with borja and said 
afterwards that the meeting was cordial 
we discussed our joint interests in doing everything possible 
about the narcotics problem the terrorism problem we discussed 
economic issues the debt problem shultz said 
ecuador a nation of 10 million people about the size of 
colorado returned to democracy in 1979 after nine years of 
civilian and military dictatorships 
in a farewell speech before the inaugural crowd febres cordero 
57 defended his four years in office in what he called ecuadors 
worst economic crisis in history 
he noted that the international price of oil which provides 60 
percent of ecuadors export earnings and half of the governments 
revenue plunged from 27 a barrel in 1984 to 8 in 1986 and has 
recovered to only 13 
ecuadors economy also was severely damaged by earthquakes that 
crippled the countrys vital oil industry for nearly six months in 
1987 he said 
ecuador lost more than 3 billion from the sinking of 
international petroleum prices and unexpected and incredibly 
destructive natural disasters he said 
febres cordero said despite the handicaps his government built 
100000 homes for the poor and 17 hospitals expanded public 
medical care and brought piped water to nearly a thousand 
communities 
he also noted his success in frustrating attempts by drug 
traffickers to make ecuador a producer of cocaine 
at the end of his twohour address febres cordero left for his 
hometown of guayaquil where his followers planned a reception 
febres cordero earlier announced that he would not personally 
turn over the presidential sash to borja who lost a bitterly 
fought election runoff to him in 1984 
borja won the presidency in may defeating populist candidate 
abdala bucaram febres cordero was not eligible for reelection 
the new president inherits a country whose economy shrank by 35 
percent in 1987 his major economic challenge will be to lower a 60 
percent inflation rate the highest in five years and create jobs 
less than half of the work force has fulltime employment 
borja says he does not plan to nationalize major industries 
because staterun enterprises are inefficient but he has pledged 
to impose controls on the economy saying a free market in a 
developing country like ecuador benefits the rich and hurts the 
poor 
he has said he will impose exchange controls restrict imports 
to save scarce dollar reserves and regulate prices of basic 
consumer goods to fight inflation 
he also plans a more restrictive foreign investment policy and a 
moratorium on foreign debt payments if creditors do not agree to 
easier terms 
febres cordero took pride in meeting payments on ecuadors 92 
billion debt but since january no payments have been made and 
ecuador is more than 1 billion in arrears

republican platform writers backed 
catastrophicillness health coverage for children wednesday but 
refused to endorse the recommendations of the presidential aids 
commission including antidiscrimination legislation 
sen lowell p weicker jr the maverick connecticut republican 
had pushed for both planks 
while endorsing the principal of catastrophic coverage for 
children the republicans shied away from any dollar commitments 
weicker won the 5330 vote after assuring fellow delegates there 
was no financial commitment involved but rather a commitment 
of spirit by this party 
angela bay buchanan former us treasurer from irvine 
calif warned that the republicans who have pilloried the 
democratic platform as deceitful might be headed down the same 
path the gop platform pledges not to raise taxes but we all 
know catastrophic coverage is going to be expensive she said 
on aids the delegates voted by voice not to endorse the 
presidential commissions report president reagan has rejected the 
commissions advice to seek new antidiscrimination legislation to 
protect aids victims 
vice president george bush who will receive the partys 
presidential nomination next week has endorsed the aids commission 
report 
our president hasnt signed off on this report said rep 
chuck lewis of california a platform cochairman 
the delegates left intact their aids plank which calls for a 
vigorous fight against the disease compassion and help for 
victims and the taking of steps to protect those who do not have 
the disease 
rich montoya of las cruces nm said the aids plank shows 
what this party is all about it shows compassion for those poor 
individuals that are afflicted with aids but it shows reason in 
protecting the vast majority of our constituents that are 
unafflicted by this disease 
earlier the platform writers endorsed the idea of a 
constitutional amendment to limit the terms of senators and members 
of the house rejected a weicker amendment to commit the party to 
preserve the small business administration and declared the party a 
champion of women as well as minorities 
the 106member platform committee was aiming for a thursday 
conclusion to drafting of the document that will be presented to 
the convention on tuesday 
going linebyline over the 30000word document crafted by its 
staff and revised by subcommittees tuesday the full committee also 
accepted an amendment by rep nancy johnson of connecticut 
promising the party will work to assure access to health care for 
all americans through public and private initiatives 
the draft sticking with the main tenets of the gops 
conservative 1984 platform includes a firm pledge not to raise 
taxes endorses constitutional amendments to ban abortion and 
balance the federal budget and calls for rapid and certain 
deployment of the strategic defense initiative 
in a plank on economic opportunity the delgates inserted 
women in the phrase the gop is the natural champion of 
blacks minorities women and ethnic americans ming chen hsu of 
westfield nj suggested the change 
polls have indicated that more women tend to favor democratic 
nominee michael dukakis over bush 
james summers of bellevue wash opposed the amendment saying 
we should no more have women in our platform than we have men 
it would be absolutely pandering to a single constituency where 
we appear according to the pollsters to be having a problem 
the delegates heatedly debated the platforms proposed hard line 
against abortion including a declaration that the unborn child 
has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be 
infringed 
they voted 5532 to reject an attempt by marjorie bell chambers 
of los alamos nm to delete the last four words 
cannot be infringed says to me that men and fetuses have a 
right to life at all times but women lost that right when they 
become pregnant said chambers 
the delegates rejected by voice a weicker amendment to support 
medicaid funding of abortion in the case of rape or incest despite 
a plea from rep johnson to recognize that rape is awful 
murder under any circumstances is also a terrible crime 
replied prolife delegate pat elf of kihei hawaii 
the committee also rejected after a perfunctory debate a 
proequal rights amendment statement sought by delawares lynn 
glaze 
the platform committee adjourned for the night after rejecting 
two weicker amendments on educating the handicapped and the rights 
of the disabled while approving a third calling for medicaid to 
cover communitybased services 
the committee had completed its draft plank on the economy and 
most of its section on family issues that left five other sections 
education agriculture energyenvironmenttransportation 
defense and foreign policy to be hammered out thursday 
weicker said were managing to win a few small victories 
earlier however he said the platform was shaping up as only 
slightly better than the partys disastrous 1984 platform 
he predicted this is the last platform hurrah believe me of 
the far right 
the republicans also released what they said was a gop staff 
estimate of how much implicit promises in the democratic platform 
will wind up costing taxpayers 431 billion in 1989 alone 
sen robert kasten said the republicans assume dukakis would end 
up embracing costly specific legislation that democrats have 
already introduced in congress

senate democrats forced their plan to aid 
nicaraguas contra rebels through the senate on wednesday but 
failed to tempt president reagan and senate republicans to join 
them in a bipartisan coalition and defuse what could become an 
explosive electionyear issue 
the 4947 largely partyline vote approved the democratic 
package which provides 27 million in nonlethal humanitarian 
aid to the contras and establishes a process by which congress 
could approve the release of 163 million in stockpiled arms to 
the contras later this year 
voting for it were sen lloyd bentsen dtexas the democratic 
vice presidential candidate and 48 other democrats no republican 
voted in the majority voting against the package were four 
democrats and 43 republicans 
revival of contra aid has yet to be taken up in the house where 
democrats have an even larger majority the senate package is to be 
attached to a defense appropriations measure already passed by the 
house and it will be up to a conference committee to decide how to 
deal with the issue before it ultimately comes up again in both the 
senate and the house when the conference report is considered 
the partisan nature of the senate vote also marked the failure 
of a long period of negotiations aimed at forming a broad 
bipartisan coalition behind usnicaraguan policy 
sen david boren dokla called the vote a tragically missed 
opportunity 
no matter how many miles one walks you still cant get some 
people to agree said senate majority leader robert c byrd 
dwva in a bitter and angry speech moments before the vote 
you can inscribe your name in blood on a shaft of marble and 
they still wont believe you byrd said of his attempts to 
convince republicans that democrats were sincere in pursuing a 
process that could lead to the resumption of arms shipments to the 
contras 
they wont listen to reason he said they are suspicious 
of everybody they are paranoid i cant understand that kind of 
person in the united states senate 
byrd said he had expected a signal by the white house accepting 
the democratic plan after the 5739 defeat of a rival proposal 
offered by senate republican leader bob dole of kansas which would 
have made immediately available 163 million in stockpiled and 
already authorized military aid available to the contras 
im sick and tired of a white house that has no steel in its 
guts byrd said 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater expressed regret over 
defeat of the dole amendment but said that the administration 
subseqently indicated that the byrd amendment was minimally 
acceptable in light of our judgment of the best interests of the 
freedom fighters 
we hope that this legislation which now goes to conference 
with the house can be improved to provide effective support for 
the freedom fighters in nicragua he said a viable resistance 
remains essential to the cause of freedom and democracy in central 
america 
republican senators speaking immediately before the vote said 
the entire directorate of the contra insurgents oppose the 
democratic package because they believe it would never result in 
new military aid 
its time to go back to the drawing board and find a real 
package of contra aid which will be effective and not a fig leaf 
which will lead the contras to despair and defeat said sen john 
mccain rariz 
this is one of those times when you cant reach bipartisan 
consensus dole told the senate 
noting that many of those voting for the democratic plan have 
opposed contra aid in the past dole said there are some of us 
on this side of the aisle who look at some of those who are about 
to vote for contra aid with disbelief and skepticism 
accusing the democrats of using their contraaid plan as a big 
umbrella political cover in this presidential election year 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas urged support of his 
proposal to bring the contras new military aid 
i think this is a lineinthesand vote dole said it is 
a vote on whether you want to send effective military aid to the 
contras or not 
byrd urged republican support for his rival democratic proposal 
with its builtin guarantees against a filibuster as the only 
approach that has a chance of actually getting aid to the contras 
the byrd plan supported by an unusally broad democratic 
coalition of contraaid supporters and opponents provides no new 
military aid for the contras 
but it sets the terms for a possible second house and senate 
vote this fall which could release 163 million of stockpiled and 
previously authorized arms aid to the contras 
this approach keeps the options open and on a fast track 
byrd told the senate i hope my amendment will receive bipartisan 
support and send a signal to the nicaraguan government in the 
strongest possible way 
byrd had threatened to cut short a longscheduled summer recess 
and reconvene the senate immediately after next weeks republican 
national convention in new orleans if prolonged debate prevented 
action on his contraaid plan this week 
its absolutely silly to remain obstinate he said this 
amendment provides something without it the contras get nothing 
nothing 
but republicans complained that the byrd plan is unworkable and 
cannot guarantee that aid can actually be delivered to contra 
forces inside nicaragua they said that postponing the decision 
whether to rearm the contras may doom them as an effective fighting 
force against nicaraguas leftist sandinista government 
the byrd plan which was offered as an amendment to a defense 
department appropriations bill would provide 27 million in 
nonlethal humanitarian aid to the contras after current funds run 
out on oct 1 it also would provide 5 million in medical help to 
the innocent civilian victims of the war in nicaragua 
the plan also calls for accelerated votes later this year with 
a 10hour limit on debate to release the 163 million in 
previously authorized military aid if president reagan certifies 
that nicaragua has created an emergency in central america that 
threatens the existence of the contras 
it bars the central intelligence agency or the defense 
department from delivering the aid and directs the agency for 
international development aid to do the job 
doles rival plan offered as an amendment to another spending 
bill would provide the 27 million in nonlethal aid and also 
release the stockpiled arms immediately 
at one time dole also had been proposing 20 million in 
immediate military aid but revised that prior to the vote on his 
amendment to settle for immediately release of the 163 million 
stockpile

a group of black ministers said wednesday it 
has called on the american civil liberties union to fight a new 
police policy of randomly stopping and questioning black teenagers 
the policy was instituted by chief marti felker last month in an 
attempt to stop racial violence in the old west end a racially 
mixed neighborhood 
we consider the police chiefs directive at the very least 
insensitive and provacative and at the very most racist and 
unconstitutional said the rev floyd rose pastor of the family 
baptist church 
it is for this very reason that we have requested that the 
aclu file suit in federal court to enjoin the mayor the city 
manager and the police chief from enforcing what we consider an 
unconstitutional directive he said wednesday at a news 
conference 
harland britz general counsel for the aclus toledo office 
said the policy appears to violate constitutional protections 
against illegal search and seizure he said the aclu would look 
into the matter 
city manager philip hawkey declined comment until he had a 
chance to review the policy 
the ministers planned to meet with felker to discuss the issue 
rose who also is director of the coalition for economic justice 
said the ministers want the chief to rescind the order 
felker in a july 8 letter to leaders of the old west end 
association said he instructed deputy chief richard kwiatkowski to 
pay special attention to groups of black juveniles in the 
neighborhood 
officers are to stop and identify these youths so that in the 
event an occurrence does take place investigators will have the 
names of the juveniles to work on felker said 
his order resulted from complaints by old west end residents 
who recorded three violent incidents involving black youths 
felker has defended his action saying it was used two years ago 
to stop whites from harassing blacks on the citys south end civil 
rights leaders said while police watched white teenagers in 1986 
they never stopped them 
the interdominational ministerial alliance which includes 
ministers from a variety of church congregations here has asked 
the us justice department to investigate claims of a conspiracy 
against black officials in toledo 
they claim that local media and officials have conspired to 
treat blacks differently than whites most notably by firing one 
city employee and disciplining two others for alleged mismanagement 
of a city housing program 
about 17 percent of the citys 340000 residents are black

former actor ben jones chosen by georgia democratic voters for 
a rematch against a republican congressman said wednesday his 
challenge is to avoid being tagged a liberal in southern illinois 
a democrat who retained a vacant house seat for his party turned to 
campaigning to win it again in november 
jones 47 who played a mechanic on the dukes of hazzard 
television series said he will take the high road in the fall 
campaign after defeating two rivals in tuesdays primary for the 
right to oppose republican rep pat swindall 
theyre going to use the l word as much as possible to keep 
from engaging their brains said jones who won 47 percent of the 
vote in a 1986 contest with the conservative congressman 
in illinois democrat jerry costello won a special election for 
the 4 months left in the us house term of rep mel price who 
died in april at age 83 costello chairman of the st clair county 
board is scheduled to be sworn in thursday in washington 
republican robert gaffner a community college administrator 
lost by a 514 to 486 percent margin tuesday but can look forward 
to a rematch with costello in november he said he was disappointed 
but not discouraged maintaining the closeness of the contest 
demonstrates costellos vulnerability 
in georgias 4th congressional district jones won 62 percent of 
the vote against lawyer nick moraitakis 21 percent and theater 
executive john stemblers 17 percent to capture the democratic 
nomination without a runoff 
swindall who was unopposed for the gop nomination is widely 
believed to be facing an uphill reelection battle following his 
admission that he considered accepting laundered drug money to 
finance the expensive home he built 
the congressman said tuesday night he thought the districts 
voters would put questions over the loan in perspective and 
decide the race on the basis of political philosophy jones he 
said is an acknowledged liberal pat swindall is a 
conservative 
georgia democratic voters also nominated david worley a 
29yearold lawyer to challenge republican rep newt gingrich 
gingrich challenged worley tuesday night to an extensive series of 
debates saying he intended to show voters that organized labor and 
the democratic establishment in washington were helping finance 
worley in retaliation for gingrichs attack on the financial 
dealings of us house speaker jim wright 
eight of georgias 10 congressmen won renomination without 
opposition in the primary election both of those opposed were 
victorious 
colorado had primaries in six congressional districts but 
almost no tight races so voter turnout possibly as low as 10 
percent of registered voters was atrocious said state 
democratic party chairman buie seawell 
exact figures were unavailable but calling the turnout poor 
would be sort of the understatement of the decade said 
secretary of state natalie meyer 
in the contest that generated the most interest republicans in 
a suburban district that includes boulder county chose state rep 
david bath over former secretary of state mary estill buchanan who 
lost to gary hart in the 1980 senate race

this countrys powerful military 
three times overthrew former president arnulfo arias madrid but it 
unwittingly turned him into a national symbol of democratic 
aspirations 
the 86yearold former president who died wednesday in exile in 
miami ran for president again just four years ago he was the top 
contender in the countrys first presidential election in 16 years 
ricardo arias calderon the president of the christian 
democratic party said wednesday we feel a little orphaned by 
his death 
arias became the symbol of our nations claim to have a 
civilian government in a democracy he said the two men are not 
related 
nicolas ardito barletta won the 1984 presidential elections 
defeating arias by a margin of 1713 votes out of about 640000 
ballots cast the count took place behing closed doors 
when the official tally was released arias supporters cried 
fraud and foreign diplomats also questioned the results 
demonstrators clashed with police and dozens were injured 
arias spent most of the last 12 months in miami while panama 
was undergoing a severe political and economic crisis 
gen manuel antonio noriega the countrys de facto ruler as 
head of the defense forces was indicted last february by a grand 
jury in florida and the united states has been applying strong 
diplomatic and economic pressure to force him to resign and leave 
the country 
persistent rumors over the past six months that arias would soon 
return to panama appeared to invigorate his authentic panamanian 
party however younger people had taken over the party and he 
played no active role in the oppositions efforts to force 
noriegas resignation 
a close aide of arias said before the 1984 election that he had 
tried to convince the harvardeducated physician not to run for 
president because of his age 
i couldnt convince him because somebody from the national 
guard now called the defense forces had called him in december to 
say that he wasnt acceptable as a candidate nobody can tell the 
doctor what to do and after that call there was no stopping him 
said the aide speaking on condition of anonymity 
the winner ardito barletta was the militarys choice but he 
held office only 11 months before he was pressured to resign 
his vice president eric arturo delvalle was moved into the top 
office he served from september 1985 until last february when he 
tried to fire noriega and the general had him replaced too 
born aug 15 1901 in penonomee a small town about 90 miles 
west of panama city arias had been active in panamanian politics 
since 1931 
he frequently tangled with the military which overthrew him in 
1941 1951 and 1968 of his three fouryear terms the military let 
him stay in office only a total 2 years in 1968 he lasted only 
11 days 
in addition to claiming victory in the 1984 election his 
supporters said he won in 1964 
his brief terms in office were characterized by nationalistic 
fervor aimed mainly at the powerful us presence here in later 
years he toned down the rhetoric and said he was a friend of the 
united states 
a staunch anticommunist arias said in an interview before the 
1984 election that he had not sought the support of the reagan 
administration because i dont want to seem like an instrument 
of american initiatives 
he said central american communists arent interested in the 
wars in guatemala nicaragua or el salvador but in obtaining 
control of the panama canal 
two of his major accomplishments while in office were to give 
women the vote in 1940 and create a social security system 
his reaction to his overthrow in 1941 became legend 
you fellow party members fulfilled your obligation i as 
president fulfilled mine these are traitors he said of the 
military as he left the presidential offices we will return 
his periods of exile including four years after the 1941 
overthrow turned the words we will return into a slogan 
arias was to be buried in panama city on monday it would have 
been his 87th birthday

attorneys in a lawsuit over liberaces 
will accused each other of introducing sleaze into the trial 
wednesday as they delved into the private lives of the entertainer 
and his associates 
the exchange came as former liberace valet and houseman george 
llinares of palm springs calif recounted his years of service 
with liberace who died feb 4 1987 of complications of aids 
llinares at one point testified that housekeeper dorothy mcmahon 
had a very close relationship with cary james liberaces 
companion the last six years of his life 
james and ms mcmahon are two of five plaintiffs in a lawsuit 
that seeks to have beverly hills calif lawyer joel strote 
removed as executor of liberaces vast estate 
harold gewerter the attorney for the five objected frequently 
as defense lawyer john oreilly questioned llinares about the 
relationship between james ms mcmahon and liberace 
llinares said ms mcmahon used to cover up for james and 
scott thorson liberaces former companion 
when they went out she would tell him they had gone shopping 
or something he said i reminded her she should remember who 
she worked for 
llinares said ms mcmahon and james were very close and 
would lock themselves in a room for an hour 
gewerter objected vigorously saying the questioning was getting 
downright sleazy 
oreilly responded that he was simply following up on issues 
raised when the plaintiffs presented their case earlier this summer 
james and ms mcmahon were visibly upset by the questioning and 
the housekeeper walked down the hall sobbing loudly during a 
morning break 
strote also appeared agitated during the session and left the 
courtroom before the break 
angie liberace the sister of the late entertainer and one of 
the plaintiffs bowed her head and sobbed when llinares claimed 
that liberace didnt want her around his house 
at one point state district judge michael wendell lectured the 
attorneys saying im interested in one thing should joel 
strote be removed as executor im not interested in personalities 
not interested in morals were getting far afield 
under crossexamination llinares admitted he had written a book 
about liberace and was trying to find a publisher he said he 
worked for liberace twice from 1975 to 1977 and 1979 to 1984 
llinares said he quit dec 29 1984 in a huff because he wanted 
to go to france to see his family he said the parting was bitter 
and he told liberace god will make you pay for that 
llinares testified that liberace referred to strote as mr 
fixit because of his legal expertise and often said thank god 
for joel strote 
plaintiffs in the case contend liberace was too ill to 
understand a new will and trust he signed 13 days before he died 
making strote executor of his estate and head of the liberace 
foundation for the performing arts 
those filing the suit contend that strote has taken excessive 
fees as head of the foundation but testimony tuesday indicated 
that the assets of the liberace estate had climbed from 14 million 
to 18 million under his guidance

united farm workers leader cesar chavez 
persisted wednesday for a 25th day of a wateronly fast the same 
length of time he went without food in 1968 to gain recognition of 
his union 
the 61yearold chavez remained bedridden but in stable 
condition wednesday as he picked up support from two officials of 
other unions representing nearly 3 million workers 
chavez says he is fasting to promote a consumer boycott of 
california table grapes whose growers refuse to sign union 
contracts and use pesticides he says endanger field workers and 
their families 
cesar has raised the ante he has made us feel ashamed said 
gerald mcentee president of the 1 millionmember american 
federation of state county and municipal employees he promised to 
urge members to hit the streets and support the fouryearold 
boycott 
cesar chavez in the minds of many of us represents the soul of 
the american labor movement said jack henning 
secretarytreasurer of the 19million member california labor 
federation 
henning acknowleged the boycott hasnt taken hold even in 
california but said the public is beginning to realize the 
sacrifice by chavez and his message 
the implementation of a boycott in the long term is not an 
easy task we have a renewal here through cesars fast said 
henning 
hollywood stars and children of the late sen robert f kennedy 
have traveled to delano in recent weeks to publicize the boycott 
but these visits and the ensuing publicity have had a negligible 
effect on california table grape sales according to state 
regulators and a california grocers association official

marco polo observed it 700 years ago 
genteel englishwomen were said to have fainted at the sight of it 
today it is a 500 millionayear business in india 
it is the ancient custom of chewing paan or betel pepper 
leaf it is the most visible indian habit millions across the 
country relentlessly chew the conicalshaped leaf and spit out its 
reddish residue 
the paan leaf is wrapped betel nut quicklime and a score of 
other flavorings geared to individual tastes some are mildly 
narcotic 
the practice gives many indian taxi drivers bright red grins 
leaves unsightly splotches on streets sidewalks and other public 
places and sometimes upsets tourists when the stream of betel 
juice comes too close 
from the humblest hut to palaces of former maharajas paan is 
part of indian life elegant hostesses serve coffee and cigars 
after dinner but reserve paan for the finale 
no indian meal is complete without a paan it would be like 
having dinner in paris without wine said bk jha a 66yearold 
journalist and paan connoisseur who has been chewing if for 50 
years 
paan has become an essential accessory to the indian life 
associated with leisure valor cuisine and ritual 
indeed paan is among the few things that seem to bind rather 
than divide india where adherents of the seven recognized 
religions and speakers of the 16 official languages are often at 
odds 
for addicts paan can be an allday habit but it is normally 
taken after meals 
in an indian home after a rich meal a guest is offered his or 
her choice of sada plain mitha sweet and tamaku 
which has a narcotic stimulant 
flavorings include camphor cardamom clove coconut cinnamon 
saffron nutmeg almond melon seeds and aniseed about 12 
different types of stimulants or tobaccos can be added 
a firstclass paan can have a vark a layer of beaten silver 
or gold on the leaf that adds a touch of beauty and is chewed with 
the other contents 
custom demands that you pop the full paan into your mouth and 
spit the first juice out depending on the quality it takes from 
two minutes to half an hour to finish one paan 
in homes cuspidors are provided for guests but since by custom 
the cuspidor is ornamental the first reddish gush is exuded on the 
road outside 
om prakash lalwani runs indias bestknown paan shop the prince 
paan bhandar in old delhi he took over from his father who opened 
the shop as a refugee from pakistan in 1949 the shop now sells 
paan to more than 5000 people a day and has a staff of 50 who 
travel across india to set up special stalls at marriages birth 
ceremonies and funerals 
paan is priced according to the contents and which of the 35 
varieties of leaf is used the most famous leaf is the benarsi 
named for the hindu holy city of benares and said to be kept buried 
for months to eliminate any raw taste 
the cheapest paan at lalwanis shop sells for 14 cents and the 
deluxe beatengold variety for 175 
lalwani says he can wrap a paan to last up to 48 hours and has 
customers who take them as gifts to friends in europe and the 
united states 
in a more ordinary shop paan can cost as little as 30 paise 2 
cents 
altogether paan cultivation marketing and sales provide 
employment to 5 million indians 
now too there is packaged paan which comes in foil envelopes 
and is advertised in newspapers and magazines in much the same way 
as cigarette ads elsewhere the government issues warnings though 
not on the package that paan can cause mouth cancer 
it doesnt seem to stop indians however 
even some foreign visitors try it a far cry from the days when 
british gentlewomen were said to have fainted at the first sight of 
a paan chewer mistaking the red spittle for blood 
it is not clear how and when paan came to india some say it was 
brought in spiceladen boats from southeast asia in ad 300 betel 
is chewed in other parts of asia but the ritual approach is 
indias own 
references to paan are found in hindu scriptures 
in the 13th century the venetian traveler marco polo visited 
kayal now madurai in southern india and wrote all the people 
of this city as well as the rest of india have a custom of 
perpetually keeping in their mouth a certain leaf 
in the 18th century an anonymous sanskritlanguage poet noted 
that paan has 13 qualities unobtainable even in heaven 
that thought may be behind the practice in eastern india where 
a paan is placed in the mouth of the dead before the funeral pyre 
is lighted so the departed soul can travel to heaven chewing

as more us hispanics add vcrs to their 
televisions theyre being wooed by everything from spanish 
versions of american films like missing in action to 
videocassettes on amnesty simplified 
every month an average of 200 hispanic video movies were 
released last year according to lomberto perez publisher of 
miamis bilingual video vision magazine some were dubbed some 
were subtitled some had original spanishlanguage soundtracks 
with a lower median income than the national norm hispanics 
were once seen as a poor market for technical gadgets but about 
half of us hispanic homes have vcrs according to strategy 
research corporation that approaches the national average of 56 
percent 
the latinos rent more because we have larger families said 
rafael rivera of condor video with a line of 300 spanishlanguage 
videos to take the family to see a movie at 6 apiece youre 
talking about 50 a night by the time they pay for the ticket and 
buy popcorn 
but if they can rent a few movies at a dollar or two apiece 
they can have their popcorn and entertainment at home said 
rivera he said hispanics typically select tapes as a family with 
youngsters often preferring englishlanguage cassettes while 
spanishlanguage videos are favored by adults 
these patterns plus the fact that the hispanic population is 
increasing faster than the overall american population are sending 
video manufacturers distributors and outlets scrambling to dub 
subtitle produce transfer rent or sell videos targeted to 
hispanics 
the golden opportunity for profits in the hispanic video 
market was discussed in a session on hispanic videos fiesta or 
siesta at the recent video software dealers association 
convention in las vegas at last years meeting the seminar was 
titled se habla dollars 
hispanic tapes run the gamut from music videos starring julio 
iglesias and other top latin stars to spanish versions of such 
popular englishlanguage movies as ironweed and et 
other titles include spanish and english video flash cards to 
help children learn math lucha libre cassettes of wrestling 
matches and the amnesty simplified tape featuring stepbystep 
instructions in english or spanish for illegal residents seeking 
amnesty without an attorney 
but most of the taped fare is movies about 75 percent of them 
from spain or latin america rivera said us releases dubbed or 
subtitled in spanish account for the rest 
generally the most popular movies are action adventure and 
comedy said david quintero vice president of videovisa a 
mexicanowned company selling videos in both countries american 
films with subtitles are the most popular in mexico in the united 
states its original mexican productions 
videovisa has about 300 films mostly mexican movies available 
in the united states and hopes to build its stock to 750 three to 
seven films are released a month usually a mix of action romance 
comedy and terror to give a little of everything for the 
public quintero said 
with the new focus on vcrs owned by hispanics theres increased 
competition to tie up us rights to spanishlanguage productions 
and get them to the viewers 
video pirates have also discovered the hispanic market and are 
offering discount illegal copies of tapes in spanish 
the pirates on any given title are selling between 2000 and 
3000 copies said condors rivera he said the illegal copies 
sold by trunkers out of car trunks or through retail outlets 
are sold at 20 to 35 just before his tapes go on the market at 
50 
if the hispanic video market is doing 30 million to 40 
million a year they could double that without the piracy 
problem said rivera added videovisas quintero the market is 
growing unfortunately its growing much more for the pirates than 
for us

god usually gets some polite nods at american 
political conventions but an oldtimer of the candidatecrowning 
powwows says he detects a stronger religious element this time 
around 
there was more of a spiritual tone at the democratic 
convention and i think well also see it at the republical 
convention says evangelist billy graham a convention regular 
since midcentury 
as he has done at every democratic and republican national 
convention over the last 36 years graham will be offering prayers 
at next weeks republican affair as he did for the democrats in 
july 
i never go to one without the other he said in telephone 
interview from buffalo ny where he wound up a heavily attended 
crusade last sunday in that mostly roman catholic city 
i always stay neutral politically and im going to be neutral 
this time he said i wont tell who im voting for and im not 
endorsing anybody thats the reason i go to both conventions 
graham 69 a personal friend and unofficial chaplain to the 
countrys seven presidents since 1952 attributed the increased 
spiritual note at the democratic convention to the influence of 
black delegates 
the black people made a great impression on white delegates as 
dignified highly educated and they love the lord he said 
they came out of the churches these black people made a 
spiritual impact 
he said that unlike some past conventions when delegates would 
walk around and talk during prayers the crowd this time would 
all stand and it would be so quiet you could hear a pin drop 
at one point he said he watched a network television reporter 
trying to question the rev jesse jackson on the floor during the 
benediction but jackson deflected the reporters questions 
saying were praying now 
jackson bowed his head while african methodist episcopal bishop 
frederick c james led the benediction refusing to continue the 
interview until the prayer was finished graham said 
while jackson the secondrunning democratic candidate gave a 
rousing address in gospelpreaching style to the democrats another 
alsoran minister pat robertson was to address the republicans 
im happily surprised for clergymen to be addressing both 
conventions graham said its healthy for there to be more 
recognition of spiritual life whenever people gather 
at the republican convention graham is to lead a prayer monday 
night when president reagan finishes his address and will sit with 
the george bush family on the closing night when he gives his 
acceptance speech 
theyre both longtime friends graham said noting that he 
had spent a dozen nights at the white house in reagans presidency 
and regularly spent part of his vacation in maine with bush 
besides leading prayers graham said hed also be going to 
various receptions at the convention just as he did at the 
democratic convention including a luncheon for governors where he 
sat with democratic candidate michael dukakis 
he was very warm and friendly graham said 
at one reception given by veteran democratic party leader robert 
strauss graham said that as he was leaving strauss followed him 
into the hall and said when you get ready to go to heaven let 
me know i want to go with you 
graham said that while avoiding partisan politics he tries to 
do as much for one party as the other and he urges christians to 
become involved in the political process regardless of which 
candidate or party they support 
of his just ended crusade in buffalo 70 percent roman 
catholics graham said he had received wonderful support from 
catholics as well as mainline protestant bodies and black churches 
people really came out in numbers he said more came 
forward to receive christ per capita than ive seen anywhere in 
america 
he said the buffalo crusade was part of a new york regional 
drive with campaigns over the next six months in rochester 
hamilton ontario syracuse long island and albany 
before his buffalo crusade graham had been abroad for 16 weeks 
first with his wife ruth in china where she was born daughter of 
a missionary doctor and then in the soviet union for celebrations 
of the 1000th anniversary of christianity in russia 
to see television filled with religion for 10 days stunned the 
soviet people he said it was the first time many of them 
realized their roots were in christianity

a 5yearold california native is the 
best termite detector on the job and one of the best allaround 
workers at a city pest extermination company his boss says 
every morning darryll dons a red collar imprinted with the 
words termite dog while his handler pulls on a white lab coat 
then man and beagle head for a house factory or other building to 
let darryll have a sniff at the woodworkcrawling critters 
darryll got local attention in a rapmusic commercial a few 
months ago that featured puppets praising the dogs skills and his 
portrait graces the companys yellow pages advertisement 
darryll is leased from tadd services of belmont calif for 
30000 for two years said dave pontes general manager of new 
england pest control tadd stands for termite ant detection dog 
tadd services begins training puppies at 8 weeks old and sends 
them to their first jobs when they are eight to 10 months old 
tadd services has 6070 termitesniffing dogs in the united 
states but our dog darryll is the only dog in new england 
pontes said 
so far darryll who has been with new england pest control 
nearly 4 years has never failed to detect a termite in a wood 
boring inspection pontes said 
when a human does an inspection theyre only guaranteed by 
what they can see pontes said and company officials are quick 
to explain that to their customers 
but with darryll we guarantee the house from the basement 
right through the ceiling pontes said he finds termites with 
a sense of smell and hearing i would say in the four years we have 
had him hes done 3500 inspections 
darrylls expertise does not come cheap the company charges a 
minimum of 125 per building customers pay a starting price of 70 
per building for human inspectors pontes said 
new england pest control has a 1 million errorsandomissions 
insurance policy for darryll as well as a 25000 life insurance 
policy pontes said 
when darryll is 8 pontes said he will be sent back to 
california deprogrammed then returned to rhode island and given 
to handler clarence cornell as a pet 
darryll currently stays with cornell at his coventry home along 
with cornells two shetland ponies three cats and another dog

buried in the prison landscape of concrete cell 
blocks watch towers and barbed wire fences is a building warmed by 
the smell of a staple of life freshly baked bread 
welcome to the bakery at the states richard j donovan 
correctional facility where 50 inmates produce 1500 loaves a day 
of white and wheat bread to help feed the 2821 prisoners 
dont tell them prison officials this but id work for 
free just to pass the time said inmate mike warner who is 
making 25 cents an hour as a lead dough man he helps oversee 
the initial creative stage the mixing of the dough to make the 
bread 
i wanted to come in here and benefit myself more said john 
briseno of bakersfield who works as a dough mixer i can learn 
more about being a baker so i can look for a bakers job when i get 
out 
briseno who has 2 years left to serve on a robbery conviction 
said the money he makes as a prison baker allows him to buy 
toothpaste shampoo and cards to send to my mother 
warner convicted of attempted murder eight years ago is 
counting on his bakery and supervisory experience to help him set 
up a business when he gets out of prison 
my mom and i are planning to open a restaurant when i get out 
in 28 months said warner who is from san diego 
george ford ii of los angeles who has served three months of a 
threeyear sentence for armed robbery worked in the prisons 
canteen and laundry before switching to the bakery when it went 
into operation may 2 
ford who works around the bakerys 43footlong oven making 
sure the bread cooks properly and workers abide by safety rules 
said tony angelini the civilian baker overseeing the inmates 
work has been an inspiration to me hes teaching me how to be 
the best oven man there is 
the blending of yeast and flour still intrigues ford who said 
he never knew the inner workings of bread 
im used to going to the supermarket and there it was he 
said 
the bakery is an operation of the department of corrections 
prison industry authority which still oversees the manufacture of 
license plates using inmate labor but increasingly exposes 
prisoners to varied occupations that they can use upon release 
we can offer these men the skills that will make them a viable 
part of society when they get out said mario luque a production 
manager for the authority at the san diego prison 
still each inmate must make an individual commitment its 
like leading a horse to water luque said 
products made by the authority are by law sold only to 
taxsupported agencies we dont compete with the public luque 
said 
but state county and local governments save millions of dollars 
each year by purchasing authority goods said carlos chavez the 
authority administrator at the san diego prison 
the prison bakery for instance sells the bread to the state 
for 465 cents a loaf well under the going rate on the open 
market officials plan to add a second shift of 50 inmatebakers 
and to expand production to 20000 loaves a day along with 
hamburger and hotdog buns and rolls the expanded bakery will 
supply breads to four other state prisons said chavez 
the prison authority is developing other enterprises at the san 
diego prison which opened about a year ago from an optical 
laboratory producing prescription and safety glasses to a textile 
mill making inmate clothing 
the authoritys jobs are the most desirable to inmates because 
they pay by the hour giving prisoners a chance to make a little 
more money than they would if they worked for the state in a 
kitchen prison fire department or yard cleanup job at a flat 
monthly rate 
plus for each day they work here they get a day off their 
sentence angelini said 
the authority which employs 42 percent of the inmates 
statewide starts its workers at 25 cents an hour for a monthlong 
probationary period the inmates work a minimum 30hour week and 
their pay can escalate in 5cent increments to a maximum of 90 
cents an hour 
the pay and conditions are so good as compared to other 
prison jobs that nobody wants to mess it up warner said when 
asked how the prison bakers got along with one another on the job 
chavez added the prison industry authority is designed to 
eliminate idleness among inmates to keep them working in the 
prison environment idleness is your no 1 concern

when people receive a financial windfall the 
standard advice is simple put the money in some safe parking place 
and take your time deciding what you want to do with it 
that principle is sound advisers on matters of personal finance 
agree in cases where you hit the lottery or receive an unexpected 
inheritance 
but it is less helpful on the much more common occasions when 
people get what is known as lumpsum distributions from a 
pension or profitsharing plan 
by law you have just 60 days to decide whether to keep the 
money and pay taxes on the proceeds or to stash it in a 
rollover individual retirement account 
and that 60day limit is ironclad in a recent case the 
internal revenue service said it couldnt make an exception for a 
taxpayer whose check was written on time but not deposited because 
of a clerical error at a bank 
taxpayers wishing to make taxfree ira rollovers must be alert 
and make certain that the 60day rule is satisfied observed the 
accounting firm of deloitte haskins amp sells 
lumpsum distributions can occur in any one of several 
circumstances for example if you retire or leave one employer 
where you are vested in the pension plan for another job 
a distribution may also crop up through no act of your own 
volition if say your employer is acquired by another company and 
the organization being taken over terminates its retirement plan 
for whatever reason lets suppose you have a check for 50000 
coming there are probably lots of uses you could think of for that 
money right away but you should bear in mind that you wont get to 
keep all of it 
as the investment firm of shearson lehman hutton points out in a 
recently published booklet on the subject your lump sum is 
included in your ordinary income and subject to tax at your 
ordinary income tax rates 
remember the amount of your distribution can push you into a 
higher bracket 
furthermore if the distribution incurs a 10 percent penalty for 
withdrawal before age 59 as some retirement savings programs do 
you could wind up owing as much as 22500 of the total to uncle 
sam 
there are ways to reduce the tax bill by using special rates 
available to people who reached the age of 50 before jan 1 1986 
the year a sweeping tax bill curtailed those benefits 
if you plan to avail yourself of those special rates you may 
well want to consult a professional adviser the rules on special 
tax treatment get very complicated and for every rule theres an 
exception shearson says 
people of any age can avoid current taxes by rolling the 
distribution over into an individual retirement account within the 
60day limit 
if youre relatively young that means tying the money up it 
also however keeps your retirement planning intact 
if youre 59 years of age or older you can tap the rollover 
ira whenever you want to incurring taxes at ordinary income rates 
only on the amount you withdraw 
unlike conventional iras which limit annual contributions to 
2000 per worker a rollover ira can be started with any amount 
like conventional iras rollover accounts offer the allure of 
taxfree compounding of interest dividends or capital gains 
if you become aware of an impending lumpsum distribution 
financial advisers say it makes sense to do as much planning as 
possible in advance 
if the check arrives on short notice they add theres no need 
to panic but you should start weighing your options without delay

get set to hear more and more about higher 
prices taxes and interest rates as the popular mood descends into 
another of its blue funks 
while sociologists know more about such phenomena than do 
economists even the most inexperienced observer can spot when a 
mood change is about take place 
the onset of a blue mood originates in bright times and seems 
to come almost as a consequence it is an overreaction that seems 
unable to stop itself until it goes to an extreme whence a 
brighter mood develops 
the newest blue mood follows a short period of 
selfcongratulation during which americans praised the strength of 
their economy which not only shook off a big stock market crash 
but showed unexpected strength 
as moods brightened stock forecasters raised their sights and 
economists declared thered be no recession this year fear of the 
twin trade and budget deficits seemed to abate people bought cars 
and houses 
the federal reserves most recent lightning bolt an increase of 
the discount rate to 65 percent from 6 percent officially ended 
the mood and perhaps economic growth as well but the clouds had 
been forming for weeks 
on aug 5 the bureau of labor statistics announced strong job 
growth for july immediately it was interpreted as an indicator of 
inflationary pressures the reasoning being that wages would rise 
sharply in pursuit of fewer workers 
relatively unnoticed was a notation by commissioner janet 
norwood that jobmarket tightness could have been exaggerated by 
methodology problem or an earlier conference board message that 
the labor market seemed to be loosening good news for all those 
still concerned about the economy overheating 
when the mood turns it does so sharply 
fortune magazine ran a cover story that advised the presidential 
candidates to stop kidding the public about taxes because 
everyody knows that for the deficit to come down taxes must go 
up 
industry week magazine matched it with a story on the next tax 
bite where and how big it contends that like it or not 
analysts expect the next administration to implement new taxes 
said the ruff times whether our next president is michael 
dukakis or george bush youll get higher taxes 
when the mood descends it spreads out enveloping everything 
after the fed raised the discount rate securities analysts 
rushed out new mainly negative views economists revised mainly 
downward forecasts of the expansions durability confidence fled 
good news became bad 
all reasons to expect the worst about inflation taxes and 
interest rates were exploited the weather for example was 
blamed a newspaper story related that july heat hurt retailers 
beside a chart depicting july sales gains by top stores that ranged 
from 27 percent jc penney amp co inc to 30 percent walmart 
stores inc 
theres no doubt in my mind its inevitable there will be tax 
increases in 1989 a magazine quotes a businessman 
perhaps true because that is the way of taxes throughout the 
1980s tax increases precede and follow tax cuts 
but is it really true that prices interest rates and the 
general economy are all headed for disaster 
or is that simply the latest mood

theyve used strategic block investing to 
buy into corporate giants like allegis and gillette and amass a 
hoard of cash instead of walking away with the companies themselves 
but the three principals of coniston partners paul tierney 
jr augustus oliver and keith gollust hardly fit the mold of 
corporate raiders think of them more as refined persuaders with 
the emphasis on persuasion 
unlike workaholic dealmakers the coniston partners take 
threeday weekends occasionally saunter about the office in jeans 
and give money and time to a number of social causes 
it could be their youthful appearances and their fresh sense of 
pace that attracts people willing to invest 5 million each to join 
their funds more likely however it is the promise of a handsome 
return which has averaged in excess of 35 percent a year those 
investors have helped the partners build a warchest estimated at 
700 million 
typically the partners parlay that cash into big profits by 
snapping up a large block of shares in an undervalued company and 
pressing management to make changes that will boost the stock price 
while thats not much different from the modus operandi of a 
carl icahn or a t boone pickens the coniston boys have added a 
dash of soft soap to the business unlike icahn they arent 
interested in taking over their targets they would rather cajole 
from the outside and get managers to fix their own problems 
they prefer sweettalking to fistpounding said donald 
carter president of the carter organization which has represented 
coniston in several boardroom battles 
more than that says oliver a 38yearold lawyer formerly with 
a prestigious new york firm we approach things like the debate 
over the future of a company with a certain amount of personal 
integrity 
thats not to say the coniston partners are anything less than 
tenacious their latest contest with razorblade maker gillette 
co involved a bitter proxy battle that saw coniston narrowly lose 
a bid for four seats on gillettes board subsequent legal 
wrangling ended in a settlement under which coniston agreed not to 
increase its stake in gillette or seek control of the company for 
three years gillette in turn agreed to buy back 16 million 
shares of its stock at 45 each 
while coniston should make about 44 million from that 
investment the profit came at a price the partners had about 3 
million in legal fees and never saw gillette sold for the 50 a 
share they believed it was worth 
it wasnt a very satisfying end to the struggle tierney 
admitted 
the fight also shed a negative light on one of conistons most 
prized investors tito tettamanti a swiss businessman who leads 
wealthy europeans into the coniston fold 
gillette characterized tettamanti in fullpage newspaper 
advertisements as part of the tangled web of conistonrelated 
foreign and domestic corporations and partnerships 
the coniston partners rebuffed hints that tettamanti figured in 
their decision making which has been the trios sole purview since 
gollust teamed up with tierney a decade ago oliver whose light 
brown mane hangs to his shoulders joined in 1984 eager to escape 
the law firms constrained atmosphere and rigorous 50hour work 
week 
besides gillette their successes have included storer 
communications where coniston made about 39 million in a 1985 
leveraged buyout the partnership also made a quick 60 million by 
selling its 12 percent stake in viacom international when the 
company was acquired by national amusements in 1987 
their best deal by far was their investment in allegis now 
known as ual corp with a 14 percent stake in the company coniston 
pressed allegis to sell its westin and hilton international hotel 
operations and hertz car rental business coniston cashed in most 
of its stock at a profit of about 460 million when the company 
bought back shares at 80 apiece 
despite the riches of their success the coniston partners 
maintain modest offices overlooking fashionable park avenue from 
their fifthfloor vantage point litter on the street is still 
visible and cab honking is quite audible 
we attempt to corral the level of greed and realize money is 
only one of the things you work for said 45yearold tierney 
whose office is adorned with family photos of a recent african 
safari 
investors in conistons various funds may be less altruistic 
last year the partners raised the minimum investment from 2 
million to 5 million because the bulk of our investors were 
interested and willing to invest more tierney said 
once clients decide to put their money with coniston thats the 
last say they have in how its used as limited partners investors 
are told in no uncertain terms that theyll remain totally 
passive tierney said 
investors know what they read in the paper and they know what 
their capital account is at the end of the year said gollust 
43 weve never had any complaints he added with a smirk 
conistons roughly 75 investors get no dividends the only 
opportunity they have to take profits is when they leave the fund 
investors are assessed a management fee of 20 percent of 
profits per year fortune magazine estimated last year that the fee 
generated some 50 million in income for the partners not counting 
the substantial personal stake each has invested in the firm 
the partners say their art comes in deciding collectively which 
of a number of companies with similar financial profiles is the 
right investment while the odd man out has no allies he does not 
feel alienated 
if im in the minority im grateful i have two partners who 
see things differently from me because i would have made a 
mistake gollust said 
the partners and the three investment professionals who work 
with them meander in and out of each others small offices freely 
discussing ideas that may have come to mind while windsurfing or 
brainstorming 
we do not want to build a large organization in terms of 
people tierney said partly because it might mean compromising 
their relaxed work environment 
tierney says striking a comfortable balance between the spoils 
of wealth and social concerns is a struggle the former peace corps 
volunteer has had a hand in local government the pta and sports 
coaching and lately has been mulling a contribution to the 
presidential campaign of democrat michael dukakis 
oliver has pledged to pay college tuition for a class of 33 
hispanic teens and he and his wife have taken the group to 
baseball games the theater even to the coniston offices 
each of us has a different sense of things wed like to see 
done in the world said oliver although making money is one 
none of us has the goal of being the richest person in the world

the phone has been ringing off the hook with 
calls from ordinary citizens at the embezzlement and bribery 
reporting center ever since it opened in the east district of 
beijing 
the office is a sign of the times in china as the government 
tries to control corruption all over the country 
the response of the people has been excellent said a 
frazzled wu yuhua the 35yearold station head a week after the 
center opened july 29 they are very curious and have many 
complaints 
housed in a cramped 19th century mudandmortar dwelling capped 
with the traditional sweeping eaves of a chinese home the center 
is in a beijing alley next to a butcher shop 
we wanted the people to be at home wu said if we stuck 
it on the fifth floor of a government building no one would come 
see us 
the station is manned six days a week for eight hours a day and 
is equipped with a telephone answering service for afterhours 
calls 
in all the station is responsible for about 6000 government 
employees serving 15 million people 
all reports are taken in secret to protect the callers and all 
investigations are handled by the reporting station 
too much corruption is investigated in china by the corrupt 
bureau itself said wan songching the 50yearold director of 
the east districts investigative wing but this reporting 
station will do its own work we are eager to see results 
similar corruption reporting centers are opening all over the 
country and the government says that by september every province 
will one in addition a telephone corruption hotline opened in 
beijing in early august ready to take calls from across the nation 
wu said such devices are necessary if china is going to reform 
its government 
in the past the government always policed itself he 
explained now weve got to have the support of the masses we 
cant clean up the government alone 
china has always tolerated a certain level of official 
dishonesty guanxi or connections are the grease upon which 
the wheels of society run but lately corruption has been getting 
out of hand 
i am shocked at the change in my country said wang poming 
who returned in july after eight years in the united states 
corruption is everywhere school teachers force their students to 
buy breakfast from them to make more money students steal tests 
and sell them for a profit 
corruption and inflation thats all we chinese are talking 
about said liu yuanshang a bookstore owner in beijing we are 
worried that all the dirt will stop the reforms 
the reforms pushed for the last decade by national leader deng 
xiaoping have helped to double chinas gross national product in 
five years to 295 billion in 1987 
but by creating a twotrack pricing system of low stateset 
prices and higher free market prices the reforms have created vast 
opportunities for illegal deals 
in late july 75 staterun businesses in the industrial city of 
wuhan were exposed for making illegal profits off peasants the 
firms bought state goods at fixed low prices and sold them to 
farmers at large profits 
the reselling scheme has become so bad in the cigarette and 
liquor market that on july 28 the government raised the price of 
chinas best brands by as much as 790 percent 
the official press said the move was made to crush a black 
market that has gained a monopoly on highquality cigarettes and 
spirit sales 
in battling corruption the governments policies have been 
unclear lax in one city harsh in the next and creative somewhere 
else 
in shenyang a northern city the city government recently 
imposed a tax on banquets cars and firecrackers three items that 
officials often use public funds to buy 
in beijing qiao yonghang 35 who had been working for several 
years at the stateowned beijing communications and electrical co 
was executed july 25 for taking bribes in exchange for color 
television sets the official xinhua news agency reported 
in all he received bribes worth 120000 yuan 32400 which 
amounts to 125 years of the average urban salary 
still because of guanxi a great percentage of official 
corruption continues 
chinas leading paper the peoples daily renmin ribao 
recently told of gu chengju a forestry official in hunan province 
who stole 300000 yuan 81000 in state funds to build an office 
building and a highclass guest house 
almost two years after his case was exposed gu has yet to be 
brought to justice 
the reason is that gu has been greasing the hands of local 
officials who were supposed to investigate him the paper said 
this feudalistic practice of officials shielding one another 
must end it said in a strong editorial 
some western analysts notably tony kane a china expert with 
the asia society in new york view the growing corruption as a sign 
that china is becoming more democratic 
during the cultural revolution the dirt and sleaze was just as 
widespread but it was being perpetrated by only a few 
individuals kane said now at least you have a situation 
where more people are being allowed to participate that is not 
necessarily bad 
wu yuhuan and his colleagues at the embezzlement and bribery 
reporting station in east beijing do not agree 
when a rat crosses the street the people run to beat it wu 
said citing a popular proverb to me corruption is the rat and 
i must kill it

i only do what i really can something an ordinary man cannot 
do but a trained man can this is me chan said proudly tapping 
his chest 
in the 1987 film project a ii chan jumped from a 50foot 
clock tower to the concrete ground through two flimsy canvases it 
was a typical example of his work 
such stunts however dont come without bruises in july he 
knocked himself out during a scene in which he somersaulted on top 
of a moving bus before smashing through a billboard 
the combination of stunts and humor in chans movies have made 
him a smash so to speak boxoffice success in asia with his last 
10 movies earning more than 150 million in japan hong kong 
taiwan singapore and malaysia 
when he appeared for a promotion in tokyo in march 800 fans 
turned up and he topped a list of idols in a survey of taiwan 
teenagers released in february 
in 1987 a japanese woman named reiko mimura moved to hong kong 
to serve him tea in his studio every day chan made her his floor 
manager a move that drove dozens more japanese women to fly to the 
british colony 
the 24yearold mimura moved here from tokyo in 1984 to be 
closer to her idol i just looked at him and felt very nervous 
he was nice and gave me his records with his autograph she 
recalled of a meeting two years ago 
chan a muscular 5foot10 said he does not dare have a lover 
or a wife for fear of driving his fans to despair two girls 
reportedly tried to kill themselves over the actor 
despite his wild popularity in asia his efforts to impress us 
moviegoers have been disappointing he has appeared in five 
american movies including battle creek brawl and the 
cannonball run 
chan was not happy with the movies and said he would like to do 
a film with steven spielberg free of charge if necessary 
i need an opportunity a great director who wants to make a 
movie about chinese people to hire me chan said the audience 
will want to see any film by that director and when they happen to 
see me in the movie theyll say hey this jackie is cool 
with no offers from spielberg however chan plans to star in a 
selfdirected movie in the united states next year if the 
americans like it ok if not forget it he said 
chan was born in hong kong in 1954 to parents who emigrated to 
australia six years later they enrolled chan in the chinese opera 
research institute to study acting acrobatics and martial arts he 
appeared in a few films before leaving the institute to work as a 
stuntman 
after kung fu star bruce lees death in 1974 director lo wei 
picked chan as a new talent chans career was launched in the 1976 
film new fist of fury in which he imitated lee more than 10 
similar films quickly followed but not until the 1978 drunken 
monkey in a tigers eye did chan find his own style of 
actioncomedy 
in 1985 chan cracked his skull in yugoslavia while shooting a 
scene in which he was to leap from a castle onto a tree instead 
he fell 50 feet to the ground fracturing his skull and driving a 
splinter into his brain chan underwent brain surgery and hearing 
in his right ear remains impaired 
i never thought it would happen to me he said while i 
was lying in the hospital i thought a lot and found there are many 
things i have not done the accident was a turning point in his 
life when he returned to hong kong he set up a charity 
foundation participated in antidrug campaigns and ran marathons 
for charity 
now i think more positively he said if i want to do 
something ill do it quickly its not that im afraid i may not 
live through tomorrow but i dont want to have any regrets

the oldsmobile cutlass ciera which made its 
debut in 1982 has become the best seller at oldsmobile and a 
topselling nameplate in the auto industry 
after testing a 1988 cutlass ciera international series coupe 
its easy to see why 
nothing was surprising about the car inside and out everything 
was where youd expect to find it and the ciera went about its 
business with predictable ease 
it didnt seem to matter what the business was oldsmobile 
reports the ciera has a higher percentage than normal of buyers who 
have singlecar households 52 percent 
thus the ciera is expected to do a lot of things get around 
town haul luggage whatever said mary munkacsy product liaison 
at oldsmobile for the cutlass ciera a majority of the primary 
drivers of cieras are women although only 38 percent of the 
purchasers are female she added 
the average buyer according to 1987 sales data has an average 
age of 53 and annual income of 44000 thirtyfive percent are 
college graduates and 23 percent are single munkacsy said 
sales of the ciera topped 264800 in the 1987 model year making 
it the sixth bestselling nameplate in the industry that year it 
also became the bestselling oldsmobile nameplate in 1985 topping 
the cutlass supreme 
through june of this model year ciera sales were 165800 down 
about 14 percent from yearago sales largely due to increased 
competition in the midsize market 
but the ciera still has a respectable record it continues to 
be the top seller at oldsmobile it also shares its body 
underpinnings acar design with other general motors corp cars 
and ranks second after its sibling chevrolet celebrity acar in 
acar sales at the giant automaker munkacsy said 
the celebrity by the way was the fourth bestseller in the 
industry in 1987 
cieras prices put it about in the range of its competitors 
at 15957 out the door the test car compared to the 16350 
for a 1988 taurus with 38liter v6 engine and other similar 
features oldsmobile lists the toyota camry as another competitor 
a 1988 camry with a 25liter v6 engine and equipped like the ciera 
was 15700 however there are lowerpriced cieras including a 
bare one at around 11000 without the v6 engine 
the international series coupe and sedan add a new name to the 
ciera line for 1988 munkacsy said they are designed for younger 
buyers who want an expressive and fun car 
the test car was expressive all right it had ribbed pieces of 
fabric in the middle of the seats and there was more of the ribbed 
look on the sides of the doors inside if you sat in the back seat 
you looked at zippers smack down the middle back of the front seats 
plus a number of seams i could do without all that 
legroom in the rear also could be cramped if a front seat was 
pushed back and reclined somewhat 
the suspension was ok not real firm and certainly not punishing 
as in some sporty cars the trunk was spacious though items must 
be lifted over the rear part of the body of the car 
consumer reports said 198286 cutlass cieras with sixcylinder 
engines rated worse than average or much worse than average in 
their trouble index with owners many problems were listed as 
engine mechanical 
munkacsy said there have been a number of engines in the cieras 
over the years and noted a new v6 will be standard in the 
international series in the upcoming 1989 model year and optional 
in some other cieras she added that in gm surveys the ciera and 
other acars have looked very good in having low incidents per car 
nonetheless the company this summer mailed incentive offers to 
buyers of 1985odel cieras who had expressed displeasure with their 
vehicles in surveys by oldsmobile those who took the time to 
respond and complain are being offered 1500 off or an extended 
warranty when they buy a new ciera 
gm noted that after about three years many owners begin to think 
about a new car and the company did not want those buyers to go 
elsewhere because of a bad experience with their ciera

he has led a life of almost fictional 
proportions a character out of f scott fitzgeralds reveries 
about the eastern moneyed elite a man of drive ability and charm 
who moves methodically from mountain to mountain simply because 
they are there to climb 
george herbert walker bush scion of the late connecticut 
senator and new york financier prescott bush yes born to the 
silvery privilege so ridiculed by the opposition in atlanta last 
month obediently learned to compete early in life and hasnt quit 
yet 
as a child he played hard in the home on grove lane in 
greenwich conn no numbered address people just called it the 
bush house matching wit and muscle against family members at 
golf tennis tiddlywinks backgammon bridge anagrams anything 
that pitted one against another then to yale and war where he 
fought valiantly on the playing fields of old blue and in the skies 
of the pacific 
next bride barbara at his side he headed westward in a shiny 
1947 studebaker to plumb the texas oil fields and a feverish 
business career where he gambled old money to win new and then 
chucked it all hes worth a modest 2 million today for a 
fitful political climb in which he still courts the north with the 
noblesse oblige of the connecticut gentry and serenades the south 
with a country tune as rough and dusty as west texas sagebrush 
just days before he trampled his republican rivals on super 
tuesday this year george bush 64 sat by a crackling fire in his 
vice presidential office and offered this prescription for winning 
his ultimate political quest be what you are in life dont try 
to be everythng just because youre running for president 
simple and sound enough advice for bush who has sometimes 
exhibited hesitance but always forged ahead uprooting wife and 
children 28 times in 40 years a 29th house the white one on 
pennsylvania avenue may be the crowning stop of the bush odyssey 
but he already has settled on his proudest accomplishment the 
fact that our children still come home 
it has been a trek from president of his prep school class at 
andover mass like dad to captain of the yale baseball team 
like dad to member of the supersecret skull and bones society 
like dad to millionaire like dad to member of congress like 
dad to unlike dad two ambassadorships chairman of the 
republican party director of the central intelligence agency vice 
president for two terms and now his partys standardbearer in a 
new campaign for the white house 
but therein lies a problem for all that george bush has been 
many people seem uncertain about what he is as one television 
wisecracker put it there is no there there 
who is the real george bush in many respects he is what ronald 
reagan played in the movies 
bush was a star collegiate athlete and a daring fighter pilot in 
the pacific roles that reagan knew only on the back lots in 
hollywood he has been married to the same woman for 42 years and 
has five children who are devoted to him reagan has an exwife and 
children he rarely sees bush regularly attends church reagan 
seldom does 
bush built the republican party in texas helped save the 
national gop as its chairman from being torn apart by watergate 
and has loyally answered every party call reagan began his 
political career as a democrat 
yet it is reagan whose name is synonymous with republican 
loyalty with god family and country with competitive spirit 
bush for his trouble has been reviled by critics right and left 
as a wimp a lap dog a preppy a whiny waffling bootlicker a 
target of scorn by carson and letterman an invisible doonesbury 
character whose political manhood has been placed in a blind trust 
bush bridles at this criticism to offset it he sometimes talks 
tough as in a speech in new york city where he blasted every 
twobit punk with a knife who mugs a cleaning lady 
several of these efforts have been downright clumsy as in his 
assertion to new jersey dockworkers four years ago that he had 
kicked a little ass in his debate with vice presidential 
challenger geraldine ferraro 
but then to the dismay of his aides he will talk offhandedly 
about his people attending comingout parties or preface a trip 
to the parched midwest with a chipper off to the drought 
the preppy charge may bother him most and he has gone to some 
lengths to explain that he hasnt worn a buttondown oxford shirt 
in 20 years and his suits arent brooks brothers but arthur adler 
and no those arent gucci shoes and he actually jogs more than he 
plays tennis 
at a preconvention rally for ethnic groups bush acknowledged 
he is a nice wasp but said his values match their own bushs 
critics dont question his innate decency within his own set of 
values but challenge whether he ever can understand what it is like 
to be poor and oppressed and desperate 
in his autobiography bush says that when he was ambassador to 
china he spurned diplomatic formalities and bicycled around 
beijing to get to know and understand its people 
historian barbara tuchman tells a story with a different view 
she and bush appeared at a forum sponsored by a church in 
connecticut some months after bush had returned from china 
according to mrs tuchman somebody asked bush if hed had a chance 
to meet any ordinary chinese and bush replied oh yes they 
gave us a boy to play tennis with 
to combat the w word bush has talked up his war record 
when he logged 1228 hours of flying time and 126 carrier landings 
crashed on takeoff once got shot down another time flew 58 combat 
missions and won the distingushed flying cross and he has written 
poignantly about the death of his daughter robin at age 3 after a 
tortuous bout with leukemia 
but nobody has questioned bushs physical courage or even his 
emotional trials or toughness a point he seems to miss the doubts 
are over his intellectual independence 
in 1980 candidate bush favored the equal rights amendment 
opposed an amendment to ban abortions derided reagan as far to 
the right as you can get but since the moment of reagans 
midnight call in detroit he has toed the reagan line and has 
reached to sometimes bizarre lengths to court the right wing 
two years ago he jangled conservative nerves when he joined 
civil rights leaders for an emotional tribute to the slain rev 
martin luther king jr at ebenezer baptist church in atlanta and 
sang we shall overcome with archbishop desmond tutu the south 
african antiapartheid leader 
three days later he rallied with the new york state 
conservative party and the day after that appeared before the 
liberty federation to praise its founder the rev jerry falwell a 
man who had branded tutu a fraud 
bush perplexingly turned out in december 1985 at a testimonial 
for the late william loeb the staunchly rightwing new hampshire 
publisher who had called bush an incompetent liberal a 
hypocrite a spoonfed little rich kid

but changes of heart did not come to bush solely in the reagan 
era going back to his early political days in texas he has often 
seen the light of the times he opposed civil rights legislation 
then favored it he backed the vietnam war even called for the 
restricted use of nuclear weapons if militarily prudent then 
wanted americans withdrawn from southeast asia 
hardly a weekend television interview show goes by without 
somebody carping that bush has yet to demonstrate his own vision 
of america that he should unveil his own positive campaign 
rather than relying on the reagan program to carry him to the white 
house 
he has spent a lifetime thinking in conventional terms never 
reaching beyond them never even wanting to said thomas lud 
ashley a former democratic congressman from ohio but one of bushs 
closest friends for 40 years 
other bush associates agree eddie mahe jr who was political 
director of the republican national committee when bush was its 
chairman puts it bluntly hes not a deep person he doesnt 
have the courage of his convictions 
bush has always favored team play baseball was his best sport 
and even in his business ventures he took in partners he does not 
enjoy a good argument and by many accounts has rarely spoken out 
in cabinet meetings or national security council sessions although 
bush himself says he communicates his ideas to the president in 
their private weekly mexicanfood lunches 
but if he has seriously taken issue with the reagan white house 
it remains locked in his heart there are just many examples in 
my mind that im not gonna share with you where i know ive shaped 
what happens he said earlier this year you cant point to 
three things i take that on the chin because its offset by the 
fact that i know ive been loyal 
even after the reelection campaign in 1984 when reagan was 
into a lameduck term and bush might have been expected to step 
into the foreground he remained quiet at white house staff 
meetings in early 1985 he rejected david stockmans pleas for 
help in persuading the president to cut the deficit a year later 
he spurned appeals from several leading republicans to intervene 
with the president to dismiss donald t regan as chief of staff 
but the most nagging of the where was george questions 
relates to the irancontra debacle an issue the vice president has 
yet to address in specific consistent terms he has variously 
claimed that he was out of the loop of the decisions that led 
to the scandal that he was deliberately excluded from key 
meetings and that he was completely unaware of the diversion of 
funds from the arms sale to iran to the nicaraguan contras 
in its 690page report on the scandal congress mentioned bush 
only briefly saying it found no evidence he knew of the fund 
diversion as for the arms sales themselves the report said the 
vice president attended several meetings on the iran initiative 
but none of the participants could recall his views 
bush did miss one key meeting on dec 7 1985 at which 
secretary of state george p shultz and defense secretary caspar w 
weinberger vigorously opposed the arms sale i was off at the 
armynavy game bush said 
some see bushs reluctance to step forward and speak out as part 
and parcel of a political style geared more to getting along than 
pulling along 
psychoanalyst ray walker bushs cousin says there is a 
christian innocence to george his life has been without moral 
ambiguity he feels he has been granted goodness and that his 
success proves the goodness was warranted 
but this has all come to him without introspection without 
any grappling about right or wrong george plays it safe he 
plays for the status quo 
with bush politics is personal a contest to make friends not 
waves he is a fanatic about writing personal notes to people along 
the campaign trail on the stump he sometimes goes overboard to 
buddy up to people hey my main man he says with the 
connecticut roll of his vowels to a high school student in ames 
iowa 
and he tailors more than street cliches to his audiences he 
does contrary to his selfadvice project different images to 
different people endearing himself perhaps to the local crowd 
but exacerbating the wimp factor in the process 
after bob dole drubbed him in iowa bush ditched his imperial 
style and surfaced in new hampshire as one of the boys offering to 
help residents whose cars had stalled shaking hands at factory 
gates tossing snowballs im one of you he said i was born 
in massachusetts grew up in connecticut and have a home across 
the way in maine 
in texas his story is that his heart is there too since as a 
young man he left the east and took a lowpaying job with the 
ideco corp to learn the oil business and went on to strike out 
on my own in the oil fields and build a business 
he doesnt dwell on the fact that the job was arranged by his 
father who was a friend of idecos chairman of the board and that 
his passage from the skull and bones club at yale to the petroleum 
club in houston was helped with an 800000 stake from relatives 
and friends back east 
even while abroad bushs attempt to please the immediate 
audience didnt play all that well elsewhere like his own country 
after visiting warsaw pact forces in eastern europe last fall he 
effusively told his hosts that when the russian tank mechanics 
run out of work in the soviet union send them to detroit 
because we could use that kind of ability auto workers were not 
amused 
some see bushs proclivity to make friends to fit in to be 
one of you not as a flaw but rather as the heart of his 
character they see his empathy with people as the glue of his 
success and point out that a major part of the art of being 
president is compromise 
bush himself acknowledges his phi beta kappa key at yale 
notwithstanding that im no intellectual according to 
nicholas brady one of bushs most trusted confidants hes not 
an ideologue in any sense his philosophy centers around whats 
fair and whats appropriate and a right sense of proportion 
there is some evidence to suggest that bush can be effective 
without stirring anybodys soul he held the cia together at a time 
when it was under severe congressional attack for domestic privacy 
violations in prior years others point out that he kept the gops 
finances and organization together when watergate threatened to 
shatter the national party 
still his cousin walker says he always placated his father 
then later on he placated his bosses if you have a history of 
deferring to somebody up the line of saying im not really free 
to have my own moral position thats not going to change when you 
become president 
bush doesnt accept that a bit i know who i am i know 
exactly where i want to go how to take this country there he 
has said 
but leadership isnt just making decisions and giving orders 
its hearing all points of view before making the decision thats 
the way leadership works in a free society by keeping open doors 
and open minds

when george bush steps to the microphone to 
accept the republican presidential nomination this week he will 
gaze out over a convention floor populated overwhelmingly with 
white collegeeducated men 
an associated press survey of 1274 of the delegates to the 
republican national convention found that 83 percent went to 
college 66 percent are men and 92 percent are white 
by contrast 52 percent of the delegates to last months 
democratic national convention were men and 68 percent were white 
republican delegates do show great diversity in their 
occupations ranging from an amway distributor to the president of 
that corporation other professions represented include lawyers by 
far the largest single group teachers scientists and sales 
representatives 
three percent of the republican delegates are members of labor 
unions compared with more than 20 percent of the democratic 
delegates 
about 26 percent of the republican delegates hold elected 
offices roughly the same as the percentage of professional 
politicians among the delegates to the democratic convention 
the average age of a republican delegate is 49 two years older 
than the average age of a democratic delegate according to the ap 
survey 
the lack of ethnic diversity at the convention brought a mild 
protest from arizona hispanics who complained that none of them 
were represented in the states 32member delegation 
overall about 3 percent of the delegates to the republican 
national convention are hispanic 3 percent are black and 2 
percent are american indian asian or other minorities according 
to the ap survey 
the polls said at this point that were behind with women and 
minorities so lets try to do something to even that up joseph 
a castillo a former state senator and chairman of the arizona 
republican hispanic committee told party leaders 
castillo filed a challenge to the arizona delegation so he could 
tell the national party what he thought was wrong with the way 
delegates were picked with respect to minorities 
the arizona delegation is sadly lacking in that respect 
castillo said 
castillo said he submitted the names of 11 people to the bush 
campaign in arizona to be considered as candidates for delegates to 
the national convention one was picked as a delegate candidate 
castillo himself but he was not elected 
arizona gop chairman burton kruglick said he supported bringing 
minorities into the party but he said they have to earn their 
place by working to elect republicans 
i think the minority communities of our state have to do a 
better job of involving their people kruglick told the partys 
committee on contests last week you cant just go out and 
annoint somebody because theyre a minority

victims she lives with an aunt and uncle in birmingham ala who 
have a legal agreement to protect cecelia in hopes she can lead as 
normal a life as possible they turn down interview requests

chicago killed 275 people 
broken bodies and burning chunks of the northwest wreckage were 
strewn for thousands of feet along middlebelt road and on the 
detroitchicago interstate 
lawrence favio an airport baggage handler was driving home for 
a dinner break at 846 pm when a sheet of flaming metal smashed 
into his thunderbird weeks later he and cecelia met at burn unit 
in the university of michigan medical center 
today he remembers the crash every time he looks at the 
mummylike wrappings that cover his hands and extend to his elbows 
betty polec of mount clemens remembers too her daughter and 
soninlaw were among the victims 
in december polec and others held the first meeting of flight 
255 their spirit lives on a support group with about 85 members 
the people who have joined the group we have formed a 
bond she said weve worn each others shoes 
other relatives of victims needed to deal with the crash in 
different ways 
ive had some people tell me on the telephone i dont want 
anything to do with this group just remember my loved one 
polec said and we do 
on tuesdays anniversary of the crash polecs group plans a 
vigil on middlebelt road where flowers have been placed since the 
plane went down a light will be lit as each of the victims names 
is read polec said 
law officers remember too 
some have sought psychological help three percent to 7 percent 
have developed significant posttraumatic disorders said 
psychologist kenneth wolf who counseled rescuers on the night of 
the crash 
some deputies today still dont want to drive down middlebelt 
because it brings back many memories of the night of the crash 
wolf said 
other deputies are looking for a man with a gray beard who 
showed up the day after the crash and began consoling victims 
families claiming to be a roman catholic priest father john 
irish 
some families became suspicious when he referred them to a 
florida attorney but by that time irish had vanished an arrest 
warrant alleged he defrauded northwest out of motel and meal costs 
and wayne county sheriff robert ficano said irish was suspected of 
similar activity at other tragedies 
but many others tried to brighten the lives darkened by 
disaster for the 68 days cecelia was in the ann arbor hospital 
americans opened their hearts and pocketbooks spokesman michael 
harrison said the hospital received 157420 in cash and checks 
all deposited in a trust fund more than 30000 cards and letters 
and 2200 gifts mostly stuffed animals 
cecelias family gave most of the gifts to childrens hospitals 
in michigan phoenix and the philadelphia area where cecelias 
grandparents live harrison said 
the pain and suffering has also been relived in a federal 
courtroom and a motel conference room 
attorneys from at least four states have filed 105 lawsuits 
naming northwest for pretrial purposes all the suits have been 
consolidated in federal court in detroit 
the next hearing is set for september district court executive 
john mayer said it wasnt clear which suits would be tried or where 
in november the national transportation safety board held a 
weeklong public hearing at a motel less than a mile from the crash 
site on may 10 the board found that the two pilots had failed to 
properly set the airplanes flaps an alarm to alert them to their 
error failed to sound according to cockpit tapes but it has not 
been determined whether it malfunctioned or was deliberately shut 
off 
if the flaps had been extended normally at the time of the 
crash investigators said the plane which never got more than 50 
feet off the ground would have been about 600 feet in the air 
climbing toward cruising altitude on its way to phoenix

in the early morning hours after northwest flight 
255 crashed and exploded on a highway last summer a graybearded 
man with a clerical collar was there to comfort relatives of the 
156 victims 
one of those relatives had a brother who was a roman catholic 
priest and something seemed wrong father john irish withdrew 
when pressed about some of the churchs sacraments 
others reacted when the priest distributed the name of a florida 
attorney he said could handle damage suits 
the wayne county sheriffs department now searching for the 
priest says his real motivation was making money out of misery 
there are always those who see the darker side of things for 
opportunity said sheriff robert ficano 
the investigation of irish is one of at least two instances of 
fraud linked to the crash in the other a new york man then a 
flight attendant sent the department burned personal documents 
allegedly evidence of a 157th victim 
the information was quickly dismissed 
we took it as a joke when it arrived said investigator tim 
rapp we checked with his family who said he was having trouble 
with his girlfriend 
but the department along with the fbi is taking irish 
seriously 
by the time officials suspected irish of unethical or criminal 
behavior he had left detroit a warrant was issued for his arrest 
charging he defrauded northwest out of money for a motel room and 
other expenses while he ministered to the relatives 
witnesses and law enforcement officials said irish also 
distributed business cards for lawyer ronald brimmell of deerfield 
beach fla who is licensed to practice law in michigan 
ficano said no charges had been filed against brimmell and 
michael schwartz of the attorney grievance commission in detroit 
refused to say whether the commission is investigating brimmell 
repeated calls seeking comment from brimmell were not returned 
irish vanished after leaving detroit 
then hours after a continental airliner flipped and crashed at 
takeoff from stapleton international airport in denver on nov 15 
killing 27 of the 82 people aboard police received reports of a 
man matching irishs description talking to survivors at denver 
general hospital he allegedly posed as a reporter and a private 
investigator who said he was seeking clients for an unidentified 
lawyer 
ficano said wayne county investigators went to denver area 
searched a condominium and found evidence linking irish to flight 
255 ficano declined to describe the evidence 
but irish eluded authorities again 
weve been following some leads ficano said he may be in 
canada right now his mother lives there 
the sheriff said irishs alleged scam involving brimmell may 
have worked in the past and he may be living off the proceeds of 
past schemes 
hell likely surface when the money runs out ficano said 
he apparently has a bankroll from other incidents

for generations farm and political leaders 
have debated rural development and usually wound up being for it 
much like the proverbial consensus that apple pie and motherhood 
are good and should be supported by all true americans 
so it is not surprising that the 1988 political season brings 
another wave of dedication to rural development including 
suggestions on how to make life on farms and in small towns easier 
and more beneficial to all concerned 
an idea of what rural development is all about can be had from 
recent testimony by two former secretaries of agriculture john 
block a republican who served in president reagans cabinet and 
bob bergland a democrat who was secretary in the carter 
administration 
blocks views on rural development were in his general statement 
last week in new orleans at a republican agricultural platform 
hearing and were intended to be partisan since he was helping mold 
the 1988 gop platform 
since he left the agriculture departments top post early in 
1986 block has been president of the nationalamerican wholesale 
grocers association falls church va 
bergland is executive vice president of the national rural 
electric cooperative association the washingtonbased umbrella 
group that represents about 1000 rural power systems in 46 states 
it was in his nreca capacity that bergland appeared last month 
before a rural economy and family farming subcommittee of the 
senates small business committee 
both men described rural america and cited its place in the 
nations economic and social fabric each made observations and 
suggestions regarding ways to aid rural development 
the federal government can play an important role in helping 
to revitalize the rural economy bergland said however such a 
role must be carefully thought through and executed in particular 
it is our experience that local development cannot be solved by 
large federal spending programs which lack local support 
bergland added successful efforts must have a strong element 
of local commitment and initiative the federal role should be 
limited to doing what only the federal government can do or what 
it does best making use of its regulatory authorities developing 
standards providing technical assistance and where needed 
financing 
block who noted that about 25 percent of the us population 
lives in rural areas although only 9 percent are farm residents 
said rural development must be a high priority in the next 
republican administration 
some other points made by block 
rural areas must be integrated with the nations overall 
economic health and the business environment must be improved 
through the implementation of rural enterprise zones and other 
measures 
the federal government should help retrain rural workers by 
targeting more job training 
all grants and formulas that allocate federal money to state 
and local areas should be reviewed and changed if rural areas are 
not receiving their appropriate share 
federal funds for rural road and bridge improvements should be 
increased as part of an incentive program to get state and local 
governments to contribute more to help in this effort 
rural education should be upgraded so that employers will 
locate in rural areas where there is a highly educated labor 
force 
bergland cautioned against the government jumping into massive 
projects to overhaul the countryside 
generally the most beneficial and longlasting economic 
development results are achieved by starting out small bergland 
said it is often more realistic for a local community or 
cooperative to undertake a project that results in a few new jobs 
rather than expend energy and resources pursuing a large employer 
small successes can snowball into more successes which build local 
vitality 
further he said a can do attitude is necessary for rural 
development those who are easily overwhelmed and have a 
pessimistic outlook are bound to reap more of the same 
bergland said development is a slow process which requires 
patience perseverance and an understanding that positive results 
normally take time

bat industries plc maneuvering to win 
approval of its hostile takeover bid for farmers group inc 
increased its cash buyout offer to 72 a share up from 63 a share 
the beefedup offer announced tuesday and apparently tendered 
to promote a possible friendly settlement boosted the british 
conglomerates total cash offer to more than 49 billion from its 
last offer of 45 billion 
farmers a los angelesbased insurance holding company has 
resisted overtures made by batus inc bat industries us 
subsidiary since an initial 60 a share offer in january but said 
tuesday it would at least consider the latest offer 
the board of directors will give this new offer careful 
consideration said leo e denlea jr chairman and chief 
executive of farmers 
in sweetening its offer for farmers 684 million common shares 
batus set a condition requiring negotiations of a definitive merger 
agreement by aug 19 
farmers stock rose 12 cents tuesday on the new york stock 
exchange to 5775 a share the new batus offer wasnt disclosed 
until hours after the market closed 
farmers has about 11 billion in assets it is the nations 
thirdlargest home and auto insurer and seventhbiggest property 
and casualty insurer 
batus also has been attempting to secure regulatory approval of 
its hostile takeover bid from insurance commissioners in nine 
states where farmers does business 
those efforts have met with mixed success 
arizona is the only state to approve the deal with decisions 
still pending in texas illinois and kansas 
in ohio the superintendent of insurance has given conditional 
approval 
three states oregon idaho and washington have rejected the 
takeover because of issues unrelated to the price offered by batus 
farmers said 
californias insurance commissioner rejected the proposal but 
that decision was recently overturned by a state court farmers 
which does 40 percent of its business in california said it would 
appeal 
batus which is based in louisville ky includes among its 
holdings the brown amp williamson tobacco corp which makes kool 
cigarettes and several retailers led by new yorks saks fifth 
avenue 
in the various state regulatory hearings farmers has repeatedly 
suggested that if batus took over its tobacco holdings would 
prompt the company to end farmers nonsmoker insurance discounts 
several members of congress have opposed the batus takeover on 
similar grounds prompting the company to assure governmental and 
regulatory bodies it wont end nonsmoker insurance breaks 
the original california rejection of the proposed takeover was 
based on a section of state law that forbids foreign ownership of 
an insurer 
about 10 percent of bat industries stock is owned by various 
government agencies including town councils in britain 
batus has acknowledged that the takeover bid initiated at the 
beginning of 1988 easily could drag on into 1989 and cost the 
company as much as 70 million in legal fees

as developments change the way people 
communicate from cellular phones to interactive cable tv some 
regulators and lawmakers say the constitutions protections of 
traditional speech and press need to be restated for the new media 
police can legally eavesdrop on cellular telephone 
conversations even though it would be unlawful to tap the same 
conversations over regular phone lines without a court order said 
ucla communication studies professor jeff cole 
its also legal to spy on the phone numbers dialed up by a home 
computer 
and here in cerritos people are frustrated by another 
constititional quandary they cant receive a futuristic cable 
system that would provide athome shopping and banking not to 
mention lots of television channels until its determined who has 
a right to install it 
we are going to have to figure out a way to ensure the first 
amendment survives the technological revolution said federal 
communications commission public affairs director john kamp 
in the cerritos case an official of the fcc which regulates 
broadcast media and some telephone services but not newspapers and 
magazines recently approved the laying of cable by the local 
telephone company gte which won a contract from the city last 
year 
but cable industry groups have asked the full fcc to review the 
matter and a decision is expected in the fall said michael morris 
of the california cable television association the industry cites 
federal regulations banning telephone companies from operating 
cable tv in cities where they run the phones 
the residents are frustrated said michele ogle a 
spokeswoman for this upscale los angeles suburb they would like 
to see cable teleision the surrounding communities have it 
some media experts are concerned for a different reason they 
think the first amendment guaranteeing free speech and press 
should keep local and federal governments from deciding who sends 
or receives information by the new media 
the phone companies like any other citizen enjoy a first 
amendment right to be speakers said patrick maines of the media 
institute in washington dc 
cable television should have little or no regulation at the 
federal or local level he said 
maines institute houses the first amendment center on the new 
media which has filed legal briefs and comments with courts and 
the fcc in eight cases it feels threaten the first amendment rights 
of new media such as cable television telephone information 
services and electronic publishing 
cole of ucla compared the state of law and the new media to 
the old west where theres no established law and order anything 
goes and the biggest guy with the most power always wins 
some argue that the first amendment is meant to ensure many 
media voices and that government rules encouraging competition 
among new media help meet that goal he said 
letting telephone companies offer electronic information on 
their wires could give them an unfair advantage over potential 
competitors according to former fcc general counsel henry geller 
now head of the washington center for public policy research 
i dont want the phone company to be in cable television and 
control 50 channels geller said 
future fiber optic transmission lines which gte would test in 
cerritos could become a highway into the home carrying 
telephone television and text messages he said 
todays new media blur the lines between categories lawmakers 
and judges have used for years 
the first amendment was written more than 200 years ago when 
print was the only mass medium the nations communication act was 
passed in 1934 when radio and telephone concerns dominated 
it used to be easy to tell the difference between newspapers 
and telephones now its not so easy said the fccs kamp some 
newspapers send electronic copies of stories to home computers over 
phone lines 
i see no difference between the washington post i pick up at 
my doorstep and the washington post that comes in on my computer 
modem except that i dont get newsprint ink on my hands said 
ken allen of the information industry association a group of 650 
companies that see information as their product 
they new media should have the same protections that the 
first amendment provides other information sources said allen 
but he cited cases where information that is put in a new media 
suddenly loses all of its first amendment protections 
californias legislature this year considered a state 
constitutional amendment extending state free speech and press 
protections to computer communications the bill passed the state 
assembly but was stalled in the senate after law enforcement and 
credit information companies voiced opposition said bob jacobson 
a consultant to the assembly committee 
i think the likelihood of all forms of communication having 
full first amendment rights is the most likely course over time 
said everette dennis of the gannett center for media studies in new 
york it may take a long time to happen but its an 
inevitability

the food and drug administration has 
sent upjohn co a strong signal that its baldness remedy will be 
approved 
the kalamazoobased pharmaceutical company said it received an 
approvable letter tuesday from the fda for its topical minoxidil 
preparation for the treatment of male pattern baldness developed 
under the trade name rogaine 
an approvable letter is historically the last step before 
final approval for marketing company spokesman rd larue said 
larue said the letter means the scientific data submitted by the 
company have been approved leaving only label language to be 
worked out 
larue would not speculate when final approval may be granted 
the drug already is approved for use in several other countries 
including canada 
minoxidil was developed as a blood pressure treatment but the 
company noted about 10 years ago that some of its users experienced 
increased hair growth

no test drives of the new sporty coupes 
rolling off the diamondstar motors assembly line will be available 
until january even though fullscale production begins next month 
part of the reason for the delay is that the cars produced at 
the 650 million normal plant will be 1990 models federal law 
prohibits automobile manufacturers from shipping cars to dealers 
more than 12 months in advance of their model year 
besides that we have such a slow launch curve on production 
that we wouldnt have the volume of cars needed to supply the 
dealers said company spokeswoman robin skiles 
well only make about 3000 units the rest of this year 
the stateoftheart auto plant a joint venture of chrysler 
corp and mitsubishi motors of japan features hightechnology 
machinery with robotics in the final assembly line 
the first batch of cars produced by diamondstar will be divided 
evenly between chrysler and mitsubishi for distribution to their 
network of dealers nationwide chyrsler will market the cars as the 
plymouth laser and mitsubishi will sell them as the eclipse 
ms skiles said diamondstar is not involved in sale or 
distribution of the vehicles in fact diamondstar is not even 
responsible for shipment of the cars to chrysler or mitsubishi 
we manufacture them and the distributors handle everything 
else including hauling them from the plant she said 
assembly of pilot cars started in june and diamondstar is 
scheduled to begin fullscale production in the first week of 
september 
none of the more than 100 pilot cars will be sold ms skiles 
said they will be used for promotion and testing in this country 
and japan 
a prototype of the laser will be on display aug 1121 in 
springfield at the illinois state fair 
rebecca caruso a plymouth spokeswoman in highland park mich 
said each plymouth dealer in the nations top 100 markets will get 
a new laser for initial showroom display 
some smaller markets including peoria will also get a car 
because of high interest locally 
the initial rollout is a small number of cars she said 
they will go to california first then chicago might have a car 
in a week or two and then peoria will get a car 
john pashdag mitsubishi spokesman said the eclipse will be 
distributed in similar fashion although each dealer likely will 
get more than one car because there are far fewer mitsubishi 
dealers around the country 
diamondstar employs about 875 people and intends to have 1300 
people on board by the end of the year 
a second shift will be added in 1989 to produce a fourdoor 
compact sedan those vehicles will be marketed as the mitsubishi 
mirage and the plymouth eagle summit total employment at that time 
is projected at 2900

an attorney for the chicago missouri amp western 
railway told a federal bankruptcy judge the companys finances are 
improving and public interest demands that the carrier continue 
operating 
at immediate issue is 14 million in aid the state has offered 
to keep the line rolling in the belief that the railroad is 
important for the states economic health 
but the railroads chief creditors citicorp north america and 
heller financial inc oppose the bailout they want to recover 
more than 100 million in loans by liquidating the railroads 
assets 
the two sides made their final pitch for the proposed 14 
million on tuesday before us bankruptcy judge john schwartz 
the creditors position has been that even under the best of 
circumstances the railroads earnings wont come close to paying 
even the interest on the loans in the coming years 
public interest dictates that the state loans be 
granted donald cassling an attorney for cmampw trustee daniel 
murray told the judge 
he noted that gregory baise director of the state department of 
transportation and the illinois commerce commission have testified 
in favor of the loan 
the cmampw filed for protection from its creditors in april 
listing debts of 1318 million and assets of 1035 million 
cassling said its position has improved although it still is 
operating at a deficit 
gov james r thompson who offered the loans and grants says 
the railroad is crucial to 90 illinois cities along its route and 
to the 300000 people annually who use the chicagotost louis 
amtrak service that runs over cmampw track 
schwartz allowed the railroad to accept 1 million of the 
proposed bailout on july 29 to keep the cmampw rolling through the 
completion of bankruptcy proceedings 
the proposed loans really cost the lenders nothing but they do 
add to the value of the lenders collateral by allowing for 
rehabilitation of deteriorating track and locomotive repair which 
will cut expenses cassling said tuesday 
the problem with that argument is that its speculative 
countered schwartz 
liquidation would affect illinois ability to attract and retain 
business cassling said 
passenger service to springfield the state capital would 
almost certainly cease as would service to bloomington joliet 
and other cities he said 
scores of jobs would be lost not only at cmampw but at companies 
that rely on the railroad cassling said 
the railroads 632mile freight operation between joliet and 
kansas city also would be affected he said

the senior partner of a law firm that agreed 
to settle a suit with the federal savings and loan insurance corp 
over the closing of a florida association by paying 50 million 
denies any wrongdoing and called the settlement a proper business 
decision 
the philadelphia law firm of blank rome comisky amp mccauley 
agreed to settle the suit over management of a savings and loan 
association that closed two years ago 
the settlement was the largest ever paid by a law firm to the 
federal agency to settle a claim the fslic said in a statement 
proceeds from the settlement will be shared by the fslic and 
former stock owners of sunrise savings and loan association of 
boynton beach fla included in the settlement is the establishment 
of a 10 million indemnity fund to cover any claims by outside 
parties against the law firm which represented sunrise 
david girarddi carlo managing partner of blank rome said 
tuesday the settlement was a proper business decision 
i believe settlement of the case is in the best interest of 
the firm and all parties involved he said 
he added that he expected negative inferences to be drawn 
because of the amount of the settlement but said the firm continues 
to deny the allegations 
the suit filed in 1986 in us district court charged that the 
law firm acted negligently in advising sunrise improperly closed 
loans aided former sunrise officials in violating several statutes 
and banking regulations and represented parties with conflicts of 
interest 
the fslic sued the thrifts former officers directors and 
lawyers including 87 partners and former partners at blank rome 
under the agreement the fslic will receive 72 percent of the 
first 40 million and 95 percent of the remaining 10 million 
unused funds will revert to fslic and shareholders by august 1992 
sunrise was closed in 1986 and insured accounts were transferred 
to the newly created beach federal savings and loan association 
this settlement demonstrates that where violations 
contributing to insolvency are caused by the negligence or 
malpractice of professionals including law firms the federal 
home loan bank board will hold them as well as thrift management

after 14 straight months of decline japans 
merchandise trade surplus reversed direction and increased 35 
percent in july over its yearearlier level the finance ministry 
announced today 
julys 718 billion surplus exceeded both the 694 billion 
registered a year earlier and the 593 billion posted in june the 
ministry said 
japans surplus with the united states shrank from a year 
earlier to 449 billion from 479 billion in july 1987 but was 
up sharply from 363 billion in june 
exports to the united states rose 40 percent from a year 
earlier to 795 billion while imports rose 214 percent to 346 
billion 
the overall increase in japans july trade surplus may partially 
reflect the recent rebound of the dollar against the japanese yen 
on foreign exchange markets the dollar which began the year at 
about 120 yen was trading in tokyo wednesday at close to 135 yen 
a lower yen tends to make japanese products more competitive 
overseas and foreign goods more costly in japan 
ministry officials also attributed the widening of the gap 
between japans exports and imports to increased sales of 
semiconductors chiefly to southeast asia where many japanese 
companies have shifted assembly of electronic products as a way of 
dealing with higher production costs at home 
but ministry offi80 
on tuesday the dow jones industrial average fell 2827 to 
207913 
declining issues outnumbered advances by about 7 to 2 on the 
nyse with 348 up 1206 down and 418 unchanged big board volume 
came to 20071 million shares against 14880 million in the

us sprint communications co told a 
federal agency that it is getting fewer complaints about billing 
problems and the problems are being resolved more quickly 
us sprints report on tuesday was in response to a letter 
received three weeks ago from the federal communications 
commission the fcc said fines may be necessary if sprint did not 
handle customer complaints more efficiently 
the fcc will have a chance to ask questions about sprints 
response at a meeting today in washington said john hoffman 
sprint senior vice president 
us sprint which has steadily lost money since its creation as a 
joint venture two years ago is the nations thirdlargest 
longdistance company after american telephone amp telegraph co and 
mci communications corp 
the longdistance companys report said the number of complaints 
dropped to 111 in june from 211 in january and it took sprint an 
average of 13 days to resolve a complaint in june compared to an 
average of 30 days in january 
sprint said it had received 149 complaints from the fcc last 
month but 30 of the 52 complaints received in the final week of 
july were postmarked in april may and june 
if those complaints had been received and processed by us 
sprint in those earlier months we believe the declining trend 
could still prevail said the report which was signed by william 
t esrey president and chief executive officer of united 
telecommunications inc of westwood esrey also is serving as 
sprints president 
united telecom owns sprint equally with the gte corp of 
stamford conn but will take majority ownership later this year 
the fcc said it had to review the report before commenting on it 
it would be premature of me to say anything said greg vogt 
chief of the enforcement division of the fccs common carrier 
bureau 
after the fcc letter was sent vogt had said the volume of 
complaints was not as serious as the number of times the agency had 
to go back to sprint about a particular complaint 
sprints report defended the number of its repeated complaints 
it said they occurred in 14 percent of the 955 complaints sent by 
the fcc in the first half of the year 
the report also listed procedures that sprint began on aug 1 to 
improve the handling of complaints a service center in dallas will 
contact customers 10 days after sprint resolves a dispute to make 
sure the customer is satisfied 
sprint said while improvements could be made the brunt of its 
billing problems were in the past

fortyseven minutes after the clock struck midnight 
wednesday the population of asia reached 3 billion according to a 
report released by a group of politicians representing 19 asian 
nations 
the asian forum of parliamentarians on population and 
development report based on data compiled by the united nations 
said the population of asia hit the 3 billion mark at 0047 
greenwhich mean time wednesday 
asia the worlds most populous region accounts for 60 percent 
of the global total which passed the 5 billion mark in july 1987 
seven babies are born in asia every second or 150000 each day 
the report said 
the forum headed by takashi sato japans agriculture minister 
issued the report at an international conference in tokyo last 
month heralding the day of the three billion the forum groups 19 
asian nations from australia to syria 
the designation of a day marking the birth of the 3 billionth 
baby in asia is very symbolic said shigemi kono director 
general of the national institute of population problems but i 
personally think it is nonsense because there is no way of 
actually knowing when the 3 billionth baby was born 
skepticism about calculations aside however kono agrees there 
are serious population problems in the region 
though we have come close to solving the fertility rate 
problem in japan and china serious questions remain in india 
bangladesh and pakistan he said 
india with a population of 818 million has an annual growth 
rate of 208 percent pakistan with a population of 115 million 
has a 345percent growth rate and bangladesh with 110 million 
people has 267 percent according to united nations estimates 
by the year 2025 asia will have 45 billion inhabitants said 
an official with the nonprofit tokyobased asian population and 
development association the estimated growth in asia is roughly 
equal to the increase in the total world population from 1950 to 
1980 she added speaking on condition of anonymity 
experts have predicted that rice production will have to 
increase 50 percent by 2025 to feed the continent

rupert murdochs news corp plans to raise money 
to help finance its 3 billion takeover of triangle publications 
inc by selling its stake in reuters holdings plc as well as land 
in britain and australia 
howard j rubenstein a spokesman for murdoch said wednesday 
that the media magnate expects to raise about 200 million from the 
sale of news corps 4 percent stake in reuters a londonbased 
news and financial information services agency 
he also said murdoch valued the undeveloped real estate holdings 
at about 200 million 
murdochs goal is to raise half the necessary funds by selling 
assets and borrow the rest while there are no formal commitments

participating in murdochs acquisition of triangle publisher of

sales 
according to wednesday editions of the wall street journal

pearson plc publisher of the financial times

securities regulators said wednesday they suspect 
massive insider trading took place on the tokyo stock exchange just 
before nippon steel co purchased a stake in a machinery maker 
driving up its stock price 
it was an unusual admission in japan where trading on 
confidential information has been an acknowledged way of doing 
business until recently securities laws have ignored all but the 
most blatant forms of such trading 
officials at the finance ministry and the tokyo stock exchange 
said they were investigating trading in sankyo seiki manufacturing 
co a precision machinery maker whose stock soared hours before 
nippon japans largest steel maker purchased an 18 percent stake 
in the company 
the tokyo stock exchange took the unusual move of suspending 
trading in sankyo shares on the afternoon of july 29 but the 
volume of sankyo shares traded in the morning session stil was 
nearly 10 times the previous days level 
securities officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
they suspect a leak 
the national daily asahi shimbun and the japan broadcast corp 
reported that numerous nippon steel and sankyo employees bought 
several thousand sankyo shares early on july 29 both companies 
denied the allegation 
under current laws workers who bought the shares with prior 
knowledge of the business deal will not be subject to criminal 
punishment 
a stock exchange official said the body has asked securities 
companies that dealt in sankyo shares to submit lists of investors 
we have obtained information on about 90 percent of the people 
who bought sankyo shares on that day said hitoshi shimakura 
head of the exchanges transaction review section 
the case is the latest in a series of stock scandals that have 
shaken political and business circles in japan and sparked public 
outcry for stricter controls over insider trading 
earlier this summer aides to some of japans top political and 
business leaders including prime minister noboru takeshita were 
found to have made huge profits by buying unlisted shares of a 
tokyo real estate concern and selling them after public trading 
began 
takeshita finance minister kiichi miyazawa and a dozen other 
top politicians admitted to their aides involvement and apologized 
for poor supervision 
the deals were legal under japanese laws but highlighted the 
close ties between business and politics and raised questions about 
political ethics 
the finance ministry last week decided to speed up 
implementation of the revised securities exchange law which gives 
authorities tighter surveillance and control and allows for 
criminal punishment for insider trading 
the new law announced in february will take effect in stages 
beginning this month instead of november officials said

today on the chicago board of trade in relatively light cautious 
trading ahead of an agriculture department crop report 
the report is expected to indicate some droughtrelated 
deterioration of crop conditions in july but traders werent 
willing to bet heavily on the usda numbers 
the pattern of trading ahead of a crop report is generally 
quiet said walter spilka an analyst in new york with smith 
barney harris upham amp co

to show about a 38 percent decline in corn production and a 20 
percent drop in soybean production from last years levels 
widespread showers that brought badly needed rain to much of the 
corn belt appeared to be tapering off today and may support prices 
in the grain markets spilka said 
the weather is beginning to dry out a little now and i think 
well see a warmer drier pattern develop he said

the contract for delivery in september at 378 a bushel corn was

japans merchandise trade surplus rose in july from 
a year earlier for the first time in 15 months the government said 
wednesday 
economists said it was too soon to conclude the steady shrinkage 
in japans surplus had come to an end and they noted that the 
surplus with the united states continued to shrink 
but some noted that japanese companies have been raising export 
prices lately something that tends to swell the surplus 
japans worldwide surplus rose 35 percent to 718 billion from 
694 billion in july 1987 and was also up sharply from the 593 
billion posted in june the finance ministry said 
japans surplus with the united states its biggest trading 
partner shrank 63 percent to 449 billion from 479 billion in 
july 1987 it was up from 363 billion in june of this year 
although the dollar has risen sharply against the japanese yen 
this year helping make japanese goods more competitively priced 
economists said that was probably a relatively small factor in the 
rise in the surplus 
it typically takes more than a year before changes in currency 
rates begin to show up in changes in the volume of goods shipped 
between nations the economists said 
i dont think you can read too much into one months data 
said mitchell held an economist for smith barney harris upham amp 
co in new york 
japanese export prices are rising partly because japans 
domestic economy is growing so strongly that it has created 
shortages of products for export said yoshihisa kitai economist 
for the long term credit bank of japan in new york 
moreover kitai said japanese exporters are beginning to push 
through price increases after having held prices down to avoid 
losing their share of foreign markets 
kyocera corp a maker of ceramic parts for electronics raised 
prices 18 percent earlier this year said thomas chesser a smith 
barney analyst he said kyocera dominates its market so much that 
it can afford to raise prices 
finance ministry officials attributed the widening of the 
surplus partly to increased sales of semiconductors chiefly to 
southeast asia where many japanese companies have shifted assembly 
of electronic products as a way of dealing with higher production 
costs at home 
exports of semiconductors during the month surged 513 percent 
over the previous years level to 111 billion it said 
in the long run once foreign operations are wellstocked the 
movement of manufacturing off shore should begin to shrink the 
surplus 
ministry officials said it was too early to tell if the july 
trade figures signaled a longterm turnaround from more than a year 
of shrinking japanese trade surpluses 
overall japanese exports during the month rose 162 percent to 
2313 billion from 199 billion while imports grew 231 percent 
to 159 billion from 130 billion the ministry said 
exports to the united states rose 40 percent from a year 
earlier to 795 billion while imports rose 214 percent to 346 
billion 
japans surplus with the european community grew from 153 
billion in july 1987 to 197 billion in july this year exports to 
the region rose 296 percent from a year earlier to 412 billion 
while imports grew 307 percent to 215 billion the ministry said 
exports to southeast asia grew 232 percent to 577 billion 
while imports from the region rose 267 percent to 405 billion 
it said 
when seasonally adjusted japans trade surplus rose to 624 
billion from 519 billion the previous month 
japan calculates its trade figures on a customsclearance basis 
which includes transportation and insurance costs in imports but 
not in exports if the costs were added to both japans trade 
surplus would be higher

chrysler corp chairman lee iacocca says he 
holds no grudges against henry ford ii for firing him a decade ago 
preferring to remember the good times they shared like when they 
hunted went to parties or caroused europe together 
my difficulty with henry ford was over long before he died 
last year the 63yearold iacocca wrote in the aug 29 edition 
of fortune magazine which was made public on wednesday 
most people were remembering the last years of his life when 
henry was sick with a bad heart realizing that he was mortal and 
worrying about his health day and night he said i tried to 
remember the years beginning in 1960 when we were buddies 
the grandson of fords founder died about a year ago after more 
than 40 years at the helm of the nations secondlargest automaker 
iacocca who rose to stardom in the auto industry after creating 
the superpopular mustang automobile was fired after more than 20 
years at ford motor co in 1978 he has been at chrysler since then 
and credited for putting the oncetroubled company back on its feet 
with the help of 12 billion in governmentguaranteed loans 
a lot of people told me henry ford ii did me a favor 10 years 
ago by firing me iacocca said in the fivepage fortune article 
he wrote they said that if i had stayed at ford i would have 
been in a comfortable ivory tower the company would have given me 
a gold watch when i retired and that would have been the end of my 
life 
by getting canned in 1978 i got thrown into a situation 
where i became a leader 
iacocca had few kind words to say about henry ford ii in his 
first book iacocca an autobiography but in the fortune 
article he recalled how he and ford hunted together we went to 
parties together we caroused europe together 
i remember the 16 good years and not the two bad ones in 1977 
and 1978

called a decline in his authority 
john m pietruski 55 is the fifth officer of sterling drug 
maker of such products as bayer aspirin and phillips milk of

kodak which acquired the company in march for 51 billion kodak 
based in rochester ny said at the time of the purchase that it 
would leave sterlings organization intact 
the resignation is effective aug 31 
when a publicly owned corporation loses its independence it is 
not unusual for there to be significant changes in the duties of 
the acquired companys chief executive officer pietruski said in 
a letter to sterling employees wednesday now that sterling is no 
longer an independent company i have experienced a similar change 
in my position 
wood said that after sterlings acquisition by kodak in march 
pietruski was named executive vice president of kodak reporting to 
kodak president kay r whitmore

i think thats what that refers to wood said there honestly

responsibility frankly and authority 
wood said pietruskis replacement would be announced on 
thursday among the likely successors are leo jack thomas 
currently vice chairman at sterling and formerly senior vice 
president at kodak

after the stateowned aeromexico plunged into 
bankruptcy last april the government charted a course create a 
new pareddown major airline and let a covey of fledgling carriers 
grow 
but negotiations on the new airline have been slower and more 
complicated than anticipated prolonging uncertainty and say hotel 
operators losses in the crucial travel industry 
the negotiations are being held up by disagreements over the 
extent of the pilots share in the new airline and their future 
role in its management 
the 54yearold aeromexico was one of two airlines that carried 
the bulk of air passengers over mexicos rugged mountainous 
terrain 
in midapril its 43 planes were grounded overnight by a strike 
of ground and technical workers protesting management plans for 
cutbacks travelers were stranded and cities served exclusively by 
aeromexico were left without service 
then less than three weeks later some of its jets were back in 
the air under a limited 90day operation run by the bankruptcy 
trustee a government bank to ease the crisis 
with the new airline delayed the temporary operation has been 
extended 
flights to aeromexicos foreign destinations including new 
york miami houston tucson ariz and madrid spain may not be 
resumed until next year an aviation source said 
crucial to forming the new airline are the 765 pilots who flew 
for aeromexico when the company collapsed flight attendants and 
the 7250 ground workers were fired and given severance pay 
the pilots however still have their contract although they 
are flying only a few hours each with the temporary operation 
their union which also includes pilots of the other major 
airline mexicana has a tentative commitment from the government 
for about 35 percent ownership in the new airline its to be 
called aerolineas mexicanas sa possibly amsa for short 
as part of the governments shedding of its array of 
nonstrategic and unprofitable companies the other 65 percent is 
to be sold to private interests 
pilots and the government are negotiating both a new contract 
and terms for the pilots ownership in the stilltobeformed 
company that will hire them 
the government blamed fat union contracts along with chronic 
losses poor service and the fourday strike for aeromexicos 
financial failure 
the situation of aeromexico was totally unsustainable it no 
longer operated said one industry source who spoke on condition 
he not be identified 
while the government wants to create a more efficient company 
with fewer personnel that would be attractive to private investors 
some businessmen are reported to be wary of an alliance with a 
union representing company employees 
alejandro luna an aeromexico pilot and outgoing head of the 
aviation pilots union counters that employee interest in the 
companys profitability should make it more attractive 
its a guarantee for anyone whos going to invest that its 
labor problems will be at a minimum he said in an interview 
he said the two sides have set a midaugust deadline for 
agreement 
any deal made on aeromexico also could affect the value of the 
governments majority ownership of the betterrun mexicana the 
governments shares in mexicana are expected to be sold once the 
new airline is formed 
officials at the communications and transportation department 
the bankruptcy trustee and the temporary operation either declined 
or did not respond to interview requests 
a department plan published in late may calls for two trunk 
airlines two or three regional airlines for the pacific and 
caribbeangulf of mexico areas and feeder airlines for five 
sectors 
smaller privatelyowned airlines notably aerocalifornia and 
aeromar in the northwest of mexico already are flying some new 
routes and have begun buying new planes 
aeromexico which carried 58 million passengers in 1987 is 
flying onefourth to onefifth of the 250 or so flights a day it 
operated before 
created as a private airline aeromexico absorbed 23 
unprofitable airlines between 1940 and 1960 nationalized in 1959 
it survived on government subsidies for years something considered 
acceptable in mexico until reforms forced by the 6yearold 
economic crisis 
but contract restrictions on work scheduling ample benefits 
the high employeetoplane ratio and other conditions made 
costcutting difficult the industry source said 
say a flight was delayed because of mechanical trouble when 
the plane was ready just one hour of the work day was left he 
said crews decided they wouldnt make the flight or they would 
be paid another full day or the flight would be canceled and many 
details like this 
four percent of flights were canceled last year 35 percent were 
delayed and the aging fleet was constantly in need of maintenance 
the government said 
ironically late last year efficiency measures had improved the 
companys situation 
the flight attendants union blames the losses on frequent 
management changes including four directors in six years capital 
flight due to corruption and a surplus of nonunion employees 
among other reasons 
the disruption definitely has had an impact on business 
guillermo rocha president of the mexican hotel and motel 
association said 
what worries us is that the start of the new airline has been 
postponed he said 
in mexico city hotel occupancy has been running about 60 
percent instead of its usual 85 percent for july and august said 
marcos romano president of the citys hotel association 
there arent enough flights both in the interior as well as 
from the united states to mexico he said 
occupancy in acapulco the biggest pacific beach resort is 
about 60 percent now when it should be booked solid with mexican 
vacationers he said

a frontwheeldrive sports coupe being 
manufactured at the diamondstar motors plant may be distributed in 
japan as mitsubishi motors corp considers joining the reverse 
importers 
japanese auto manufacturers honda nissan and mazda already are 
shipping usmade vehicles back to japan and mitsubishi is 
thinking of shipping its eclipse model to be made here because it 
will not compete with any autos now on the market in japan 
richard recchia executive vice president of mitsubishi motor 
sales of america said tuesday the reverse import plan is being 
considered 
imported cars are beginning to get strong in japan recchia 
told the bloomington pantagraph 
the diamondstar plant is a joint venture between chrysler corp 
and mitsubishi motors of japan the sports coupes produced in 
normal will be 1990 models available at plymouth and mitsubishi 
dealers in january 
a decision on exporting the eclipse would be made within six 
months and will depends on whether the domestic dealer network 
over there wants it recchia told the newspaper 
if the eclipse is shipped overseas he said it will involve 
small numbers and will occur later next year or in early 1990 
toyoo tate president of mitsubishi recently told the los 
angelese times his company was thinking of importing from the 
united states 
he said the eclipse was a perfect candidate because it is 
different from anything on the market in japan 
we will be making a completely different kind of sporty car in 
the united states than we make in japan tate said 
recchia said production of a convertible also is being studied 
at the diamondstar plant with a decision expected by next spring 
the biggest problem is the passiverestraint seatbelt laws 
convertibles are difficult to put those in if we can solve the 
problem in an economic way we could produce a convertible he 
said 
fullscale production begins in september at the 650 million 
diamondstar plant about 875 employees already are at work 
producing pilot cars and gearing up for the offical start of the 
assembly line

consumer prices rose 17 percent in july the 
smallest monthly increase in seven years the central bank of 
mexico announced 
inflation for the first seven months of the year reached 433 
percent the bank said while the annual inflation rate from july 
of 1987 was 1223 percent 
the government started an economic solidarity pact with business 
and labor last december to control inflation which soared by a 
record 1592 percent for 1987 
the central banks report said the latest figures showed the 
pact continues being successful in bringing down the inflationary 
process 
consumer prices had risen 2 percent in june 19 percent in may 
31 percent in april 51 percent in march 83 percent in february 
and a record 155 percent in january 
the biggest contributors to the increase in the latest report 
issued tuesday night were an 116 percent increase in fresh meat 
prices and 74 percent in rents 
the banks report noted decreases in 82 of the 302 categories 
tracked for the consumer price index among them a 1 percent 
decline in health and personal care shoes and clothing fell 05 
percent and transportation fell 02 percent 
a key component of the inflationfighting program is a freeze on 
the minimum wage prices of governmentregulated goods and services 
and the exchange rate of the peso currency 
critics of the solidarity pact say it was intended to 
artifically control inflation to ease unrest before july general 
elections without correcting any of the problems that are the 
basic causes

the reagan administration said wednesday it 
has postponed action until the end of the year on a request by us 
ball bearing manufacturers for protection from imports 
commerce secretary c william verity said president reagan 
directed the commerce and defense departments to assess recent 
efforts to improve the competitiveness of the ball bearing industry 
before a decision is made on import restrictions 
in july 1987 the antifriction bearing manufacturers 
association filed a petition seeking protection under a 1962 law 
designed to protect industries vital to national defense 
the petition alleged that high levels of imports are seriously 
weakening the domestic bearing industrys defense production 
capabilities verity said in a statement 
the administration is currently taking a number of steps 
to better enable the domestic bearing industry to improve its 
production capabilities he said 
among the steps are new regulations requiring defense 
contractors to use only usmanufactured ball bearings and a 
program to encourage the industry to modernize 
because the administrations actions are expected to improve 
the bearing industrys ability to meet national security 
requirements the president is withholding a final decision at 
this time verity said

the jolt applied to interest rates by the 
federal reserve singed financial markets again wednesday as 
traders from tokyo to wall street sweated over the prospects for a 
global interestrate spiral 
the day started with a violent reaction in japan where the 
already volatile nikkei index of 225 selected issues posted its 
biggest loss since november the index plummeted 61549 points or 
22 percent to close at 2755487 
when trading shifted to london the financial timesstock 
exchange 100share index echoed those rumblings by shedding 227 
points or 12 percent to 18399 
and in new york the dow jones average of 30 industrials fell 
4499 points to close at 203414 after a loss of more than 28 
points the previous day 
the dow had been off slightly more than 50 points with an hour 
of trading to go wednesday but that descent was stalled when the 
new york stock exchange triggered its postcrash collar on program 
trading 
the markets began reeling in the united states on tuesday after 
the federal reserve unexpectedly announced it was raising a key 
lending rate the 05 percent increase in the discount rate to 65 
percent put the fee the fed charges member banks for shortterm 
loans at its highest level in more than two years 
interestrate worries then swept overseas to tokyo hitting a 
market that some experts said was poised for a selloff 
noboru terashima head of research at shearson lehman hutton 
asia inc in tokyo said the feds decision hastened the 
inevitable for the japanese market which had lately shown signs of 
instability 
many observers said markets overseas were caught by surprise and 
may have overreacted many investors around the world had assumed 
the fed would refrain from taking any interestrate action until 
after novembers presidential election 
but with the feds decisive antiinflation move theres 
worry on worldwide basis that everybody is competing with interest 
rates as their weapon said hugh johnson senior vice president 
at first albany corp 
japan britain and west germany all have taken action recently 
to push up shortterm interest rates and more hikes are expected 
that makes markets fairly nervous even though cooperation 
among the major western trading nations hasnt broken down said 
johnson 
if interest rates become a drawing card for us securities 
some of the money siphoned out of japans stock market could find 
its way into american markets 
theres no doubt that japanese portfolio managers have an 
ongoing appetite for usdollar assets and this increased rate 
differential makes them attractive said ronald solberg a vice 
president and senior international economist at security pacific 
national bank in los angeles 
the japanese governments longterm bond is carrying a yield of 
about 54 percent compared with a return well over 9 percent on 
the us treasurys bellwether 30year issue 
indeed in the long run rate hikes can help stabilize the 
financial markets by calming inflation worries 
but in the immediate aftermath of the feds action fear appears 
to be overwhelming investors 
with the dow down 5050 points late in the trading session 
wednesday the new york stock exchange said it banned member firms 
from using computer trading systems for index arbitrage the most 
prevalent form of program trading 
the socalled collar used for the sixth time since it was 
approved as a temporary measure in april bans the use of the 
exchanges computer system for index arbitrage on days when the dow 
average rises or falls 50 points from the previous close 
in the credit markets bond prices tumbled as their yields 
soared the treasurys 30year bond plunged 1750 per 1000 in 
face value its yield surged to 936 percent a level not seen 
since last december from 919 percent late tuesday 
the dollar which initially rallied on the interest rate news 
pulled back amid some profittaking however dealers said the 
dollars fall was broken by the prospect for higher interest rates

to a sweetened 5 billion friendly takeover bid from batus inc 
and batus pledged to continue a hostile bid for the insurer if 
management refuses to negotiate 
batus which is based in louisville boosted its cash offer on 
tuesday for a negotiated merger from 63 a share to 72 a share and 
gave management until aug 19 to respond 
farmers announced it would study the offer with an eye to the 
best interests of shareholders but treasurer jerry faulwell hinted 
the higher price was unlikely to overcome management opposition to 
the bid from the tobacco and retailing company 
among management concerns are that farmers could end up helping 
pay off the loans needed to finance the buyout and oftvoiced 
worries that the insurer might end up sharing costs of tobacco 
liability suits against batus 
i dont know of any reason why our position with regard to 
having certain noneconomic misgivings about this offer have 
changed faulwell said 
the 72ashare offer for a managementsanctioned buyout is 
distinct from batus 63ashare tender offer to the owners of 
farmers stock submitted in january and scheduled to expire 
thursday 
farmers has 684 million shares outstanding and employees have 
options to buy an additional 15 million shares putting the 
potential cost to batus at 5 billion 
on wednesday batus a subsidiary of bat industries plc of 
britain hinted the tender offer to shareholders would be extended 
beyond its thursday expiration deadline but the company said it 
didnt intend to boost the price in the tender offer beyond 63 a 
share 
as of july 15 holders of 31 percent of farmers shares had 
offered to sell to batus the company said 
farmers with 11 billion in assets is the nations 
thirdlargest home and auto insurer and seventhbiggest property 
and casualty insurer 
batus has retailing operations led by saks fifth avenue stores 
and its brown amp williamson tobacco corp makes kool viceroy and 
other cigarette brands 
farmers has been battling batus in hearings before insurance 
regulators in nine states where a takeover needs government 
approval 
arizona regulators approved a merger and ohio gave conditional 
approval oregon idaho and washington have rejected batus and 
california regulators rejected it only to have the decision 
overturned by a state judge 
decisions or hearings are pending in texas illinois and kansas 
and the decisions already made in other states are in various 
stages of appeal by both companies

nearly two months 
on other commodity markets stockindex futures plunged 
precious metals advanced grains and soybeans were higher and 
energy futures were mixed 
meatpackers in western kansas and texas paid up to 69 cents a

delivery of live cattle settled 117 cents higher at 6942 cents a 
pound and the october contract gained 150 cents the maximum 
movement allowed by the exchange 
what pushed the futures market up was the speculation and 
speculation is the key word here that the cash market might go 
to 6950 or 70 morgan said 
but market bears believe packers now have enough cattle on hand 
to satisfy the labor day demand and will become less aggressive in 
their bidding he said 
the livecattle rally spread to the neighboring feeder cattle 
pit where limit gains also were recorded and the pork pits most 
frozen pork belly contracts gained 2 cents a pound the limit in 
that market

safe investments in a turbulent economy 
silver got an additional boost from ideas that a resolution was 
near in the 3weekold miners strike in peru said bette 
raptopoulos precious metals analyst in new york with 
prudentialbache securities inc 
a scheduled vote thursday in the house of representatives on a 
proposal for stronger trade sanctions against south africa gave

ongoing discussions between the united states and thailand and 
indonesia 
our goal is not trade retaliation but the recognition and 
granting of our intellectual property rights 
worldwide divergences over how to protect intellectual 
property patents and copyrights have led the administration

the commerce department has notified us makers 
and users of semiconductors that it will be more flexible in its 
treatment of alleged dumping of memory chips by japanese companies 
it was announced wednesday 
the changes are designed to avoid unintended situations in which 
the commerce department rules required japanese companies to price 
their chips artificially high 
japanese chipmakers will be allowed to spread out their costs of 
introducing a new kind of chip over an appropriate length of 
time instead of having to raise prices enough to recoup all their 
costs in the first three months the commerce department said 
also chipmakers will also be allowed to spread out their costs 
over longer than three months when they start up a new line to 
produce an existing product line 
the changes apply to the two kinds of chips covered by a 1986 
antidumping agreement between the united states and japan namely 
dynamic random access memories drams and erasable programmable 
readonly memories eproms 
the commerce department informed the semiconductor industry 
association and the american electronics association of its 
decisions in a letter tuesday and those organizations issued 
statements on wednesday supporting the decisions 
the government changes would mainly benefit companies that use 
chips which have suffered from the unintended price spikes caused 
by the old commerce department rules 
the semiconductor industry association which consists of chip 
producers went along with the american electronics association in 
requesting the changes in a june 21 letter to the government 
because of an interest in creating harmony in the electronics 
industry 
allen moore the undersecretary of commerce for international 
trade said in his letter that the unified approach of your two 
organizations is an integral element of developing sound public 
policy approaches

an attorney who was a central figure in the 
socalled yuppie five insider trading ring has been sentenced 
to four months in prison by a judge who also contended the lawyer 
should be disbarred 
you completely disrupt the forces of the free market and help 
to create incredible cynicism among the general populace us 
district judge john keenan said before sentencing attorney michael 
david on tuesday 
david pleaded guilty in november 1986 to four criminal counts 
for his part in an insider trading scheme with three other wall 
street professionals and an investor 
the five who all have pleaded guilty to various charges all 
were in their 20s at the time of the indictment 
david has admitted stealing clients confidential corporate 
information from the law firm he once worked at and passing it on 
to the others 
the case was unrelated to insider trading cases involving ivan 
f boesky and dennis b levine 
david 30 of manhattan the last of the yuppie five to 
plead guilty after keenan denied his pretrial motions in late 
1986 pleaded guilty to conspiracy securities fraud mail fraud 
and obstruction of a securities and exchange comnmission 
investigation 
defense attorney darrell fennell asked for leniency saying that 
david once an associate at the the prominent new york law firm of 
paul weiss rifkind wharton and garrison faces disbarment and 
has been driving a cab to support himself 
visibly irritated keenan countered i dont think anyone 
should confuse the practice of law with a right its a 
privelege 
the very least he should face as far as im concerned is 
disbarment said keenan 
fennell said david was not a classic insider trader because 
he had not traded on the secret information he stole and did not 
make any illegal profits 
but assistant us attorney carl h loewenson jr said david 
was trying to make contacts and get a job in the arbitrage 
community arbitragers speculate on the stock of corporations 
that are potential merger or takeover targets 
david dressed in a dark gray suit told keenan before sentence 
was imposed that he regretted his conduct and asked the judge for 
an opportunity to help rebuild my life as i have tried to do 
keenan sentenced david to four months in prison and four years 
probation and said he would have imposed a longer jail term if not 
for davids cooperation with federal investigators 
lowenson said david had cooperated extensively for almost two 
years with federal investigators and would be an important 
government witness if there were any future trials arising from the 
probe 
keenan did not impose a fine but david faces civil penalties of 
between 50000 and 150000 under an sec consent agreement
