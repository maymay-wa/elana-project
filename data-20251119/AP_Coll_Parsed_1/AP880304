government efforts to curb the flow 
of smuggled drugs have failed and may have actually boosted profits 
for latin american cocaine and marijuana growers a rand corp 
study said thursday 
latin american drug producers make money whether the drugs are 
successfully smuggled or intercepted said the study by the private 
thinktanks national defense research institute if the drugs are 
intercepted more must be shipped 
thus we conclude that cocaine interdiction has probably 
increased the export earnings of producers in bolivia colombia and 
peru the study said 
the us government has tripled its spending to battle smuggling 
and has seized more narcotics but an even greater amount is 
getting through to meet demands of american drug users who can pay 
higher prices the study said 
the study noted that from fiscal 1981 to fiscal 1985 seizures 
of cocaine rose from less than 2 metric tons to more than 25 metric 
tons while seizures of marijuana were halved from 4000 metric 
tons to 2000 metric tons 
meantime the study said the amount of cocaine believed to be 
reaching the united states rose from between 38 and 68 metric tons 
in 1981 to between 111 and 153 metric tons in 1985 the latest year 
for which figures were available 
for marijuana the amount reaching the united states rose from 
between 8700 and 12700 metric tons in 1981 to between 9447 and 
12228 metric tons in 1985 
the study said it based its figures on estimates from the us 
drug enforcement administration 
from fiscal 1981 to fiscal 1986 federal spending on 
interception of drugs rose from 237 million to 801 million the 
study said

the house on thursday rejected a package of 
30 million in humanitarian aid for nicaraguas contras and for 
young victims of the war the proposal had been pushed by democrats 
as an alternative to military aid for the rebels 
the final vote of 216208 was a defeat for house speaker jim 
wright and his democratic lieutenants who had sought to craft a 
package that would diffuse pressure for future military aid for the 
rebels but it also damaged administration hopes that the contras 
whose last us aid ran out tuesday could be given any new 
infusion of aid in the near future 
liberal democrats opposed to the contras joined republicans who 
thought the package too weak in voting it down 
house action came just a month after the house rejected 
president reagans request for both humanitarian and military aid 
the democratic package had included money for food clothing 
medicine and shelter for the antisandinista rebels and a 14 
million program of aid for children injured in the nicaraguan civil 
war 
reagan welcomed the vote but wright dtexas said it may prove 
a somewhat pyrrhic victory for republicans wright said he had 
no immediate plans to revive a contra aid plan and other democrats 
vowed to make any new try for aid difficult 
as far as im concerned it ought to be a damned lengthy 
process said rep david obey dwis chairman of the house 
appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over the matter and 
a contra opponent 
this has effectively stopped aid for the near future added 
rep steny hoyer dmd 
in a written statement reagan called on congress to act 
urgently to develop an aid package which is effectively deliverable 
and of sufficient quantity to sustain the nicaraguan freedom 
fighters 
if not the prospects for peace and democracy inside nicaragua 
will diminish quickly reagan said 
the house had set up a procedure under which the 
democratwritten package would come before the chamber as an 
amendment to a competing but similar republican bill it was 
adopted on a vote of 215 to 210 replacing the gop version but 
minutes later the entire package was defeated on a final vote the 
house never voted on the republican plan 
rep mickey edwards rokla who led the republican debate 
said supporters of contra aid were never given an option they could 
support 
this plan didnt do anything he said it was just a 
lousy lousy bill we were saying we werent going to vote for it 
and they didnt believe it 
as he returned to the white house from a nato summit in 
brussels belgium reagan said im very happy when asked about 
the defeat of the democratic package spokesman marlin fitzwater 
explained the president meant he was happy to have another chance 
to work on an adequate package of humanitarian aid for the freedom 
fighters 
however a spokeswoman for the contras said in miami that the 
leadership of the nicaraguan resistance a contra umbrella group 
had wanted the measure to pass 
every time the united states turns its back on the contras it 
puts us in a less favorable position said contra spokeswoman 
marta sacasa the sandinistas will become even more intransigent 
and more hard line 
we are fighting against an enemy that doesnt have these kinds 
of problems the aid from the soviet union has not stopped flowing 
to the sandinistas ms sacasa said 
the sandinista government hailed the vote and called for direct 
talks between reagan and nicaraguan president daniel ortega 
the vote must contribute to the peace efforts taken by the 
presidents of the central american countries a statement 
released by government spokesman manuel espinoza said 
reagan in a letter from brussels said the democratic plan 
does not meet the essential criteria of maintaining military 
pressure on the sandinistas 
wright called the dispute over the aid package a battle for 
peace in nicaragua and for a constructive role for the united 
states in central america as opposed to a destructive role 
reagan in his letter agreed that the vote represented a 
watershed in our policies toward central america but he said the 
democratic proposal would have led to rapid debilitation of the 
resistance and further encouragement of sandinista intransigence 
the republican alternative he said would ave kept alive 
prospects for democracy and meaningful talks toward peace 
the democratic package included about 16 million in food 
clothing medicine and shelter for the rebels intended to last at 
least through june and 14 million to set up a fund to help 
children injured in the sevenyear nicaraguan civil war 
on feb 3 the house defeated 219211 a 362 million reagan 
proposal that included money for weapons and other military 
equipment 
in debate thursday both sides argued that their version would 
best enhance a central american peace process 
our opportunity today is to construct a united position on 
nicaragua policy for the first time in eight years said rep lee 
hamilton dind a sponsor of the democratic package 
it says to the contras that the united states is not going to 
provide them the means to make war but neither is the united 
states going to turn away from them hamilton said 
but rep william broomfield rmich called the proposal a 
surrender package it could turn the freedom fighters into refugees 
in their own country 
ceasefire talks between the two warring sides were stalled as 
the debate occurred in congress 
but nicaraguan president daniel ortega proposed for the first 
time holding highlevel direct talks inside nicaragua without 
cardinal miguel obando y bravo who has been serving as a mediator 
the contras agreed to a meeting but only if obando were included 
as a witness and guarantor 
in seeking to craft a majority for their package democrats were 
faced with challenges from at least two sides they needed the 
votes of moderates who were reluctant to totally abandon the 
rebels believing that they provide useful pressure to keep the 
sandinistas bargaining in good faith 
they also needed the votes of the partys liberal wing most of 
whom have steadfastly refused to vote for aid to the rebels in any 
form 
party leaders argued that passage of this purely 
humanitarian aid bill would lessen chances that reagan could 
come back to congress soon with a request for weapons and 
ammunition to sustain the contras 
the republican alternative contained more money for the rebels 
about 22 million and placed fewer restrictions on the way the 
contras could use the aid allowing purchase of nonlethal military 
supplies the gop package also contained a childrens aid fund 
similar to that proposed by democrats 
the gop package also would have permitted the president to ask 
for military aid any time after april 15 and would have expedited 
action on such a request 
even before the house acted white house chief of staff howard 
baker said the administration would go to the senate for whatever 
it failed to obtain in the house we have good strength in the 
senate he said 
republicans noted that the democratic bill would turn over 
responsibility for delivery of the supplies to the defense 
department rather than the existing ciarun supply network even 
if the pentagon retained the private contractors now used by the 
cia to make supply flights us military personnel would have to 
be present in the region to oversee them edwards said 
the republican alternative would have left the delivery of 
supplies in the hands of the cia

the deaths of 14 hospital patients from 
tainted drugs has prompted an investigaton of indias 
pharmaceutical industry and accusations that health is being 
sacrificed to greed and corruption 
adulterators and purveyors of death move freely in society 
heads high said judge bakhtavar lentin of the bombay high court 
who led the 17month inquiry 
he finished nearly three months ago but his findings have not 
been made public the 14 patients who were from the lower middle 
class and ranged in age from 10 to 75 died two years ago from the 
effects of tainted glycerol a drug used to treat edema or 
abnormal swelling 
failure of the maharashtra state government to release the 
report has encouraged charges of slipshod manufacturing in indias 
16000 drug companies and of government connivance in certifying 
substandard drugs 
chief minister sb chavan the highest elected official of 
maharashtra appointed lentin as an investigating magistrate but 
the government is not obligated to prosecute on the basis of his 
report and the law does not require the report to be made public 
lentin has pressed to have his findings made public chavan said 
the report will be presented to the legislature in march but has 
not given a date 
state governments certify drugs in india and 60 percent of the 
industry is located in maharashtra a western state of which bombay 
is the capital some other states also use the maharashtra 
government laboratory for drug certification 
indias drug business is worth 18 billion a year and exports 
total 203 million of that but there is no indication tainted 
products have been exported 
most finished medicines go to the soviet union africa the 
middle east and southeast asia bulk drugs also are sold to 
manufacturers in europe the united states and australia 
indubhai a modi president of the indian drug manufacturers 
association said all companies are being blamed for the shoddy 
work done by a few small ones according to figures presented to 
parliament 14 percent of indian drugs tested in 198687 were 
substandard 
dr arun bal secretary of the association for consumer action 
on safety and health says about 40000 drug formulations are 
produced in india compared with 250 the world health organization 
describes as essential 
even the federal drug controller does not have an exact 
figure he said this is ridiculous 
the industry has been under attack since the 14 patients died in 
january 1986 at the governmentrun jamshetjee jejeebhoy hospital in 
bombay after being given glycerol contaminated with toxic 
diethylene glycol 
lentins inquiry took testimony from 120 witnesses and charges 
of perjury were lodged against a former state health minister and 
four other people the investigation was conducted in public not a 
common practice in india and unearthed facts embarrassing to state 
officials 
one was that the tainted glycerol originally was labeled 
industrial glycerine was substandard even for that category 
and went through several middlemen before being packed for hospital 
use 
charges were made that employees of the state food and drug 
administration sometimes drank rather than tested samples of 
country liquor or illicit alcohol sent for analysis 
there were complaints that agency employees demanded bribes a 
drug company owner j sipahilalani testified diwali comes more 
than once every year for fda officers diwali is an indian 
holiday on which gifts are given 
the most sensational revelation a list of 582 drugs declared 
substandard but still on the market became known as the fda 
murder book among the products were medicines used for typhoid 
and for serious diarrhea often a cause of death among indian 
infants 
included were drugs made by major indian companies and 
subsidiaries of multinational manufacturers parke davis raptakos 
brett rallis india roche products and lupin laboratories 
some companies whose products were listed described the defects 
as minor and said they were caused by later handling not 
manufacturing 
vh bhat a spokesman for roche said chipped sugar coating on 
vitamin tablets could be due to mishandling by persons concerned 
or in transport cm hattangadi president of parke davisindia 
said some tablets found to contain less than the stated amount of 
ingredients were a stray case that could be due to high 
humidity high temperature or poor transport arrangements 
state officials concede privately that proper procedures were 
not followed in buying the tainted glycerol and said some fda 
employees have been suspended 
a senior doctor at jamshetjee jejeebhoy hospital said a report 
in 1972 recommended changes in hospital rules for buying and using 
medicines but it was not implemented he spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
drug makers say indian drugs have been instrumental in 
increasing the average life span of indians from 32 years in 1947 
to 54 today and that the more than 600 percent increase of exports 
in a decade was achieved by quality 
we want spurious drug manufacturers prosecuted for murder

microscopic minority why paint us all black

ibrahim radaydehs name is 
scrawled on walls all over town he is a marked man and knows it 
his fellow palestinians may kill him as an informer 
palestinians suspected of collaborating with israel have been 
attacked by their neighbors one was lynched 
it is a sign of the spread and greater organization of the arab 
uprising that began 12 weeks ago in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip 
israel was shocked when other villagers in qabatiyeh hanged 
mohammed ayad from a utility pole and burned his house during the 
fivehour rampage last week ayad fired on the crowd with an 
israeliissue uzi submachine gun killing a 4yearold boy 
the palestine liberation organization applauded the lynching in 
leaflets distributed in the west bank 
arsonists have burned shops or homes of other suspects many of 
whom have been identified by name on a pirate arabiclanguage radio 
station 
about two dozen palestinians have renounced connections with 
israel over mosque loudspeakers in the past two weeks handed over 
israelisupplied weapons to village leaders and received letters 
saying they have reformed the arabrun palestine press service 
reported 
it said most west bank villages are believed to have a few 
collaborators although the agency estimated they total less 1 
percent of the 800000 arabs in the territory 
residents say there are about 10 suspects in obediyeh a town of 
7000 people on the outskirts of bethlehem the main job of 
informers in the current turmoil is to give israeli authorities the 
names of activists in their villages 
some work for money special privileges or promotions in their 
jobs in israel others became informers in exchange for shorter 
sentences after they were arrested 
israeli soldiers have done little to help the collaborators and 
leaders of both major parties have said that may cost israel the 
few allies it has among palestinians 
as a jew and a soldier i am ashamed former defense 
minister ariel sharon of the rightwing likud bloc said after ayad 
was lynched how could we have left this man without help for so 
many hours this was a moral failure 
amnon linn a legislator from the centerright labor party 
said now every arab in the occupied territories knows this is 
what he can expect if he is working with us to achieve peace 
radaydeh 41 is suspected of helping his nephew ali abu bakr 
give the israelis information abu bakr is said to have bragged 
about a year ago that he worked with the army 
his neighbors were willing to overlook it then but not now in 
the heat of the uprising 
he threeroom home where he lived with his wife and six 
children was gutted by fire last week and he fled the town his 
burnedout car still sits outside the shell 
if abu bakr tries to come back here he will be massacred 
said an elderly man barefoot and wearing a long robe who gave his 
name only as khalid parents whose sons were arrested will be 
after him 
some villagers said they had suspected radaydeh for months but 
most became convinced he was a collaborator only last weekend when 
he was seen standing on a dirt road watching about 100 masked 
villagers protest 
no soldiers were there but the next night troops entered town 
and arrested 32 of the protesters 
that was enough for radaydehs neighbors spraypainted messages 
like this appeared on the walls of homes throughout obediyeh we 
warn collaborators like ibrahim radaydeh to flee as soon as 
possible beware hypocrites 
one protester who not at home when the soldiers came was 
31yearold jamil who would not give his last name 
collaborators are worse than the israelis he said they 
are an internal enemy they know everything and can do more harm 
radaydeh has no future in this village 
jamil stood outside a friends house watching the road for signs 
of israeli army jeeps 
during an interview in his home radaydeh insisted on his 
innocence he squinted nervously smoking a cigarette 
i want you to write that i went to a bethlehem newspaper and 
asked them to publish an announcement denouncing my nephew abu 
bakr he said i think collaborators should be lynched i want 
the plo to know i am not one these are rumors spread by a few 
vicious children 
his neighbors are unmoved 
mahtar assin the mukhtar or town leader sipped thick sweet 
arabic coffee and said whatever he says the palestinian 
revolution may well take its revenge next on ibrahim if he wants 
to be safe radaydeh should leave obediyeh now

his name didnt appear on the agenda 
but it was on nearly every leaders lips during the first nato 
summit since mikhail s gorbachev assumed power in the kremlin 
three years ago 
gorbachev was a shadow on the wall as president reagan and 
leaders of 15 western democracies tried to size up their potential 
foe 
the twoday session was designed mainly to present a united 
front on key arms control issues before reagan travels to moscow in 
may or june for his fourth summit with the soviet commmist party 
leader 
but the alliance meeting showed how intensely washington and its 
north atlantic treaty organization allies are trying to assess the 
implications of gorbachevs efforts to open up parts of soviet 
society they wonder whether it will help western security or harm 
it 
the meeting also underscored the difference in western views 
particularly between washington and london on one hand and paris 
and bonn on the other about how nato governments should deal with 
gorbachev 
some want to give gorbachev the benefit of the doubt others do 
not 
the issue is important to nato because gorbachev in recent 
months appears to have succeeded in portraying himself to much of 
the west european public as more of a peace seeker than the wests 
leaders 
a gallup poll last year said 58 percent of britons thought 
russia sincerely wanted peaceful relations with nato while only 33 
percent thought its foreign policy initiatives should be treated 
with great suspicion 
the west german magazine der spiegel says that according to 
recent polls conducted on its behalf gorbachev has become the 
first soviet leader to get a higher popularity rating than an 
american president 
the reagan administration is worried about the popularity among 
many west europeans of gorbachevs goal of eliminating all nuclear 
weapons from the european continent 
washington fears that if this happened the transatlantic 
partnership would be severed and western europe would be vulnerable 
to soviet intimidation 
a joint nato declaration thursday noted encouraging signs of 
change in soviet policies and welcomed moves to open up the east 
bloc societies 
but it also said the western nations must look beyond 
pronouncements for tangible and lasting changes that directly 
address the issues that have kept the european continent divided 
for four decades 
this was a reference partly to what the nato countries consider 
to be a systematic denial by the soviets of basic human rights for 
their citizens and in part the soviet military domination of 
eastern europe 
yet for all their words of caution some western leaders appear 
increasingly convinced that gorbachev is genuine in saying he wants 
to establish more peaceful relations with the west at a lower level 
of arms 
gorbachev has opened possibilities that we should take 
advantage of dynamically and boldly thats where the challenge 
lies belgian prime minister wilfried martens told the nato 
conference 
he said the future of europe may depend on the outcome of 
gorbachevs reform efforts 
french president francois mitterrand was quoted by his aides as 
telling the brussels summit that the soviet union was undergoing an 
historic transition 
we must not be naive but we must show flexibility that will 
enable dialogue and which will have an effect on gorbachevs 
actions he said 
last week mitterrand was quoted in a french newspaper interview 
as saying nato should put off plans to modernize some of its 
nuclear weapons in europe in order not to upset the trend of 
improving eastwest relations he did not specifically address this 
in brussels 
most of the other alliance leaders want to go ahead with the 
weapons modernization program 
british prime minister margaret thatcher said after thursdays 
meeting that nato must keep its defenses strong by upgrading 
nuclear as well as nonnuclear weaponry regardless of signs of 
change in the kremlin 
so long as our defense stays sure we have nothing to fear 
from gorbachevs reforms she said

they sat side by side beneath bright 
television lights in a huge government hearing room a vivacious 
student council president and her newfound friend with aids 
the white house commission listened intently as ryan white and 
jill stewart told their stories thursday 
i came face to face with death at 13 years old said ryan 
no one realizes how much he has done for us said jill he 
helps us put life in perspective in so many ways 
it was three years ago when doctors discovered ryan had aids a 
victim of contaminated blood products used to treat his hemophilia 
and gave him six months to live 
but the indiana youngster now 16 and planning for an 
advertising career or maybe architecture refused to accept that 
he told the presidential aids commission that he decided to live 
a normal life to go to school be with my friends and enjoy 
daytoday activities 
im a normal happy teenager again he continued 
hes on azt now a drug that helps prolong the lives of people 
with aids but does not cure the fatal disease 
i have a learners permit i attend sports functions and 
dances i made the honor roll just recently with two as and two 
bs i believe in myself as i look forward to graduating in 
1991 
but it wasnt that way until ryan moved to cicero ind last 
summer three doors up from jill and enrolled at hamilton 
heights high school in nearby arcadia 
in kokomo another indiana town things had not been so good 
because of the lack of education on aids discrimination 
fear panic and lies surrounded me he told the commission 
i was labeled a troublemaker my mom an unfit mother and i was 
not welcome anywhere people would get up and leave so they would 
not have to sit anywhere near me even at church people would not 
shake my hand 
as word of his plight spread around the country ryan started 
making new friends but mostly from far away places 
mayor edward koch of new york was the first public figure to 
give me support he said i met some of the greatest like 
elton john greg louganis max headroom alyssa milano my teen 
idol lyndon king and charlie sheen all of these plus many more 
became my friends but i had very few friends at school 
i tried to ignore the injustice because i knew the people 
were wrong my family and i held no hatred for those people because 
we realized they were victims of their own ignorance we had great 
faith that with patience understanding and education that my 
family and i could be helpful in changing their minds and attitudes 
around 
yet finally they decided to move 
the people in cicero and arcadia had heard of ryan and they 
prepared themselves for him 
jill who aspires to study human genetics next year in college 
or maybe law told about how the 600 students at her school had 
witnessed ryans pain in his former community and how they

partisan squabbling charges of justice for 
sale and milliondollar campaigns have thrown the historically 
clubby even genteel texas supreme court into a political tempest 
as much at issue in the march 8 democratic and republican 
primary campaigns as the nominations for five seats on the 
ninemember court is the reputation of the high court itself 
texas is the last big state to elect its appeals justices 
in unusually highprofile developments over the last year the 
troubled supreme court has seen two justices publicly reprimanded 
two others depart because of disagreement over whether justices 
should be elected or appointed and republicans bidding to achieve 
their first majority on the court 
it is i think without question the most important judicial 
election in texas ever certainly the most important judicial 
election in over 100 years said thomas phillips the only 
republican chief justice this century 
phillips was appointed to the court by gop gov bill clements 
who said the judge represents the first volley in the fight for a 
judicial selection in texas in which merit and fairness are the 
determining factors in the selection of supreme court justices 
phillips a houston district judge succeeded democrat john 
hill who resigned to return to private practice and champion the 
cause of an appointed appellate judiciary hill charges that the 
election process leads to big donations from lawyers who have cases 
before the court 
cbstvs 60 minutes did a segment on the court late last 
year titled is texas justice for sale 
hills resignation was followed by that of justice robert 
campbell who argued that appointing judges is a mere scheme to 
give big business interests the power to control our courts 
clements again appointed a republican judge barbara culver of 
midland to replace campbell giving the gop two supreme court 
justices for the first time this century 
neither phillips nor ms culver has an opponent in the 
republican primary and they are expected to lead the socalled gop 
court reform slate which hopes to capitalize on negative publicity 
to defeat democrats in november 
justice william kilgarlin for example was publicly admonished 
by the state commission on judicial conduct last june the 
commissions report listed kilgarlins failure to require staff 
members to observe proper ethical standards and the solicitation of 
funds 
kilgarlin dismissed the criticism as insignificant and 
immediately announced for reelection 
only recently campaign reports showed that kilgarlin and 
justice ted robertson had received 25000 apiece in january from 
joe jamail the lead attorney for pennzoil co in its lawsuit 
against texaco inc two months after the supreme court upheld a 
multibilliondollar verdict favoring pennzoil 
jamail and his family have contributed 288000 to sitting 
supreme court justices since 1980 
kilgarlins opponent in the democratic primary is state district 
judge carol haberman a former san antonio city council member 
republicans seeking that seat are justice nathan hecht of the 
5th court of appeals in dallas d camille dunn of the 1st court of 
appeals in houston and ronald block a houston attorney who lives 
in missouri city 
dallas lawyer john humphreys opposes robertson in the democratic 
primary for chief justice 
the democrats avoided a possible partysplitting campaign 
between former us rep jack hightower and former state sen lloyd 
doggett when hightower switched to a race with no democratic 
opponent he will face ms culver in november 
doggett is opposed by state district judge marsha anthony of 
houston who became known statewide three years ago when she 
declared the states no pass no play rule unconstitutional that 
ruling was reversed by the state supreme court 
republicans george barbary a dallas attorney and justice paul 
murphy of the 14th court of appeals in houston oppose each other in 
the race for that seat on the court 
the late entry of san antonio lawyer art vega spoiled justice 
raul gonzalezs previously uncontested bid for the democratic party 
nomination gonzalez is the first hispanic elected to statewide 
office in texas 
justice charles ben howell also of the 5th court of appeals in 
dallas is unopposed in the gop primary for that seat howell lost 
a supreme court race in 1986

estimates by the agriculture department show 
that farmers will have received about 9 billion in direct federal 
subsidies by the end of march for participating in 1987 commodity 
programs 
part of the payments has been in cash but most has been in 
generic certificates that can be redeemed for surplus commodities 
held by the departments commodity credit corp 
another installment was announced thursday milton hertz 
executive vice president of the ccc said farmers who participated 
in last years feed grain program will get about 145 billion in 
government deficiency payments this month 
hertz said the payments will include about 13 billion for corn 
farmers and 225 million for sorghum producers all in certificates 
under the program deficiency payments are required when average 
market prices fall below a prescribed target price the payments 
make up the difference between the target and the market price or 
support level whichever is higher 
in addition to the 145 billion due this month corn producers 
received about 26 billion in advance payments for 1987 
participation and sorghum producers got advances of 225 million 
according to figures supplied by the departments agricultural 
stabilization and conservation service which is headed by hertz 
total deficiency payments for 1987 crops may be around 12 billion 
slightly less than the 126 billion paid to farmers under 1986 
programs 
counting the payments for feed grains announced thursday 
payments through march are expected to total about 9 billion with 
the possibility of an additional 3 billion to come as final 
settlements for 1987 participation 
the feed grain deficiency payments are expected to reach about 
73 billion for 1987 other projections included totals for 
sorghum 612 million barley 294 million oats 19 million 
wheat 32 billion upland cotton 861 million and rice 568 
million 
in addition to the deficiency payments farmers also can qualify 
in some cases for diversion payments to remove additional land 
from crop production for 1987 those are expected to total more 
than 16 billion including corn 144 billion sorghum 137 
million barley 31 million and oats 8 million 
there were no diversion payments for wheat cotton and rice

women who bear premature babies can provide 
more milk for their infants by not smoking during lactation 
according to an agriculture department scientist 
physiologist judy m hopkinson said she instructed mothers who 
delivered babies eight to 12 weeks early to empty both breasts at 
least six times a day she said 23 of the nonsmoking mothers or 
80 percent maintained enough milk after the infants went home but 
only three of the 11 mothers who smoked or 27 percent continued 
to produce enough milk 
hopkinson works at the departments childrens nutrition 
research center at baylor college of medicine in houston her 
findings were reported here thursday by the departments 
agricultural research service 
in nonsmokers low milk production is usually due to mothers 
not pumping their breasts enough she said generally its not 
a physiological problem 
but smokers have significantly lower milk volume than 
nonsmokers hopkinson said the 11 smokers averaged 11 percent 
less milk during the first two weeks after giving birth and 40 
percent less by the fourth week 
the infants have to be tube fed because they are too immature to 
suck and swallow and mothers want to give them their milk she 
said its one of the few things they can do and its a very 
emotional issue 
but many women who deliver prematurely are not getting the 
appropriate information to produce enough milk hopkinson said 
most of the mothers can increase milk production by pumping more 
frequently five times a day is enough to maintain volume she 
said and eight to 10 times a day will increase milk volume within 
a week or two 
hopkinson said mothers milk is preferred over formula or donor 
milk because it is more suited to the infant and may also enhance 
the infants immunity to infections even so she said for very 
lowbirthweight babies mothers milk must be fortified with extra 
protein and minerals including calcium and phosphorous

many have brushed but only a few have swallowed 
so say researchers who scrutinized medical literature and found 
exactly 31 cases in all recorded history of people somehow managing 
to swallow their toothbrushes 
four of those incidents occurred in durham nc in recent 
years dr allan d kirk of duke university medical center and 
colleagues reported in the march issue of the archives of surgery 
two of the north carolina swallowers apparently had drunk a 
large quantity of alcohol while a third was a 60yearold woman 
who had a seizure while brushing her teeth she complained only of 
throat pain but examination revealed the brush stuck in the 
esophagus and it was removed with forceps 
the fourth victim was a 20yearold woman who developed a 
violent coughing spell while brushing her teeth the brush made its 
way to her stomach and surgeons snared it with a wire dropped down 
through her mouth 
despite the unusual cluster in durham this problem should 
probably not be considered endemic to this part of north 
carolina the researchers wrote 
the other reports of toothbrush swallowing in this country are 
isolated with one each in san francisco tennessee and louisiana 
one region in india reported six such swallowings between 1960 
and 1973 
the champion toothbrush swallower of all time was a soviet 
psychiatric patient who ate 16 of them in 1984 
most toothbrush swallowing has been accomplished in recent 
years although the earliest reported case was in 1882 in hong kong 
in times past swallowing knives was in 
in 1602 for example florian mathis a german barbersurgeon 
removed a knife from the stomach of a 36yearold knife swallower 
who had something go wrong with his trick 
in fact the researchers said knives were the only foreign 
bodies reported removed from the stomach for 207 years then people 
started doing it with forks and spoons too 
but perhaps the no 1 champion swallower of all times was a 
mental patient who had 2533 objects removed from his stomach in 
1927

big ike may stand in the way of 
progress but owners bill and dewayne davis figure the aging 
100foot giant pecan tree is worth a campaign to keep the chainsaws 
at bay 
you can put your arm around six times before you meet 
yourself said dewayne davis 
the tree is in danger of being cut down as part of a project to 
expand us 45 in northern mississippi 
to save their tree the davis brothers and a growing number of 
supporters are waging a campaign that already includes a big 
ike newsletter and save big ike tshirts 
ike which has an average limb span of 84 feet is located on 88 
acres owned by bill of olive branch and dwayne of richmond va 
on the west side of us 45 three miles south of corinth 
the mississippi highway department is widening the highway from 
two to four lanes and needs six acres of the brothers land 
on that six acres sits what is arguably the fifth or sixth 
largest pecan tree of its kind in the world said dewayne 
forestry experts say they are not sure if big ike is a 
record tree but they agree that it is among the largest of its 
kind the tree is on the mississippi forestry commissions list of 
the states largest pecan trees and mississippi historically has 
some of the nations largest pecan trees 
dewayne davis said the tree also had sentimental value 
i was born under that tree in a house right below the tree 
he said i ran into that tree the first time i rode a bicycle 
davis said he had met with representatives of the highway 
department and that officials were attempting to work with him 
there are no villains he said 
davis said that as part of his campaign he wrote letters to 
various officials and contacted an area newapaper 
that cut loose a real groundswell of support he said 
he said he had received calls and letters offering support and 
a fourthgrade class at kossuth elementary school adopted the tree 
davis said he forwarded the information to gov ray mabus who owns 
a tree farm and began sending out the newsletters and the tshirts 
puckett wilson of the governors staff a selfproclaimed tree 
fanatic said the governor will do anything within reason to 
save the tree 
i think its going to come out happy said davis

what was to have been us rep pat 
swindalls dream house has turned into a political albatross 
dripping with threatened lawsuits and leaving the congressman 
battling suggestions of moneylaundering 
swindall designed the 12500squarefoot house for him and his 
wife kimberly near stone mountain state park 
the ultimate irony is i started out wanting to build a log 
cabin said the republican congressman 
nine subcontractors have filed liens against the property and 
swindall has appeared before a federal grand jury investigating an 
accused money launderer who once lent the congressman money 
swindall a lawyer has tried to stay out of court over the 
thousands of dollars in contested bills and said he has asked his 
pastor and his general contractors pastor to help him resolve the 
dispute 
there is a route you ought to follow that is biblically 
prescribed in matthew 18 said swindall first you confront 
the person alone which ive done and he denied everything 
secondly you take them before their church which i intend to do 
i dont think christians ought to be suing other christians 
the threestory mansion built on 13 heavily wooded acres and 
overlooking a small lake has seven bedrooms 7 bathrooms a 
motherinlaw suite a swimming pool a tennis court and a 
threecar garage 
the size and cost of the house was made an issue by ben jones a 
democrat who nearly upset swindalls 1986 reelection bid jones 
said it was built at cut rates by john sauers a political 
supporter tied to the religious right 
swindall 37 laughs at hints of a sweetheart deal from 
sauers his general contractor because the two and numerous 
subcontractors are feuding over unpaid bills 
swindall blames sauers for delays poor workmanship and cost 
overruns that he said tacked 300000 to the price of the house 
their contract was an oral costplus10percent agreement that 
gave sauers unlimited access to swindalls construction account 
the congressman said 
swindall claims sauers whom he fired in november failed to pay 
subcontractors and used the congressmans credit to buy supplies 
for other projects 
sauers denies the charges and says he built swindall a fine 
home the house costs were extremely fair he said adding that 
swindalls claims of shoddy work is like telling van gogh he 
cant paint or michaelangelo he cant sculpt 
rusty johnson a smyrna flooring contractor is among the 
subcontractors who say the congressman owes them money 
you try to pay your taxes then your damn local congressman 
dont pay you said johnson who says swindall owes him 5395 
he said he rejected an offer from swindall to settle at 50 cents on 
the dollar 
swindall said the cost overruns led him to borrow 150000 from 
former atlanta businessman charles lechasney indicted in january 
on federal moneylaundering charges 
while seeking a permanent home loan last fall swindall said he 
negotiated an interim construction loan from lechasney but returned 
the 150000 check after becoming suspicious of him 
swindall voluntarily testified about the loan before a federal 
grand jury last month 
the congressman admits to poor judgment in some dealings 
with sauers but blames part of his predicament on placing too 
much responsibility on my wife 
the house was my wifes project he said

legislation to raise the federal minimum wage 
from 335 an hour to 465 over the next three years has won house 
subcommittee approval but organized labor failed in a bid to tie 
future increases to inflation 
with voting along strict party lines the democraticcontrolled 
house labor standards subcommittee approved the bill on thursday 
the full house education and labor committee plans to take up the 
measure next week 
subcommittee chairman austin j murphy dpa said the current 
minimum of 335 an hour no longer provides the same level of 
opportunity to improve ones life that it once did 
our actions here today represent a step in the right 
direction he said an increase in the minimum wage will 
certainly help many lowwage workers achieve a measure of dignity 
organized labor supports the legislation while the us chamber 
of commerce and the national restaurant association oppose any 
minimum wage increase 
the subcommittee approved the legislation 63 with all the 
democrats for the measure and all the republicans opposed 
democrats earlier defeated several republicansponsored amendments 
either to water down the legislation or kill it outright 
one amendment sponsored by rep thomas e petri rwis would 
have increased the minimum just 65 cents over the next three years 
it was rejected on party lines 
however labor did not gain all it had been seeking over the 
past year the subcommittee on a motion by timothy j penny 
dminn refused on a 72 vote to tie future increases to inflation 
penny said he was concerned about something like this being on 
automatic pilot congress should review any future increases 
he also said automatic increases in the minimum wage could lead 
to higher inflation 
rep augustus f hawkins dcalif chairman of the full 
committee disputed that argument saying wages lag behind 
inflation and will always do so as long as they are based on past 
experience 
a similar bill has been introduced in the senate by sen edward 
m kennedy dmass chairman of the labor and education committee 
the panel has held hearings but has not placed the measure on its 
business agenda yet

legislation broadening the power of banks to 
enter the securities industry but narrowing their opportunities to 
offer insurance would offer a mixed bag to consumers of financial 
services 
the provisions are contained in a bill passed late wednesday by 
the senate banking committee the bill which must go before the 
full senate dismantles most of the barriers between commercial and 
investment banking in place since the depression 
supporters say businesses and state and local governments would 
pay lower underwriting fees because of added competition in the 
securities business they say individual investors would pay lower 
mutual fund fees for the same reason 
home buyers could save as much as 1000 on a 100000 mortgage 
says sen william proxmire dwis chairman of the committee and 
the bills sponsor 
consumer groups are also hailing a section sponsored by sen 
christopher dodd dconn that provides new safeguards on home 
equity loans 
but limits on bank involvement in insurance also sponsored by 
dodd could hamper competition in that field they say 
despite the lopsided 182 vote by the senate committee 
signaling almost certain passage in the full senate similar bills 
in the house face more uncertain prospects there jurisdiction 
over the issue is shared by the energy and commerce and the banking 
committees 
house banking committee chairman fernand j st germain dri 
has expressed great skepticism about allowing banks too many new 
powers 
rep edward j markey dmass chairman of the finance 
subcommittee of the energy and commerce committee has said he 
favors phasing in new powers for banks so federal regulatory 
agencies arent swamped 
it is essential that congress link the introduction of new 
powers to regulatory preparedness he said in a statement 
thursday 
the home equity loan section of the proxmire bill requires 
lenders to disclose the interest rate on loans in a clear and 
uniform manner as well as closing costs and repayment terms it 
also would prohibit lenders from unilaterally changing the terms of 
a home equity line of credit after the contract is signed 
michelle meier an attorney for the consumers union and leslie 
gainer of us pirg a group associated with consumer activist 
ralph nader said in a statement that the proxmire version is an 
improvement over a similar home equity bill in the house which 
does not bar unilateral changes 
another section would make it easier for consumers to shop for a 
place to put their money by requiring banks and mutual funds to 
advertise in a uniform manner the interest rate paid on deposits 
and money market accounts 
under the bill banks would get immediate power to underwrite 
mortgagebacked securities commercial paper and municipal revenue 
bonds 
they would be able to deal in mutual funds and corporate bonds 
six months after enactment but in a concession to the securities 
industry banks would not be allowed to underwrite corporate stock 
viewed by senators as the riskiest securities area unless 
congress authorizes that in a separate vote early in 1991 
on insurance the bill permits state officials to authorize 
statechartered banks and bank holding companies to underwrite 
insurance within their home states but they will not be able to 
sell insurance outside their home state and the bill would close 
loopholes that permit some national banks to sell insurance

former president jimmy carter says he and his 
family would be in danger if secret service protection stopped 
under legislation that a senator says would end the era of the 
imperial former presidency 
elimination of security would make it almost impossible for us 
to live a normal private life at home free of uninvited visitors 
to attend major events if our attendance is publicized or to 
travel to many places in our country or abroad carter said in a 
letter to sen lawton chiles dfla 
he said there were frequent occasions when people have come to 
his hometown of plains ga and threatened him or his family with 
bodily harm 
last fall he said there were three such incidents within a 
month in one case he continued the visitor shattered the large 
glass reflector mirrors and tried to destroy the gate leading to 
his driveway 
there is no way to anticipate when one of them could be 
serious wrote carter 
carters letter and letters from former presidents gerald r 
ford and richard m nixon were made public thursday in a hearing by 
chiles senate government operations subcommittee 
ford said he can do without the federal protection and nixon 
gave up his government security in 1985 
chiles and 14 others have sponsored legislation that would end 
secret service protection of former presidents and their families 
five years after they leave office the bill also would place a 
limit on their office and staff expenses and would phase out 
funding entirely after 10 years 
secret service protection could be extended beyond the fiveyear 
period if the treasury secretary demonstrated a need for continued 
protection 
the american people want former presidents to live a dignified 
retired life as an elder statesman free from any real danger one 
free from the need to commercialize to huckster the office of 
the presidency chiles said but the programs were left 
openended things have gotten out of hand 
he said secret service protection for ford and carter and their 
families cost 8 million in 1986 in nixons last year of 1985 
federal protection cost some 3 million for him 
ford told chiles that he favored enactment of the legislation a 
nixon aide john h taylor said nixon voluntarily gave up the 
lifetime federal protection in august 1985 and mrs nixon did so in 
1984 thus saving the government 3 million annually he believed 
it was no longer appropriate for the taxpayers to bear the cost of 
his security wrote taylor 
michael endicott a secret service agent for 20 years who now is 
in charge of security for nixon said secret service protection 
often limits the recipients freedom of movement he said he has 
never felt nixons safety has been threatened since he began to 
handle his security traveling to cities around the world and 
attending sporting and other public events 
at most of these events we usually sit in the general public 
seats even though vip boxes are usually available he said 
there is more privacy with fewer people we are able to go to 
more ball games now than when he had secret service protection 
the big difference he said is that the secret service must 
protect against the potential threat while i can protect from 
the actual threat 
endicott said he believes there should be a time limit on the 
secret service protection but feels that the federal government 
should continue to be responsible for their protection 
i believe the government should provide funding to the former 
president so that they can manage their own daytoday security 
he said 
carter asked that an adequate level of security be 
continued however he said he would not object if secret service 
experts could reduce the level and cost of his protection 
there is a need for a security or law enforcement presence 
around a former president that naturally flows from occupying the 
most important office in the country he said to finance ones 
own security force however modest is a very expensive matter 
though some of our former highlevel officials have chosen to do 
so

while vice president george bush spoke from 
the steps of the kershaw county courthouse his campaign manager 
was telling reporters how easily bush could withstand a loss in 
saturdays south carolina republican presidential primary 
not many people expect bush to lose to either kansas sen bob 
dole or former television evangelist pat robertson two recent 
polls said bush was running well ahead of dole in this state with 
robertson in third place rep jack kemp was far behind 
but the south carolina vote comes three days before super 
tuesday the day 20 states hold primaries or caucuses most of them 
in the south or bordering the region 
south carolina is going to set the pace bush told the crowd 
gathered on the courthouse lawn 
lee atwater a native of this southern state is a master of 
political spin and he was determined to plant the bush campaign 
view of things with reporters 
the stakes are extremely high on everybody else he said 
robertson has said over and over again that hes going to win 
and if he doesnt win here i dont see anywhere else he could 
win said the bush aide 
as for dole he has the support of sen strom thurmond the most 
popular republican in the state said atwater so if dole cant 
beat bush in south carolina where can he beat him three days later 
on super tuesday 
a bush loss on saturday 
it would not be good said atwater but not all that 
devastating either he says 
youve got dole whos got no organization as far as i can 
tell anywhere in the south hes not running on tv in a lot of the 
states and hes way behind in the polls he went on no one is 
in a position to capitalize if something does happen 
one secret of atwaters success putting spin on political events 
is that there always is a measure of truth in what he says 
while he tries to minimize the impact of a bush loss hes 
probably right about the thinness of the dole organization in the 
south 
it also is hard to argue with his contention that if robertson 
cant win in south carolina he cant win anywhere 
the night the new hampshire votes were counted robertson who 
finished last in the northern new england state said the race was 
moving into his back yard and he flatly predicted hed beat bush 
and dole in south carolina 
the states primary seemed tailormade for robertson the state 
has a large fundamentalist christian community and there are no 
barriers to democrats who want to vote in the gop primary many of 
robertsons supporters are democrats 
but as polls began to come out showing bush with a solid lead in 
the state robertson toned down his optimism 
i have a tremendous uphill fight against george bush said 
the former host of the televisions 700 club hes way way 
ahead of me in the polls 
atwater is cautious in assessing robertsons showing in the 
polls however 
you just cant judge the robertson factor in the polls he 
said 
thurmonds backing and active campaigning gave dole a boost in 
the state a victory on saturday or a strong second would revive 
doles prospects in the region where he is considered weakest 
on the other hand if the kansas senator finishes third it 
would seem to confirm his weakness in the south 
south carolina is another conservative state where kemp hoped to 
find a large enough constituency to establish himself as the 
conservativewing alternative to bush and dole but here as 
elsewhere robertson stood in his way and there seems little 
likelihood that the new york congressman will have any breakthrough 
a lastplace finish for kemp would be the end of the line 
whether or not he stays in the race

in campaign sparring rep richard gephardt has 
accused democratic rival gov michael dukakis of taxing average 
families to close a state budget deficit dukakis for his part 
claims he has cut a record amount in taxes 
both men have a point 
dukakis governor of massachusetts for nine of the past 13 
years has served the state as chief executive in the best and 
worst of times in that period the state has increased taxes by 
about 500 million and cut taxes in a series of steps by more than 
700 million 
as governor dukakis signed all those measures some he 
initiated some he merely tolerated and some he resisted 
in a campaign debate monday night dukakis criticized gephardt 
for his 1981 federal tax bill vote saying the iowa gephardt 
softpedaled that vote 
gephardt shot back asking what about the massachusetts 
dukakis that raised taxes on average families 
dukakis responded by saying he had cut taxes five times in the 
last four years 
but gephardt persisted why did you raise taxes on average 
families in 1974 
in fact massachusetts did raise taxes under dukakis in 1975 
when dukakis took office from a republican governor and inherited a 
530 million deficit in a 4 billion budget 
the deficit forced dukakis to go back on the leadpipe 
guarantee he made in his 1974 campaign not to raise taxes acting 
with the legislature dukakis borrowed 450 million to close the 
gap and put through 110 million in sin taxes and another 350 
million in a surcharge on the states 5 percent income tax 
dukakis also imposed drastic cuts in social spending which 
balanced the budget but which are widely blamed for costing him the 
governorship in 1978 when he was defeated by conservative democrat 
edward j king one of kings top advisers edward reilly is now a 
gephardt strategist 
since dukakis returned to office in 1983 state taxes have been 
reduced by more than 700 million according to frank keefe 
dukakis secretary of administration and finance keefe also notes 
that massachusetts has seen its bond rating improve and the cost of 
state and local government fall to near the bottom of national 
rankings 
i think the governor deserves the reputation of being the 
biggest taxcutter in the history of the commonwealth a record i 
dont think will be matched in two generations keefe said 
dukakis does however have bitter detractors in massachusetts 
prominent among them is barbara anderson executive director of 
citizens for limited taxation a taxfighting group that has been 
supplying ammunition against dukakis to the rival campaigns of 
gephardt and tennessee sen albert gore jr 
anderson said in an interview that if tax cuts are defined as 
any reductions dukakis signed then youd have a wash 
but she argues that dukakis has consistently resisted tax cuts 
over the years and proposed only minor ones she notes that dukakis 
opposed proposition 2 the 1980 ballot question that limited local 
property taxes although she does not note that virtually every 
politician did 
her groups list of grievances against dukakis also includes 
keeping the income tax surcharge for 10 years advocating a 
graduated state income tax in 1976 increasing the capital gains 
tax in 1983 proposing 300 million in business taxes to fund an 
infrastructure bank vetoing a tax cut for senior citizens and 
pushing for a unitary tax on multistate corporations 
but clts biggest complaint involves a protracted complex 
struggle over taxes in 1986 that resulted in repeal of the surtax 
and the imposition by the voters of a cap on state revenues 
anderson claims dukakis resisted both moves at every turn 
richard manley head of the nonpartisan massachusetts taxpayers 
foundation gives dukakis more credit 
i think its fair to say dukakis has never been 
philosophically a guy who wants to cut taxes but i think its also 
fair to say that the surtax part of the 1975 package hung around 
his neck like an albatross manley said 
hes no pal of mine but if you look at the thing objectively 
the fact is the 1975 deficit was inherited and somebody had to 
pay it he said did he repeal the surtax no the legislature 
did he went along but i dont think its fair to say in any 
way that hes a tax raiser

sen albert gore jr entered his first 
attack ad in the super tuesday sweepstakes as two of his 
democratic rivals went at each other over a commercial about 
corporate contributions 
the political tv ads heated up and proliferated thursday in 
preparation for the presidential primaries and caucuses next week 
in 20 states most of them in the south 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis sparked a chain reaction with 
his new ad challenging rep richard gephardts message to the 
little people that its your fight too 
the dukakis ad consists of a rolling list of corporate political 
action committees that have contributed to gephardts campaign 
is dick gephardt really fighting your fight or theirs asks 
the narrator 
gephardt who has been running ads criticizing both dukakis and 
gore for days staged an airport news conference and blasted 
dukakis for questioning his sincerity and record of fighting for 
working people 
im very upset about it gephardt told reporters at 
baltimorewashington international airport ive never made a 
decision in my public life based on pac contributions some who 
are raising money for me were grievously damaged by the 1986 tax 
reform 
gephardt accused dukakis of accepting millions from special 
interests who do business with the state of massachusetts and 
said his campaign would release a partial list on friday 
the dukakis campaign does not take a dime of corporate pac 
money or any money from a lobbyist registered in the state of 
massachusetts responded dukakis spokesman leslie dach 
gore introduced a 60second ad consisting entirely of an excerpt 
from a debate last month in dallas it is running in a great 
number of markets in a great number of states said gore 
spokesman mark armour 
the spot shows the tennessee senator accusing gephardt of voting 
against minimum wage increases against creating the department of 
education for tuition tax credits and for reaganomics and 
reversing his positions on all four issues 
the next president of the united states has to be someone the 
american people can believe will stay with his convictions 
youve got to be willing to stand your ground and be consistent 
gore tells gephardt 
a gephardt spokeswoman said the missouri congressmans campaign 
would have no direct response to the gore ad 
negative commercials dubbed attack ads by the campaigns 
were the order of the day for the republican frontrunners as well 
vice president george bush and senate republican leader bob dole 
continued their television attacks on each other in ads that began 
earlier in the week 
a gop official said he is not worried about the intensity of the 
campaign as long as the two keep their advertising accurate 
this is hardball were talking high stakes here said frank 
fahrenkopf chairman of the republican national committee 
i think the tone and rhetoric really in both campaigns has 
gotten pretty rough fahrenkopf told reporters in boston but he 
added in many ways ive welcomed whats happened in january i 
was concerned with the lack of fire in the belly 
both bush and dukakis have stepped up their super tuesday media 
campaigns in recent days both in scope and frequency of ads and 
gore was expected to do the same we intend to outspend the other 
democratic candidates on media in the super tuesday states 
armour said

nato leaders are looking toward better 
relations with the soviet union encouraged by mikhail s 
gorbachevs new policy of openness but demanding that he back up 
his words with deeds 
we are looking beyond pronouncements the western alliance 
said in a final communique that called on the soviets to respect 
human rights and make a speedy and complete withdrawal of red 
army troops from afghanistan 
the 16 nato leaders on thursday wound up their twoday summit 
the first in six years in a show of solidarity that glossed over 
differences on arms issues and applauded superpower efforts to 
reduce longrange nuclear weapons 
president reagan claimed a mandate for his planned spring summit 
in moscow and said nato was ready to get down to business on 
strategic arms talks 
he said the mediumrange nuclear weapons treaty signed by the 
united states and the soviet union last december was a direct 
result of alliance unity 
the alliance troubled by a dispute over the modernization of 
shortrange nuclear missiles in west germany sidestepped a direct 
confrontation on that issue and produced an upbeat proclamation of 
unity 
the leaders pledged to maintain a nuclear presence in europe to 
deter a soviet attack and called for a reduction in soviet bloc 
conventional forces the west says the soviet bloc has a 
substantial edge in five major ground categories 
nato said the search for improved and more stable relations 
with the soviet union and the other countries of eastern europe is 
among our principal concerns and called for efforts to reduce 
eastwest tensions 
the statement noted encouraging signs of change in the 
policies of the soviet union that create the prospect for 
greater openness in their relations with their own people and with 
other nations 
but we look beyond pronouncements for tangible and lasting 
policy changes addressing directly the issues dividing east and 
west the communique said 
we agree that the speedy and complete withdrawal of soviet 
troops from afghanistan and effective restoration of that countrys 
sovereignty would be of major significance it is against these 
criteria that we shall assess general secretary gorbachevs recent 
statements the statement said 
the nato leaders were united in their assessment of the alliance 
and its goals 
were strong were united were prosperous and were free 
said reagan 
underscoring natos commitment to keep nuclear weapons in 
europe he said all of us understand the absolute necessity of 
maintaining the credibility of our deterrent 
there is no doubt whatsoever that the agenda we have set now 
is the right one for nato said british prime minister margaret 
thatcher 
french president francois mitterand said this is one more step 
toward disarmament with all the necessary precautions 
the harmony of the meeting had been threatened by west germanys 
reluctance to replace older shortrange nuclear weapons with newer 
more effective ones 
most of these weapons if fired would hit german soil east or 
west and the modernization campaign has inflamed disarmament 
passions in west germany 
in a compromise the communique avoided use of the word 
modernization to which west germany objects instead the document 
said nato will maintain an appropriate mix of adequate and 
effective nuclear and conventional forces which will continue to be 
kept up to date where necessary 
nato secretary general lord carrington said the word 
modernization perhaps because of translation problems means 
in the minds of a number of people in different countries in europe 
the introduction of new and more terrible and more destructive 
weapons 
however he said it was more likely that the new weapons would 
be more accurate and may very well be of less destructive power

text of the final communique agreed to thursday at the conclusion 
of the nato summit 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
we the representatives of the 16 members of the north atlantic 
alliance have come together to reemphasize our unity to assess 
the current state of eastwest relations to review the 
opportunities and challenges which lie ahead and in so doing 
to reaffirm the common ideals and purposes which are the 
foundation of our partnership 
to rededicate ourselves to the principles and provisions of the 
washington treaty of 1949 
to reassert the vital importance of the alliance for our 
security and the validity of our strategy for peace 
the security in freedom and the prosperity of the european and 
north american allies are inextricably linked the longstanding 
commitment of the north american democracies to the preservation of 
peace and security in europe is vital 
the presence in europe of conventional and nuclear forces of the 
united states provides the essential linkage with the united states 
strategic deterrent and together with the forces of canada is a 
tangible expression of that commitment this presence must and will 
be maintained 
likewise a free independent and increasingly united europe is 
vital to north americas security the credibility of allied 
defense cannot be maintained without a major european contribution 
we therefore welcome recent efforts to reinforce the european 
pillar of the alliance intended to strengthen the transatlantic 
partnership and alliance security as a whole 
the atlantic alliance cannot be strong if europe is weak 
our aim will continue to be to prevent any kind of war or 
intimidation by maintaining credible deterrence the alliance has 
secured peace in europe for nearly 40 years 
conventional defenses alone cannot ensure this therefore for 
the foreseeable future there is no alternative to the alliance 
strategy for the prevention of war this is a strategy of 
deterrence based upon an appropriate mix of adequate and effective 
nuclear and conventional forces which will continue to be kept up 
to date where necessary 
while seeking security and stability at lower levels of 
armaments we are determined to sustain the requisite efforts to 
ensure the continued viability credibility and effectiveness of 
our conventional and nuclear forces including the nuclear forces 
in europe which together provide the guarantee of our common 
security 
taking into account the structure of the alliance each of us 
undertakes to play his part in this joint endeavor in a spirit of 
solidarity reaffirming our willingness to share fairly the risks 
burdens and responsibilities as well as the benefits of our common 
efforts 
we want gradually to overcome the unnatural division of the 
european continent which affects most directly the german people 
we will continue to uphold the freedom and viability of berlin and 
to support efforts to improve the situation there 
the search for improved and more stable relations with the 
soviet union and the other countries of eastern europe is among our 
principal concerns we call upon these countries to work with us 
for a further relaxation of tensions greater security at lower 
levels of arms more extensive human contacts and increased access 
to information we will continue the effort to expand cooperation 
with the east wherever and whenever this is of mutual benefit 
we have noted encouraging signs of change in the policies of the 
soviet union and some of its allies this creates the prospect for 
greater openness in their relations with their own people and with 
other nations but we look beyond pronouncements for tangible 
and lasting policy changes addressing directly the issues dividing 
east and west 
however we have to date witnessed no relaxation of the military 
effort pursued for years by the soviet union the soviet union 
persists in deploying far greater military forces than are required 
for its defence this massive force which the soviet union has not 
refrained from using outside its borders as is still the case in 
afghanistan constitutes a fundamental source of tension between 
east and west 
arms control is an integral part of our security policy we seek 
negotiations not for their own sake but to reach agreements which 
can significantly reduce the ris of conflict and make a genuine 
contribution to stability and peace 
the recently concluded inf agreement between the us and the 
soviet union is a milestone in our efforts to achieve a more secure 
peace and lower levels of arms 
consistent with their security requirements the 15 allies 
concerned will make use of all possibilities for effectively 
verifiable arms control agreements which lead to a stable and 
secure balance of forces at a lower level for them the 
comprehensive concept of arms control and disarmament includes 
a 50 percent reduction in the strategic offensive nuclear 
weapons of the us and the soviet union to be achieved during 
current geneva negotiations 
the global elimination of chemical weapons 
the establishment of a stable and secure level of conventional 
forces by the elimination of disparities in the whole of europe 
in conjunction with the establishment of a conventional balance 
and the global elimination of chemical weapons tangible and 
verifiable reductions of american and soviet landbased nuclear 
missile systems of shorter range leading to equal ceilings 
genuine peace in europe cannot be established solely by arms 
control it must be firmly based on full respect for fundamental 
human rights as we continue our efforts to reduce armaments we 
shall press for implementation on the part of the governments of 
the soviet union and of other eastern countries of all of the 
principles and provisions of the helsinki final act and of the 
madrid concluding document 
we agree that the speedy and complete withdrawal of soviet 
troops from afghanistan and effective restoration of that countrys 
sovereignty would be of major significance it is against these 
criteria that we shall assess general secretary gorbachevs recent 
statements 
we hope that at their forthcoming summit in moscow president 
reagan and general secretary gorbachev will be able to build upon 
the progress achieved at their washington meeting last december we 
strongly support the efforts of the united states

advocates of using lie detectors to screen job 
applicants and test employees honesty have given up hope that 
president reagan will veto legislation outlawing the practice 
the senate by a 6927 vote on thursday joined the house in 
approving a bill effectively prohibiting about 85 percent of the 
some 2 million polygraph examinations now conducted each year in 
the united states 
remaining now is only for the house and senate sponsors of the 
ban to iron out minor differences in the two versions submit the 
compromise for passage again and send it to the white house for 
reagans signature 
throughout his first term and even into last year reagan had 
vowed to veto any legislation to restrict private employers in 
their growing use of lie detectors allegedly to ferret out thieves 
and other wrongdoers 
labor unions and civil liberties groups argue that the devices 
are used just as often to intimidate workers or weed out those with 
prounion sympathies 
with increasing evidence that the tests in most circumstances 
are poorly administered and produce faulty results between 15 and 
50 percent of the time advocates of the ban have worn down much of 
the administrations opposition 
after two days of extended debate this week stalling the senate 
action opponents of the ban gave up their fight when the 
administration released a statement objecting only to portions of 
the legislation and avoiding any mention of a veto for the first 
time 
the administration does not have the backbone at this time to 
veto this bill complained sen dan quayle rind they have 
folded up shop caving like a house of cards 
crafted by sens edward m kennedy dmass and orrin hatch 
rutah normally adversaries on labormanagement issues the 
senate bill would allow some private use of polygraphs to 
investigate specific incidents of theft or sabotage 
but even then the tests would have to be conducted by licensed 
examiners under regulations to be developed by the labor 
department and employers would first have to file a police report 
or insurance claim and detail in writing the basis for suspecting 
the employee to be questioned 
employees who failed the test or refused to take it under such 
circumstances could not be fired absent other evidence if they 
were the bill allows civil suits against offending employers and 
provides for up to a 10000 federal fine for each violation 
kennedy and hatch respectively the chairman and ranking 
republican on the senates labor and human resources committee 
complained that an estimated 320000 honest workers are branded 
as liars each year often losing their jobs or being denied one 
because of the machines inaccuracy 
conversely it is a regrettable fact that employees steal 
hatch said this bill addresses both concerns by barring use of 
polygraphs where they are most likely to make a false 
identification but permitting the use of these tests where they are 
likely to be most accurate 
both house and senate versions exempt private security guards 
and kennedy said thursday that senate negotiators are likely to go 
along with the house in extending the exemption to employees of 
pharmaceutical companies as well 
he said he expects to meet with rep pat williams dmont the 
primary author of the house version passed by a 254158 vote last 
november within the next two weeks to begin hammering out a 
compromise 
they ban about 90 percent and we ban about 85 percent 
kennedy said predicting the new prohibition will become law before 
the end of the year with or without the presidents support 
hatch credited the united food and commercial workers union and 
its president william wynn for crafting the language that allows 
use of lie detectors to investigate specific instances of 
economic loss 
with that provision absent in the house bill several business 
groups representing railroads bankers restaurants brokerage 
houses grocers and other retail merchants dropped their opposition 
the only major opponents that remained were the polygraph 
industry itself the american trucking associations and the us 
chamber of commerce 
weve found them to be reliable and costeffective 
particularly in preemployment screening said roger middleton 
chief counsel for corporate policy at the chamber of commerce 
this is just an inconsistent attempt by the federal government to 
address a state problem 
however the ufcws wynn said the large margin by which the 
senate passed the bill reflects a recognition that the devices are 
little more than the 20th centurys equivalent of the dunking 
stool

the commerce department turns 75 today just 
four years older than the man who runs it c william verity and 
verity claims to be a late bloomer just like the oncestaid 
agency he heads 
even as a late bloomer you can come into the scene and be a 
player verity said in an interview in his ballroomsize office 
built in the late 1920s to the specifications of one of the early 
commerce secretaries herbert hoover 
the oldest cabinet member at 71 the retired chairman of armco 
steel is still five years younger than his boss in the white house 
verity arrived on the scene in october about the time topechelon 
members of the administration plan their returns to the private 
sector 
still veritys brief tenure has been marked by activism and 
some measure of controversy 
there have been trade skirmishes with japan turf squabbles with 
other agencies and resignations of several top officials veritys 
outspoken advocacy of closer economic ties with the soviet union 
has drawn criticism from both conservatives in congress and from 
some jewish organizations 
the agency has come a long way from its creation in 1913 when 
its main functions included counting the population inspecting 
steamboats and maintaining lighthouses 
today the department enforces us trade policy probably its 
most vital role in a day of 170 billion trade deficits it also 
collects and analyzes economic data and serves as home for the 
census bureau the national weather service the bureau of 
standards and a host of other agencies 
it serves now as in the past as the business communitys 
advocate within the halls of government 
verity had retired in 1982 as chairman and chief executive 
officer of armco then based in ohio the retirement ended when he 
was picked by president reagan to head the sprawling agency after 
the death last summer of malcolm baldrige who had been commerce 
secretary since 1981 
baldrige who was extremely popular with the agencys 38000 
employes and members of congress died in a freak rodeo accident 
although under baldrige the commerce department had been the 
lead federal agency on dealing with congress on trade legislation 
verity has moved into other areas and pressed ahead with his own 
pet projects 
one has been more fully automating the departments many 
activities another was pressing for commercializaton of space an 
effort verity said gave him a quick lesson in heading a government 
agency since it brought him into conflict with the national 
aeronautics and space administration 
nasa doesnt want anybody else out there he said 
i think you find out youre not in charge he said there 
are a lot of people who have a piece of the action who have to get 
on board the mission in private business is to get something done 
in government its to move toward solving a problem but to get 
everybody on board with you as you try to solve it 
and that just requires a lot of time and a lot of massaging of 
peoples feelings and testing this and testing that 
he said his present priority is a program to help smaller 
companies export more 
i think our economy is going to be exportdriven this year 
he said our department feels we should do whatever we can to 
encourage small and medium sized companies to get into the export 
game 
his nononsense approach particularly his tough stance toward 
japan has won him a lot of fans in the business community just a 
few days on the job verity threatened japan with retaliation if it 
didnt do more to open its markets or adjust its prices to match 
the lower dollar 
while japanese officials protested the tough talk from a man 
who speaks softly and slowly won him fans among us industries 
battered by japanese imports 
other secretaries and other us spokesmen have not been 
urging the government to start speaking in plain language to these 
guys the japanese said richard muller a washington 
representative for chrysler corp 
verity also delighted conservationists by recommending sanctions 
against japan last month for the killing of minke whales in 
violation of international whaling regulations 
but sighed verity i never had any idea i would be in charge 
of whales some day and i had no idea it would take so much of my 
time

a black student activist at the university of pennsylvania was 
under 24hour protection thursday after receiving a death threat 
and an allwhite fraternity was banned from campus for hiring two 
black strippers for a party 
earlier thursday about 300 people rallied at dartmouth college 
in a protest against bigotry 
the threat was made against conrad tillard director of the 
organization of black consciousness which had called for the 
ouster of the primarily jewish fraternity zeta beta tau from the 
ivy league school in philadelphia 
the university had charged that black strippers at a zbt party 
in september danced naked with a prospective freshman pledge before 
a jeering audience shouting racial epithets 
the threatening letter was sent to a reporter at the school 
newspaper the daily pennsylvanian the writer claimed to be a 
student member of the jewish defense league 
however school officials said they do not believe the writer is 
a student and the jdl denied any connection with the threat 
tillard will receive roundtheclock protection by campus police 
as long as it necessary said security spokeswoman sylvia 
canada 
police said they were investigating the letter the fbi also 
said they have received the letter but declined comment 
the main thing it said was that i was a target on their hit 
list tillard said it also said that in general theyre trying 
to stop the rise of this black power group that im helping bring 
about 
in hanover nh the rally was sparked by a conservative 
offcampus student newspapers criticism of a black professors 
teaching ability and his music course the night before about 200 
people held a candlelight march 
members of dartmouths afroamerican organized the protests 
aimed at the dartmouth review four review staff members are 
charged by the school with harassing the professor william cole 
after confronting him in his classroom over the article 
at the rally music professor john appleton defended his 
colleague saying we must find a away to put an end to jim crow 
to jingoism to sexism and to just plain ignorance that the review 
seeks to foster on this campus 
on monday demonstrators at a penn rally sponsored by the 
organization of black consciousness had called for the ouster from 
campus of a zbt which was charge by the university with lewdness 
indecent exposure and hazing 
late thursday the 112member fraternity announced that it had 
been banned from campus until at least the fall of 1989 
the threatening letter did not mention the fraternity incident 
tillard said 
the racial tension on the campus has been very very high for 
a long time said jacqueline wade director of penns 
afroamerican studies department this is just one indicator of 
the level its part of a larger whole of racism on this campus 
penn spokesman bill epstein said university officials believe 
the death threat was written by a penn student weve checked 
around said epstein theres no sign of the jdl 
mordechai levey international director of the new yorkbased 
jdl said that several jews on campus were affilitated with the 
organization but that the jdl played no role in the threat 
rabbi howard alperg director of the jewish campus activities 
board called the zbt incident deplorable but added to claim 
that it is now a jewishblack issue is also deplorable 
there are black radicals who are trying to turn it into a 
blackjewish issue alperg said that is perceived by jewish 
students as being antisemitic 
relationships between black and jewish students were strained in 
1986 during a confrontation over attempts by the black student 
unity conference to have nation of islam leader louis farrakhan 
give a speech 
farrakhan did not speak his organization said it was not 
satisfied with the security arrangements 
on wednesday minority students at hampshire college in amherst 
mass ended their nineday occupation of a dormitory office after 
administrators signed a 16point agreement aimed at encouraging 
racial harmony

two large holes opened up in a road in 
eastern england swallowing a doubledecker bus and prompting the 
evacuation of a small hotel and nearby homes police said 
authorities believe the road near the city of norwich was built 
above an abandoned 19th century chalk mine 
one hole opened under the rear of the bus thursday and the 
driver ordered the 20 passengers off the vehicle immediately the 
british broadcasting corp reported but as the driver tried to 
pull away the hole grew into a 26footwide gap and another hole 
appeared nearby 
the television report showed the bus with its rear in the hole

the house has killed its democratic 
leaderships proposal for a package of humanitarian aid for the 
nicaraguan contras leaving the vacillating us policy toward 
central america once again in limbo and the rebels without support 
the lawmakers voted 216208 thursday to reject the democrats 
305 million proposal that would have provided four months worth 
of food clothing and medical supplies to the rebels and created a 
new 14 million program to aid children who are victims of the 
nicaraguan civil war 
fortyfive democrats mostly liberals who oppose any aid to the 
contras joined with republicans who thought the aid proposal too 
weak to deal it a fatal blow only five of 176 gop members present 
voted for the measure on the final ballot 
the vote showed the difficulty of coming up with any kind of 
agreement on the contentious issue it was a particular setback for 
house speaker jim wright dtexas who had sought to keep the 
contras in place in nicaragua to pressure the leftist sandinista 
government into concessions as part of a regional peace process 
democrats had hoped too that their milder aid package would 
relieve pressure to give the rebels more weapons later this year 
but the surprise outcome also appeared to dim any administration 
hopes of speedy action to keep supplies flowing to the rebels who 
by some accounts are in dire need of food and other nonlethal 
materiel previous us aid and the authority to deliver it by 
airdrops inside nicaragua expired tuesday 
wright dtexas said the vote may prove a somewhat pyrrhic 
victory for republicans adding that he had no immediate plans to 
revive a contra aid plan 
we have thus far done our best wright said it was as 
good an effort as could be made i dont know how you would find a 
better consensus among those who have a sincere effort to help the 
peace process 
other democrats vowed to make any new try for aid difficult 
as far as im concerned it ought to be a damned lengthy 
process said rep david obey dwis a contra opponent who is 
chairman of the house appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction 
over the matter the republicans sandbagged us 
the vote came exactly one month after the house rejected a 36 
million reagan plan to aid the rebels one which included money for 
weapons and other military supplies wright won that showdown 
partly on the strength of a promise that he would give moderate 
members of his party a later chance to vote for a purely 
humanitarian aid package 
we fulfilled our commitment to them wright said after the 
vote 
with no aid plans left before congress us policy toward the 
contras who were organized seven years ago with us backing 
was in limbo 
the confusion was illustrated by conflicting reactions to the 
vote from president reagan the contras most prominent supporter 
and a rebel spokeswoman in miami 
as he flew back to the united states from a nato meeting in 
brussels belgium reagan said im very happy his spokesman 
marlin fitzwater later explained that the president meant he was 
glad to be able to work on an improved aid package 
but contra spokeswoman marta sacasa said the rebels had wanted 
the aid to pass and said the united states was turning its back 
every time the united states turns its back on the contras it 
puts us in a less favorable position sacasa said we are 
fighting against an enemy that doesnt have these kinds of 
problems the aid from the soviet union has not stopped flowing to 
the sandinistas 
in drawing up their aid proposal democrats led by rep david 
bonior dmich were faced with the challenge of attracting 
support from moderate members many of them southerners while not 
alienating the partys liberal wing most of whom never have 
backed the rebels 
to gain every possible advantage democratic leaders had set up 
an unusual procedure under which their package would come before 
the house as an amendment to a competing but similar republican 
bill the democratic version was adopted on a vote of 215 to 210 
thus wiping out the gop version and replacing it with the 
democratic plan 
but minutes later voting on final passage for the same bill 26 
members switched their votes and the entire package was defeated 
the largest group of those abandoning the bill comprised liberal 
democrats who had been uncomfortable voting for it in the first 
place 
rep mickey edwards rokla who led the republican debate 
said supporters of contra aid were never given an option they could 
support 
this plan didnt do anything he said it was just a 
lousy lousy bill we were saying we werent going to vote for it 
and they didnt believe it 
one democratic liberal who said he grudgingly voted for the 
package rep george miller of california said it would have 
helped encourage the peace process in central america because it 
sent a renewed message to the contras that congress is not 
willing to provide lethal aid 
but a contra supporter rep dan burton rcalif said the bill 
was like throwing a bone to the freedom fighters without any meat 
on it 
rep henry hyde rill said the democratic package represented 
an invitation to a funeral a funeral for freedom and if it 
passed hyde told democrats youll have the guilt you deserve 
being accessories to the murder of freedom and democracy in this 
hemisphere

police said they arrested two men late thursday 
in the slaying of a rookie police officer shot at pointblank range 
in his patrol car feb 26 outside the home of a drug witness he was 
guarding 
the men whose names were not released had been picked up 
thursday for questioning along with two women who were later 
released said officer peter odonnell a police spokesman 
details of the arrests in the slaying of 22yearold officer 
edward byrne will be released friday he said 
police commissioner benjamin ward had described the slaying as 
an assassination meant to intimidate drug witnesses byrne was 
killed by shots from a car that had apparently coasted up to his 
early in the morning 
since the slaying detectives have flooded the queens 
neighborhood arresting 256 streetlevel crack dealers in hopes of 
extracting information about the killing 
shooting at cops its just bad for business i think 
experienced criminals know that perhaps these inexperienced ones 
will learn it ward said 
the reward for information leading to the conviction of the 
killer grew to 130000 thursday with a 25000 contribution from 
members of the new york stock exchange more than 10000 officers 
attended byrnes funeral 
wnbctv reported wednesday night that investigators identified 
two men including the gunman and two women believed to have 
been in the car from which the shots were fired 
a police spokesman capt tom fahey asked earlier about the 
wnbc report said the case has not been solved the reward is 
still in effect we still need the cooperation of the community to 
help us solve this case 
the broadcast report also said police believed the killing was 
ordered by lorenzo fat cat nichols 29 a reputed drug kingpin 
sentenced feb 25 to 25 years to life in prison for narcotics and 
weapons possession 
he is also awaiting trial on charges he had his parole officer 
killed for revenge

nearly every night for the past week and a 
half sen albert gore jr has delivered himself by satellite to 
television stations in super tuesday states for interviews on local 
newscasts 
the tennessee democrat also appeared via satellite for a 
campaign pep rally with supporters assembled in more than 50 
locations and for a questionandanswer session with students on 
more than 100 college campuses 
everybody is having to do things like this in view of 
campaigning in 20 states at the same time said arlie schardt a 
spokesman for gore its economical and its the best method of 
reaching large numbers of voters 
as the approaching super tuesday primaries strain campaign 
warchests and candidate schedules satellite uplinking is being 
used by presidential hopefuls to increase their exposure to voters 
in the cheapest way possible 
though many stations refuse these brief interview opportunities 
the chance for live time with the candidates has become 
attractive to smaller stations in areas where the contenders are 
not likely to appear in person 
but some media experts say the new hightech tool of the 1988 
campaign does not serve the public well 
it plays on the vanity of the local media because everyone 
wants to be seen interviewing a presidential candidate but the 
tough questions arent being asked by the local interviewers 
said kathleen hall jamieson a communications professor at the 
university of texas at austin 
the candidates wont run into any sam donaldsons in the 132nd 
market said stephen hess senior fellow at the washington 
dcbased brookings institution referring to abcs tough 
sometimes abrasive white house correspondent 
costs for transmitting via satellite vary depending on location 
and equipment used but generally it is far less expensive than 
producing and airing an advertisement 
airing a 30second ad on a boston television station during the 
popular cosby show program can cost 30000 while buying 90 
minutes of satellite time that can be used for fiveminute 
interviews by 18 stations costs about 2000 said gary galanis a 
spokesman for democrat paul simons campaign 
we at this point dont have the resources to buy even a 
minimum amount of paid advertising which would probably be about a 
million dollars to hit all the super tuesday states galanis said 
you cant mold your message as well with satellite interviews 
but you can get two to three minutes on a local newscast he 
said paid advertising is the best thing but the next best 
thing is satellite uplinks 
tim archie a spokesman for republican bob dole said large 
stations in major markets are less likely to accept a satellite 
interview because they are in cities where the candidates are 
appearing anyway these stations also often have a reporter on the 
road with the campaigns 
but for other stations satellite interviews give the stations 
a sense of an exclusive he said

a number of democratic congressmen want the 
final totals of the 1990 national census adjusted to make up for 
the many minority group members and city dwellers they say will be 
overlooked 
commerce department and census officials who have refused to 
agree to such changes were criticized thursday at a hearing for 
making shameful and political decisions 
every census since 1790 has seen at least some criticism for the 
socalled undercount and the complaints have grown in recent 
years despite improvements in census taking 
officials estimate that in 1980 only about 1 percent of 
americans were missed in the national head count but they admit 
the problem was much greater among minorities and in cities than it 
was for other groups 
studies were launched to try and determine if adjustments could 
be made to compensate for this problem but last october the 
decision was announced that there would be no adjustment in 1990 
pointing out that the people usually missed are most often 
minorities and city residents where the democratic party 
predominates rep charles schumer of new york termed the decision 
not to adjust shameful and political 
he said the action was not based on fairminded concern about 
accurate statistics its a raw exercise of partisan politics 
schumers remarks came thursday at a hearing of the house post 
office and civil service census subcommittee reps mervyn m 
dymally of california and robert garcia of new york also raised 
concerns about the decision not to adjust all three are democrats 
commerce undersecretary robert ortner denied that politics were 
involved in the decision contending that statisticians disagree on 
whether there is an accurate method of making adjustments 
i dont think it would make the problem any better if we were 
to devise an elaborate mathematical system to make up new 
numbers ortner said 
the focus of the problem is the fact that all 435 seats in the 
house of representatives and billions of dollars in state and 
federal money are distributed on the basis of the figures collected 
every 10 years by the census bureau

for the first time in canadian history a member 
of parliament has revealed that he is homosexual surprising the 
public delighting gay rights activists and provoking rightwing 
ridicule 
svend robinson of the socialist new democratic party made his 
announcement in parliament thursday 
we do not choose to be gay or lesbian and are not seeking 
special rights merely the right to live openly in dignity without 
losing our jobs or homes or being subjected to violence 
robinson 36 said 
his honesty had consequences 
robinsons constituency office in burnaby british columbia was 
vandalized last weekend following reports he was about to confirm 
longstanding rumors about his sexual orientation 
premier grant devine of saskatchewan father of five children 
expressed fear that robinsons statement would encourage young 
people to try homosexuality devine said his compassion for gays 
equaled that for bank robbers 
pollsters said the declaration may damage the new democrats 
chances in the next election 
but toronto gay rights activist russell armstrong called 
robinsons decision a quiet act of heroism 
he set a wonderful example for all of us who have to make that 
same kind of revelation in our lives armstrong said i feel a 
kind of jubilation 
the minneapolisborn robinson explained in an interview with the 
associated press why he chose this week to make his disclosure 
after a nineyear parliamentary career which made him the enfant 
terrible of canadian politics 
it was a difficult decision in both personal and political 
terms i didnt want to be perceived as a singleissue candidate or 
a gay member of parliament but rather as a member of parliament 
who happens to be gay 
for me as for any other gay or lesbian person it is a 
liberating experience the legislator said 
robinson whose family moved to canada in 1964 said it was 
important to make his declaration before the federal election which 
conservative prime minister brian mulroney may call this year 
the new democrats are at a historical high in the polls under 
their popular leader ed broadbent and could vie for power 
other factors in his decision robinson said were the 
governments twoyear delay in fulfilling a pledge to outlaw 
discrimination against gays and lesbians a growing trend of 
violence and harassment against homosexuals and attempts to link 
aids to homosexuality by the jimmy swaggarts of the world 
rather than allowing extreme rightwing fundamentalist 
homophobia to become stronger i think its important that we stand 
up and say this is enough he said 
he denied being pressured into revealing the truth but cited 
past harassment including an incident following the 1985 aids 
death of film star rock hudson a conservative member yelled across 
the floor of parliament why arent you at rock hudsons 
funeral 
it stung said robinson who disclosed his secret in a 
speech and two major television interviews earlier this week 
a lawyer and graduate of the london school of economics 
robinson is known as an aggressive spokesman for minority and 
leftwing causes and has been thrown out of the house of commons 
several times 
broadbent chastised robinson last year for heckling president 
reagan over us support for nicaraguan rebels when reagan 
addressed the canadian parliament 
robinsons judgment was criticized again this week for saying 
there are homosexuals in the federal cabinet a statement he later 
withdrew he also said he wished it were socially acceptable to 
stroll hand in hand with the man he cares about in vancouvers 
stanley park 
columnist orland french of the toronto globe and mail noted that 
robinson is justice critic for the new democrats french commented 
how odd it would be if the new democrats are elected and justice 
minister svend robinson were seen traipsing hand in hand through 
the park with his male lover 
is canada ready for this the columnist asked 
robinson said he knows of three other legislators who have 
revealed their homosexuality labor member of parliament chris 
smith in britain and congressmen gerry studds and barney frank 
from massachusetts 
robinson acknowledged political risks but was confident he 
would be renominated for his seat this weekend 
pollster angus reid said the new democrats would find it harder 
to shed their fringeparty image the financial post commented 
the reality is that there is an undercurrent of fear of 
homosexuals in canada 
robinson didnt shed all his apprehensions he asked a reporter 
if his story would reach us newspapers ive got relatives in 
the states and some are aware and some arent he said

a sharp increase in methane gas in the 
atmosphere since 1978 probably will make earth warmer and may 
worsen seasonal losses of protective ozone over antarctica 
scientists say 
but the 11 percent increase in methane in the past decade also 
may slow depletion of the ozone shield over the rest of the planet 
said f sherwood rowland and donald r blake chemists at the 
university of california at irvine 
their nasafunded study was published today in the journal 
science 
methane is the major component of natural gas but about 80 
percent of atmospheric methane comes from decomposition in rice 
paddies swamps and the intestines of cows with some contribution 
from wood digestion in termites rowland said 
humans are responsible for increased methane levels because they 
are raising more cows growing more rice and chopping down tropical 
forests which provides food for more termites said atmospheric 
scientist pat zimmerman of the national center for atmospheric 
research in boulder colo 
researchers generally agree that by trapping solar heat like 
glass in a greenhouse methane carbon dioxide and pollutants are 
likely to warm earths lower atmosphere by 3 to 5 degrees by the 
year 2050 
they fear this greenhouse effect may cause cropthreatening 
droughts and partially melt polar ice caps which could raise sea 
levels up to 15 feet and threaten coastal cities 
ozone is an air pollutant at low altitudes but in the 
stratosphere it shields earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation 
scientists say reduction of the ozone layer will cause more skin 
cancers and might trigger climatic changes 
in 1974 rowland and chemist mario molina first warned that the 
ozone layer was threatened by manmade chlorine compounds called 
chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs which are used as refrigeration 
coolants aerosol propellants and for making plastic foams the 
united states banned spraycan cfcs in 1978 
mounting evidence indicates cfcs are responsible for the 
worldwide loss of about 1 percent of earths ozone shield and the 
formation of a hole that forms in the ozone layer above antarctica 
for a few months starting every september 
blake and rowland said methane increases may worsen the ozone 
hole by aiding formation of ice clouds above antarctica thats 
because studies by molina and others suggest the clouds enhance 
chemical reactions that allow chlorine from cfcs to break down 
ozone 
as methane rises into the polar stratosphere it breaks down and 
releases hydrogen which combines with a chemical called hydroxyl 
to form water which in turn freezes into clouds blake explained 
outside antarctica wind and higher temperatures prevent 
formation of stratospheric clouds so methane attacks chlorine from 
cfcs reducing the amount of chlorine available to destroy ozone 
blake said 
the 11 percent methane increase will make the ozone hole over 
antarctica more severe it will probably make the ozone depletion 
in the rest of the world less severe said molina of the 
national aeronautics and space administrations jet propulsion 
laboratory in pasadena 
he said the increase will make the greenhouse effect more 
severe 
rowland and blake also said that because increasing atmospheric 
methane reduces the amount of hydroxyl present it indicates the 
atmosphere is losing its ability to cleanse itself of pollutants 
hydroxyl reacts with many pollutants and removes them from the 
atmosphere 
their study also indicates the rate of increase in methane gas 
slowed slightly during the past five years 
blake and rowland collected air samples regularly between 
january 1978 and september 1987 at up to 60 locations around the 
pacific to measure methane levels 
earlier studies suggested methane levels more than doubled 
during the previous 200 years based on that blake and rowland 
calculated methane increases may have raised the amount of water 
vapor in the stratosphere by 28 percent since the 1940s and by 45 
percent over the past two centuries

american jewish leaders ending a visit to 
israel say they are still troubled by the ongoing violence in the 
occupied lands but are convinced that us jews should air their 
criticisms in private not public 
it is a formula supported by prime minister yitzhak shamir who 
told the american jewish leaders this week it is absolutely 
unjewish and very dangerous to join an antiisraeli front with 
nonjews by publicly chastizing israel 
the 42member presidents of major american jewish organizations 
met in jerusalem for a weeklong annual conference that ended 
thursday 
morris b abram the groups chairman said he had arrived with 
a good deal of anguish a good deal of anxiety and misgivings 
other american jewish leaders also have spoken publicly of their 
concern over seeing nightly television footage and reading daily 
news reports on the israel armys tough tactics to quell three 
months of unrest in the west bank and gaza strip 
reports of troops using excessive beatings of palestinians and 
burying alive four arabs near nablus heightened that unease 
but abram said that after private meetings with israels 
political and military leaders i have not the slightest doubt 
the policy is to use restraint and the time is not right to 
publicly criticize israels handling of the unrest 
the question is not whether american jews have the right to 
express dissatisfaction of course they do abram said in an 
interview with the associated press the question is on matters 
of israels defense and security is public criticism effective or 
prudent 
shamir called on the us jewish leaders to stifle outspoken 
criticism among their ranks 
every critical statement of a jewish leader does much more 
harm than many violent demonstrations in gaza shamir said it 
is inconceivable that god forbid american jews would permit 
themselves to be used in the campaign against us 
not all us jewish leaders agree they should be silent partners 
with israel 
we as jews need to cut through our illusions and 
selfdelusions about israel albert vorspan vice president of 
the union of american hebrew congregations told the organization 
he said american jews should speak out about their concerns and 
warn israeli leaders that the tv pictures that multiply every day 
are potentially explosive in terms of israels image abroad 
vorspan also expressed frustration that israels divided 
government seemed to be throwing away a chance for peace 
he described us secretary of state george shultzs middle east 
peace mission as a shuttle between shamir and his rival foreign 
minister shimon peres 
the deep divisions in israels government concern some us 
jewish leaders as much as israels inability to put down the 
antioccupation unrest some warn that that issue is potentially 
more damaging to israels relations with the united states than the 
riots themselves 
zvi rafiah a retired israeli diplomat who served in israels 
embassy in washington said us leaders are alarmed because israel 
appears incapable even incompetent in resolving one of its most 
important problems the peace process 
in a speech to the jewish leaders rafiah warned the 
palestinian problem has become a time bomb in our relationship with 
the united states

a highlevel board of military and civilian 
advisers is departing from its normal policy stance and questioning 
the future of a buildup in reserve forces 
the suggestion that the reserve forces may be overextended comes 
as budget problems appear likely to prevent any significant growth 
in reserve and national guard forces in fiscal 1989 
in recent years the 22member reserve forces policy board has 
consistently argued that more money be appropriated for the 
reserves because of their increasing role in military preparedness 
and strategy 
the selected reserve forces the drilling socalled weekend 
warriors now total more than 11 million people compared with 
the 21 million on active duty 
under the socalled total force policy adopted in 1973 many 
of those reservists and guardsmen would go to war before their 
activeduty counterparts because of the equipment they use or the 
jobs for which they have been trained 
the policy board in its justreleased fiscal 1987 report 
repeats its plea for greater financial support for the reserve 
forces but it also advances the unexpected suggestion that the 
pentagon should attend to the strength of its activeduty forces 
first 
an appropriate balance should exist between the active and 
reserve components the board stated 
according to col phil fogel an aide to the panel the board 
issued its warning this year in part because of declining 
projections for military spending 
when you have budget constraints people tend to want to shift 
more responsibilities to the reserves to save money fogel said 
thursday 
the board is saying youve got to have a sufficient 
activeduty force and that you cant shift like that without 
providing the necessary resources money spaces in schools etc 
the board said it thought the most suitable missions for the 
national guard and reserves are those with low peacetime activity 
levels and high wartime surge requirements 
if a mission must be performed on a daily basis or requires 
daily training that mission is best suited to the active 
component the panel said

sheikh bassam 
jarrar stabbed the air with his finger and declared that a 
political settlement with israel would be disastrous 
the moslem religious leader said the koran islams holy book 
forbids recognition of israel he argued against cooperating 
with peace initiatives aimed at ending the threemonth uprising in 
the israelioccupied lands 
jarrars remarks criticial of the plos policy of seeking a 
settlement provoked murmurs of disagreement from men sitting 
crosslegged along the wall of the mosque in this village 10 miles 
northwest of jerusalem 
the dispute reflecting deep political divisions of palestinians 
despite the unity they have shown in confronting israeli soldiers 
soon grew into a shouting match 
it cut short the gathering of more than 150 men an informal 
town halltype meeting where the heated exchanges continued outside 
the mosque under a tree despite a drizzle 
the first to challenge jarrar a charismatic speaker aligned 
with the fundamentalist moslem brotherhood was a middleaged man 
in a white headdress who asked if there wasnt a peaceful 
alternative to street violence 
the 39yearold preacher left no room for compromise and warned 
that anyone who recognized the jewish state would be considered an 
enemy of islam 
we dont have any common language with israel we have nothing 
to demand of them we are in a state or revolt against israel the 
conflict should continue until victory jarrar said his deep 
resonant voice cracking with emotion 
a bearded man in his 20s accused jarrar of breaking ranks with 
the palestine liberation organization which has endorsed an 
international conference to discuss peace with israel 
the plo represents all the people there is no islamic trend 
there are only moslems who support the plo shouted the young 
man a supporter of plo chairman yasser arafats fatah organization 
i represent the islamic trend said jarrar whose full black 
beard signified his fundamentalist allegiance 
a tall muscular man rose to disagree with jarrars criticism of 
syria and the soviet union 
we are in need of syria there is a plo delegation visiting 
damascus now to create a good atmosphere for fighting israel we 
should support an alliance with syria he said 
the man whose comments indicated he was a supporter of the 
prosoviet democratic front for the liberation of palestine 
faction blamed jarrar for provoking the dispute 
we have differences it is true but we are all supporting the 
uprising and we should not discuss them now he said 
jarrar attacked the plo position saying arafat only had agreed 
to a conference after losing his independent base in lebanon being 
driven out of beirut by israel and out of the northern lebanese 
city of tripoli by syria 
its impossible to have a peaceful alternative while we are in 
a weak position jarrar said i will not say there is a 
possibility of a political solution it would be disastrous under 
the current conditions 
the infighting was also reflected in graffitti spraypainted on 
walls near the mosque 
one slogan attacking the peace mission of secretary of state 
george shultz was signed by the democratic front and another 
antioccupation slogan by hamas which means fervor in arabic 
and is used by the moslem brothers a movement founded in egypt in 
1929 by a school teacher named hassan al banna 
israeli officials especially those of the rightwing likud 
bloc have stressed the islamic influence in the ongoing riots 
they have argued that the fundamentalists threaten western nations 
as well as israel 
the influence of the fundamentalists has grown since the 
violence began dec 8 islamic groups are especially strong in the 
occupied gaza strip where there are more refugee camps than in the 
west bank and poverty is widespread 
but plo supporters appear to be in the vast majority in the west 
bank which israel also seized in the 1967 middle east war and 
even jarrar said the riots were not an uprising of the mosques 
as he said some israeli leaders had claimed 
israel wants to frighten the west by saying the 
fundamentalists are playing an active role israel wants to justify 
its oppression by saying they are fighting fundamentalists 
jarrar said 
he said the riots had damaged israels image in the world hurt 
the israeli economy by robbing it of arab labor and tourism and 
prevented the military government in the occupied lands from 
imposing new and more harsh measures 
they thought we were sleeping or dead jarrar said if 
there is no other benefit of the uprising it is to show that we 
reject oppression

air force officials have been told by 
lawmakers to scour their budget for money that would avert the 
temporary furlough of more than 80000 civilian workers 
rep nicholas mavroules chairman of the house armed services 
readiness subcommittee told air force comptroller general claudius 
watts on thursday that the air force could wring the necessary 
funds out of its budget 
if the initiative does not come from the military itll 
come from this one member the massachusetts democrat said 
these humane issues the quality of life that we take such a 
deep interest in are not going to be affected 
under the air force plan 82500 civilian workers in the air 
force logistics command could be furloughed for up to 10 days this 
year 
i wish i could guarantee to you that no one would be 
furloughed watts told the subcommittee but i cant 
rep john kasich rohio said the command would only need to 
find 167 million out of its total budget of 5 billion to avert 
the furloughs 
were spending 60 million on a club system for our service 
people and 13 million to subsidize golf courses said kasich 
we can start by cutting out the 13 millon for golf courses i 
think weve got to find the money 
the logistics command is responsible for transporting air force 
supplies as well as repairing and maintaining equipment it has 
about 7300 workers at its headquarters at wrightpatterson air 
force base near dayton ohio and another 2500 at the newark 
ohio air force station 
in addition to wrightpatterson and newark the logistics 
command operates major centers at ogden utah sacramento calif 
san antonio texas oklahoma city warner robins ga 
davismonthan air force base in arizona and battle creek mich 
rep jim hansen rutah has introduced a bill aimed at averting 
the furloughs by increasing from 15 billion to 4 billion the 
amount of money the pentagon could transfer from one account to 
another

the nations weekend warriors in the 
military reserves tend to be married and older individuals who have 
served in the active forces and have years of experience in their 
jobs a firstofitskind survey shows 
reservists and national guard members also tend to come from 
military families almost always have at least a high school 
diploma expect to stay in the reserves because of the pay and 
pension benefits as well as out of a sense of patriotism and now 
mirror the percentages of women and minorities in the active 
forces the study found 
the survey entitled simply description of officers and 
enlisted personnel in the us selected reserve 1986 was 
released late thursday by the pentagon 
the defense department described it as the first comprehensive 
survey of reservists it had ever attempted adding that more than 
52000 enlisted personnel and 12000 officers across the country 
had been queried on their personal backgrounds and satisfaction 
with their parttime military work 
the selected reserve forces include the army national guard the 
air national guard the army reserve navy reserve marine corps 
reserve air force reserve and coast guard reserve those forces 
now include more than 11 million men and women who are expected 
to train on active duty for two weeks every year and on one weekend 
a month 
stephen m duncan the assistant defense secretary for reserve 
affairs said thursday the pentagon intended to use the survey to 
gauge the adequacy of its recruiting and retention policies for the 
reserves 
according to the survey 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
about 62 percent of parttime reserve officers and 47 percent 
of the enlisted reservists spent time on active duty an average 
of more than four years for enlisted members and five years for 
officers about threequarters of the reservists come from families 
with other members who served in the armed forces 
once they join up reservists tend to stick with their 
commitment parttime enlisted reservists have an average 7 years 
of service with their units while officers have an average 105 
years of service under their belts 
the median age for an enlisted member is 295 while the median 
for an officer is 379 
fiftyfive percent of the enlisted reservists and 76 percent of 
the officers are married threequarters of the married reservists 
say their spouse supports their parttime military service 
only about 15 percent of the reservists employers are 
perceived as having an unfavorable attitude toward military 
service 
serving their country was a major contributor to the retention 
decision for 55 percent of the enlisted personnel and 59 percent of 
the officers the study states 
earning credit towards retirement was a major contributor for 
50 percent of the enlisted personnel and 62 percent of the 
officers

republicans said they were treated like 
common criminals 
the senates democratic leader said the republicans were merely 
crybabies and should act like adults 
for five hours thursday senators talked about and briefly 
debated the legality of the senates vote last week to arrest 
absent senators 
at one point spectators in the senate gallery may have thought 
they had wandered into a courtroom 
facing the presiding officer at the bench was sen george 
mitchell dmaine drawing on his experience as a former federal 
judge to defend the democrats vote last week to arrest republicans 
who refused to show up for a quorum call 
on the other side of the ornate chamber stood sen arlen 
specter citing his background as a former philadelphia district 
attorney and arguing that senators should enjoy the same 
protections against illegal arrest as common criminals 
that vote resulted in the senate sergeantatarms chasing 
senators down corridors and finally entering the locked office of 
sen robert packwood with a team of detectives the senator was 
escorted to the senate where he was picked up and carried into the 
chamber feet first 
packwood an oregon republican seemed amused 
but 17 other republicans were not and they spent much of the 
day thursday condemning the whole episode they introduced a 
resolution asking the rules committee to tighten procedures by 
which senators can be arrested and forced to attend the senate 
specter rpa charged that an arrest is an arrest is an 
arrest and demanded that in the future warrants be changed to 
include a written statement establishing the reasons for arrest 
the resolution also proposed a rule change that would prohibit 
the seizure of an absent senator between 11 pm and 8 am 
unless the pending business is of a compelling nature 
through it all sat senate majority leader robert byrd dwva 
the man who had proposed the rarelyused motion to arrest 
he said the complaining republicans were crybabies and the 
arrest warrant carried no penalties other than requiring senators 
to show up for work 
we bored the american people today with almost four hours of 
talk about the tough life of senators byrd complained 
he called the whole debate a tale of woe and suggested 
there are several million americans who would be glad to trade 
places with us 
byrd singled out the provision that would limit latenight 
arrest warrants other than for compelling reasons whos to 
determine that byrd asked the senate determines that and it 
determined that the other evening 
packwood was seized in his office at about 130 am last 
wednesday when he and most other republicans fled the chamber to 
prevent the senate from establishing a quorum a quorum of 51 
senators was needed to keep the senate in session and the 
republicans were trying to end an allnight debate on a campaign 
spending bill 
packwoods unique arrival gave the democrats a quorum and the 
senate remained in session all night 
packwood was not a sponsor of the resolution introduced 
thursday and referred to the rules committee 
in addition to specter sponsors included sens alan simpson of 
wyoming john chafee of rhode island william armstrong of 
colorado rudy boschwitz of minnesota thad cochran of mississippi 
john heinz of pennsylvania dan quayle of indiana mitch mcconnell 
of kentucky kit bond of missouri dan evans of washington robert

american and soviet negotiators meet next week 
to start work on a new longterm grain agreement to replace the 
current pact that guarantees sales of 9 million metric tons a year 
we look forward to our discussions with the soviets on a new 
ussoviet longterm grain agreement said a joint statement 
thursday from agriculture secretary richard e lyng and us trade 
representative clayton k yeutter 
the two officials said they expected the talks that start march 
11 in vienna to be only the first step in the negotiating 
process aimed at fashioning an agreement to replace the current 
one which expires sept 30 
any agreement produced by the talks would be the third such deal 
between the united states and the soviet union since 1975 
the two officials said the earlier ones have been important in 
stabilizing grain trade between our two countries and we are 
optimistic we will be able to achieve another mutually beneficial 
agreement 
under the current fiveyear agreement the soviets agreed to 
purchase 9 million metric tons of wheat and corn annually four 
million tons must be wheat and four million corn 
the soviets may satisfy the rest of their commitment through 
purchases of wheat corn soybeans soybean meal or any combination 
of those commodities with every ton of soybeans or soybean meal 
counting as two tons of grain 
earlier this week the agriculture department announced the sale 
of 500000 metric tons of subsidized us wheat to the soviet union 
by private exporters it would be worth about 50 million at recent 
prices 
the sale came under the export enhancement program a subsidy 
established under the 1985 farm bill to provide exporters with 
surplus government commodities as an incentive to sell us farm 
goods 
the soviet union was a grain exporting nation through most of 
the 1960s but began largescale imports in the early 1970s the 
first longterm pact with the united states was signed in 1975 and 
another followed in 1983 
friction arose in 1986 when american producers were still 
recoiling from five years of weak performance in the farm economy 
and the soviets fell 38 million tons short of the minimum wheat 
purchase under the agreement complaining that the united states 
failed to meet world market prices 
the soviets left untouched a lastminute offer by the united 
states under which 4 million tons of wheat were made eligible for 
bonuses under the export enhancement act but the agriculture 
department made a similar offer again in early 1987 and the soviets 
resumed purchases

elizabeth shatto and christina drury braved 
rough seas to rescue a young girl from drowning in the gulf of 
mexico last summer earning them an award from the carnegie hero 
fund commission 
now the two 16yearolds from houston are taking a lifesaving 
course 
we hadnt had any lifesaving before that miss shatto said 
thursday it was just instinct you see someone who needs help 
and you go get them 
sixteen other people in 10 states were awarded carnegie medals 
thursday by the pittsburghbased commission established in 1904 by

heroes of civilization 
of the 18 heroes five died in their rescue attempts according 
to the commission each of the heroes or their survivors received a 
2500 grant and a bronze medal 
miss shatto said she and miss drury were in a beach house near 
surfside texas on aug 18 1987 when they heard a young boy 
scream he pointed to 11yearold lynette bennett whose head could 
be seen bobbing out in the ocean 
there was no one else around if we hadnt been there she 
would be dead she said 
the girls swam out grasped an arm and towed the exhausted girl 
to shore fighting a strong current and rough surf lynette 
recovered after being hospitalized overnight miss shatto said she 
and her friend were uninjured

ibm researchers say theyve set a record high 
temperature for superconductivity a jump of 35 degrees by 
varying the recipe that produced the old mark reported last month 
the accomplishment is a significant step toward making 
superconductors practical according to a superconductivity expert 
the new material lost all resistance to electricity at minus 234 
degrees fahrenheit said edward engler of the international 
business machine corp almaden research center in san jose calif 
the material was a mix of thallium barium calcium copper and 
oxygen the same elements used by university of arkansas 
researchers who last month reported zero resistance at minus 269 
degrees 
ibm used the elements in different proportions engler declined 
to reveal the new recipe thursday citing patent considerations 
allen hermann chairman of the physics department at the 
university of arkansas said he was astounded and thrilled by ibms 
result 
i knew someone would probably do us better he said in a 
telephone interview well the race is on 
superconductivity is the ability to carry electricity without 
resistance scientists want to drive the temperature up as far as 
possible to reduce or eliminate the need for chilling that will 
help make the materials practical for use in highspeed computers 
bullet trains and other applications 
one goal is to reach superconducting temperatures as far as 
possible above minus 321 degrees that is how cold a material gets 
when chilled by liquid nitrogen which is relatively cheap 
the higher the superconducting temperature is above that mark 
for a material chilled by liquid nitrogen the more electrical 
current the material can carry and the greater magnetic field it 
can withstand before losing its superconductivity 
the ibm compound is a significant step in that effort said 
brian schwartz physics professor at brooklyn college 
he noted that in terms of the kelvin scale which measures 
temperature in centigrade degrees above absolute zero liquid 
nitrogen chills to 77 degrees while the ibm mark corresponds to 125 
degrees 
now we have almost a situation with the thallium materials 
where if were working at liquid nitrogen temperatures were 
working at close to half the transition superconductivity 
temperature which is a very nice feature schwartz said 
thallium is poisonous and scientists say its potential for 
practical use outside the laboratory is limited but they hope to 
learn enough from thallium compounds to find more suitable 
materials that superconduct at still higher temperatures 
engler said the new material has shown no sign of losing its 
superconducting ability in the roughly two weeks his team has 
worked with it all of the dozen or so samples made so far have 
reached zero resistance in the range of minus 244 degrees 
fahrenheit to minus 234 degrees he said 
the thallium compound expelled a magnetic field a hallmark of 
superconductivity called the meissner effect engler said 
ibms results were reported this week at a superconductivity 
meeting in switzerland engler said his coworkers at the ibm 
center were victor lee adel nazzal and stuart parkin 
higher temperatures for superconductivity have been reported in 
the press but many have not been reproducible and others were 
based only on evidence that a sample contained isolated pockets of 
superconductivity rather than a complete zeroresistance pathway

washington ap an independent counsel investigating attorney 
general edwin meese iii is focusing on a 1 billion iraqi oil 
pipeline project calling a former national security council aide 
as a witness before a federal grand jury 
nsc aide david wigg a central figure in discussions of the 
proposed pipeline went before the grand jury for both morning and 
afternoon sessions thursday in the criminal investigation of meese 
being conducted by independent counsel james mckay 
in the fall of 1985 wigg was designated by thennational 
security adviser robert mcfarlane to expedite the project the 
proposed pipeline was foundering over iraqs desire for an 
insurance package iraq feared that israel its enemy for four 
decades would destroy the project 
wigg was involved in late 1985 in a plan which was never 
approved to use pentagon budget money to ensure that israel would 
not attack the proposed pipeline meese said last week through his 
lawyers that he had known nothing of the idea 
mckays probe is focusing on a 1985 memo to meese written by his 
longtime friend e robert wallach which mentioned that a portion of 
up to 700 million from the pipeline would be paid directly to the 
israeli labor party of thenprime minister shimon peres 
wallach was representing one of the projects partners swiss 
oilman bruce rappaport who has close ties to peres 
peres says that rappaport offered israel a 65 million to 70 
million a year discount on oil purchases but says he didnt take 
the idea seriously and didnt inform other government officials 
peres denies that rappaport proposed paying part of the money to 
the labor party 
the pipeline to have been constructed by san franciscobased 
bechtel group inc was never built 
mckay is investigating whether meese may have violated the 
foreign corrupt practices act which makes it a crime for us 
citizens companies or their agents to bribe foreign officials for 
help in business matters and authorizes the attorney general to 
file suit to block such practices meese says he doesnt recall 
reading the portion of wallachs memo pertaining to labor party 
payments 
wigg now is a deputy assistant secretary for policy analysis in 
the pentagon

a 50yearold law exempting truck and bus 
drivers in cities from meeting federal safety requirements is one 
step closer to being removed from the books 
the senate passed legislation thursday that would apply federal 
safety regulations within urban areas for the first time and would 
also commence government consideration of whether to put devices in 
trucks that would monitor drivers performances 
the bill which would also require the government to study how 
to improve truck braking systems was approved by a unanimous voice 
vote 
it is aimed at truck and bus accidents that kill more than 5000 
americans every year 
federal regulations set minimum standards for the construction 
and operation of trucks and buses and for the physical condition 
of their drivers they are often stricter and more detailed than 
state requirements 
but the rules do not apply in urban areas the regulations were 
written in the 1930s when urban traffic was slower than it is 
today and lawmakers believed city authorities could keep track of 
local problems 
the exemption for vehicles operating in cities would be 
eliminated one year after the bill becomes law 
the measure would also give the department of transportation a 
year to determine whether drivers performances must be monitored 
by instruments installed in the trucks and if so which devices 
should be used 
federal rules forbid commercial drivers from driving more than 
10 consecutive hours or 60 hours per week drivers are required to 
keep written records of their hours but these logs are believed to 
be frequently falsified 
mechanical and electronic devices are available that could 
record the driving time and speed of drivers 
the legislation would also give the transportation department 
until sept 30 to conduct a study on ways to improve truck braking 
systems and until a year after that to require better brakes if 
they are found to be necessary brake problems are believed to be a 
cause of up to onethird of all truck accidents 
the measures chief sponsors are sens john danforth rmo and 
brock adams dwash 
a similar bill is awaiting action in the house public works and 
transportation committee

a 94 million damage award to the family of a 
woman whose killer was hired through a soldier of fortune magazine 
classified ad is sending out a warning to other publishers the 
jury foreman says 
an attorney for the magazine said it would appeal thursdays 
verdict in favor of gary wayne black 18 and his grandmother 
marjorie eimann 64 who sought 225 million in their lawsuit 
this fight goes three rounds like a lot of first amendment 
cases said soldier of fortune attorney larry thompson we lost 
the first round but put your money on us in the next two rounds 
after deliberating for 12 hours over three days the jury 
awarded black 15 million 400000 to mrs eimann and 75 
million in punitive damages to the plaintiffs 
were sending out a warning or message to other publishers 
that ads placed in a certain context can be a very dangerous 
message and publishers as such should be responsible said jury 
foreman herman castex 
sandra black blacks mother and mrs eimanns daughter was 
shot to death feb 21 1985 at her home in bryan about 90 miles 
northwest of houston 
mrs blacks husband robert is on death row for paying john 
wayne hearn 10000 to kill her hearn is serving three life terms 
in florida for that slaying and two others 
robert black contacted hearn through a classified ad hearn 
placed in late 1984 in soldier of fortune the selfstyled 
journal for professional adventurers 
in a pretrial decision us district judge david hittner ruled 
that the boulder colobased magazine and parent company omega 
group ltd could not enjoy full first amendment protection because 
of the ads commercial nature 
this will have no effect on the legitimate press said 
plaintiffs attorney ron franklin soldier of fortune knew in 
fact that it was advertising for contract killers and that offers 
no first amendment protection 
publishing and legal experts were not as certain 
when magazine publishers advertising people hear a big 
verdict based on this kind of ad they may be more concerned than 
necessary to accept controversial advertising said slade 
metcalf chairman of legal affairs for the new yorkbased magazine 
publishers association 
these kinds of cases really open the door said david 
protess a professor at northwestern universitys medill school of 
journalism in evanston ill theres very little case law on 
media negligence there are almost no precedents 
attorneys said it could take 18 months before the case reaches 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals in new orleans 
mrs eimann shook hands and hugged the six jurors after the 
verdict i lost a daughter and he lost a mother she said 
looking at her grandson we felt something had to be done to save 
other peoples lives 
soldier of fortune publisher robert k brown said the verdict 
would not affect the future of his publication which sells about 
150000 copies monthly 
please understand this was a terrible tragedy a terrible 
crime he said we have a great deal of empathy for them but 
we didnt do it 
this means every publisher is going to have to read every ad 
and look into the minds of those placing the ad brown said 
hearns ad in four issues of soldier of fortune read ex 
marines 6769 nam vets exdi weapons specialist jungle 
warfare pilot me highrisk assignments us or overseas 
attorneys and witnesses for the family said highrisk 
assignments meant hearn and others placing similar ads were 
willing to commit crimes 
soldier of fortune witnesses defended the publication as a 
legitimate military journal and described the ads as providing 
employment for vietnam veterans as bodyguards security workers or 
mercenaries overseas 
but the familys lawyers linked at least nine other crimes to 
ads before september 1984 including a 1982 houston murderforhire 
case

a white house commission has adopted its 
chairmans recommendation to pour an additional 2 billion a year 
into the the fight against aids 
the panel unanimously approved retired navy adm james d 
watkins 60 pages of suggestions thursday night during a brief 
business meeting that wrapped up four full days of hearings on a 
variety of topics such as testing and protection against 
discrimination that are to be addressed in subsequent reports 
watkins had outlined his recommendations at a news conference 
last week and they were formally considered by the full commission 
on monday 
the final version contained no substantive changes although 
there were some additions to emphasize particular areas of concern 
for example a paragraph was added to emphasize that available 
data do not provide a basis for comfort or complacency to any 
segment of our society we express our concern that inaccurate 
and misleading statements suggesting that the virus cannot be 
spread through heterosexual activity could stimulate transmission 
among those who would see such reports as bases for ignoring the 
danger that does in fact exist 
in a section on drug abuse a sentence added to say in 
addition to direct transmission the use of drugs that impair 
judgment can contribute to sexual transmission 
that had been suggested by commissioner theresa l crenshaw a 
physician who specializes in sex therapy and has expressed the view 
that alcohol marijuana and other drugs can lower inhibitions and 
result in people engaging in risky sexual behavior that they 
otherwise would avoid 
the bulk of the increased spending called for in the report 
about 15 billion a year in federal and local funds would go 
directly to attacking intravenous drug abuse the rest all federal 
funds would go for development of drugs to treat the disease and 
additional ways of caring for aids patients such as more group 
homes for those who do not require constant hospitalization yet are 
unable to care for themselves 
the recommendations are geared toward the establishment of a 
treatment on demand system for iv drug abusers whereby treatment 
would be immediately available for any iv drug abuser the report 
said 
health authorities are convinced aids is spreading most rapidly 
among iv drug users who often pass the virus by sharing 
contaminated needles and their sexual partners and offspring 
it is estimated that there could be as many as 20000 babies 
infected with aids by 1991 most of them catching it directly or 
indirectly from the estimated 13 million iv drug users in the 
nation 
the other two sections of the report focus on patient care and 
basic research for drug development to treat the disease 
the commission recommends expanding resources for the food and 
drug administration expanding community based clinical trials and 
removing placebos in clinical trials whenever possible 
the section on patient care says the aim is to promote a 
continuum of comprehensive accessible costeffective high quality 
care for persons infected with hiv hiv is the medical term for 
the aids virus

vice president george bush holds a strong lead 
over rival bob dole among likely gop voters in south carolinas 
primary according to a poll published today 
the washington post said bush had the support of 49 percent of 
1000 people who said they would vote in the gop primary while 
dole had 26 percent pat robertson garnered 14 percent and new york 
rep jack kemp claimed 7 percent 
among those voters most likely to go to the polls those who 
said they were certain to vote had voted in 1986 and strongly 
supported a specific candidate bush had 55 percent support to 
doles 22 percent and robertsons 17 percent figures for kemp were 
not provided in that category 
the post survey taken over six nights ending wednesday had a 
margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points the south 
carolina contest takes place just three days before the big round 
of super tuesday primaries and caucuses concentrated in the south 
the post survey found that even among several different 
categories of christians former television evangelist robertson 
was not the favorite among voters who said they watch television 
evangelists almost every week bush got 44 percent to robertsons 
27 percent 
the core of robertsons support according to the poll was 
among voters who placed high priority on moral and social issues 
about 83 percent of robertsons backers said their main reason 
for supporting him was his stand on pornography robertsons stand 
on abortion was cited by 78 percent of his supporters as a big 
factor about half cited concerns about declining moral 
standards or school prayer as the biggest reason for their 
support

a house panel chairman investigating fbi 
conduct says a bureau official used mccarthylike tactics when he 
disclosed unproven allegations against an antireagan organization 
in a floor speech thursday night rep don edwards chairman of 
a house judiciary civil rights subcommittee likened the disclosure 
to misuse of fbi files by the late sen joseph mccarthy in the 
early 1950s 
mccarthy used investigatory information from the fbi to 
label government officials as communists without proving the 
allegations edwards said 
edwards panel and the senate intelligence committee are 
investigating the fbis march 1983june 1985 probe of opponents of 
president reagans central america policy the lawmakers want to 
know whether the bureau improperly investigated political activity 
protected by the first amendment 
the intelligence panel held a public hearing feb 23 at which 
fbi executive assistant director oliver b revell sought to justify 
the bureaus investigation the probe focused primarily on the 
committee in solidarity with the people of el salvador but it 
broadened to include a number of other groups and individuals 
revell released a report that detailed some of the allegations 
against cispes none of which were proved by the fbi 
during the mccarthy era it was a common practice of the fbi 
to secretly disclose investigative file information to 
congressional committees edwards dcalif said 
if the fbi responds to criticism by doing publicly before tv 
cameras what it once did privately then we have not come very far 
at all he said 
fbi spokeswoman sue schnitzer said mr revell testified at 
the request of the committee this was an open hearing and 
therefore the information provided at that hearing was not of a 
classified nature 
edwards said he was not trying to prove or disprove the 
information but said the allegations amounted to guilt by 
association since no charges were ever filed against cispes or 
its members 
some of the information released at the hearing was made public 
previously under a freedom of information act lawsuit filed on 
behalf of cispes other information disclosed at the hearing had 
not been made public before 
edwards called revells disclosure of unsupported 
allegations at a public hearing a major violation of the key 
rule for police investigatory files that none of the information 
can be published except according to established rules and 
safeguards 
improper release of file information by the government is 
a violation of the constitutional and statutory right of privacy 
and can cause grave injury to innocent people or groups edwards 
said 
among the allegations that edwards said should not have been 
released 
claims that some cispes members were involved in the 
distribution of a sovietforged document to the media 
a statement that cispes was believed to have been established 
with assistance of the communist party of the usa 
linking cispes political support of the salvadoran guerrilla 
group fmln to terrorist actions by that organization suggesting 
according to edwards that cispes was somehow connected with 
these actions 
a possible connection between cispes and two bombings in 
washington because one took place about the same time of a 
cispes rally in the capital and responsibility for the second was 
claimed by a group with positions similar to those of cispes 
the fbi never brought any charges against cispes or its members

the government says a weeklong military exercise 
in the falkland islands set to begin monday is not intended to 
provoke argentina noting that fewer than 1000 troops are to take 
part 
argentina which claims the islands it calls malvinas lost a 
74day war with britain for their possession in 1982 and still has 
not formally declared an end to hostilities in the south atlantic 
a communique thursday from argentinas foreign affairs and 
defense ministries said argentina has adopted plans for vigilance 
and defensive alert during the british exercise and if 
necessary will execute corresponding defense plans it did not 
elaborate 
britains minister of state for the armed forces ian stewart 
told the house of commons thursday night that fewer than 1000 
troops and only a small number of aircraft would take part in the 
exercise codenamed fire focus 
stewart said the exercise involves an airlift and is part of a 
defensive strategy to keep a minimum of troops in the islands about 
400 miles east of the southern argentine coast 
the british defense ministry announced last june that it was 
reducing the strength of its falklands garrison but refused to 
disclose the size of the cut published reports at the time said 
the move would cut the garrison then consisting of more than 2500 
troops by about 400 
britain completed an international airport at mount pleasant 
near the falklands capital of stanley in june 1985 the airport can 
take widebodied military jets enabling britain to fly in 
reinforcements at short notice if necessary 
stewart said the development of contingency plans for a massive 
airlift had enabled britain to halve the size of the garrison 
he gave no figures for the present strength of the costly 
garrison but added such a substantial reduction of the military 
presence serves to confirm that our purpose is entirely 
defensive 
a defense ministry spokesman who in accordance with british 
practice declined to be named said later we are not intending 
to increase the tension down there there is nothing significant 
about the timing of it the exercise it is not meant in any way 
to be provocative to argentina 
a foreign office spokesman said britain recently notified 
argentina through swiss diplomatic channels that the exercise was 
purely one of reinforcement 
diplomatic ties between britain and argentina cut during the 
1982 war remain severed

federal researchers could find no new or unusual 
pathways by which aids spread in a study of 2059 people who 
apparently contracted the deadly disease from unknown sources says 
a report published today 
another new study concluded that routine screening of surgical 
patients for the aids virus is unwarranted because it would wrongly 
identify as many as 130000 people as having the virus for every 
surgeon it saved from infection 
even though surgeons are very important people somehow 
changing the lives of 130000 people to protect one of them doesnt 
seem quite right to me said one of the researchers dr stephen 
g pauker 
both studies were published in the journal of the american 
medical association 
the national centers for disease control in atlanta investigated 
2059 cases of aids recorded through the end of september in which 
there was no evident means for the patient to have acquired the 
infection 
cdc researchers concluded that known but undetected risk factors 
were probably responsible 
the risk factors are male homosexual contact intravenous drug 
use and receiving tainted blood transfusions or blood products the 
researchers said other factors are sexual contact with people 
infected with the aids virus or at high risk and residency in a 
country where aids is passed mainly through heterosexual contact 
it can be concluded the disease is still following patterns of 
transmission that have already been identified said coauthor dr 
kenneth g castro 
weve had six or seven years of epidemic he said in a 
telephone interview thursday we should have had some change by 
now if other modes of transmission existed 
although the aids virus has been detected in saliva tears and 
urine there is no evidence for believing it can be passed through 
these fluids according to an accompanying article by dr alan r 
lifson a public health specialist with the san francisco 
department of public health 
of the 2059 cases 921 were eliminated because no detailed 
medical history could be obtained another 825 were found to 
involve risk factors that had not been identified originally 
an additional 32 cases were excluded because the patients had 
been incorrectly diagnosed as having acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome 
that left just 281 cases for which no risk factors seemed to 
exist the researchers said 
the patients or relatives in about twothirds of these cases 
were questioned it turned out that 34 percent of those subjects 
had a history of other sexual disease and 38 percent had visited 
prostitutes the researchers said 
the findings suggest that the group with no known risk factors 
probably represents a mixture of persons who either had 
undetected risk factors or were sex partners of persons in 
highrisk groups the researchers said 
the 2059 cases were among a total of 41770 reported to the cdc 
through september since june 1981 when recordkeeping began 
by monday a total of 54723 cases had been reported of those 
30715 died 
in the study of presurgical screening doctors at bostons new 
england medical center concluded that routine testing for the aids 
virus was unjustified 
for a surgeon to get an infection three things must happen 
pauker said in a telephone interview wednesday 
the patient must have disease the surgeon has to stick 
himself or herself and the infection needs to be transmitted he 
said the chance all three events will occur is quite low 
pauker and his colleagues said a surgeons likelihood of getting 
infected while working on an infected patient is between one in 
130000 and one in 4500 based on figures for surgical accidents 
and their frequency of causing infection 
the researchers weighed this against prevalence of the aids 
virus in us populations ranging from one in 100 to one in 
10000 and the lowest known falsepositive test rate for people 
who are screened one in 20000 
the researchers found that for every surgeon saved from 
infection between 22 and 130000 people would be falsely labeled 
as aidsinfected the researchers said those people then would be 
told they were infected and perhaps would be denied surgery 
aids desroys the bodys defenses against disease leaving a 
person prey to lifethreatening infections and certain cancers

jesse jackson accused the democratic 
party leadership in the south of a sustained effort to thwart 
his presidential candidacy but said its not working 
he said he has a twopronged message that will reap strong 
support for him on super tuesday with its round of caucuses and 
primaries concentrated in the south 
jackson said one part of his message is the need to rid our 
society of drugs a message that brings an enthusiastic response 
wherever he goes 
the other he said is that a growing body of american working 
people feel abandoned by the law and are turning to him because 
he addresses their concerns 
jackson made the comments in an interview thursday aboard his 
campaign plane flying here he declined to predict how well he will 
do in tuesdays critical primaries but he expressed cautious 
optimism that his economic justice theme is reaching whites as 
well as his traditional base of black support 
one can never becertain whats going to happen tuesday 
night he said but added my sense is theres a higher comfort 
level among whites about his candidacy 
asked about exit polls following februarys iowa caucuses and 
new hampshire primary that showed his white supporters were mostly 
upscale and welleducated rather than the working class he is 
appealing to jackson said 
that is changing iowa led the breakthrough people were 
wrestling with an ancient cultural barrier 
by the time maine held its democratic caucuses last weekend 
jackson contended the working class had become a main force behind 
his secondplace finish 
drugs he tells his audiences are the no 1 national security 
threat against the united states today people respond to that 
he said because every parent knows their child is threatened 
every day by drugs people see this as a moral issue of our day 
as president jackson says his priorty would be to beef up the 
customs and border patrol interdiction efforts press 
drugproducing nations to develop other crops and crack down on 
corruption in law enforcement agencies and banks that work with the 
drug traffickers 
the democratic candidate is crisscrossing the south touching 
down at five states per day for rallies at schools churches and 
auditoriums to shore up his widespread black support and woo new 
white voters 
on thursday jackson held events in arkansas oklahoma 
mississippi but had to cancel a trip to new orleans because of a 
tornado watch that grounded his plane instead he spoke by 
telephone to a church full of people who were waiting for him 
the campaign is filled with madefortv events to augment the 
100000 tv ad campaign that begins today in several southern 
states 
casual conversations with voters along the campaign trail reveal 
some sentiment that white voters are more willing to support 
jackson than they were in 1984 several said the race issue is far 
less of a concern 
jackson represents something weve needed a long time said 
thomas delong a 57yearold white man who came to hear jackson 
thursday at mississippi state university 
the majority of people in this country are not wealthy 
theyre not yuppies theyre poor and they cant get up because 
the system wont let them he said 
jackson said he senses the difference between this campaign and 
his unsuccessful white house bid in 1984 because black and white 
interests are coming together and the racial factors have been 
overtaken by economic concerns 
jackson cited this weeks endorsements of his campaign by 
prominent white politicians texas agriculture commissioner jim 
hightower oklahoma state sen gene stipe and tennessee democratic 
activist john j hooker as evidence of an expanding base 
historical movements in this country have always been kind of 
racebased this is becoming a classbased movement for economic 
justice he said in the interview 
he accused southern democratic leaders many of whom have lined 
up behind the other southern native son sen albert gore jr of 
tennessee of a sustained effort to try and keep democrats 
from his campaign 
all these elected officials are trying to stop me he said 
but stipe said that regardless of what the power brokers say 
they cannot stop that momentum that jackson is building 
hooker said that in 1984 many whites who would not accept 
jackson are taking a new look after he garnered substantial white 
totals in the early primary and caucus states 
regardless of how the convention turns out this summer jackson 
said he will work with the party leaders and push for the party 
platform to include planks addressing his priorities on raising the 
minimum wage and other concerns of working people 
he will also seek foreign policy planks on renewing trade with 
nicaragua and working with banks to relieve latin countries debts 
so those nations can afford to buy more us goods he said

physicians must be more aware of selfdestructive 
impulses in aids patients who are much more likely to commit 
suicide than the general population and even victims of other 
terminal illnesses a new study says 
the study published in todays journal of the american medical 
association found that the risk of suicide among men 20 to 59 
years old with aids was 36 times greater than for other men in that 
age group and 66 times greater than for the general population 
other studies have shown that cancer victims are up to four 
times more likely than the general population to kill themselves 
while suicide is statistically rare the study found that the 
threat to aids victims comes first when they learn they have the 
disease then again when it begins to affect the central nervous 
system 
the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome has been associated 
with secondary depression and other psychiatric syndromes all 
of which are associated with higher suicide rates the 
researchers wrote 
the lesson is that physicians treating aids patients must be 
aware of the possibility of suicide said one of the researchers 
dr peter m marzuk of cornell university medical college 
physicians should evaluate suicide risk in these patients 
carefully he said because of the risk for suicide the 
presence of concomitant psychiatric syndromes especially 
depression and delirium should lead to early psychiatric 
intervention 
an accompanying editorial emphasized the potential suicide risk 
for people who test positive for the aids virus even though some 
of them might not have the disease 
the presence of aids antibodies in a persons blood does not 
mean he has the disease but only that the virus that causes aids 
has entered his system and provoked a natural diseasefighting 
response 
the risk of suicide is one more reason that such tests should 
never be considered as routine dr richard m glass an 
associate professor of psychiatry at the university of chicago 
hospital wrote in the editorial the enormity of this problem is 
indicated by estimates that approximately 15 million americans 
have hiv antibodies 
there were reports last spring of seven suicides in the miami 
area among people who had tested positive 
roger lane hotline coordinator for miamis health crisis 
network said in a telephone interview thursday that others tried 
unsuccessfully to take their own lives on the basis of very 
preliminary tests 
the suicide outbreak coincided with the opening of new 
aidstesting centers many of which offered no counseling and some 
of which merely gave test results over the telephone he said 
if you were notifying someone they had terminal cancer you 
wouldnt do that over the phone he said 
doctors must specifically ask patients about any suicidal 
feelings glass said 
the study reported in jama focused on suicides in 1985 in new 
york city where aids is the leading cause of death of men in their 
30s there were 3828 people who had aids in the city then of whom 
12 were known to have killed themselves 
these are conservative estimates of the number of 
suicides marzuk said we dont know how many people may have 
taken an overdose of heroin for example these would never have 
been counted as suicides 
aids destroys the bodys defenses against disease leaving a 
person prey to lifethreatening infections and certain cancers

the reagan administration has suspended new 
regulations that would have cut off federal funds to family 
planning clinics which offer abortions or abortion counseling 
after a judge ruled the guidelines were unconstitutional 
abortion referral and abortion counseling are constitutionally 
protected speech under the first amendment said us district 
judge walter j skinner issuing a permanent injunction thursday 
against enforcement of the regulations 
denying an otherwise eligible organization a grant because it 
provides abortion counseling or referral even with nonfederal 
funds constitutes an impermissable penalty for the exercise of a 
constitutionally protected right he said 
the regulations are specifically designed to suppress speech 
and particularly directed at the suppression of one viewpoint 
skinner said as a result they run directly contrary to the 
dictates of the first amendment 
he said the regulations also were contrary to the intent of 
congress when it established the family planning program under 
title x of the public health service act of 1970 
the regulations scheduled to take effect thursday will not be 
enforced while the administration reviews the ruling and decides 
whether to appeal said lucy eddinger a spokeswoman for the 
department of health and human services 
skinner ruled the guidelines would cause irreparable harm to 
women who receive services from the clinics and violate a womans 
right to privacy and to choose to have an abortion 
federal judges in denver and new york city had issued temporary 
injunctions against the new rules but had not ruled on their 
constitutionality and it was not clear whether those rulings had 
full nationwide force 
this court has national jurisdiction in federal question 
cases skinner saidin his 28page ruling 
the regulations had not been expected to affect the estimated 
4000 family planning clinics operated with federal funds because 
the rules apply only to new grants about 5 million poor women 
receive services through the clinics 
the injunction was requested last month by the state of 
massachusetts the national family planning and reproductive health 
association and 13 other local and national family planning groups 
although the injunction applied only to those clinics 
represented by the groups skinner said he expected secretary of 
health and human services otis r bowen to scrap the regulations 
scott r sterling executive director of the washington 
dcbased family planning association said he expected the 
administration to appeal because of political pressure 
we expect to be successful at the appeals level as well 
sterling said 
massachusetts attorney general james shannon called the ruling 
a major victory for a womans right to consult privately with her 
doctor 
the new rules would have prohibited federally funded family 
planning programs from providing abortion counseling referring 
women to abortion providers and engaging in lobbying or legal 
action to increase availability of abortions 
if the facility also performs abortions to keep title x funding 
for its other programs the clinic would have to maintain completely 
separate facilities for each type of patient 
in its attempt to implement a health care policy which 
promotes childbirth the defendant has devised a system which rests 
in large part of keeping title x clients in ignorance skinner 
said 
the title x budget for fiscal 1988 is 137 million down from 
142 million in fiscal 1987

a factory director whose laborefficiency plans 
won him a 2700 prize has decided to give up the money because of 
the lingering stigma against wealth and a deluge of request for 
handouts a newspaper said today 
the prize 10000 yuan is a huge sum for most chinese equal to 
10 years wages for the average urban worker and double that for a 
typical peasant 
zhang xingrang director of the no 1 plastic factory in the 
eastern city of shijiazhuang decided not to keep the money after 
being besieged with petitions for loans the staterun workers 
daily said 
the paper said he was receiving dozens of letters each day from 
strangers wanting to share in his new wealth with friends and 
coworkers adding to the chorus 
zhang won the prize for developing what he called a fullload 
work plan for allocating labor more efficiently at his factory 
he became a nationally famous labor hero winning praise from 
communist party leader zhao ziyang 
the workers daily said colleagues told zhang old zhang now 
that youre rich dont forget we helped you you can eat meat now 
a little soup or some bones is enough for us 
one letterwriter pleaded for 375 yuan to buy a threewheeled 
pedicab so he could take his children including 9yearold 
triplets to school 
take pity on these children he pleaded addressing zhang as 
the god of wealth 
another writer said he needed 2000 yuan to get out of 
financial straits adding this amount is nothing to you 
the paper said zhang feared criticism that has been heaped on 
other factory directors who have become rich in recent years 
because of incentives and profitsharing programs designed to spur 
production 
he put the money in a bank and is busy trying to devise a 
giveaway plan that will satisfy most people the paper said 
zhao declared last october that china is in the primary stage 
of socialism and that it is permissible in this stage for some 
individuals to become rich while others lag behind 
egalitarianism was the rule for most of chinas first four 
decades under communism in recent years the chinese government 
has relaxed many of its economic policies allowing for free 
enterprise but many of the new rich have been criticized and even 
hit with criminal charges for acquiring large amounts of money

the state department has violated the spirit 
and letter of a new law by denying a visa to the head of the 
legal political wing of the irish republican army says a new 
yorkbased group advocating the end of british rule in northern 
ireland 
gerry adams president of the iras sinn fein was denied a visa 
because of his alleged involvement in terrorist activities in 
northern ireland donna sherman a state department spokeswoman 
said thursday 
he was ineligible under the section of the immigration and 
nationality act which excludes from admission to the us people 
who are personally involved with terrorist activities sherman 
said 
but martin galvin spokesman for the irish northern aid 
committee in new york said in a statement irishamericans are 
outraged by the refusal of the state department to comply with the 
spirit and letter of the new visa provisions 
he was referring to an amendment to an appropriations bill 
passed last year which in effect overturned that portion of 
immigration law allowing the us government to deny visas to 
aliens who participate in political activities in their native 
countries which would be legal for us citizens in the united 
states 
the ira is fighting to end british rule in northern ireland and 
is outlawed on both sides of the border although sinn fein is

korean officials shudder and editorial 
writers sputter when rep richard gephardt says a midsized 
american car costs 48000 in south korea because of tariffs but 
they admit the presidential hopeful is threequarters right 
an american car that would cost 10000 in the united states 
costs about 36000 in south korea after taxes tariffs and duties 
according to korean and us officials 
the charges limit foreign car sales in south korea to a few 
hundred each year last year south korea exported 442557 vehicles 
to the united states that averaged 7000 in price 
gephardt has used the 48000 figure on the campaign trail to 
underscore his argument that many nations close their markets to 
us goods while taking advantage of washingtons free trade policy 
to flood american markets 
the argument has appealed to some americans and the missouri 
congressman has emerged as a frontrunner in the race for the 
presidential nomination of the democratic party 
gephardts platform has caused resentment in south korea at a 
time when the country is under american pressure to open its 
markets to imports south koreas trade surplus with the united 
states its main trading partner reached 95 billion last year 
gephardt is a name on many lips here but the government isnt 
too worried since theres still a long way to go in the 
elections said a us trade official in seoul who asked not to 
be identified 
korean newspapers and television have provided regular reports 
on gephardt since he started singling out south korea gephardt has 
been attacked by newspapers as an unreasonable politician trying to 
blame others for americas failure to keep its economy healthy 
the charges gave the impression that malicious korean trade 
practices are responsible for the sad state of the us economy 
its really shocking to us said the kyunghyang shinmun in a feb 
13 editorial 
but the government has not challenged gephardt because trade 
restrictions do exist officials said 
it is true to a certain extent that there exists some 
discrimination against imported cars said one offical who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
korean officials say their country has many economic problems 
and is only just emerging as a modern nation they say the economy 
is fragile and needs protection including some import barriers 
the gross national product is below 3000 per person and the 
economy is weighed down by 35 billion in foreign debt 
radical students have seized on american trade pressure in 
recent weeks in a bid to attract public support farmers worried 
about cheap us agricultural products have dumped cow manure at 
government buildings 
most koreans agree that the economy must be protected but the 
small scattered protests have attracted little support 
the korean attitude is to wait until it really becomes a 
problem a us diplomat said 
the government has pledged to open its markets wider to american 
and other imports as quickly as possible but us pressure to move 
more quickly is rejected as bullying 
theyre promising changes but if its going to happen is 
anyones guess said one us business representative based in 
seoul who asked not to be named 
the united states has been pressing south korea to drop import 
restrictions on a wide range of goods recent talks have centered 
on allowing beef imports and lowering the price of american 
cigarettes 
the disparity in the car industry is a good example of the 
problems and discrimination faced by american companies us 
diplomats said 
our figures show about 10 foreign cars have been sold in south 
korea so far this year we dont think any of them were american 
said one noting that the only levy imposed by the united states on 
imported korean cars is customs duty of about 4 percent

the massive rioting and arrests of 
opposition leaders that followed this weeks reelection of 
president abdou diouf have shaken this west african nations belief 
in itself as a democracy 
two days of rioting in the capital that followed sundays 
national balloting took the government by surprise it denounced 
the hail of stones as stemming from the oppositions reckless 
manipulation of youngsters 
opposition parties had claimed dioufs socialist party rigged 
the voting 
a state of emergency and curfew were imposed and soldiers and 
riot police flooded the capitals streets officials were granted 
sweeping arrest powers and authority to curb the media 
more than 80 buses were damaged dozens of gas stations and 
stores looted or gutted by fire the homes of some officials of the 
governing socialist party ransacked police raided the university 
and opposition party headquarters and fought running battles with 
stonethrowing protesters 
several top opposition leaders were arrested including the main 
opposition presidential candidate abdoulaye wade of the senegalese 
democratic party 
wades fiery rhetoric and call for change clearly struck a 
responsive chord opposition supporters say the socialists after 
28 years in power had themselves become the state losing touch 
with the countrys 67 million people 
a senior government official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the nations leaders were shocked 
they did not understand the depth of the feeling they dont 
want to face it and since the campaign began they have been 
shrinking away from the real issue they talk about democracy but 
they wont relinquish power 
no black african government has ever handed over power to an 
opposition party after an election defeat 
there are 17 registered political parties in senegal but just 
six participated in the elections a free press regularly lampoons 
the government and even pokes fun at diouf without fear of 
reprisal senegalese are proud of those freedoms 
but the opposition parties act more like rip van winkle than 
real parties every five years they wake up to watch the political 
parade then nod off again 
many senegalese including diouf supporters said the 
52yearold president was not powerful enough to control his own 
party which they say has too much at stake to allow the freedom 
people demand 
diouf supporters joined those who expressed frustration with 
nepotism in government 
serigne mor diop an outofwork carpenter said he thought 
diouf was a good leader and an honest man whose party had gone 
unchallenged for too long 
we need dioufs leadership but we dont need the ps and their 
corruption he said no party should be allowed such power 
a senior western diplomat whose government strongly supports 
diouf said the presidents commitment to democracy was not matched 
by the government bureaucracy 
democracy has been an evolutionary process going on here since 
1848 said the diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity 
these elections are one way of viewing how far its come in the 
long run there will have to be further evolution 
the senegalese are outraged when they think their rights have 
been abused 
in riottorn sections of dakar and in the industrial city of 
thies about 45 miles away senegalese young and old angrily 
denounced what they saw as police brutality and violation of their 
rights this week 
with tear gasreddened eyes and tearstained faces they angrily 
demanded is this what diouf calls a democracy we have a right 
to peaceful assembly our government has no right to stop us 
jacques nzouankeu of dakars center for studies and research on 
pluralistic democracy in the third world sees such violence as a 
serious threat to the handful of democratic countries in africa and 
those moving towards democracy 
it is a catastrophic thing because those who dont want 
democracy are numerous he said they are looking for a chance 
to say see democracy doesnt work we need a new system 
omar bongo who heads the oneparty central african state of 
gabon called the senegalese troubles proof pluralism is not for 
africa 
see what this leads to bongo said we are for 
democratization of our states but not for the multiplication of 
anarchy

republican presidential hopeful pat robertson 
said god had spoken to him calling him to usher in the second 
coming of jesus christ a newspaper reported today 
in a tape of a december 1984 address to a religious seminar in 
dallas robertson said christs return is imminent and would be 
accompanied by christians taking dominion over the wealth and 
property of nonbelievers the los angeles times reported 
in a reference to dallas downtown office buildings robertson 
said imagine the time the people of god have inherited that 
property because the bible says that the wicked lay up and heap up 
treasures for the righteous 
in the 1984 tape robertson said god had told him i have 
called you to usher in the coming of my son he also briefly 
speaks in tongues a form of unrecognizable language uttered by 
those who practice charismatic christianity during his closing 
prayer 
robertson has said he received the prophecy in 1968 through 
harald bredesen a close associate who laid his hand on robertsons 
head and spoke as if god were speaking through him 
however when questioned about the prophecy both bredesen and 
robertson characterized it as applying to robertsons ministry the 
christian broadcasting network robertson resigned from cbn before 
undertaking his presidential campaign 
bredesen said we would all be appalled and pat would be 
appalled at the prospects that robertsons remarks would be 
construed to mean that gods words applied to him personally 
asked thursday to comment about the 1968 prophecy robertson 
said bredesen may have been referring to middle east 
television and predicted robertsons role in spreading the 
gospel thoughout the middle east via cbns transmitter in lebanon 
however in an april 1982 letter to cbn contributors robertson 
quoted the bredesen prophecy and said god has assigned a ministry 
to cbn to prepare the way for the second coming 
robertson has rebuked reporters for referring to him as a former 
television evangelist he insists on being evaluated on the basis 
of his record as a businessman educator and founder of the 
multimilliondollar christian broadcasting network 
robertson contends that examinations of his religious beliefs in 
the context of his presidential campaign constitute bigotry and he 
maintains that his fervent evangelical beliefs would not interfere 
with his execution of presidential power

police arrested two men in the slaying of a 
rookie patrolman who was shot in the head as he guarded a drug 
witness last week a spokesman said today 
the suspects were picked up thursday afternoon in the borough of 
queens and questioned for about six hours before their arrest 
around midnight said officer peter odonnell 
two women picked up with the men were released odonnell said 
the suspects names the charges and other details will not be 
released until a news conference today odonnell said 
officer edward byrne 22 was shot three times in the head at 
pointblank range early feb 26 while sitting alone in a patrol car 
outside the queens house of a man who had complained to police 
about neighborhood crack dealers 
the daily news and new york times quoting unidentified sources 
said one of the four picked up was 24yearold todd scott of

an associate of reputed drug kingpin lorenzo fat cat nichols 
nichols 29 was sentenced feb 25 to 25 years to life in prison 
on drug and gun charges and is awaiting trial on charges he had 
his parole officer killed for revenge mason is awaiting trial on 
charges he helped carry out the killing 
police have speculated that nichols may have ordered byrnes 
killing as retribution for his long sentence 
since the slaying police have rounded up 294 suspected drug 
dealers in their investigation 
shooting at cops its just bad for business i think 
experienced criminals know that perhaps these inexperienced ones 
will learn it police commissioner benjamin ward said thursday

the reward for information leading to a conviction grew to 
130000 thursday with a 25000 contribution from members of the

identified two men including the gunman and two women believed to 
have been in the car that quietly coasted up to byrnes police car 
before he was shot

the first egg produced by a pair of captive 
california condors is a huge success for biologists trying to save 
the endangered species even if it proves to be infertile a 
curator says 
the egg laid thursday at san diego wild animal park will be 
inspected for fertility monday officials said 
if its not fertile we would still remain happy said bill 
toone curator of birds for the san diego zoo which is affiliated 
with the park we now know they will breed in captivity 
only 27 of the giant birds exist all in captivity at the park 
or the los angeles zoo 
the 10ounce pale bluegreen egg was moved from a nest to an 
electronic incubator said park spokesman tom hanscom if fertile 
the egg is expected to hatch within two months 
the egg may be infertile because the female is old and her mate 
may be sexually immature park officials said 
by taking the egg from its parents at an early point scientists 
hope to induce the pair to produce a second egg to replace the one 
they lost 
the incubator will maintain a constant temperature and humidity 
for the egg handlers will turn it 180 degrees twice a day 
imitating the behavior of a mother condors care in the wild 
california condors which have a wingspan of about 9 feet are 
dark reddishbrown with a curved beak they were decimated in the 
wild by lead poisoning from eating lead shot in animal carcasses 
biologists said 
the last one living in the wild was captured and brought to the 
wild animal park last april in the effort to save the species 
since 1981 scientists have successfully hatched 13 condors in 
captivity from eggs taken in the wild 
wildlife biologists hope to breed sufficient numbers of the 
condor in captivity and release the captivebred birds into a safe 
environment in the wild

garrison keillor former star of a prairie 
home companion has sued national public radio and a new york 
distribution company for allegedly violating his copyright by 
selling a recorded speech 
in the lawsuit filed thursday in us district court here 
keillor claims he never gave the nonprofit radio network permission 
to commercially use a speech he gave last year at the national 
press club in washington 
an author is entitled to decide which of his works he wants 
sold to the public said keillors attorney samuel heins he 
said keillor wants to stop sales of the 45minute cassette which 
is called garrison keillor back home and sells for 1095 
npr spokeswoman cate cowan said the network handled keillors 
speech no differently than it does other press club talks by 
prominent people and that nprs lawyers do not believe the network 
infringed on keillors copyright 
npr included the speech in its catalog of cassettes for sale 
and according to the suit sold rights to the speech to a record 
distributing company 
that company spoken arts inc of new york city took out an 
advertisement last month in publishers weekly to promote keillors 
tape and three others to bookstores spoken arts entitled the 
cassette garrison keillor beyond lake wobegon and listed its 
price as 995 
keillors suit names both npr and spoken arts as defendants 
spoken arts employees who answered the companys telephone thursday 
said president joel klein was unavailable for comment 
the speech was given last october while keillor was promoting 
his book leaving home national public radio regularly 
broadcasts press club luncheon speeches according to cowan it 
announces at the end of each speech that cassette recordings are 
available for purchase 
in the speech keillor spoke about his feelings on having left 
minnesota just as his beloved minnesota twins were about to win the 
world series 
he also invited recordings of the speech if you have tape 
recorders you are welcome to turn them on at this point he 
said you are welcome to use any of this if you want 
heins says in the suit that keillor filed for a copyright on the 
speech feb 26 he also said that he asked npr and spoken arts to 
stop sales of the tape but that neither has agreed to 
the suit asks for a court order to impound and destroy all 
unsold tapes it also requests a list of people who have bought the 
tapes and asks for unspecified damages for keillor and attorneys 
fees for heins 
keillors nationally broadcast live variety show was produced by 
minnesota public radio and distributed by american public radio 
before it was discontinued last june

rose cipollone was so hooked on cigarettes 
that she smoked a pack while in labor with her first child even 
though she had tried to quit an addiction expert testified in 
support of her familys liability suit 
dr jerome jaffe cited several instances on the stand thursday 
to show that mrs cipollone was so dependent on cigarettes that 
smoking governed her behavior until her death of lung cancer at age 
40 
he depicted a smoker who picked butts from the garbage ordered 
groceries just to have cigarettes delivered and puffed away even 
after part of her lung had been removed 
mrs cipollone became a vivid presence for the first time during 
the fiveweek federal court trial after her death in 1984 her 
widower antonio of lakehurst carried on the suit against three 
tobacco companies 
the defendants philip morris co lorillard inc and liggett 
group inc deny they are responsible for her death one of their 
arguments is that mrs cipollone smoked of her own free will 
jaffe a clinical psychiatrist and director of the national 
institute of drug abuses research center in baltimore described 
what he learned about mrs cipollones smoking habits during a 
75minute interview at her lawyers office months before she died 
she was dependent and i thought heavily dependent on tobacco 
and cigarettes jaffe said 
under crossexamination by liggett lawyer james v kearney 
jaffe acknowledged that he did not examine mrs cipollone 
physically and never saw her smoke 
until now testimony in the case has centered on allegations 
that the companies failed to do enough research on the health 
effects of smoking tell the public what they did know or put a 
safer product on the market 
as the focus shifted to mrs cipollone jaffe related that when 
she was in labor with her first child in 1947 she was asked by 
doctors what she wanted her answer was a glass of water and 
despite having nearly quit during her pregnancy a cigarette the 
doctors brought her a pack 
she said i smoked a whole pack before the baby was born 
according to jaffe who referred to his notes of the interview 
while being questioned by marc z edell an attorney for her estate 
in 1964 when the surgeon generals report linking smoking and 
disease came out mrs cipollone consciously tried to ignore it 
its typical jaffe said its the heart of most 
dependences denial is the cardinal symbol 
in 1981 when a spot was found on her lung mrs cipollone threw 
away her cigarettes but jaffe recalled her saying i was smoking 
when i went into the hospital for a lung operation 
she continued to smoke after the operation he said stopping 
the following year when her right lung was removed 
jaffe also served as a special consultant to the president for 
narcotics and dangerous drugs from 1971 to 1973

that hold the ships two 60000pound anchors

offices of armand hammer chairman of occidental petroleum corp 
and the university of california los angeles 
as the prince proceeded to the jet plane for the afternoon 
flight he said this is one of the loneliest walks ive ever 
done 
the engines screamed and sarah wearing a flight helmet of her 
own clutched a gift teddy bear as she watched the jet soar off the 
ship it turned back for a low flyby and the pair waved to each 
other before the duchess boarded a helicopter for her own flight to 
long beach where the royal yacht britannia is docked 
the duke and duchess returned to the britannia to host a

the policymaking body of the assemblies 
of god will resolve an unprecedented rift between national and 
state church leaders over the punishment of fallen tv evangelist 
jimmy swaggart a spokeswoman says 
this will be a final decision with no right of appeals said 
juleen turnage assemblies secretary of information our 
executives feel that this is a situation that needs to be 
expedited quickly 
g raymond carlson the general superintendent of the 
pentecostal denomination based here said in a statement thursday 
that the general presybtery would meet march 28 to make a decision 
meanwhile in new orleans three state appeals court judges 
heard arguments on whether they should revive a 90 million lawsuit 
filed against swaggart by a preacher he accused of adultery 
a lawyer for preacher marvin gorman said evidence gathered by 
private detectives who investigated swaggart will be made public in 
court if the lawsuit is reinstated if the judges refuse to revive 
the suit attorney thomas frasier said the evidence will be made 
public in some other manner 
the judges gave no indication when they would rule 
swaggart a baton rouge la evangelist with a 150 million 
empire and a worldwide television following confessed to 
undisclosed sins after reports linked him to prostitutes 
swaggart has admitted sinning against his wife but has not gone 
into detail what others are saying he has done depending on the 
specifics might best be described as voyeurism sexual perversion 
or pornographic acts 
an investigation to determine if swaggart can keep his 
ministerial credentials has grown into a circle of meetings with 
the louisiana district council and the executive presbytery 
debating his punishment 
the louisiana officials recommended swaggart be suspended from 
the pulpit for three months but national leaders have said such a 
short suspension for a minister who has confessed to moral 
misconduct would be unprecedented 
national officials asked the state leaders to reconsider their 
recommendation but in another unprecedented move the state 
refused 
mrs turnage said the executives had hoped to have the march 28 
meeting earlier but previous commitments by some of the 250 
general presybters prevented it the general presbytery meets 
annually usually in august 
the general presbytery consists of the 13 executive presbyters 
representatives of the assemblies districts foreign missions and 
colleges and honorary members it is described as the policymaking 
body for the church and serves as the court of appeals on 
ministerial credentials 
only once within the last 25 years has it convened in special 
session to deal with a church matter the matter then was the 
founding of evangel college in springfield mrs turnage said 
the majority vote prevails she said the only item on the 
agenda is jimmy swaggart they will have open discussion and a vote 
will be taken 
she said the presbyters can request that swaggart attend the 
meeting but at this time that point has not been discussed 
mrs turnage said figures will not be available for another 
three weeks to determine whether the swaggart situation has had any 
effect on contributions to the nations largest pentecostal 
denomination 
last year following the ptl scandal contributions rose 6 
percent and the assemblies gained more church members and 
churches she said

new york citys new schools chancellor says he 
will begin shaping up one of the nations most troubled school 
systems by abolishing time clocks and paring down the bloated 
central bureaucracy 
richard r greens inaugural message delivered amid 
unprecedented pomp and splendor thursday in the ornate chapel of 
erasmus hall high school was that new york citys schools are on 
trial business as usual must come to an end and it must do so 
today 
green left behind a 30year career in minneapolis schools to 
lead the 939000pupil system the largest in the nation with a 
48 billion annual budget 
green was ushered into the oakpaneled chapel by six children 
wearing sashes reading the class of 2000 greeting him on the 
speakers podium were gov mario m cuomo mayor edward i koch 
board of education president robert f wagner jr and other 
dignitaries all wearing academic robes 
frequently departing from a prepared text of a 20minute 
inaugural address green took a generally conciliatory tone toward 
the many problems and constituencies he faces but he vowed that 
the infamous central bureaucracy would likely face cuts especially 
with mayor koch pressuring the board to find 28 million in budget 
savings 
i have heard that 110 livingston street has been immobilized 
by the twin abuses called apathy and cynicism he said this is 
a new day 
by july 1 i will have a management team in place that i can 
rely on and there will be some transfers out of 110 livingston 
he said referring to the brooklyn headquarters of the city board 
of education 
he also vowed to remove the time clocks that teachers are 
required to punch and he said that we are going to find a way to 
open schools to parents who want to use facilities and i am certain 
we can reach a new accommodation with our custodians 
green did not mention his controversial suggestion of an 
11month school year which he made offthecuff on wednesday while 
touring several schools 
united federation of teachers president sandra feldman called 
the 20minute speech an exciting beginning he was both tough and 
caring i was especially gratified that he singled out the work 
done by the citys teachers and the fact that they dont get enough 
recognition as professionals 
the citys first black chancellor has his work cut out for him 
the system which has 32 autonomous districts has a dropout rate 
pegged by the school board at 307 percent an independent panel 
put the figure at 504 percent 
many of the citys 1050 school buildings are deteriorating and 
an estimated 25 percent have serious problems 
greens staff of 61000 teachers exceeds the number of students 
in the minneapolis system yet officials expect the city will need 
40000 new teachers by 1994

the newest house rejection of aid for the 
nicaraguan contras has put the rebels on the defensive as they near 
facetoface peace talks with the sandinista government a contra 
spokeswoman says 
the house rejected a 30 million humanitarian aid package 
thursday night only hours after contra leaders agreed to meet the 
sandinistas inside nicaragua without a mediator 
every time the united states turns its back on the contras it 
puts us in a less favorable position said contra spokeswoman 
marta sacasa the sandinistas will become even more intransigent 
and more hard line 
the failed bill had limited the use of the funds to food 
clothing and medical supplies and a plan to help young war victims 
the 216210 vote against the package meant the rebels whose last 
us aid ran out tuesday would be left without new supplies unless 
congress passes another measure 
we of course wanted a positive vote but the death or survival 
of the nicaraguan resistance is not tied to the us congress 
ms sacasa said we have adapted and we will continue to adapt 
she said this setback coupled with a feb 3 house rejection of 
a 362 million aid package proposed by president reagan makes it 
clear the contras cannot count on the united states 
we are fighting against an enemy that doesnt have these kinds 
of problems the aid from the soviet union has not stopped flowing 
to the sandinistas she said 
while a date for the peace conference has not been set the 
contras on thursday accepted in principle an offer of facetoface 
talks made by nicaraguan president daniel ortega 
but the contras insisted in a communique that cardinal miguel 
obando y bravo of managua who was dismissed by ortega as a 
mediator after two previous negotiating sessions be present as a 
witness and guarantor 
ortega has proposed that the talks take place in southern 
nicaragua with his brother defense minister humberto ortega 
heading the government delegation 
the contras appointed adolfo calero considered to be one of the 
more hardline directors to head their delegation 
we are accepting a facetoface meeting in nicaraguan 
territory director alfredo cesar said after a daylong meeting of 
the directorate 
ortega had suggested that the meeting be held in the town of 
sapoa near nicaraguas costa rican border on march 1012 but cesar 
said the time and place should be worked out later 
the communique signed by the five directors of the nicaraguan 
resistance as the contra rebels are formally called lambasted 
ortega for dismissing obando y bravo as a mediator 
it called the action unilateral and dictatorial and praised 
the cardinal for his help in pushing the peace talks

governors that their main task will be to restore order

down margarita tenorio 62 a ward leader and president of the 
anticommunist vigilante crusaders for peace and democracy

a university of pennsylvania fraternity that 
sponsored a strip show in which white students jeered black dancers 
has been ordered to close for 1 years and a black student 
activist received a death threat he believes stemmed from a protest 
of the incident 
blacks and feminists at penn have complained bitterly during the 
past few weeks about the rush party at the allwhite fraternity 
during the party last september two black women stripped 
performed sexually explicit acts and danced naked before an 
audience that shouted racial epithets according to the university 
the school on thursday ordered the 112member zeta beta tau to 
close for at least 1 years because of the incident the fraternity 
said 
zbt president zane brown in a statement apologized for the 
incident but said the decision by the penn judicial board was 
unjust 
the death threat was made earlier this week against conrad 
tillard director of the organization of black consciousness in a 
letter sent to a reporter at penns student newspaper the daily 
pennsylvanian 
the writer claimed to be a student member of the jewish defense 
league but school officials did not believe the claim and the jdl 
denied any connection with the threat the fraternity that was 
ordered closed is primarily jewish 
the main thing it said was that i was a target on their hit 
list tillard said it also said that in general theyre trying 
to stop the rise of this black power group that im helping bring 
about 
tillard will receive aroundtheclock protection by campus 
police that will continue as long as is necessary said 
security spokeswoman sylvia canada philadelphia police said they 
were investigating the letter the fbi also acknowledged receiving 
a copy but declined to comment 
tillard said he believed the letter stemmed from a rally monday 
sponsored by his group which called on the school to oust zbt 
however the letter did not mention the fraternity incident 
tillard said 
black officials said the fraternity incident and the death 
threat reflect growing racial tension not only at the ivy league 
campus but at colleges around the country 
what is happening now in terms of the real tensions on 
campus is just the tip of the iceberg said jacqueline wade 
director of penns afroamerican students department i think 
were going to see across the nation something thats very 
reminiscent of the 60s 
racism never left the university environment she said 
meanwhile at dartmouth college in hanover nh about 300 
people rallied thursday to protest bigotry the day before police 
guarded the offices of a conservative weekly campus newspaper that 
revived stinging attacks on a black professor and reawakened 
charges of racism at the school 
rabbi howard alperg director of penns jewish campus activities 
board said black radicals are trying to turn the fraternity 
controversy into a blackjewish issue 
but daniel gamulka chairman of the jewish student council said 
the fraternity incident enraged both white and black students 
the jewish community does not support what happened at zbt 
said gamulka they find it offensive just as anyone would 
relationships between black and jewish penn students have been 
strained since a verbal confrontation between the groups in 1986 
when the black student unity conference planned to feature a 
keynote address by louis farrakhan nation of islam leader 
farrakhans critics say he is antisemitic

increases in federal seizures of 
imported cocaine and marijuana raise the demand for greater amounts 
of drug imports and likely fatten the coffers of latin american 
drug producers a study concludes 
the study released thursday by the rand corp found that more 
and more narcotics shipments are being stopped at the borders but 
an even greater number are getting through to meet demands of 
american drug users who are relatively insensitive to higher 
prices that may result 
while interdiction raises smugglers risks they adapt in the 
short run and learn in the long run very large increases in 
expenditure might lead to more seizures and arrests but not to 
large decreases in consumption said the study by the research 
institute 
between 1981 and 1986 the government tripled its spending in 
the war against imported drugs from 237 milion to 801 million 
the study said the military portion of that rose from 1 million 
to 196 million 
despite the increase the amount of cocaine reaching us users 
rose from between 38 and 68 metric tons in 1981 to between 111 and 
153 tons in 1985 the latest year for which figures were available 
the amount of marijuana entering the united states during the 
same period rose from between 8700 and 12700 metric tons to 
between 9447 and 12228 metric tons 
seizures of cocaine rose from less than 2 metric tons to more 
than 25 metric tons while seizures of marijuana were halved from 
4000 metric tons to 2000 metric tons 
the figures were based on official estimates of the us drug 
enforcement adminstration the study said 
in addition latin american drug manufacturers may be getting 
even richer because they make money whether the drugs are 
successfully smuggled or not said the study 
meanwhile it added a steppedup seizure of cocaine from 
colombia has caused a shift to mexican and domestic sources 
the study which looked only at cocaine and marijuana comes as 
congress considers a proposal that would make the defense 
department a primary agency in the interception of drugs at 
substantially increased costs to taxpayers 
the defense department now serves a secondary role mostly by 
providing radar surveillance and limited air and sea pursuit to 
the three agencies that have primary responsibility in stopping the 
drug flow the coast guard the customs service and the immigration 
and naturalization service 
meanwhile on thursday the us coast guard said it has ended 
its routine drugsmuggling patrols by land and sea off the west 
coast because of budget constraints 
the decision to stop routine sea patrols and surveillance 
flights will result in more smugglers successfully delivering their 
cargo rear adm a bruce beran said 
beran commander of the coast guard district that includes 
california oregon nevada and arizona said he ended the patrols 
six weeks ago in an effort to trim some 1 million from his 
districts budget 
he cited as an additional budgetary pressure some 100 million 
in cuts to coast guard funding contained in a proposal for the 1989 
federal budget

said 
the tugboat was leased to the mexican company by seattle 
washbased stabbert amp associates he said

a chicago obstetrician has been indicted on 
federal charges that he lied on the witness stand about his role in 
tests concerning the safety of the dalkon shield birth control 
device 
dr louis g keith 53 an obstetriciangynecologist at 
northwestern university medical school at chicago testified 
falsely about transfer of bacteria by the tail string of the 
intrauterine shield the justice department said thursday in 
announcing the indictment 
keith faces eight counts of perjury and one count of obstruction 
of justice if convicted on all counts he faces 45 years in prison 
and 85000 in fines an fbi spokesman said keith was expected to 
surrender in chicago today and be arraigned march 17 in tampa 
dr keith is innocent and will be vindicated said his 
lawyer matthew kennelly that is all i will say 
on march 15 1983 keith told jurors in a tampa lawsuit against 
ah robins co the manufactuer of the iud he had performed 
experiments that verified the safety of the birth control device 
in fact he did not design direct conduct or do the scientific 
experiments about which he testified the indictment announced 
in washington said 
the alleged perjury came during the suit brought by linda harre 
of tampa who alleged that the shield caused her to become sterile 
she lost the 125 million suit 
mrs harre won a new trial in march 1985 when the 11th us 
circuit court of appeals in atlanta issued a scathing opinion 
attacking the veracity of keiths testimony 
five months later ah robins filed for protection from its 
creditors in federal bankruptcy court in richmond va a measure 
which barred future action on pending lawsuits including mrs 
harres 
john d taylor a spokesman for ah robins in richmond va 
said thursday evening that keith had testified for the company in 
several lawsuits and the firm has no reason to believe he ever 
lied 
the company halted production and sale of the dalkon shield in 
the united states and abroad in 1974 although distribution 
continued in some foreign countries until early 1985 said taylor 
some 200000 claims have been filed against ah robins by women 
who contend they suffered pelvic infections sterility or 
spontaneous abortions because of the dalkon shield ah robins 
sold 28 million of the devices between 1971 and 1974 and has paid 
more than 300 million in legal damages involving its shield 
robins spokesman roscoe puckett said the firm is awaiting court 
approval of a reorganization plan that would set aside 2375 
billion to settle claims relating to the dalkon shield

president hussain muhammad ershads 
jatiya party increased its majority in parliament today after 
national elections marked by violence fraud and an opposition 
boycott 
at least 11 people were reported killed and more than 300 were 
injured during voting thursday for 299 contested seats in the 
330seat parliament turnout appeared very low and even jatiya 
party members acknowledged ballot boxes were stuffed 
with results in for 194 races jatiya candidates had won 176 
seats in 18 of those contests they ran unopposed one race was 
postponed because one of the candidates for the open seat was 
killed 
a coalition of 73 minor opposition parties won nine seats 
according to election commission figures two other small parties 
had one seat each and independents gained seven 
another 30 seats in parliament are reserved for women who are 
chosen later 
opposition leaders alleged that the outcome was due to rigged 
voting which is common in bangladesh politics 
the opposition which launched a campaign nov 10 to demand 
ershads ouster succeeded in shutting down most of dhaka on 
election day with a general strike but the government said the 
election the fourth in bangladeshs 17 years of independence from 
pakistan was successful and peaceful 
foreign reporters who visited polling stations in and around 
dhaka noted a low turnout and much vote tampering 
ershad a former army general who seized power in a 1982 
bloodless coup called the elections in a failed attempt to appease 
the opposition 
at separate news conferences today chief opposition leaders 
sheik hasina and khaleda zia vowed to continue the campaign to oust 
ershad who was elected president in 1986 in balloting they say was 
rigged 
in those elections the jatiya party won 152 seats in 
parliament the main opposition awami league won 102 and small 
parties held the rest 
the two opposition leaders said rallies in dhaka were planned 
for saturday to protest the balloting 
ershad scheduled thursdays elections after he dissolved 
parliament last december 3 years ahead of schedule the move was 
aimed at working out a compromise with his foes but they demanded 
instead that ershad step down and said elections held under him 
wouldnt be fair 
election officials and some jatiya party said ballot boxes were 
stuffed to favor the governing party and inflate the turnout 
the independent bangladesh observer newspaper reported on 
polling in nine cities and did not list any with heavy voting the 
descriptions it used for turnout in various cities were very 
negligible very meager 1 percent to 2 percent of the 478 
million eligible voters 
home minister abdul matin claimed there was a good turnout 
he told reporters that on the basis of 12 voting centers he 
visited in dhaka he estimated voter turnout at 50 percent

a teenager accused of fatally bludgeoning 
a classmate with a baseball bat for a thrill smiled while denying 
any knowledge of the boys fate two days after the slaying a 
detective testified 
he was very calm almost bored sort of like dont bother 
me he grinned when i asked if he knew where shaun was 
detective john devine said during the second day of rod matthews 
trial in norfolk superior court 
devine said thursday he questioned matthews twice about 
14yearold shaun ouillettes whereabouts 
prosecutors say matthews a 15yearold being tried as an adult 
in the 1986 slaying showed the body in the snowy woods to friends 
who stayed mum for weeks 
defense attorney john philip white has not denied that matthews 
killed his classmate but white said matthews was a mentally ill 
child from a troubled home and whose use of the prescribed drug 
ritalin used to counter hyperactivity in children contributed to 
his actions 
devine testified he went to matthews home after a bus driver 
said he had seen matthews and ouillette together the previous 
afternoon 
when asked where ouillette was matthews then 14 said he had 
not seen him the previous day and suggested he might be in a 
neighboring town the detective said 
during later questioning matthews said he played pool at home 
with ouillette on nov 20 two days before matthews initial 
questioning but still denied knowing anything about his 
whereabouts devine testified 
forensic pathologist george katsas who performed an autopsy 
testified the victim had three head injuries the largest six 
inches long which fractured the skull 
chemist robert pino of the state police crime lab said blood and 
hair on the bat matched ouillettes 
other former friends told a shocked courtroom wednesday of 
viewing ouillettes body only hours after a prethanksgiving pep 
rally then bicycling with matthews to a shopping mall pizza parlor 
for a snack 
he said it could happen to us he said you never know 
testified robbie peterson 
the former friends said matthews named several potential victims 
before settling on ouillette an overweight high school freshman 
who had moved to the community south of boston a year earlier

the washington metropolitan area transit 
authority has rejected a 492 million low bid from a construction 
consortium that included a japanese firm citing a congressional 
ban on awarding federally funded contracts to japanese companies 
the provision signed by president reagan in december bars the 
awarding of contracts to firms of any country that discriminates 
against foreign bidders in its own public works projects 
it was aimed at japan which has prohibited foreign 
participation in more than 60 billion worth of public works 
projects it plans during the next 10 years 
the metro board made its decision thursday as us and japanese 
negotiators were meeting at the state department in an attempt to 
resolve the construction dispute a major source of contention 
between the two countries 
sen frank murkowski ralaska who coauthored the provision 
with rep jack brooks dtexas hailed metros decision 
the japanese private sector needed to know that america is 
ready to use the leverage at our disposal to open their market if 
they didnt think we meant business before they know it now 
murkowskiaid 
no one is going to take a chance of using a japanese firm in 
any capacity for any project said metro deputy general counsel 
robert polk the law will have the desired congressional 
effect he said 
the low bid came from a joint venture between kiewit 
construction of omaha neb and the kajima construction company of 
japan to work on tunnels and rails for a new subway line which is 
to run beneath an existing station in northeast washington kajima 
was a 30 percent partner in the plan and kiewit 70 percent 
john f mcelhenny metros assistant general manager for design 
said bidding on the project will be reopened he said rejection of 
the contract is not likely to delay construction which is 
scheduled for completion in 1993

on thursday the department said the nations productivity rose 
just 09 percent last year only slightly more than earlier 
estimates and the lowest since the last recession the government 
says 
meanwhile the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks slipped 
780 points to 206349 the dollar was mixed in foreign exchange 
and bond prices barely budged in lethargic trading 
productivity among nonfarm businesses that are responsible for 
threefourths of the nations economic activity rose at an annual 
rate of 03 percent in the fourth quarter the labor department 
said that contrasted with a 02 percent deterioration reported in 
preliminary figures last month 
productivity is a measure of the amount of labor required to 
produce goods and services 
the revisions raised the productivity improvement for the entire 
year from 08 percent to 09 percent slightly more than half the 
16 percent gain of 1986 
the efficiency improvements for the year were the smallest since 
1982 when an economic recession depressed output so much that 
productivity actually declined 06 percent from 1981 
anything less than 1 percent is a disappointing number said 
roger brinner an economist for data resources inc of lexington 
mass it gives you very little room to buffer pay increases and 
not much leeway to improve the standard of living 
the revised figures on productivity showed output of goods and 
services by nonfarm businesses rising by an annual rate of 56 
percent in the fourth quarter 
that was the greatest increase in nearly two years and compared 
with a rise of 51 percent in the preliminary figures before the 
gross national product was revised upward last week by the commerce 
department 
but in achieving that higher output businesses increased the 
total hours worked by their employees by 53 percent 
frankly we dont foresee much improvement in productivity 
this year said donald straszheim chief economist for merrill 
lynch productivity improvements require rapid growth and we 
havent been experiencing much of that lately

a twinengine commuter plane flying from nancy to 
paris crashed near the capital this morning while waiting to land 
killing all 22 people aboard aviation authorities said 
the fairchild 227 turboprop owned by the small aviation company 
tat apparently hit hightension wires and crashed in a field in 
pamfou a town near melun 25 miles southwest of paris police said 
the force of the crash gouged a huge hole in the plowed land 
police said officials said there was snow in the region and 
temperatures were below freezing 
the aircraft was carrying 19 passengers including a baby and 
three crew members tat commercial director patrice decourt told 
the associated press earlier reports said 21 people were aboard 
debris from the plane was spread out over hundreds of square 
yards and workers were combing the field and surrounding forests 
the director of the nancyessey airport jeanclaude philippe 
said the plane had been circling the melun area in the 
seineetmarne region 25 miles southeast of paris waiting for 
orders to land at orly airport 
planes are landed sooner or later so they are stacked up 
waiting for a free runway philippe said they dont wait long 
of course several minutes 
decourt said the plane was in the holding pattern for six to 
seven minutes after the 50minute flight from nancy then plunged 
very rapidly to the ground 
the cause of the accident was not immediately known police and 
rescue workers were searching the area for the aircrafts black box 
the plane was perhaps in a situation of intense icing but 
tats experience with this type of plane leads us to believe that 
circumstances which we are not yet aware of led to the accident 
said a statement issued by tat 
the usmade fairchild 227 is built under license from the 
dutch company fokker 
the last ground contact with the plane was at 732 am 
according to the control tower at orly the aircraft disappeared

alarm clock ms gillou said in a telephone interview with the 
associated press 
she said the same plane made a trip without problems thursday 
night but that the pilot had mentioned icy conditions 
todays crash was the worst plane accident in france since 1981 
when a yugoslav dc9 went down near ajaccio corsica in the 
mediterranean killing 180 people

peace talks on afghanistan recessed today so 
pakistan could decide if it is willing to sign a settlement with 
the sovietbacked afghan government the mediator said all 
substantial differences had been worked out 
the head of the pakistani delegation acting foreign minister 
zain noorani flew back to islamabad for weekend consultations with 
the countrys political leaders including opposition 
representatives 
the meeting will mark the first time the pakistan government has 
sought direct contact with its opposition since president gen 
mohammad zia ulhaq seized power and imposed martial in july 1977 
coup 
pakistan has represented afghanistans antimarxist moslem 
guerrillas in the peace talks 
the two sides agreed thursday to a ninemonth timetable for the 
pullout of soviet troops from afghanistan with half the estimated 
115000 troops to be withdrawn in the first 90 days 
un mediator diego cordovez said no major differences remained 
but the negotiators did not resolve the issue of what government 
would be in power in afghanistan to oversee implementation of a 
settlement 
over the weekend pakistan will try to decide whether it is 
willing to sign a settlement with president najibs government 
which it does not recognize 
noorani said there was no change in pakistans position that the 
settlement should be accompanied by formation of a transitional 
government in kabul to prevent more bloodshed 
not all opposition parties have declared their stand on 
afghanistan but most have urged the government to sign a soviet 
pullout accord then worry about a political settlement later 
the geneva talks are set to resume monday 
cordovez told reporters that that the withdrawal issue had long 
stalled the almost 6yearold negotiations he said its resolution 
meant a significant step toward concluding a settlement 
i am not going to consider that these documents are absolutely 
ready until they are signed and sealed he said but also stated 
repeatedly that the remaining differences are not of substance 
there is no doubt about the political significance of the 
agreements reached this week and also of some understandings that 
have started to evolve regarding other oustanding problems he 
said 
he did not elaborate but made plain that he is increasingly 
confident that there will be an eventual accord on the future shape 
of the kabul government 
cordovez said that both kabul and islamabad recognized that a 
broadbased afghan government would make a settlement more 
effective although their concepts differ 
he also said he believed that the afghan resistance movement 
which is flatly opposed to any powersharing with the present 
leadership will change its attitude once a settlement is complete 
the chief afghan delegate abdul wakil reiterated thursday that 
kabul was ready to talk with all political forces including the 
resistance movements about the formation of new government 
a threemember team from the office of the un commissioner for 
refugees returned to geneva today from a factfinding visit in 
afghanistan 
a spokeswoman judith kumin said the team followed an 
invitation of the kabul government she said it was evident that 
the office would have a role in repatriating the more than 5 
million afghan refugees once a settlement was reached 
an estimated 3 million refugees are in pakistan and another 2 
million are in iran

the government today decreed a ban on 
smoking in public places and launched a campaign to try to convince 
this nation of smokers to give up the habit 
the government of socialist prime minister felipe gonzalez also 
outlawed the selling of tobacco to anyone under 16 
the ban will take effect in july three months after its 
publication in the official state bulletin it was in keeping with 
directives issued by the european economic community 
representatives of spains tobacco industry agreed to accept a 
complete ban on television advertising and restrictions limiting 
outdoor advertising to the name of their brand 
according to eec statistics 41 percent of spains 388 million 
people smoke the second highest figure in the 12nation community 
after greece 
the same statistics indicate about 60000 spaniards die each 
year from smokingrelated diseases 
the decree requires cigarette and cigar packages to carry the 
warning that smoking causes cancer and endangers the life of the 
smoker as well as unborn babies 
it bans smoking in hospitals department stores elevators and 
places where pregnant women work and prohibits the sale of tobacco 
products to minors under 16 
the decree says that the rights of nonsmokers over those of 
smokers will take priority in all legal questions it carries fines 
on infractions ranging from 4400 to 880000 but its enforcement 
mechanism remains unclear 
spanish explorers who traveled to central and south america in 
the 16th century returned with stringtied rolls of tobacco leaves 
that became the rage among their wealthy countrymen under the name 
cigar 
etymologists believe the word comes from sikar the term 
the mayan indians of central america used for smoking 
cigarillos or little cigars were devised by street 
beggars in seville from the butts of castoff cigars and are the 
forerunners of todays cigarettes

the government will hold an 
unprecedented meeting with its political opposition to discuss 
whether pakistan should sign a peace accord with afghanistan 
officials said today 
saturdays meeting will mark the first time the pakistan 
government has sought direct contact with the opposition since 
before july 1977 when president gen mohammad zia ulhaq seized 
power and imposed martial law 
officials said nearly all 19 parties have accepted an invitation 
to meet with prime minister mohammad khan junejo 
the chief of the pakistani delegation to the un afghanistan 
talks in geneva foreign state minister zain noorani was to return 
to islamabad today after the third day of indirect negotiations 
with the communist afghan government 
pakistani officials said junejo wanted to discuss whether 
pakistan should link an accord over a soviet troop withdrawal from 
afghanistan with the formation of an interim coalition government 
in kabul 
about 115000 soviet troops are in afghanistan the soviets have 
been fighting afghan rebels since 1979 when they entered the 
country and replaced the existing communist government with another 
one 
almost all opposition leaders pledged to attend the 
extraordinary meeting except pakistan peoples party leader benazir 
bhutto who was reported ill with influenza her karachi office 
said she would at least fly to islamabad to consult with her 
representatives 
ms bhuttos father ousted prime minister zulfikar ali bhutto 
was hanged in 1979 after he was convicted of plotting a political 
murder 
zia lifted martial law on dec 30 1985 after the installation 
of junejos muslim league government the previous march 
most opposition parties boycotted the election that brought 
junejo to power and still refuse to recognize his government 
pakistans largest opposition alliance the nineparty movement 
for the restoration of democracy decided to accept the 
governments gesture because it was not founded in protest over 
foreign policy said sheikh rafiq ahmed an official in mrs 
bhuttos party 
not all opposition parties have declared their stand on 
afghanistan but most have urged the government to sign a soviet 
pullout accord then worry about a political settlement later 
in a recent turnabout pakistan has threatened not to sign a 
geneva accord that does not provide a safe environment for the 
return of the 5 million afghan refugees living in pakistan and iran 
islamabad has said it fears that the soviets absence will clear 
the way for a new bloody internecine struggle between the 
promoscow government of president najib and afghan moslem 
guerrillas based in pakistan 
saturdays meeting could give the pakistanis a facesaving 
pretext to soften their controversial stance at geneva it also 
could serve to enhance the muslim league governments own 
legitimacy at home

the baltimore city school board has banned 
telephone beepers because school officials said they were being 
used by students acting as gobetweens in drug deals 
effective march 14 students found carrying a beeper face 
suspension under the new policy adopted by the board thursday 
school officials say the telephone pagers are a status symbol in 
the drug world and are also used by students who want to portray 
the image of being involved in narcotics 
when i see a beeper i assume the worst said arthur pierce 
principal of francis m wood high school at the high school and 
middle school level if a child is in possession of an operational 
beeper they are usually dealing drugs 
at the elementary level kids are wearing inoperative beepers 
to appear tough or macho and mimic the older kids and thats not 
something to encourage said pierce who has been confiscating 
the pagers at his school for the past three years 
beepers also were banned from schools in nashville tenn in 
december similar problems have been reported from florida to 
michigan 
virtually all drug possession arrests in baltimore schools 
involve marijuana said larry burgan school police chief with a 
few instances of cocaine or cocaine derivatives 
from my standpoint i dont see any time a student would need 
to carry a beeper said burgan its basically a disruptive 
influence whether the kids are carrying them to traffic drugs or 
just to project that image its no good 
pierce said it is hard to determine the scope of the problem 
because most beepers go undetected 
new beepers no longer emit the three short beeps from which 
their name was derived 
the more sophisticated ones vibrate against the body or are 
fitted with a silencer that keeps them from being detected 
pierce said 
burgan said the drug problem is kept under control largely 
because city high schools have officers patrolling the halls

the 800yearold round tower at windsor 
castle one of queen elizabeth iis homes has been damaged by 
shifting foundations the department of the environment said today 
the castle overlooking the river thames is reportedly the 
queens favorite home and is one of britains top tourist 
attractions the monarchs royal standard is flown from the tower 
when she is in residence 
there has been a slight movement to the round tower at windsor 
castle we are looking into it the government department said in 
a brief statement 
the statement added that the cause was not known and gave no 
details about the extent of the damage 
the daily telegraph which first broke the story described the 
damage to the fivestory tower as serious following a shift in its 
ancient foundations 
the london newspaper said the tower moved two weeks ago 
bringing down plaster causing cracks to appear in the stonework 
and jamming a door and two windows 
it said the queen had inspected the tower buckingham palace 
said in a statement the queen is obviously concerned and is 
being kept informed 
the queen and her husband prince philip live for much of the 
year at buckingham palace in london but they and their family spend 
each christmas at windsor castle windsor is 21 miles west of 
london 
the round tower is the most imposing feature of the castle the 
foundations of the tower and the rest of its lower part were built 
by king henry ii in 1172 the upper part was added 6 centuries 
later in the reign of king george iv 
the round tower is built on a mound thrown up by the saxons the 
teutonic invaders who conquered britain between the 5th and 7th 
centuries they ruled until their army under king harold was beaten 
at the battle of hastings in 1066 by duke william of normandy who 
then became king william i of england 
the original castle was built by king william around 1070

the senate kept in the dark by the reagan 
administration during the irancontra affair today rejected an 
effort to let the white house withhold details about covert actions 
from congress 
the 6523 vote came as the chamber worked on a bill requiring 
that congress be notified of all covert actions within 48 hours 
the decision came on an amendment by sen james mcclure 
ridaho that would have allowed a president simply to tell 
congress that a covert action was underway but withhold details and 
specifics until later 
this is a compromise it gives the president some 
flexibility said mcclure 
but sen william cohen rmaine chief author of the bill 
opposed mcclure telling his colleagues this is not a 
compromise its a capitulation this lets the president play 
ive got a secret but not tell 
this cannot guarantee that future abuses such as irancontra 
will not occur but it will certainly minimize them cohen 
vicechairman of the intelligence committee said late thursday as 
debate began 
the bill overhauls procedures for notifying congress about 
intelligence activites the central feature would require that 
congress be notified within 48 hours of the time a covert or 
secret action begins 
cohen suggested that the requirement could have helped expose 
the irancontra affair in which us weapons were sold to iran and 
some of the profits were diverted to the nicaraguan contra rebels 
reagans approval of the iranian arms deal was withheld from 
congress for 10 months in 1986 until it was revealed by a beirut 
publication 
cia director william webster testifying last month to the house 
intelligence committee said the 48hour notification requirement 
will not be acceptable to the president but webster did not 
say whether reagan would veto the bill 
cohen noted that presidents normally have notified congress of 
most covert actions ever since congressional review committees were 
created 14 years ago in the wake of revelations about a series of 
abuses by the cia 
he said it is time to close the last loophole by requiring 
notification of all such actions 
the irancontra affair shows what happens when a president 
seeks to circumvent congress cohen said 
sen david boren dokla chairman of the intelligence 
committee called the measure landmark legislation 
reagan has promised to notify congress about future covert 
actions but boren said we feel a need to put these changes into 
statute to make sure a president does not go back on his word 
we do not want our country ever again to go through what it 
did these last few months because of the irancontra affair 
boren said 
theres an old saying that two heads are better than one 
said boren in the intelligence committee we try to give those 
in the intelligence community our best judgment 
sen james mcclure ridaho opposed the bill because he said 
the notification provision could endanger american lives and the 
lives of others who have taken the risk of assisting the united 
states 
sen malcolm wallop rwyo agreed with mcclure this bill 
will cost lives he said 
the bill was approved by the senate intelligence committee last 
december on a 132 vote if passed by the full senate it will need 
house approval before it would go to reagans desk

a group of nationalist legislators today 
asked the taiwan government to drop its 40yearold policy of 
having no contact with the communist government in beijing 
huang shuwek one of the 12 lawmakers questioning the 
nocontact policy during a legislative yuan session proposed a 
temporary twochina policy to precede eventual reunification 
huang said the taipei and beijing governments must compete on 
an equal footing so we can show all chinese people the achievements 
of taiwans development and let them accept our system 
huang proposed that the nationalist government provide financial 
and technological aid for chinas modernization and discuss 
bilateral trade and other relations with beijing 
the two countries already have a secret trade estimated at more 
than 1 billion a year through third parties such as hong kong and 
singapore taiwan recently began allowing its citizens to visit 
their families on the mainland 
the nationalists have refused official contacts with china since 
1949 when they fled to taiwan after losing a civil war on the 
mainland to the communists both governments claim to be the 
rightful government of the mainland and taiwan 
premier yu kuohwa said in response that communist china has 
never treated us equally and the time has not yet come for peaceful 
competition between the two governments 
yao chiawen chairman of the opposition democratic progressive 
party said we dont care too much about the nationalists claim 
to represent china 
dozens of political activists held a torchlight run today 
through downtown taipei echoing the demands of president lee 
tunghi that elderly nationalist chinese legislators elected on the 
mainland four decades ago should retire 
this is the time for our elderly legislators to step down 
most of those who voted for them 40 years ago on the mainland have 
already died opposition legislator you ching told about 100 
people outside the national assembly after the run 
led by legislator chu kaocheng of the opposition democratic 
progressive party about 60 runners began at the legislative yuan 
building and finished an hour later outside the national assembly 
where opposition leaders delivered speeches from a pickup truck 
many elderly members of the legislative yuan taiwans highest 
lawmaking body and the national assembly the electoral college 
have rejected a proposal for them to retire voluntarily 
last saturday lee urged the elderly legislators to resign in 
accordance with the governments plans to reform taiwans political 
system 
we must place national interests and public welfare above our 
personal opinions lee told the national assembly 
lawmakers elected on taiwan now account for 73 members of the 
312seat legislative yuan and 106 members of the 934seat national 
assembly 
the other seats are either empty or held by aging nationalists 
opposition leaders said the elderly legislators who have been 
frozen in office to support the nationalists claim to be the 
legitimate government of mainland china should yield their seats 
so all lawmakers can be elected in taiwan 
during the run some activists distributed flyers listing 
telephone numbers of 120 aging assemblymen chu has urged taiwanese 
to call elderly lawmakers and ask them to retire

massachusetts gov michael dukakis today 
promised to pursue economic and energy policies to help texas 
come back and come back strong including expanded natural gas 
sales to northeast states 
in a speech to 300 people in this west texas city before flying 
on to denver cheyenne and seattle dukakis said the natural gas of 
the southwest could provide clean efficient nonpolluting 
nonacid rain energy at a quarter of the cost of nuclear energy 
from the controversial unlicensed seabrook nh plant that he 
opposes 
dukakis wrapping up a twoday 1200mile swing through the 
state with the biggest super tuesday prize promised he would help 
texas distressed oil industry come back and come back strong 
on thursday dukakis said the last few days to super tuesday may 
get a little dicey because of what he characterized as 
desperate tactics by democratic rival richard gephardt the 
missouri congressman has runs ads accusing dukakis of favoring tax 
increases and knowing nothing about agriculture 
dukakis has responded in kind with ads suggesting gephardt has 
voted to protect the interests of big banks and corporations from 
which he has collected political action committee money 
after a meeting with community organizers at a church hall in 
houston thursday night dukakis told reporters i think the next 
three four days may be somewhat difficult only because things may 
start getting a little dicey between now and tuesdayi think some 
people are getting desperate 
asked if he meant gephardt dukakis said the record is clear 
hes running negative ads right now 
the folks that attack are usually those that are behind he 
said 
to gephardts charge that dukakis has accepted campaign money 
from businesses that have major dealings with the state of 
massachusetts the governor replied i dont know what hes 
talking about i have over 65000 individual contributors to my 
campaign 
dukakis who refuses to accept money from pacs said he has 
never taken contributions from state lobbyists or more than 100 
from a state employee 
what is clear is that the pac system is a very bad system 
its time it ended said dukakis who blamed sen bob dole of 
kansas a republican presidential hopeful and his gop colleagues 
for filibustering a bill to curb pac contributions 
if im president of the united states the first bill i will 
send to the congress is the campaign contributions bill he 
vowed 
texas offers the biggest prize 183 delegates and dukakis was 
headed back to san antonio saturday night after stops in spokane 
and little rock ark 
he picked up endorsements thursday from washington gov booth 
gardener and sen brock adams 
dukakis also won the backing of the 95000member texas state 
teachers association which withdrew its earlier endorsement of 
illinois sen paul simon who is for the most part sitting out the 
souths primaries 
dukakis charged gephardts retaliatory trade legislation could 
provoke a global trade war and harm usmexican relations 
before largely hispanic audiences at airport rallies in the 
border towns of harlingen and laredo dukakis related how gephardt 
asked him in a recent debate if he was running for president of 
mexico 
i said dick if im president of the united states im 
going to pay attention to our relationship with mexico and im 
going to make sure that our proposals do not wreck the economy of 
mexico dukakis said to cheers 
were going to work with our neighbors in mexico as 
partners to create opportunity on both sides of the border 
in both harlingen and laredo the multilingual dukakis who grew 
up speaking greek and english spoke at length in spanish 
in houston dukakis stood with his wife kitty before a 
twostory lone star flag draped against the glass elevators in the 
atrium of the hyattregency hotel he told 600 supporters i 
dont have to tell you how important super martes is 
he ended his appeals with this poco a poco paso a paso mano 
en mano juntos vamos a ganar or as he translated little by

and opened fire on a crowd celebrating a hindu holiday killing at 
least 34 people and wounding about 45 police said today

independent homeland there in 1982 it occurred shortly before

holiday commemorates the triumph of the hindu god lord krishna over 
evil

religious minority in india and claim they are discriminated 
against by the majority hindus

the national research council said today its 
14month review of the challenger disaster has found no 
showstoppers to prevent nasa from resuming manned space flights 
in august 
we are all quite comfortable with what has been done to get 
ready for the next flight said alton d slay a retired general 
who headed a 12member committee that audited the space agencys 
efforts to recover from the accident 
but he cautioned no matter how good you are you never reach 
mecca there is always room for improvement 
the committees central finding he said is that nasa has the 
ability to assess and manage risks associated with space flights 
but uses so many review boards and safety organizations that the 
result is a fragmented picture of the safety and reliability of 
the total space transportation system 
further he said those organizations rely on subjective 
assessements of risk posed by thousands of individual space shuttle 
components rather than on engineering evaluations 
we are both favorably impressed with nasas progress thus far 
in addressing space shuttle safety issues and full of suggestions 
for further improvements slay said 
although we have criticisms we did not find anything that 
will delay the next space shuttle launch said slay a former 
head of the us air force systems command launch of the shuttle 
discovery is scheduled aug 4 
slay praised nasa for having made real strides in enhancing 
the safety of the shuttle and said we found no showstoppers 
in a brief response the space agency said it acted on early 
drafts of the committees report and most of the recommendations 
made by the council essentially are in place 
the nrc review was recommended by the presidential commission 
that investigated the jan 28 1986 accident that destroyed the 
challenger and killed its crew 73 seconds after liftoff the nrc 
acts as a scientific advisory group to the federal government and 
is administered by the national academy of sciences the national 
academy of engineering and the institute of medicine 
as the challenger accident made painfully obvious no probe 
into space is routine and the space shuttle is still a 
developmental vehicle said the nrc committee the risks of 
space flight must be accepted by those who are asked to participate 
in each flight as well as by those who are responsible to the 
nation for achieving its goals in space 
the report said that one of the key failures that led to the 
challenger disaster was that the history of problems with the 
shuttle booster orings was not known by the officials who gave the 
goahead for the illfated launch an oring that allowed hot gases 
to escape was blamed for the accident 
the committee has found numerous indications that data from 
sts space transportation system inspection test and repair and 
inflight operations do not always feed back rapidly enough or 
effectively enough into the risk management process the report 
said 
it noted that nasa now intends to review all data from each 
flight before going ahead with the next one at least during the 
shuttles initial flights but the committee worried that once the 
pace increases the same dangerous preconditions will once again 
be present 
the number of items deemed to be of criticality 1 and 1r 
items whose failure could doom the shuttle has increased from 
2369 before the challenger accident to 4686 because of 
reevaluation of the shuttle system and tighter ground rules the 
committee said 
but said the committee all criticality 1 items are not alike 
and nasa is wrong in not assigning priorities 
the most likely and most threatening failure modes merit the 
most attention said the report 
the committee found 
nasa tends to focus on singleevent worst case failures in 
making risk analyses and there does not appear to be an adequate 
integratedsystem view of the entire sts 
before the challenger accident cannibalization of parts from 
one shuttle to another was routine introducing greater chance of 
failure through human error the committee recommended that enough 
money be available to ensure that cannibalization is a rare 
requirement 
so many boards and panels are watching every aspect of the 
shuttle system that individuals might defer to the anonymity of 
the process and not take responsibility for decisions 
tests on the solid rocket booster are performed at the 
manufacturing plant in utah and there is a risk that damage may 
result from the long rail trip to the kennedy space center in 
florida the committee recommended that nondestructive tests 
tests that stop short of firing the rocket be performed at the 
launch site

urban planners eager to revitalize aging 
industrial centers are urging city dwellers to take charge of their 
own future and are looking to britains prince charles to drive 
that message home 
charles arrived today in cold and rainy to take part in an 
international architectural symposium and get a firsthand look at 
the despair and disrepair of oncemighty us steel towns 
we see him as somewhat of a catalyst for urban renewal 
efforts from within said volker hartkopf an architecture 
professor at carnegie mellon university here 
the prince of wales has emerged as an outspoken advocate of 
community architecture and innercity rehabilitation over the past 
few years 
he made worldwide headlines in december when he accused 
architects of wreaking more havoc on london than german bombers did 
in world war ii and said postwar planners were artless mediocre 
and contemptuous of public opinion 
more than anyone else in his position he has tried to find 
out for himself exactly what it urban decay is because he is 
concerned said roger tillotson lecturer at the university of 
newcastle upon tyne in england 
prince charles is honorary chairman of the fourday remaking 
cities conference which is exploring ways to bring prosperity back 
to depressed communities in the united states and britain 
this afternoon he plans to visit a new jobs center for the 
regions bluecollar unemployed and a high school computer training 
classroom 
on the conferences last day saturday he is to address about 
350 people attending the symposium sponsored by the american 
institute of architects and royal institute of british architects 
in his speech the 39yearold heir to the british throne is 
expected to comment on recommendations made by conference delegates 
for helping cities move from singleindustry to more diversified 
economies 
before like it or not companies took care of life you may 
not have liked everything they did but they were there it was 
secure said john clarke a trenton nj architect 
but when that goes away suddenly you turn around and say 
gee the leadership used to be the company now the leadership 
has to be you said clarke who led a 17member study of the 
regions depressed steel towns 
in its 120page report presented monday the team stressed the 
need for public participation in replacing the darkened factories 
dominating the monongahela river banks parks gardens marinas and 
shops 
that valley is a gold mine and i think these people would be 
fools not to take up the opportunity said team member tony 
mcgann a planner from liverpool england its a golden 
opportunity that might not come again

the senate foreign relations committee voted 
unanimously today for a resolution urging the reagan administration 
to end all contacts with gen manuel antonio noriega and to 
consider imposing economic sanctions against his military regime in 
panama 
but the committee took no action on legislation introduced on 
thursday and cosponsored by 25 senators which would impose a total 
trade embargo on panama in an effort to break noriegas hold on the 
country 
the 150 committee vote approving the nonbinding resolution 
came after administration officials seeking to avoid passage of 
trade embargo legislation proposed a set of milder alternatives 
that still would penalize the noriega regime 
national security adviser colin powell told reporters thursday 
night that several economic and financial measures were being 
prepared for consideration by president reagan but he refused to 
be more specific 
other officials insisting on anonymity said the administration 
believes a bipartisan congressional proposal for a trade air 
travel and currency embargo against panama would be unwise 
the administration believes us interests would be better 
served if noriega were ousted primarily by panamanian and not 
american pressure 
the officials said displays of american heavyhandedness could 
be used by noriega to his advantage and could produce resentment 
elsewhere in latin america where us intervention has long been a 
popular antiamerican rallying cry 
the committee resolution declares that eric arturo devalle who 
was ousted by the panamanian parliament after trying to fire 
noriega as commander of panamas armed forces remains the 
countrys legitimate head of state and should reeceive the full 
moral political and diplomatic support of the government of the 
united states 
it called on the white house to formally terminate any and all 
contacts with gen noriega 
the government of the united states should consider further 
measures to support democracy in panama including economic 
sanctions in the event gen noriega continues to defy president 
devalles lawful order the resolution declared 
it also called on the white house to study the impact on us 
energy supplies if noriega reacts to possible economic sanctions by 
shutting down the transpanama petroleum pipeline used to transport 
alaskan oil to the east coast of the united states 
for noriega panamanian independence from the united states has 
been his principal line of defense in his struggle to survive it 
was a recurring theme at a progovernment demonstration in panama 
earlier this week when a crowd of 3000 turned out to cheer noriega 
shortly before powell made his comments to reporters while 
returning with reagan from the nato summit in brussels belgium 
six republicans and democrats introduced the embargo bill 
it would prohibit all trade and air travel between the two 
countries and bar us banks from transferring any funds to panama 
and its banking system 
by stopping the transfer of funds from us banks to panama 
we go for the jugular said sen alfonse damato rny a 
principal sponsor of the embargo plan 
because of panamas heavy reliance on its economic ties with 
the united states the impact of a us trade embargo would be 
immediate dramatic and devastating to noriega and his cohorts 
damato said 
a ban on panamanian goods would paralyze a 412 million market 
representing 60 percent of panamas total exports damato said a 
ban on us exports to panama would affect a 30 percent slice of 
all panamanian imports he said 
other sponsors of the embargo bill are sens edward m kennedy 
dmass david durenberger rminn bob graham dfla john 
kerry dmass and jesse helms rnc 
the administration has been sending mixed signals about the 
degree to which it is willing to pressure noriega who is under 
federal indictment on drug smuggling charges and who forced out the 
constitutionally elected president last week 
some officials are sensitive to charges that the administration 
has not done enough to oppose noriega while others believe broader 
us interests require a cautious approach 
in any case there appears to be a consensus within the 
administration that a trade embargo is too ambitious a step the 
administration is hopeful a combination of other pressures will 
force an end to noriegas rule 
the issue of whether to withhold a 7 million us payment due 
in midmarch to panama for canalrelated fees and services has 
underscored the split in the administration 
assistant secretary of state elliott abrams has said that the 
administration will refuse to deliver the funds if such a request 
is received from ousted president eric arturo delvalle 
but on thursday state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley 
said no final decision has been made on that issue even though the 
administration has had the request in hand since earlier in the 
week 
she acknowledged however that the request probably will be 
honored 
with an assist from the administration panamanian authorities 
apparently have been denied access to official funds on deposit in 
us banks 
at a news conference thursday night at the panamanian embassy 
an attorney for delvalle said federal courts in new york and boston 
have issued temporary restraining orders to prevent withdrawal of 
the funds 
we believe that whatever funds are in those institutions are 
at this point frozen and cannot be transmitted to the noriega 
regime said daniel resnick a washington attorney

robertson could tie him up even further beginning on tuesday when 
the trial is scheduled to begin 
in appearances today

elsewhere richard gephardt was gunning for democratic rival 
dukakis over specialinterest campaign contributions and robertson

kemps 7 percent the washington post poll indicated

i dont throw hail mary passes said the former pro 
football player as he campaigned thursday in columbia sc 
dole who picked up the endorsement thursday of former un 
ambassador jeane kirkpatrick conceded he was running behind bush 
in south carolina but pointed to bright spots that day a caucus 
in wyoming and the election of 14 national gop delegates in 
kansas doles home state 
all four republicans were campaigning in south carolina today 
robertson bought half an hour of television time on stations 
around the state thursday night saying he wanted to set the 
record straight about religious issues

america today are those who try to tell us that we should tear 
down the crosses and the manger scenes at christmas time that our 
children should be denied the right to pray in school and that 
traditional moral values are out of style 
meanwhile more polls today pointed to a strong southern lead 
for bush while dukakis and jesse jackson dueled for support among 
democrats 
a cbsnew york times survey gave bush a better than 21 lead 
over dole in 14 southern and border states a survey by cable news 
network and usa today had similar findings 
in the cbstimes poll jackson led dukakis and tennessee sen 
gore in the south the cnnusa today survey suggested dukakis and 
jackson were neckinneck in the region 
dukakis in texas attacked gephardts plan for mandatory 
retaliation against countries whose trade practices are judged 
unfair 
theres always somebody who suggests that throw up the walls 
hunker down the massachusetts governor said 
gephardt for his part sought to turn the tables on dukakis 
who has been running ads excoriating the missouri congressman for 
accepting campaign contributions from the political action 
committees of banks defense contractors utilities and other big 
businesses 
ill give back every penny of money that ive gotten from 
political action funds if he will return the money to all the

his campaign is that a conflict of interest he said 
gephardt said his votes in the house have not been dictated by 
special interests

record for roll call votes last year was absent thursday night as

the university of pennsylvania announced 
friday the 1year suspension of a fraternity that hired two black 
strippers to perform at a party 
zeta beta tau will be permitted to return only if it meets 
stringent requirements for its reorganization said penn 
spokesman william epstein 
the exact terms have not been established but penn president 
sheldon hackney said the first step is an immediate public 
apology 
in a joint statement hackney and provost michael aiken said the 
charges against the fraternity were very serious and deserved the 
significant sanctions that we are applying 
behavior that dehumanizes any individual or group will not be 
tolerated at penn every one of us has a responsibility to help 
build a community that values our diversity and the worth of each 
individual 
members of zeta beta tau said that have been given until march 
20 to move out the 112member allwhite fraternity will not be 
allowed to pledge new members and will not be allowed to reapply 
for recognition by the university until september 1989 
zbt president zane brown in a statement complained the 
decision was unjust but apologized for the rush party incident 
the university charged the fraternity in february with engaging 
in lewdness indecent exposure and hazing through activities that 
were indecent or shocking to moral or religious scruples 
the charges stemmed from a rush party in september when two 
black women stripped performed sexually explicit acts and danced 
naked with a prospective freshman pledge before an audience that 
shouted racial epithets according to the university 
the fraternity had offered to pay a 2500 fine to the campus 
womens center make a public apology and attend educational 
programs on sexual harassment but black student leaders said they 
wanted zbt expelled

the alabama beverage control board is 
making a mistake by planning to open a liquor store near a halfway 
house for recovering alcoholics say officials of the halfway 
operation 
the store to open next month in downtown tuscaloosa is one 
door away from the phoenix house which houses up to 17 men who are 
trying to get off alcohol 
im an alcoholic and i went through the house eight years 
ago said ted jones now its acting director looking back on 
it during that first year if something had been that convenient 
i would have patronized it 
most of the residents have been sober for only about six weeks 
when they get here and like i said that first year of sobriety is 
a volatile one jones said 
the abc board said that by the time it learned the phoenix house 
was so close to the store site it was too late because a 10year 
lease had been signed for the store 
had the board known about this previously they never would 
have approved the location said lucricia foster the abcs 
alcohol awareness coordinator but now were entered into a legal 
contract with the builder and we cant break it 
she said an abc employee scouted the location when it was being 
considered 
in this instance he was just not aware that the halfway house 
was there i know there are some signs marking it but apparently 
they werent very noticeable miss foster said 
that sounds like some of the excuses we come up with for 
drinking said alice mclean stewart chairwoman of the phoenix 
house board its raining so im drinking that kind of thing

a young moose that had fallen through ice on 
the androscoggin river was destroyed friday after a community 
effort to save it failed 
volunteers and game wardens used blankets overnight in an effort 
to keep the animal warm but she had suffered enough and couldnt 
even lift her head so i made the decision to destroy it said 
fish and game warden martin garabedian 
when an animal gets in trouble garabedian said we usually 
let nature take its course but there were so many people who 
wanted to help that we gave it a shot adding that about 30 
volunteers in the community of 300 people brought blankets 
garabedian on thursday supervised the rescue of the 2yearold 
600pound moose 
garabedian said he looped a noose around the moose and it 
took seven or eight of us to pull her out

enhanced images of a 150 millionyearold 
fistsized dinosaur egg did not establish whether theres an embryo 
inside 
columbia scientific inc a maryland software company enhanced 
catscan images of the egg and the hightech pictures revealed a 
small piece of shell inside the egg in addition to a polliwoglike 
image of a possible embryo said brent harker a spokesman for 
brigham young university 
the polliwog image looks very lifelike much more so than on 
the unenhanced film harker said 
but it would require cracking the egg to be sure and that 
would destroy it were not going to do that he said 
the egg will soon be displayed at the universitys earth 
sciences museum 
paleontologist wade miller announced last week the egg may 
contain the oldest dinosaur embryo ever found dating from the 
jurassic period which ended about 145 million years ago the egg 
was unearthed last summer from a quarry in utah 
i think the chances are good we have an embryo inside

sen gordon humphrey claimed friday that there 
has been a sharp decline in the movement of us aid to the 
afghanistan resistance fighters battling soviet troops 
the new hampshire republican one of capitol hills strongest 
supporters of the afghan rebels told a news conference i want 
to know if this is negligence or a sellout of the afghan 
resistance 
last week a top state department official denied a similar 
charge by members of the afghan resistance 
we will not abandon the afghan resistance said robert peck 
deputy assistanct secretary of state he said us support would go 
ahead until that support is no longer needed 
humphrey spoke a day after afghanistan and pakistan which 
represents the guerrillas agreed on the main elements of a 
unmediated peace accord that includes provisions for the 
withdrawal of some 115000 soviet troops from afghanistan within 
nine months 
that agreement makes it all the more imperative that we get 
some airlifts under way humphrey said 
humphrey said one of his staff members michael pillsbury spent 
four days in peshawar last week talking to afghan resistance 
leaders and came back with the conclusions that the flow of 
weapons has decreased markedly and suddenly 
humphrey said pillsbury was shown warehouses which he and i 
had visited a year ago which were bulging then but which are all 
but empty now 
the united states provides weapons such as stinger antiaircraft 
missiles to the guerrillas but the amount of military aid is 
classified however government sources have said congress 
increased the level to 630 million this year 
rep william h gray dpa asked the congressional general 
accounting office last month to investigate reports that more than 
1 billion in covert cia aid to the afghan rebels has been diverted 
to corrupt pakistani officials or to the nicaraguan contra rebels 
congressional sources told the associated press 
however the gao said it had no authority to subpoena material 
from the cia

the madison square garden audience thursday 
night forgot the elephant mans bones plastic surgery and other 
controversies and sat mesmerized by michael jackson the performer 
his high voice with its controlled vibrato was enthralling 
especially on shes out of my life which followed a duet of 
i just cant stop loving you video screens amplified 
jacksons stricken expression as the duet ended with the female 
singer walking away 
the girlish face of jackson 29 often was shown large on the 
screens that flanked the stage but he made no attempt to maintain 
a pretty expression adopting a tearful grieving pose several 
times at the end of songs 
unlike his 1984 tour in which jackson was by far the most 
graceful dancing in a line with his brothers this time he was 
among equals surrounded most of the time by four men obviously 
well trained in dance 
jacksons kicks and spins were so fast the eye only registered 
them after they were over his pelvic thrusts like different 
jackets he donned conveyed little sexual suggestion and much 
childlike dressing up like grownups 
the stagecraft looked simple but probably was far from it there 
were no giant structures just the smooth front half of the stage 
where jackson sang and danced and a lowerlevel back of the stage 
for four backup singers seven musicians and modern musics mounds 
of equipment 
much use was made of spotlights sometimes on four sides of the 
singer each filled with his silhouette and laser beams stabbed 
the air once jackson ended a song and a circle of green lights 
surrounded his feet 
there were tricks in which he seemed magically to move from one 
place to another as in 1984 in one jackson he stood on a ladder 
and a cylinder drape dropped over him from above his next 
appearance was on the other side of the stage where a 
gangplank lifted up and swung him out over the audience 
near the beginning of the evening a man walked out on stage 
shook hands with jackson and began to dance opposite him briefly 
it seemed part of the show then a couple of large bodyguards 
walked the intruder offstage fairly unobtrusively no abrupt moves 
were made and the shows pacing wasnt dented 
spontaneity was in short supply but the wellplanned 
entertainment being offered was so fascinating that a viewer didnt 
mind 
jacksons dancing and just trotting around stage is grace 
itself a couple times he did a robot sequence but obviously is 
playing down his signatures of one jeweled glove and the moon 
walk he used both only once during billie jean 
jacksons solo tour began in september in japan in america it 
began feb 23 in kansas city mo and will run till midmay this 
first of three shows at madison square garden was a benefit for the 
united negro college fund to whose president jackson presented a 
check for 600000 on tuesday

israel blocked journalists from major trouble 
spots in the occupied territories friday in an effort to limit news 
reports of explosive palestinian protests following weekly moslem 
prayers 
the media clampdown came after complaints from politicians 
soldiers and settlers that the presence of journalists often 
inflamed arab protests in the west bank and gaza and caused more 
violence 
despite the absence of cameras and notepads palestinian revolts 
occurred friday in most of the west banks major cities 
friday also marked the first time since the start of arab unrest 
on dec 8 that israeli soldiers had blocked major roads and turned 
back journalists from cities and refugee camps that typically are 
the sites of postprayer protests 
brig gen ephraim lapid the armys spokesman in tel aviv told 
the associated press the barricades did not represent an official 
change in military policy 
there are a few localities that are closed according to 
existing policy which allows local commanders to shut an area based 
on operational needs lapid said 
the army declined to say how many cities and refugee camps were 
offlimits to journalists but in the west bank soldiers barred 
reporters from more than half a dozen major cities only bethlehem 
the traditional birthplace of jesus was open 
this is a closed military area one soldier told an ap 
photographer outside nablus 40 miles north of jerusalem if you 
dont leave now we will arrest you 
an army jeep then followed the photographers car for about 
three miles apparently to make sure it was headed toward jerusalem 
journalists were permitted to enter the gaza strip but kept 
from the area around gaza citys main mosque and the major 
commercial street 
the decision to bar journalists from the occupied territories 
drew mixed reviews from israelis 
the right to see bangbang is not protected by the first 
amendment said zeev chafets a former director of the government 
press office and a native of pontiac mich 
i would support closing off the west bank to the world press 
in a minute but keeping it open to the israeli press chafets 
said in an interview the world press is only an asterisk here 
to me whats important is my press 
but israel peleg also a former director of the government press 
office disagreed 
it is better to let the media operate freely and without any 
obstacles than to be depicted in the world as a country that 
restricts journalists peleg told the ap 
israels image may be immediately harmed by these pictures of 
protests but in the long run the fact that these pictures can be 
circulated speaks for israels democracy he said 
prime minister yitzhak shamir of the rightwing likud bloc twice 
this week publicly referred to the possibility of restricting media 
access and accused journalists of bias against israel 
some soldiers serving in the west bank also have said 
journalists make their jobs more difficult angry settlers in 
hebron attacked foreign photographers thursday accusing them of 
impeding troops efforts to arrest an arab who stabbed a 
15yearold settler 
four soldiers were arrested after a cbs news crew photographed 
them beating palestinians with rocks last week 
but foreign minister shimon peres of the leftleaning labor 
party has warned that barring media access to the occupied 
territories will simply spark rumors of atrocities that journalists 
will be unable to refute from onthescene reporting 
other israeli officials have warned that denying media access 
could lead to unfavorable comparisons between israel and south 
africa which the government has been sensitive about 
in south africa police can declare areas offlimits to 
journalists on the spot and demand that all reporters leave in 
israel local commanders also are permitted to declare an area 
closed if they deem the presence of journalists will make the 
armys job more difficult 
in addition to limiting access israel has military censors who 
in an effort to prevent what they consider to be incitement 
carefully control arabiclanguage newspapers based in jerusalem 
which circulate in the occupied territories 
but the censorship controls on foreign press coverage of the 
occupied territories have been less stringent 
robert slater chairman of the foreign press association said 
he was appalled but not surprised by israels decision to bar 
journalists from large portions of the territories friday 
from the prime ministers statements and comments by cabinet 
members it appeared increasingly likely the government would do 
something to keep us away from this story slater said in an 
interview we have fought it for three months and we will 
continue to fight it

the vast majority of americans view ties with 
europe as very important for the united states but at the same 
time they recognize that transatlantic links have waned over the 
past 10 years a poll commissioned by the european economic 
community shows 
the gallup poll of national opinion leaders and the general 
public published in the march edition of the eec magazine 
europe also shows the majority of respondents believe us 
troops must be stationed in europe to prevent a soviet attack 
of those polled 86 percent said us ties with europe matter 
a great deal compared with 65 percent who answered the same way 
in a 1973 poll commissioned by the magazine 
asked how todays ties compare with those of 10 years ago 33 
percent of the respondents said they were closer but 53 percent 
said they were not as close 
the united states should strengthen its links with europe 
according to 53 percent of those polled thirtyone percent favor 
the level of current ties and 11 percent support reduced ties with 
the continent 
although about onethird of the respondents said west european 
countries engage in unfair trading practices both the general 
public and national opinion leaders which the magazine defined as 
business and academic leaders and policy makers cited japan as an 
unfair trading partner more than twice as often as the countries of 
western europe 
for example 30 percent of the public said they view europe as 
an unfair partner while 65 percent cited japan 
respondents are more likely to know about the us trade deficit 
with japan than about the one with western europe according to the 
poll the 1987 deficit with japan was 598 billion the largest 
chunk of the 1712 billion overall deficit while the deficit 
with europe was 302 billion 
of those polled 47 percent said they mostly agree that 
europe is a good market for the united states while 31 percent 
said they completely agree 
those polled generally said they respect european achievements 
in arts but gave higher credit to us achievements in science 
encouragement of individual creativity and equal opportunity 
among the general public 54 percent said the united states 
provides an excellent education for its citizens while 21 percent 
said europe has a good educational system but among the opinion 
leaders 33 percent said the united states provides an excellent 
education and 34 percent credited europe with the same service 
the poll conducted late last year by telephone surveyed 1300 
adult americans and 387 opinion leaders the poll results had a 3 
percentage point margin of error

a highranking tibetan official confirmed friday 
that a buddhist monk jailed for advocating tibetan independence had 
died in prison the official xinhua news agency said 
xinhua said gyamco vicechairman of the tibetan autonomous 
region government told foreign reporters in tibet that lobsang 
wangchuk died last year of lung cancer while serving an 18year 
term 
tibetan exile groups in india said last year that wangchuk died 
nov 4 of injuries suffered in a beating after he refused to admit 
he was wrong to support tibetan independence he was 74 
at the time chinese authorities in beijing dismissed the report 
of wangchuks death as sheer fabrication 
xinhuas report did not say why authorities initially denied the 
report however his death came during a time of great tension in 
the remote himalayan region one month earlier three antichinese 
demonstrations were led by buddhist monks and at least 14 people 
were killed 
in the peoples republic of china citizens can freely air 
their views the report quoted gyamco as saying but advocating 
independence for any part of the nation is a crime 
wangchuk was first arrested in 1959 nine years after chinese 
troops entered tibet for taking part in an uprising against 
chinese rule tibets godking the dalai lama fled to india 
during that uprising 
according to exiled tibetan groups wangchuk was detained 
without trial until 1962 when he was sentenced to a 10year term 
he was released at the end of his term but was arrested again in 
1981 
xinhua said wangchuk renewed his splittist activities by 
distributing leaflets advocating the independence of tibet and 
was sentenced to three years in jail the term was extended to 18 
years because he refused to change his views the report said 
splittist is a term coined by the chinese to refer to 
individuals who advocate independence for regions in china 
xinhua also quoted gyamco as saying last years protests had 
no impact at all on chinas policy of allowing religious freedom 
in tibet 
on the contrary it the policy will be more effectively 
implemented it quoted him as saying 
tibetans traditionally are deeply religious and before the 
chinese red army entered in 1950 were governed by a theocracy 
headed by the dalai lama and the buddhist monasteries 
the chinese smashed the temporal power of the monasteries and 
for many years banned public worship thousands of monasteries were 
destroyed and their monks forced to marry during the 196676 
cultural revolution 
since then public worship has been restored and some 
monasteries have been rebuilt however most monks and many lay 
tibetans remain hostile to chinese rule 
an eightday great prayer festival that ended this week in 
lhasa tibets capital was boycotted by many monks because of the 
heavy chinese police presence attendance by pilgrims also was 
sharply down according to tibetan sources and westerners who 
observed the festival this year and in the past

the vast majority of americans view ties with 
europe as very important for the united states but at the same 
time they recognize that transatlantic links have waned over the 
past 10 years a poll commissioned by the european economic 
community shows 
the gallup poll of national opinion leaders and the general 
public published in the march edition of the eec magazine 
europe also shows the majority of respondents believe us 
troops must be stationed in europe to prevent a soviet attack 
of those polled 86 percent said us ties with europe matter 
a great deal compared with 65 percent who answered the same way 
in a 1973 poll commissioned by the magazine 
asked how todays ties compare with those of 10 years ago 33 
percent of the respondents said they were closer but 53 percent 
said they were not as close 
the united states should strengthen its links with europe 
according to 53 percent of those polled thirtyone percent favor 
the level of current ties and 11 percent support reduced ties with 
the continent 
although about onethird of the respondents said west european 
countries engage in unfair trading practices both the general 
public and national opinion leaders which the magazine defined as 
business and academic leaders and policy makers cited japan as an 
unfair trading partner more than twice as often as the countries of 
western europe 
for example 30 percent of the public said they view europe as 
an unfair partner while 65 percent cited japan 
respondents are more likely to know about the us trade deficit 
with japan than about the one with western europe according to the 
poll the 1987 deficit with japan was 598 billion the largest 
chunk of the 1712 billion overall deficit while the deficit 
with europe was 302 billion

europe is a good market for the united states while 31 percent 
said they completely agree 
those polled generally said they respect european achievements 
in arts but gave higher credit to us achievements in science 
encouragement of individual creativity and equal opportunity 
among the general public 54 percent said the united states 
provides an excellent education for its citizens while 21 percent 
said europe has a good educational system but among the opinion 
leaders 33 percent said the united states provides an excellent 
education and 34 percent credited europe with the same service

police were summoned to quell a revolt by angry 
commuters who vandalized and jammed the doors of a delayed subway 
train and refused to get off in protest authorities said friday 
it was the second such mutiny in the underground this week 
we got the message the first time this is only making things 
worse said david morris a spokesman for london regional 
transport which operates the massive system 
the spectacle of rebellion by londons usually reserved and 
mildmannered commuters is making headline news in the capital and 
a member of parliament says he will raise the issue in the house of 
commons 
morris said the latest incident was pretty close to an 
outofcontrol act of vandalism while one of the passengers 
involved said commuters had grown fed up with delays and shoddy 
stations 
the first whiff of trouble came tuesday night when in what 
london regional transport called unprecedented behavior passengers 
at finchley central station on the northern line refused a request 
to get off the train prematurely and forced the driver to take them 
to their destination 
the second incident occurred at the same station in both cases 
the trains had been delayed by track defects and passengers were 
told to get off and catch the next train 
the first incident ended in peaceful victory for the commuters 
without police intervention the second incident by all accounts 
was nastier 
passengers ripped off pieces of the train and used them to jam 
the doors said morris apparently there was much jubilation 
undoubtedly it was inspired by what happened on tuesday the staff 
called the transport police who ordered the passengers off the 
train and they obeyed 
londons evening standard newspaper quoted passenger faz razeen 
34 a leader of the revolt as saying people were really worked 
up and annoyed some had waited more than half an hour for their 
train he said 
morris conceded that halfhour waits were not unusual we are 
trying to do something but if people dont use their common sense 
the whole line will come to a stop whatever sympathy they got over 
the first incident will soon be lost 
morris insisted that in both incidents the passengers behaved 
selfishly because by trying to force their trains to take them to 
their destinations they made passengers at other stations wait 
longer 
but the standard said this response betrays an arrogance which 
ought to be replaced at once by better management on the misery 
line 
john marshall a conservative party lawmaker and northern line 
commuter said the northern line is the nearest thing to hell on 
earth and promised to raise the matter in parliament 
replied morris when youre running 460 trains a day for 25 
million passengers something always goes wrong he said 
thursdays delays were caused by a beer can that was thrown onto 
the line jamming a track mechanism 
meanwhile the standard tracked down the man said to have 
started tuesday nights rebellion by quietly declaring his refusal 
to get off the train 
described by fellowpassengers as a mildmannered welldressed 
man he turned out to be 49yearold civil servant barry blain 
i am not a natural rebel the standard quoted him as saying 
but like a lot of my fellow commuters i am fed up with our 
treatment on the northern line

thirtyone people were killed in ethnic rioting in 
the azerbaijani city of sumgait the staterun news agency tass 
reported today 
it was the first time the official media reported deaths in 
ethnic violence between azeris and armenians in the two southern 
soviet republics dissident sources had reported that as many as 20 
people died in the sumgait riots 
the rioting erupted sunday in the industrial city 19 miles 
northwest of the azerbaijani capital of baku government spokesmen 
had previously acknowledged people were killed in the rioting but 
refused to say how many a television worker in baku had said one 
or two people were killed 
the tass dispatch blamed the sunday killings on hooligan 
elements provoked by disorder 
trouble between the azeris who are predominantly shiite 
moslems and armenians who are christian began early last month 
with a dispute over nagornokarabakh a region in azerbaijan just 
north of iran and east of turkey more than threequarters of the 
population is armenian but it was made part of azerbaijan in 1923 
armenians are demanding that the region be made part of the 
republic of armenia azeris opposed the move and violence has 
ensued 
earlier today an armenian nationalist said his sister and at 
least two other people were killed in ethnic violence in armenia 
unstable immature people falling under the influence of 
false rumors about the events in nagornokarabakh and armenia 
involved themselves in lawsless actions tass said criminal 
elements took part in violent activities and looting from their 
hands 31 people perished 
an english version of the tass story said the dead included 
members of various nationalities old men and women 
on thursday gennady i gerasimov chief spokesman for the soviet 
foreign ministry in moscow gave the first official confirmation of 
deaths during the riots in azerbaijan but would not say how many 
people were killed 
on tuesday he said he could not confirm reports from armenian 
activists that up to 20 people were killed in sumgait in 
azerbaijan but he added there was hooliganism and there can be 
deaths in such cases 
the first official hint of deaths in the ethnic unrest came feb 
24 when nonvoting politburo member vladimir i dolgikh said on 
armenian television that in nagornokarabakh the matter has gone 
so far as confrontations between armenians and azerbaijanis and 
there have been casualties 
street rallies began feb 13 in nagornokarabakh and later 
spread to yerevan the capital of armenia where dissidents said 
more than 1 million people demonstrated on feb 19 rioting spread 
to sumgait 
mosef gorgisyan telephoned the associated press in moscow to say 
his sister avetik gorgisyan 32 was stabbed today and two other 
people were shot in their homes in the armenian city of kirovakan 
he said the three were killed by azeris 
he said six people all ethnic azeris were arrested in the 
killings 
gerasimov said he could neither confirm nor deny the report 
because he had no information about renewed violence in the region 
gorgisyan 26 is a member of an unsanctioned armenian 
organization called the alliance for national selfdetermination 
gorgisyan said his sister was killed today but the telephone 
was cut off before he could say when the two shootings reportedly 
occurred he said demonstrations had been held in kirovakan earlier 
he said he saw the aftermath of three slayings in kirovakan he 
said he had heard 13 other people were killed but could not confirm 
those reports 
gorgisyan said his grandmother and other relatives were in his 
sisters house when the stabbing occurred 
an official at the ministry of internal affairs in yerevan said 
there were no deaths anywhere in the republic the ministry 
includes the police forces of the region the official refused to 
give his name 
an official answering the telephone at police headquarters in 
kirovakan refused comment i am not obligated to say anything to 
foreigners about what happens here said the official who 
declined to give his name 
kirovakan is a city of 137000 people about 35 miles north of 
the armenian capital of yerevan western reporters have not been 
allowed to travel to the region 
since mikhail s gorbachev became communist party chief the 
most deaths previously reported in ethnic unrest occurred in alma 
ata the capital of the central asian republic of kazakhstan 
up to 3000 people rioted in that city dec 1718 1986 to 
protest the appointment of a russian to replace an ethnic kazakh as 
local party chief soviet media reported that two people were 
killed 200 injured and dozens arrested

a settlement aimed at ending the war in 
afghanistan appeared to be taking shape friday and the latest 
round of peace talks were recessed while pakistan decided if it was 
willing to deal with the sovietbacked afghan government 
still open too was the question of whether afghanistans 
moslem resistance groups would drop their fierce opposition to 
future powersharing with afghan president najib 
after a short session of the unsponsored talks friday 
pakistans chief negotiator acting foreign minister zain noorani 
flew back to islamabad for a rare meeting between the government 
and leaders of the political opposition 
pakistan represents the afghan guerrillas in the negotiations 
the meeting in pakistan was convened by prime minister mohammad 
khan junejo to try to reach a consensus on whether a settlement 
should be signed with najibs government 
it was the first time the government sought such direct contact 
with the opposition since president mohammad ziaul haq seized 
power in a 1977 coup 
before leaving noorani reaffirmed pakistans position that a 
settlement must include formation of a transitional government 
replacing najibs 
pakistan does not recognize najibs government and has said it 
must be replaced if 5 million afghan refugees living in pakistan 
and iran are to return safely home 
most of pakistans opposition parties have urged the government 
to sign an accord clearing the way for the withdrawal of soviet 
troops from afghanistan then worry about a political settlement 
later 
diego cordovez the un mediator who has been the gobetween in 
the nearly 6yearold talks told reporters that thursdays 
agreement on a ninemonth timetable for the withdrawal of the 
soviet troops represented a significant step toward a final 
political settlement 
he stopped short of saying it was complete but exuded confidence 
that remaining issues would be resolved noting that all sides 
showed determination and political will 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev has said that if an accord is 
signed by march 15 the estimated 115000 red army troops would 
begin leaving afghanistan in midmay the soviets intervened in 
1979 
afghanistan has accused pakistan of undermining peace 
prospects by linking the withdrawal to formation of a transitional 
government 
the head of the afghan delegation foreign minister abdul wakil 
told a un human rights commission on friday that his nations 
concept of a multiparty government of national reconciliation 
has the vigorous support of our people 
opponents say that concept is designed to cement the leading 
role of najibs governing peoples democratic party of afghanistan 
wakil said political hysteria made the opposition reject all 
attempts by kabul to launch a constructive dialogue instead 
he said extremist bands relying on mounting supplies of 
american and british arms had stepped up their destructive and 
terrorist deeds 
the united states has been largely noncommittal on the issue 
and some sources close to the talks said there is a growing feeling 
in pakistan that washingtons prime interest is in sealing a deal 
before the moscow summit 
cordovez indicated friday he is increasingly confident that 
there will be an eventual compromise on the future shape of the 
kabul government 
he said he was in close contact with superpower 
representatives on the problem and was confident the afghan 
resistance will change its attitude once a settlement is signed

president hussain muhammad ershads 
jatiya party gained a lopsided majority in parliament in an 
election that brought new calls for protests friday from opposition 
leaders 
an opposition coalition of 21 parties scheduled rallies for a 
day of protest saturday and denounced thursdays balloting 
which they boycotted 
at least 13 people were reported killed and more than 300 were 
injured in election violence and reporters who visited polling 
places found evidence of a low voter turnout and widespread vote 
rigging 
with results announced friday for 218 of the 299 parliament 
seats up for grabs the presidents party had won 194 
a coalition of 73 small factions known as the combined 
opposition parties won 12 two other small parties had one each 
and independents won seven voting was canceled in one district 
where a candidate was slain the other 30 seats in the 330seat 
parliament are reserved for women who will be chosen later 
in the 1986 elections jatiya won 157 seats but its majority 
rose to 210 after wheeling and dealing with independents and the 
addition of the 30 seats for women those traditionally go to the 
governing party 
the vote did not end the stalemate between ershad and his 
leading opponents sheik hasina of the awami league and khaleda zia 
of the bangladesh nationalist party 
the women vowed to persist in their campaign against ershad and 
ms hasina declared we will topple this corrupt government 
they have been organizing antiershad demonstrations and strikes 
since nov 10 
bangladesh journalists decided to stop work for a night to 
protest government restrictions on the press that were imposed 
under a national state of emergency in november 
reazuddin ahmed president of the bangladesh federal union of 
journalists representing about 1500 journalists across the 
country said government officials had been phoning newspapers each 
night and telling them not to publish news of antigovernment 
activities 
he said they were told not to publish news of a low voter 
turnout or election violence 
most newspapers seemed to have kept low profile about reporting 
violence or election fraud 
the action will result in nonpublication of about 15 
dhakabased dailies and half a dozen more outside dhaka on 
saturday two national news agencies will also be affected 
ershad said he expected the new parliament to serve out its full 
fiveyear term 
ershad dissolved the parliament last december 3 years early 
in a move to compromise with the opposition the opposition 
declared a boycott of the election 
the former lieutenant took power in a bloodless coup in 1982 and 
was elected president in 1986

the senate trying to avoid another 
irancontra affair on friday voted down an effort to let the white 
house withhold details about covert operations from congress 
the 6523 vote came as the chamber worked on a bill which would 
require that congress be notified about all covert actions within 
48 hours after they start 
the vote killed an amendment proposed by sen james mcclure 
ridaho which would have allowed a president simply to tell 
congress that a covert action had started but withhold details 
until later 
mcclure called his proposal a compromise which he said 
gives the president some flexibility about when to tell 
congress 
but sen william cohen rmaine chief author of the bill said 
mcclures amendment is not a compromise its a capitulation 
this lets the president play ive got a secret but not tell 
the bills future is unclear the reagan administration strongly 
opposes the measure as an unconstitutional limit on a presidents 
ability to conduct foreign policy a similar measure is pending in 
the house but has not yet reached the floor 
cohen is vicechairman of the intelligence committee and was 
also a member of the irancontra committee which investigated the 
sale of us arms to iran and the diversion of some of the profits 
to the contra guerrillas president reagan withheld notice from 
congress for 10 months about the iranian arms sales 
the bill overhauls procedures for notifying congress about 
intelligence actions the chief provision requires that 
notification be sent to capitol hill within 48 hours of the time a 
covert operation begins replacing the current requirement that 
congress be given timely notification which is not defined 
cohen said the bill cannot guarantee that future abuses such 
as irancontra will not occur but it will certainly minimize 
them 
sen orrin hatch rutah an opponent called the bill an 
overreaction to the irancontra situation he termed it 
unnecessary unwise and unconstitutional 
but sen lloyd bentsen dtexas said the requirement for 
this legislation has certainly been demonstrated 
there is no question but that not being advised for over 10 
months about the iran arms sale was not a timely notification 
said bentsen what this legislation does is close that loophole 
sen patrick leahy dvt said the bill contained small but 
necessary steps although he warned we can write every law 
conceivable but unless the people follow them they are no good 
sen john chafee rri said many people believe that if we 
had this requirement in place irancontra would never have 
happened but thats not so 
cohen agreed noting that theres no piece of legislation we 
can enact that would prevent a president from exercising poor 
judgement

pat robertson was accused in court papers 
friday of abusing the judicial process by trying to dismiss the 35 
million libel suit he filed against an excongressman who 
questioned his war record 
lawyers for former rep paul n mccloskey jr rcalif 
formally opposed robertsons motion to dismiss the case that is set 
to go to trial next tuesday the campaign seasons super tuesday 
when the former television evangelist is hoping make a good showing 
in southern states 
robertson though still denying mccloskeys allegations says he 
felt he had to abandon his libel suit because he couldnt take part 
in the trial and effectively campaign at the same time 
however mccloskeys lawyers said in court papers friday that 
robertson initiated this action for political purposes and has 
conducted this litigation in bad faith putting the defendant to 
substantial unnecessary and improper expense and public 
denigration 
robertsons lastminute tactics to avoid trial are just the 
latest most flagrant example of his abuse of the judicial process 
and his attempt to treat this forum as a court of convenience 
the lawyers said in papers filed with us district judge joyce 
hens green 
the judge must now make a decision on robertsons motion to 
dismiss the lawsuit 
the libel suit against mccloskey was filed in 1986 following 
publication of mccloskeys charges that robertson used the help of 
his father the late sen a willis robertson dva to avoid 
combat during the korean war 
the former television evangelist agonized over the decision to 
seek dismissal but concluded that the trial date which the 
judge refused to postpone presented a hobsons choice of either 
abandoning his campaign during a critical period or forgoing the 
opportunity for personal vindication robertsons lawyers said 
thursday in their motion to dismiss the case 
mccloskeys lawyers asked the judge to order the trial to 
proceed to ensure the right of mr mccloskey to have the same 
vindication of his integrity that mr robertson apparently sought 
if the judge decides to dismiss the lawsuit mccloskeys lawyers 
asked that she order robertson to pay the former congressmans 
court costs and legal fees which they estimated to be about 
400000 
they also asked the judge to preserve mccloskeys legal rights 
to initiate court action against robertson and his attorneys 
involving possible claims of malicious prosecution 
to allow plaintiff to initiate an action which may require the 
expenditure of significant legal fees by or on behalf of mr 
mccloskey in defending his first amendment right of 
selfexpression on the eve of the trial to both denounce the 
defendant in the most outrageous fashion and then request that the 
court dismiss the case seems to be the very sort of manipulation of 
the judicial process which this court should resist attorneys 
george lehner roger spaeder and leslie blackmon said in their 
brief 
mccloskeys motion also asked the judge to issue an order 
preventing future legal actions against mr mccloskey based on 
any past or future repetition of the statements at issue in this 
action 
while a dismissal of the case would prevent robertson from suing 
mccloskey over the statements he made in 1986 the former 
congressman is concerned that mr robertson may attempt to 
silence his free speech again with yet another lawsuit based on 
repetitions of the alleged libels the brief said

if tammy and michelle walsh were stumped 
by the pythagorean theorem or baffled by ohms law when they were 
doing their school assignments help was usually just a call away 
by ships radio 
while sailing in the bahamas an engineer from nassau was there 
with advice on algebra a vacationing english professor from the 
university of california at berkeley once offered essaywriting 
tips 
the sisters now are freshmen at babson college having completed 
elementary junior high and high school while sailing on the 
atlantic with their parents and two cats on a 45foot boat called 
high hopes 
they studied french in florida and geometry in georgetown via a 
chicago correspondence school that once a year mailed books and 
exams they completed the tests at their own pace and returned them 
for grading 
i think we got a better education michelle 21 who took 
some time off before going to college said in an interview at the 
1550student undergraduate business school outside boston you 
learned much more because you read everything you had a lot of 
responsibility we ended up more wellrounded and ready to take on 
the world 
in 1971 when the sisters were preschoolers mickey and joyce 
walsh of oakdale ny on long islands south shore decided to 
take the kids sailing mickey gave up his job working on a clam 
dredge and the family left for puerto rico where they lived for a 
year 
they returned to puerto rico in 1974 for another year and 
michelle started in correspondence school the family sold their 
house in 1979 and decided to move to the boat 
they always liked sailing and wanted to live on a boat and 
travel tammy 18 said of her parents they were going to wait 
until we grew up 
instead the family went to sea and the girls learned to 
discipline themselves in their studies their parents left them on 
their own almost from the start they said 
they felt we were mature and responsible enough to do it and 
by doing that we became more mature and responsible said tammy 
the walshes spent summers on new yorks fire island then 
usually left in october and sailed down the atlantic coast the 
trip offered maximum study time often up to eight hours a day 
then wed get to the beach and not study for months 
michelle said 
the family spent most winters anchored off georgetown in the 
exuma islands in the bahamas books often werent a priority 
michelle needed three years to complete algebra 
michelle and tammy admit that while they disciplined themselves 
enough to finish the required texts if the sun was shining and the 
water glistening boardsailing won out over shakespeare 
we didnt have set hours said michelle if it was a 
beautiful day outside i wasnt going to sit and read 
mary mckeown principal of the chicagobased american school of 
correspondence said michelle received her high school equivalency 
diploma in 1984 and tammy in 1987 they had to take at least 16 
credits under illinois requirements 
she said the school is accredited by the north central 
association of colleges and schools and serves a variety of 
students from young people living abroad to adults seeking to 
finish high school tuition and books cost 679 for four years 
science and math courses most frequently sent the sisters 
searching for help on the radio or high seas 
people living on boats are very friendly tammy said you 
dont think anything about rowing up to someones boat knocking on 
the hull and saying hi 
the walshes say they dont regret missing the typical high 
school scene and they offer their scholastic aptitude test scores 
in defense of their academic preparation 1280 for tammy and 1080 
for michelle compared to the 1987 national average of 906 out of a 
possible 1600 
they gave you a book and you had to read the whole book no 
matter what tammy said i think thats a big difference i 
know people who say they never finished a textbook

the house interior committee is investigating 
possible government corruption in the us trust territory of 
palau including allegations that senior palau officials may be 
involved in heroin smuggling 
the probe was disclosed this week by chairman morris udall 
dariz and del ron de lugo dvirgin islands chairman of the 
interior subcommittee on insular and international affairs 
the lawmakers in statements not disputed by palauan or us 
officials quoted the us drug enforcement administration as 
saying that the pacific islands are being used to transship 
heroin from southeast asia to the us 
in a letter sent wednesday to rep dante fascell dfla 
chairman of the house foreign affairs committee udall and de lugo 
said several senior palauan government officials have been 
identified to us as being connected to this drug trade 
the letter cited no basis for the accusation against the 
unidentified officials jeff farrow staff director for de lugos 
subcommittee said its coming from our investigation thats 
all we can say at this point 
haruo willter palaus acting washington representative 
acknowledged that his country has a drug problem the same as the 
united states as for the involvement of senior officials he 
said these allegations are made by individuals i have seen no 
specific accusations with names 
howard hills counsel for interagency affairs at the state 
department said weve been aware of allegations of drug 
trafficking including allegations of officials being involved 
for years and we dont understand why the interior committee is 
treating them as new 
the letter said the committee investigation also involves 
allegations of corruption and bribery among highranking palau 
officials misappropriation of federal and local funds and violence 
against palauans opposed to a longterm compact linking the united 
states and palau 
palau and the reagan administration are pressing congress to 
approve a resolution to implement the compact leading to the end 
of a unsanctioned trusteeship the united states has exercised 
over palau for 40 years palau is the worlds last united nations 
trust territory 
under the arrangement the united states would provide economic 
assistance and military protection for palau which the pentagon 
sees as a backup location in case this country loses its military 
bases in the philippines 
the interior committee has made no move toward voting on the 
resolution which was endorsed thursday by two subcommittees of the 
foreign affairs committee there was no mention of the drug 
allegations before their votes 
about 14000 people live on the eight permanently inhabited 
islands of palau which comprises more than 200 islands in the 
caroline chain most of the inhabitants live in koror the capital 
some 4450 miles southwest of honolulu and 720 miles south of guam 
in a letter last october to de lugo dea administrator john lawn 
said it appears that palaus primary involvement in international 
drug trafficking is as a transshipment point for southeast asian 
heroin being smuggled to the united states 
lawn said marijuana is grown freely throughout palau and 
that there may be more than 400 heroin addicts in palau far 
higher than the percentage of addicts in the united states 
hills said palau with help requested from the dea and interior 
and state departments is trying to combat the problem he said 
that 25 marijuana and heroin suspects were arrested in a major 
bust tuesday in palau 
about the accusation that senior officials could be involved 
with heroin smuggling hills said the issue of whos involved is 
not going to be commented on because its under investigation by 
the government of palau 
he said congress should move to sever the trusteeship because 
palauan independence and increased us aid would give the islands 
government more resources to combat its problems 
udall and de lugo also cited last summers violence in palau 
surrounding a plebiscite in which a majority of palauans voted to 
change their constitutions strong prohibition on nuclear weapons 
in their country 
palauan dissidents have questioned the legality of the 
plebiscite a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the vote 
was withdrawn because of governmentfostered intimidation 
dissidents have told congress 
udall and de lugo said they wont act on the resolution until 
palaus judiciary rules on the plebiscites legality or the 
dissidents say they wont renew the lawsuit 
the resolution approved by the foreign affairs subcommittees 
says the reagan administration can implement the compact with palau 
unless a legal challenge to the plebiscite is pending

agriculture officials from arizona texas 
and louisiana came to see for themselves whether florida was doing 
all it can to prevent citrus canker from traveling in fruit 
shipments to their states 
we are trying to assess the level of confidence we can place 
on the procedures being taken so that we can determine what 
inspection methods we need in our state said arizonas director 
of agriculture and horticulture ivan j shields 
shields joined florida agriculture commissioner doyle conner and 
regulatory and technical officials from the two other states in a 
tour of florida citrus nurseries groves and packinghouse 
facilities in the indian river and interior areas of floridas 
citrus belt 
florida fruit presents no threat to their citrus industries 
and we want to assure them of that conner said in orlando prior 
to their departure in three small airplanes to fort pierce winter 
haven frostproof and lake wales 
conner invited the representatives from the three states and 
california as a partial answer to embargoes on florida fresh fruit 
shipments imposed by texas and louisiana shortly after the us 
department of agriculture last month lifted a 3yearold ban on 
florida shipments to other citrusgrowing areas 
florida citrus mutual an organization representing 12000 
growers and tuxedo fruit co of fort pierce went into federal 
court and obtained a temporary injunction against the texas 
embargo the first florida truckloads of fruit were expected to 
reach texas this weekend 
conner said florida also was prepared to challenge a louisiana 
ban from the southern part of the state where about 1000 acres of 
fruit is grown 
california which did not send a representative to florida on 
friday and arizona have not interfered with florida shipments 
the usda ban was lifted after a joint statefederal scientific 
task force determined that there was little threat to other 
citrusgrowing states by the florida nursery strain of the tree and 
fruit disease which resulted in the voluntary destruction of 20 
million young trees in the last three years 
john w impson state entomologist for the louisiana department 
of agriculture said there was little worry about floridas 
procedures our concern is monitoring in our state in 
particular by the usda he said 
florida which is the largest domestic producer has almost 
600000 acres of commercial citrus most of it is processed into 
juice but its freshfruit exports to other citrusgrowing states 
constitute an annual market of about 25 million 
california has traditionally been the secondlargest producer 
with texas third followed by arizona louisiana and hawaii a 1983 
freeze in texas dropped its annual production to about 115000 tons 
on 22000 acres of groves however arizona has 35500 acres 
yielding about 485000 tons 
citrus canker threatens commercial citrus groves because it is 
easily spread it mars leaves and fruit making it unmarketable 
and can damage stems and twigs causing a general decline of trees 
the fruit is edible however 
floridas juiceprocessing industry has not been affected 
because except for the small gulf coast region the disease has 
not spread into commercial groves 
canker does not affect humans

a car bomb was discovered today about 300 yards 
from us secretary of state george shultzs hotel and police said 
the explosives were dismantled safely 
in beirut yasser arafats mainstream palestine liberation 
organization guerrilla group fatah claimed responsibility said 
shultz was the target 
the car had been driven into a wall and abandoned a passing 
officer thought the vehicle looked suspicious and discovered the 
bomb jerusalem police commander yosef yehudai said 
a us embassy spokewoman said the car bomb was nowhere near the 
route shultz was scheduled to travel today between the hotel and 
israeli government offices 
fatah in a communique telephoned to the associated press office 
in west beirut said its military command instructed the limassol 
martyrs group to park a bombladen car in front of the hilton hotel 
in jerusalem targeting shultz the messenger of imperialism 
three plo officials were killed in a car bomb explosion in the 
cypriot port of limassol feb 14 the plo blamed israels mossad 
secret service for the bombing 
the fatah communique identified the vehicle in jerusalem as a 
frenchdesigned renault4 and said it was packed with 35 
kilograms 77 pounds of tnt 
the driver had an accident and the car crashed into a power 
pole about 30 minutes before the time set for the bomb to 
explode the communique said the driver deserted the vehicle 
and managed to escape 
it said the attack was meant to be a response to the zionists 
israelis brutality against our people in the occupied 
territories 
we warn shultz and all agents of imperialism against reaching 
out for the plo the sole legitimate representative of the 
palestinian people the communique added 
the vehicle was abandoned near a shopping mall and close to the 
citys central bus station it was northwest of the hilton hotel 
where shultz spent thursday night 
yehudai told the radio 22 pounds of explosives a quantity 
that could have caused a great deal of damage and a mechanism to 
set it off was found inside the vehicle no arrests were reported 
it was the second day in a row that a car bomb was discovered in 
israel on thursday a car bomb exploded outside the central bus 
station in kfar saba northeast of tel aviv no injuries were 
reported 
during the night we received a report of a car involved in a 
regular accident not involving other cars yehudai said on the 
radio about todays car bomb 
later the chief police explosives expert passed by and 
through his own experience decided the car was indeed suspicious 
we found it was a car bomb 
he said the discovery happened by accident 
its discovery and dismantling prevented a damaging attack 
yehudai said of the car bomb it looks like this is the new hit 
tactic of the terrorists 
an additional police statement said the car was registered to 
israelis living in tel aviv and had not been reported stolen 
the area around where the car was found was closed to all 
traffic for more than an hour the vehicle was towed to a police 
laboratory for further tests the statement said

president reagans fiscal 1989 budget would 
produce a deficit of 165 billion a congressional report said 
friday an amount that would trigger massive automatic spending 
cuts under the grammrudman law 
the deficit estimate by the congressional budget office is 30 
billion higher than the amount of red ink the white house office of 
management and budget says the presidents spending plan would 
create 
the differences are mainly because cbo is more pessimistic about 
the how the economy will perform than the administration is 
the grammrudman balanced budget law calls for a 136 billion 
deficit target in fiscal 1989 which begins oct 1 if final 
figures indicate the deficit will exceed that amount by more than 
10 billion domestic and defense spending would be slashed 
automatically by whatever amount it takes to shrink the deficit to 
136 billion 
the final deficit estimate however is made by omb with cbo 
playing only an advisory role according to omb reagans 11 
trillion budget would leave 130 billion in red ink and no 
automatic cuts would occur 
some lawmakers have expressed concern about the pessimistic 
economic and deficit forecasts that cbo has made this year but 
with 1988 an election year congress is not expected to seriously 
challenge ombs numbers and commence a painful round of spending 
cuts and tax increases 
acting cbo director james l blum who presented the report to 
the senate appropriations committee told the legislators that 
deciding which set of forecasts to trust is a political judgment 
call for them to make 
cbo expects slower economic growth and higher inflation and 
interest rates in the next two years than the administration does 
all of those factors would produce higher government spending and 
lower revenue collections than the white house anticipates 
blum conceded that recent economic statistics have been better 
than expected 
it would appear that the pronounced slowdown we were expecting 
in the first quarter of 1988 is not materializing he said 
cbo is also more pessimistic than the administration about 
longerrange efforts to reduce the deficit while the white house 
says the deficit will drop to 104 billion in 1990 and 23 billion 
by 1993 the congressional agency says the deficit will be 157 
billion in 1990 and 109 billion in 1993 
grammrudman requires a balanced budget by 1993 
the house and senate budget committees are expected to begin 
writing their own versions of the 1989 budget soon but neither is 
expected to propose any budgetcutting much beyond that proposed in 
the presidents plan reagans spending blueprint adheres closely 
to the socalled budget summit agreement he reached with 
congressional leaders last november 
among its projections cbo said 
the economy will grow by 18 percent this year compared with 
the administrations estimate of 24 percent 
inflation will be 49 percent in 1988 contrasted with a white 
house forecast of 43 percent 
enactment of reagans entire budget would reduce the deficit by 
12 billion below what it would be if no further deficitreduction 
action were taken

strong critic of washingtons middle east policies 
shultz on a second unscheduled swing through the region in the 
past week did not indicate he had achieved any progress in a 
statement before leaving israel 
the president sent me back to work at it some more and while 
he told me hed let me come home tonight he made it clear that we 
would keep pushing and working shultz said at ben gurion 
international airport 
israel radio reported that shultz presented a written version of 
his peace proposal to israels rival leaders prime minister 
yitzhak shamir of the rightwing likud bloc and foreign minister 
shimon peres of the leftist labor party

oppose it 
the radio said shultz expects shamir to reply to the american 
proposals when the prime minister visits washington on march 14 
the draft proposal also was given to jordans king hussein in 
london on thursday the radio said 
the plan which contained no surprises called for beginning the 
peace process with an international opening which will lead to 
direct talks between israel and a jordanianpalestinian 
delegation the radio said 
it also called for implementing palestinian selfrule in the 
occupied territories this fall and then beginning talks on a 
permanent settlement in december 
shamir described his 90minute session with shultz as very 
friendly very useful and promising he said he was sure the 
united states and israel would continue efforts to start peace 
talks in the area

islamic fundamentalists circulated leaflets in the gaza strip 
condemning the shultz mission and referring to the us official as 
the great evil envoy the jerusalem post reported today

a british official from a private relief 
organization and his syrian aide disappeared in lebanon and one 
official of their group said friday that they had been kidnapped 
the purported abduction came near the end of a week that saw two 
scandinavian employees of the united nations and a west german 
engineer released in lebanon 
peter coleridge the 44yearold middle east coordinator of 
oxfam and oxfams lebanon representative omar traboulsi 31 a 
syrian were kidnapped thursday evening spokesman john magrath 
said in oxford england 
coleridge was on his first trip to lebanon in three years 
weve had conflicting reports as to whether they are still 
being held or not magrath said but nissrine rawda an official 
at oxfams beirut office said there were no eyewitnesses 
confirming the abduction 
sunni moslem leftist leader mustafa saad whose nasserite 
militia controls sidon told reporters the two oxfam officials have 
been detained for questioning by an unidentified palestinian 
group in sidons ein elhilweh refugee camp 
i expect their release within hours god willing saad said 
this is not an abduction there is a security mishap in the 
camp 
he said coleridge had visited the hittin area south of ein 
elhilweh in 1982 when it was devastated by israels invading army 
when he returned this time he took pictures of the areas 
reconstruction and a group inside the camp seized him for 
questioning fearing he might be taking espionage photographs 
saad added 
saad declined to name the group which he says is holding 
coleridge and traboulsi 
police in this ancient city 25 miles south of beirut confirmed 
the two men had been missing since the night before but could not 
say for sure how they vanished 
they may have been seized by gunmen of the molem ulema 
grouping said a sidon police spokesman who could not be 
identified in keeping with regulations we are acting on this 
assumption in our investigation 
the moslem ulema is a fundamentalist sunni moslem faction headed 
by sheik maher hammoud and is influenced by the proiranian 
hezbollah or party of god 
hammoud however disclaimed any involvement in the abduction 
why should i be blamed for every foreigner who is abducted in 
sidon hammoud told the associated press 
hezbollah is believed to be the patron of underground factions 
holding many of 22 other foreigners held hostage in lebanon 
beirut radio stations had blamed this group for the abduction of 
un scandinavian relief workers jan stening 44 of sweden and 
william jorgensen 58 of norway last month they were freed 
unharmed tuesday after 25 days of captivity 
the un relief and works agency with which the two 
scandinavians served had blamed their abduction on palestinians 
acting without a political motive 
coleridge and traboulsi traveled to sidon from beirut on 
thursday morning on a routine visit to inspect relief groups 
supported by oxfam a british charity that aids refugees and poor 
people in many countries 
police said the missing pair had lunch thursday in sidons 
skandarani district with alia shammaa who heads the ghassan 
kanafani foundation a palestinian charity that receives aid from 
oxfam 
they left mrs shammaas house at 330 pm and went to the

soldiers today barred journalists seeking to 
enter the occupied west bank as demonstrations erupted after noon 
prayers on the moslem sabbath two arabs were reported shot to 
death and eight others wounded by israeli gunfire 
authorities also discovered and defused a car bomb near the 
central bus station 300 yards from the hotel where us secretary 
of state george p shultz was staying yasser arafats mainstream 
palestine liberation organization guerrilla group fatah claimed 
responsibility and said shultz was the target 
the explosivesladen car was discovered by a policeman after it 
ran into a wall and was abandoned 
shultz met prime minister yitzhak shamir and foreign minister 
shimon peres in a final but apparently inconclusive effort to 
promote arabisrael negotiations that would help end riots in the 
occupied west bank and gaza 
hospital officials and arab press reports said mohammed ahmed 
salah 18 was shot in the head during a demonstration after noon 
prayers in the village of khatar close to bethlehem israeli 
photographers said the army imposed a curfew 
the army said one palestinian was killed and another wounded in 
the west bank town of araba between nablus and jenin after soldiers 
opened fire to quell a riot by hundreds of arabs who attacked them 
using clubs bottles and stones 
the palestine press service said three arabs were shot and 
wounded in the northern city of jenin it also said a 40yearold 
woman was wounded in the right leg in the refugee camp of balata 
near nablus 
the agency and hospital officials in nablus reported jewish 
settlers were involved in the shooting of a palestinian youth in 
the village of burka the youth 18 was wounded in the back 
officials at arab ahli hospital said two palestinians were 
wounded by gunfire at a protest outside al amari mosque 
before todays violence the united nations reported 76 arabs 
have been killed since the violence began dec 8 
shultz left for syria to meet president hafez assad and then 
planned to fly to cairo for talks with egyptian president hosni 
mubarak before wrapping up his shuttle saturday 
the us proposal calls for peace talks at an international 
conference which will lead to direct talks between israel and a 
jordanianpalestinian delegation 
peres a member of the labor party has expressed support for 
the shultz plan but shamir a member of the rightwing likud has 
not shamir and peres are bitter rivals in the coalition government 
the outbreak of violence came despite a crackdown on press 
coverage israeli officials contend television cameras and still 
photographers inflame demonstrations 
there is no policy to bar journalists from covering the west 
bank and gaza strip said a senior defense ministry official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
it is not a total closure said brig gen ephraim lapid 
the army spokesman he said local commanders had been authorized to 
bar journalists and indicated some areas were closed because noon 
prayers often end in violent demonstrations 
a tightening of restrictions on press coverage had been expected 
after shamir warned he was considering closing occupied zones to 
journalists whom he accused of being biased against israel 
robert slate chairman of the foreign press association said 
restrictions had been expected after shamirs warning 
im appalled but not surprised slater said the question 
is whether this is limited to fridays or more general 
it was not immediately known if army roadblocks were set up in 
the occupied gaza strip 
the us embassy said the car bomb found in jerusalem was not 
along a route shultz was to travel today it was not clear when the 
bomb was to have gone off police said it had a detonating 
mechanism but did not elaborate 
the vehicle was abandoned near a shopping mall and close to the 
citys central bus station it was northwest of the hilton hotel 
where shultz spent thursday night 
fatah in a communique telephoned to the associated press office 
in west beirut said its military command ordered commandos to 
park a bombladen car in front of the hilton hotel in jerusalem 
targeting shultz the messenger of imperialism 
the driver had an accident and the car crashed into a power 
pole about 30 minutes before the time set for the bomb to 
explode the communique said the driver deserted the vehicle 
and managed to escape 
authorities said it was unclear if the driver was on his way 
elsewhere when the vehicle was driven into a wall or had abandoned 
the car intentionally 
the jerusalem post quoted a leaflet issued by the militant 
islamic jihad which called for a threeday general strike starting 
today in gaza the leaflet linked the strike to shultzs mission 
the leaflet called shultz the great evil envoy and said his 
mission was designed to stop the threemonth uprising by the 15 
million palestinians of the west bank and gaza which israeli 
seized in the 1967 middle east war

secretary of state george p shultz has invoked 
the powers of a good luck charm during his middle east shuttle a 
white peace dove in his jerusalem hotel lobby 
whenever shultz passed through the lobby of the jerusalem 
hilton he pulled a silverandwhite ribbon hanging from the dove 
sending the birds wings flapping 
when i came here about seven or eight days ago to start the 
process i went into the hotel and there hanging from the ceiling 
was a bird a great big thing on a little rope you pull and the 
wings go and the dove flies shultz said friday 
so i pulled it when i came in and everybody clapped and i keep 
pulling it whenever i go through there in the hope that it will 
bring us good fortune shultz said he made his comments after 
meeting with prime minister yitzhak shamir and foreign minister 
shimon peres 
and that is what i wish to the people of israel to the 
palestinians to the people of all the neighboring countries that i 
have visited good fortune and peace shultz said

an outside committee that audited nasas 
recovery from the challenger disaster for 14 months said friday it 
finds no safety flaws serious enough to delay the resumption of 
space shuttle flights 
the first mission with the shuttle discovery is scheduled for 
aug 4 
we are all quite comfortable with whats been done to get 
ready for the next flight retired gen alton slay chairman of 
the national research council committee told reporters 
we find absolutely no showstoppers slay said space 
travel will always entail risks it cannot be reduced to zero the 
key to minimizing those risks is to identify the most likely 
hazards or failures and to take steps to eliminate them or control 
them if they cannot be eliminated 
but coupled with the praise was a strong recommendation that the 
national aeronautics and space administration tighten the ways it 
assesses and manages risks associated with the shuttle 
no matter how good you are you never reach mecca said 
slay there is always room for improvement 
the committees central finding he said is that nasa is able 
to assess and manage risks associated with space flights but uses 
so many review boards and safety organizations that the result is 
a fragmented picture of the safety and reliability of the total 
space transportation system 
further slay said those organizations rely on subjective 
assessments of risk posed by thousands of individual space shuttle 
components rather than on engineering evaluations 
their procedures and their oganizations need policing up 
slay said they need to do more to integrate their risk 
assessment and risk management they need more to take advantage of 
all the data that does exist in their decisionmaking process 
slay defined risk assessment as saying on any particular piece 
of hardware what is the likelihood this is going to cause a 
problem if it is going to fail and if it fails will it cascade 
into some other system and cause a problem there 
asked if better risk assessment might have stopped the illfated 
launch of the challenger on jan 28 1986 slay replied 
no one can say that for sure the only thing we can say for 
sure is if these procedures had been in place we would have had 
more information at our fingertips whether the engineering 
judgments that they made at the time would have bveen different 
who can say 
challengers sevenmember crew was killed when the shuttle 
exploded 73 seconds after launch 
william lenoir a former astronaut who flew on the shuttle in 
1982 said the bulk of the recommendations in the 144page report 
has already been put in effect by nasa and that the report 
contained no surprises for the agency 
nasa said it will carefully review the report agency 
administrator james c fletcher said nasa owes the national 
research council a vote of thanks 
i am particfdularly gratified that the council did not find 
any showstoppers that in their opinion should delay the next 
launch of the space shuttle now set for august he said 
lenoir whose planned spacewalk was scrubbed by a malfunctioning 
space suit said he is worried that the challenger accident may 
have made nasa personnel gunshy 
we need to be careful that we dont go overboard and keep 
trying to make it safe enough a little bit safer and a little bit 
safer and we may never fly again because well never make it 100 
percent safe he said i believe the right processses are in 
place 
the committee review was recommended by the presidential 
commission that investigated the challenger accident the national 
research council acts as a scientific advisory group to the federal 
government and is administered by the national academy of sciences 
the national academy of engineering and the institute of medicine

the communist party newspaper friday 
accused australia of interfering in polish affairs by supporting an 
invitation to solidarity leader lech walesa to attend a trade union 
congress in melbourne 
the government said tuesday it would bar walesa and three top 
aides from traveling to australia to attend the union congress 
officials said they were acting to protect the states basic 
political interests 
fridays commentary appeared in trybuna ludu the official daily 
of the party 
the australian embassy in warsaw said allowing walesa to visit 
australia would improve relations between the two countries and 
show that poland was making progress in enacting reforms 
it said australian prime minister bob hawke had presented the 
argument that a countrys standing is enhanced if it permits a 
citizen albeit a controversial one to go abroad where he can 
speak freely 
the australian council of trade unions invited the poles to 
attend the world congress of the international confederation of 
free trade unions from march 1418 
trybuna ludu said inviting members of an illegal organization 
was a provocative action against poland and ignored the real 
fact of the existence in poland of a reborn trade union 
movement 
the newspaper was referring to the allpoland trade union 
alliance the official labor federation set up with government 
backing after solidarity was outlawed in october 1982 that claims 
about 7 million members 
walesa contacted by telephone at his gdansk apartment said 
such personal attacks in trybuna ludu were not new he added that 
the article showed who is standing behind the allegedly 
independent official trade unions 
he called it strange that the state should try to force 
international recognition for the official trade unions by barring 
him from traveling to australia 
walesa has not traveled abroad since the december 1981 martial 
law crackdown that suppressed solidarity the soviet blocs first 
free trade union the gdansk shipyard worker helped found 
solidarity in 1980 and won the nobel peace prize in 1983 
walesa has not yet received a formal refusal of his application 
said an aide also invited to australia were wroclaw solidarity 
leader wladyslaw frasyniuk gdansk leader bogdan lis and senior 
adviser bronislaw geremek

the independent postal rate commission 
recommended a sweeping series of increases in us postage rates 
friday including boosting the cost of first class letters to 25 
cents 
but the agency also put forth a proposal to charge consumers 
less than a quarter for paying bills and recommended that 
advertising mail rates increase by even larger percentages than 
other groups 
the complex series of rate proposals now goes to the board of 
governors of the postal service which requested rate hikes 10 
months ago the new rates could be ordered into effect within 10 
days to two weeks with the governors likely to consider the matter 
next week 
overall the rate commission recommended a series of postage 
rate hikes totaling 175 percent somewhat more than the postal 
service request for a 16 percent increase 
the higher rates are necessary for the postal service to avoid a 
deficit which could total more than 5 billion by 1989 rate 
commission chairman janet steiger said 
the agency agreed with the postal services original request to 
set the rate for first class letters at 25 cents up from the 
current 22 cents 
at that rate sending a letter to aunt maude would take about 
the same bite from the average wallet as it did in 1932 adjusted 
for inflation the 3 cent postage rate introduced in 1932 would 
amount to 255 cents today 
noting that typical consumers are one of the few groups that 
dont get any discounts for bulk mail the commission made an 
innovative proposal to give these people a break 
it suggested a new courtesy mail discount in which business 
could prepare special envelopes with proper coding and zip codes 
for automatic processing and which would be addressed to post 
office boxes to save carrier delivery 
consumers using these envelopes for example to pay bills or 
respond to an advertisement would be given a discount on the 
postage the agency didnt suggest an amount of the discount but 
said the postal service should study the costs and come up with an 
amount 
the rate commission did recommend a 2 cent cut in the current 7 
cent minimum cost for prepaid business reply envelopes in order to 
encourage companies to provide these for consumers 
in the first class category the price for each additional ounce 
of mail would rise from 17 cents to 20 cents as requested by the 
postal service 
but the cost for a post card would increase from 14 cents to 15 
cents a penny less than had been requested 
overall first class rates would increase 147 percent the rate 
commission said 
third class mail however which is mostly advertising and is 
widely termed junk mail would have a 25 percent cost hike 
the rate commission said in studying costs it determined that 
this type of mail was responsible for more postal service costs 
than it was paying and thus should have a larger increase 
the minimum rate for third class mail would jump from 125 cents 
to 167 cents slightly more than the postal service had requested 
the per pound rate would rise from 38 cents to 48 cents 3 cents 
more than asked 
for nonprofit advertising mail the minimum rate would increase 
from 85 cents to 87 cents slightly less than the 9 cents 
suggested by the postal service 
second class mail newspapers and magazines for the most part 
would face overall increases of just over 18 percent 
newspapers sent within the county would rise to 98 cents per 
pound and 34 cents to 59 cents per piece the current rate is 91 
cents per pound and 31 cents to 49 cents per item 
the commission agreed to a postal service proposal for a 875 
rate for the highly competitive express overnight mail 
while some employee retirement costs anticipated by the postal 
service turned out to be less than expected the saving was eaten 
up by other amounts including a poorer than hopedfor showing in 
costcutting programs steiger said 
when the new rates take effect they will end the prices 
structure that took effect feb 17 1985 
compared to other small necessities we commonly purchase 
from toothpaste to ground coffee this is a very modest 
increase postal board chairman john n griesemer said last may 
when proposing the increases 
he estimated the additional cost of postage to the average 
individual would be less than 10 per year 
the postal service is required to break even over time by 
the 1970 law that made it an independent federal agency and ended 
the taxpayer subsidy for the mail 
the postal service has been in the black five of the last 10 
years it finished last year with a 223 million loss after showing 
a 305 million surplus in 1986 
a special nondenominated e stamp has been prepared for use 
when the new rates take effect 
because the agency had no way of knowing what rate would be 
recommended it had the e stamps printed for use at whatever the 
rate turned out to be 
the e stamps features a spacebased image of the earth and may 
be used only for domestic mail 
overseas mail rates currently 44 cents for letters are not 
affected by the new recommendation

pat robertsons quest for the republican 
presidential nomination is approaching a crossroads on his southern 
home ground 
winless one month into the primary season he has been 
predicting things will change when he reaches the south the 
regions contests kick off with the south carolina primary 
saturday followed three days later by super tuesday 
at times his presidential effort has seemed as much crusade as 
campaign 
the former television evangelists rhetoric is filled with 
references to morality religion and patriotism his campaign song 
is titled for god and country and he calls for the nations 
return to the bedrock of faith in god 
government doesnt give us our freedom he said at a rally 
monday night in miami it is a gift of god given every one of 
us 
robertsons enemies are communists congressmen who vote against 
aid to nicaraguan contra rebels and supreme court justices who 
wont permit prayer in public schools 
although the son of a us senator robertson has never held 
public office and stresses he is running as an outsider against the 
political establishment 
i want you to know i am not a politician nobody has any hooks 
in me he told about 1000 wildly cheering supporters at a rally 
here tuesday night i am free to serve god as my conscience 
dictates 
yet his political organization has won the grudging admiration 
of opposing campaign officials turning out large crowds of 
enthusiastic supporters and giving him some impressive showings in 
caucus states 
this is the big one for me robertson said of south carolina 
after coming in last in the new hampshire primary 
he has acknowledged his campaign will be in trouble if he loses 
south carolina which appears made to order for his godandcountry 
message the state is conservative rooted in the bible belt and 
has crossover voting that will permit democrats to cast ballots in 
the republican primary 
however a new washington post poll on friday indicated that 
robertson was far behind in the state the poll of 1000 likely 
republican voters showed vice president george bush with the 
support of 49 percent sen bob dole with 26 percent and robertson 
with 14 percent 
the survey said that even among voters who said they watch 
television evangelists almost every week bush got 44 percent to 
robertsons 27 percent 
robertsons campaign may still be in trouble even if he wins 
south carolina 
in florida and texas the two biggest prizes of super tuesday 
public opinion polls show him a poor third to bush and dole 
robertson also has been dogged by questions about some of his 
public statements during the past couple weeks including 
suggesting the bush campaign leaked information about evangelist 
jimmy swaggarts sexual indiscretions in an attempt to smear 
robertson by association 
he also has revived a claim that there are soviet missiles in 
cuba despite denials from the reagan administration he raised 
eyebrows with a contention that his christian tv network knew of 
the whereabouts of us hostages in lebanon 
and he is trying to drop a 35 million libel suit against former 
rep paul mccloskey rcalif the trial is to begin on super 
tuesday in washington mccloskey an exmarine who had been on the 
same troop ship with robertson during the korean war had written a 
letter alleging robertson avoided combat duty in korea through his 
fathers political influence 
robertson made a swing through florida on monday and tuesday 
concentrating heavily on wooing miamis cubanamerican voters by 
repeating the cuban missile claim and pledging to support the 
exiles right of belligerence although he acknowledged later 
that he could do so only within the constraints of us law 
about 800 people mostly hispanic turned out at a miami rally 
a disappointment because robertson campaign staffers had been 
predicting nearly twice as many would attend but his crowds 
generally have been bigger than those of other presidential 
candidates 
in orlando some supporters held up signs indicating they had 
come from towns miles away in interviews several of his orlando 
supporters said they had watched robertson for years on his 700 
club program and christian broadcasting network 
the reason i say we need pat weve got to have the 
christian principles that our forefathers founded this nation 
with said clair baker an electronics worker from clermont 
weve got to get back to that or were all down the tubes 
former florida republican chairman tommy thomas who was 
president reagans state campaign chairman and now is active in the 
bush camp conceded robertson is well organized his supporters are 
loyal and a high percentage of them will go to the polls 
but he said there just arent enough of them to give robertson 
a victory in florida where democrats cannot cross over into the gop 
primary 
in texas bush has a home court advantage over robertson and 
dole as it is the vice presidents adopted home state 
bush also has strong florida connections through his son jeb 
former local party chairman in dade county where the cubanamerican 
vote is centered he is now the states commerce secretary also 
the gop establishment in florida from gov bob martinez a 
national bush campaign cochairman on down has lined up strongly 
behind the vice president

president francois mitterrand on friday toured the 
tall glass pyramid capping the new entrance to the louvre museum 
finally finished after six years of controversy and delay 
the 72foothigh pyramid is set between the museums two main 
wings and tops three underground levels which are still under 
construction the lower levels will house a main foyer boutiques 
information desks snack bars storage rooms restoration studios 
and other services

other government officials awarded the legion of honor medal to 
im pei the chineseamerican architect who designed the pyramid 
here is a man who is not only in love with the louvre but 
also with french history mitterrand said following the visit 
i knew he would do nothing to take away from the beauty and the 
history of the site 
mitterrand said he had seen examples of peis work in washington 
and boston and was taken with his pure geometric forms 
i guess you could say i like pure and simple shapes better 
than any others he said 
starting next year the pyramid will be the louvres only 
aboveground entrance though there will be direct access from 
nearby subway stations and underground parking lots 
the three underground levels form a hub and will be connected to 
the louvres two miles of painting and sculpture galleries by 
corridors resembling the spokes of a giant wheel 
the pyramid is but a small portion of a 26 billion overall 
moderization 
it was met with considerable resistance from public groups art 
historians and political leaders after it was unveiled early in 
mitterrands presidential term but he remained committed to it 
renovations of the museum have been delayed by finance minister 
edouard balladurs refusal to vacate the sumptuous offices in the 
louvres northern wing his ministrys preserve for decades the 
finance ministry is supposed to move by the end of the year to new 
quarters in eastern paris

american arms negotiators in geneva have 
complained very forcefully to their soviet counterparts that 
moscow has failed to submit three key documents slowing progress 
on a plan to cut strategic nuclear arsenals by 50 percent us 
officials said friday 
phyllis oakley the state departments deputy spokeswoman said 
the united states is still waiting for the soviets to submit their 
drafts of a memorandum of understanding and two protocols on 
verification which american negotiators have already provided 
both sides promised to submit the papers in time for a review by 
secretary of state george p shultz and soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze at a meeting scheduled for march 22 in 
washington she said 
if the ministers are to have the opportunity to review these 
key documents at their next meeting its clear and imperative that 
the soviets supply their versions as soon as possible mrs 
oakley said 
weve set no deadlines but obviously these issues are 
complicated and complex and they need time for thorough study and 
review she added 
another official speaking on condition of anonymity said s 
read hanmer the us negotiator at the strategic arms reduction 
talks in geneva very forcefully raised this issue with the 
soviets 
president reagan and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev agreed 
at their dec 810 summit to work diligently toward a 50 percent 
reduction in longrange weapons carried by bombers and missiles on 
land and sea the aim was to get an agreement in time for signature 
at a summit meeting in moscow which is expected to be held in may 
or june 
one of the most difficult elements of the negotiation has been 
figuring out a way to insure that neither side cheated in its 
conversion or elimination of the weapons 
as in past arms negotiations the two sides said they would 
submit drafts of how they thought a verification system should be 
written and then begin work to eliminate the differences 
since october the united states has provided its versions of 
two protocols one on how the conversion or elimination would take 
place and one on how the procedures would be monitored and 
inspected on wednesday the united states submitted the final 
document a 130page draft of a memorandum of understanding 
providing an extensive exchange of factual material 
the soviets have not tabled proposed their versions so 
theres nothing to work with and they wont convene working groups 
until they have submitted their versions a us official said 
in a speech in st louis on thursday edward l rowny an arms 
control adviser to reagan said vast amounts of work need to be 
done on a strategic agreement before it can be ready for reagan and 
gorbachev to sign 
verification is among the toughest problems he said 
in start because of the many different systems on both sides 
spanning a wide variety of geographic deployments and operational 
practices it is important that the details be tackled now and 
solved soon he said 
us officials conceded on friday that the three documents they 
submitted contain omissions reflecting the need for more work just 
to refine the american position on these issues 
the difference is that weve made the submissions anyway so 
that at least we can start the process one official said

more missiles flew at baghdad and tehran 
on friday in the longrange rocket duel between iran and iraq 
which has taken scores of lives in the five days since it began 
iran said 17 civilians including four infants were killed 
friday and iraq said women and children were among the casualties 
in baghdad iraq has not given specific casualty figures since the 
missile exchange began monday 
in tehran demonstrators marched on the soviet embassy chanting 
death to russia iran says the soviet union supplied the iraqi 
missiles but the soviets deny it 
police ringed the embassy in tehran and the consulate in the 
central city of isfahan irans official islamic republic news 
agency said 
iraq said it fired three surfacetosurface missiles into tehran 
and the iranians said they countered with two launched at baghdad 
an iraqi military communique confirmed one iranian missile strike 
on the capital 
the attacks began early in the afternoon breaking a 30hour 
lull in latest round in the war of the cities which has killed 
thousands of people since the war began in september 1980 
in the five days iraq says it has hit tehran with 27 missiles 
and qom the iranian hierarchys holy city with three iran says 
it has fired 12 into baghdad and iraq has confirmed only nine 
iran has reported 47 people killed and more than 100 wounded in 
tehran and no casualties in qom iraq is not specific about 
casualties but speaks of many civilians killed or wounded 
although iraq claims to have developed its own missiles western 
military analysts believe they are sovietmade scudb rockets with 
strapon boosters that enable them to reach tehran and qom both 
slightly less than 300 miles from the border they say the probable 
source is north korea 
iran also uses scudbs supplied by its arab allies syria and 
libya but does not need boosters because baghdad is only 80 miles 
from the frontier 
a iranian dispatch said a missile exploded in a densely 
populated residential area of tehran on friday destroying eight 
houses and 20 cars 
the official agency said 17 bodies were found under the debris 
and 15 civilians were wounded it reported several civilians 
wounded in another missile attack 
in a sermon at weekly moslem prayers friday ayatollah mussavi 
ardebili the chief justice said iran would stop the missiles if 
iraq did but otherwise would retaliate severely by showering 
missiles and artillery fire on iraqi cities irna reported 
it said later that iranian gunners fired two rockets at military 
targets in baghdad iraq said one reached the capital and hit a 
residential area killing or wounding civilians including women 
and children and destroying houses and shops 
the iranian rulers should prepare themselves for further 
devastating iraqi rocket and air strikes by day and night an 
iraqi military spokesman said and the second iraqi missile of the 
day hit tehran less than an hour later 
tehran radio claimed iranian revolutionary guards fired 
shorterrange missiles that destroyed a mobile iraqi missile 
platform at tib near the iraqi city of amarah in the central 
sector of the 730mile border warfront 
the area is about 180 miles southeast of baghdad and 340 
southwest of tehran 
if the radio report is confirmed it would be the first 
indication of a lauching site for the iraqi missiles iraq claims 
they have a 400mile range

the nuclear regulatory commission indicated 
friday that the tennessee valley authority may win permission 
within two weeks to restart its first nuclear reactor since its 
entire atomic power system was closed in 1985 
the commission heard its staff present a generally glowing 
report about tvas readiness to reopen the sequoyah unit 2 plant 
near chattanooga tenn after a monthlong nonnuclear heatup of 
the facility 
but i do not believe that sequoyah is ready to go critical 
yet nrc executive director victor stello said that may come 
next week or the following week 
the longpostponed restart of the sequoyah plant would mark a 
significant breakthrough for the tva nuclear system in its long 
costly journey to recover from management and safety breakdowns 
which branded it one of the worst in the history of atomic power 
its five operating reactors two at sequoyah and three at 
browns ferry near athens ga were ordered shut down in 1985 
plans for eight other plants were canceled and construction on 
four others was delayed for years 
the commission heard a lengthy presentation from tvas new 
chairman marvin j runyon and its nuclear chief steven a white 
and found little to quarrel with about tvas latest efforts to put 
the program back on track 
we truly are ready to resume the production of nuclear 
power white said we will be cautious we will be conservative 
we will be deliberate 
i did not want to apply industry standards to the tva white 
said i wanted to apply the highest standards and thats what we 
did 
representatives of the nrcs special task force for the tva 
agreed that most problems confronting a sequoyah restart have been 
resolved including major concerns about the durability of 
rubberinsulated cables and the reliability of emergency diesel 
generators necessary for power in the event of a reactor accident 
but stewart ebneter who head the task force said some concern 
remains about allegations raised in january by a previous tva 
employee after interviewing the man twice ebneter said the nrc 
staff is pursuing whether a fire hazard may be posed by the 
possiblity of cabletocable shorts a separate issue than the 
earlier problem with the siliconeinsulated cables 
ebneter said he expected to receive new technical data from the 
tva on the issue and expressed hope it would be resolved before 
the commissions next formal meeting tentatively set for march 10 
to consider a sequoyah restart 
the commission also is known to be reviewing findings of its 
office of investigation over allegations that tvas white 
deliberately misled the commission about safety conditions at 
sequoyah in a january 1986 document 
the case was referred to the justice department late last year 
but no mention was made of the investigation during fridays 
session 
in fact nrc chairman lando zech was effusive in his praise of 
white and told the tvas board of directors that i hope you will 
continue your support for steve white

one of austrias five generals announced 
friday he was resigning because of a disagreement involving 
president kurt waldheim and his service in the nazi army during 
world war ii 
gen karl schaffer said he asked to resign last month to protest 
a directive from defense minister robert lichal who ordered the 
general not to edit an army film used for political education 
schaffer wanted to cut out a segment in the film that quoted a 
historian as saying historians are no apostles of morals 
he said he wanted to do so to avoid a potential association with 
a recent report by an international historians commission that 
questioned waldheims moral integrity during his service as a 
lieutenant in the german army the commission also said waldheim 
was in close proximity to wartime atrocities 
but lichal a conservative backer of waldheim decreed the 
segment must remain in the film 
schaffer who is director of the prestigious national defense 
academy told the associated press he had tried to keep the dispute 
over waldheim out of the army 
but since it had proved impossible schaffer said he was 
resorting to the last means available to an officer and asking 
for early retirement 
under the austrian constitution waldheim is commanderinchief 
of the federal army 
word that the 58yearold general was stepping down from the 
officers training academy drew calls from the socialist party and 
the small freedom party for lichal to back down 
party bickering over the president should be kept out of the 
army the socialist and freedom parties said 
soon after the historians report was released feb 9 socialist 
officers in the army issued a statement calling on waldheim to 
resign 
the defense minister told a news conference friday that schaffer 
had asked to retire for health reasons and rejected all other 
suggestions about the generals departure 
the neue arbeiterzeitung said several unidentified officers had 
declared their solidarity with schaffer and one brigadier one of 
the 90 most senior army commanders had returned his membership 
card to the conservative peoples party

two men were arrested and a third was being 
questioned friday in the slaying of a rookie cop who was shot three 
times in the head as he guarded a witness in a drug case police 
said 
todd scott and scott cobb were charged with seconddegree murder 
and criminal possession of a weapon after their arrests late 
thursday according to police a third suspect surrendered friday 
and was being questioned police commissioner benjamin ward said at 
a news conference 
officer edward byrne 22 was shot early feb 26 while sitting 
in a patrol car guarding the house of a man who had complained to 
police about crack dealers in the south jamaica neighborhood of 
queens 
the killing outraged mayor edward koch who called president 
reagan a wimp in the war on drugs prompted a roundup of 294 
suspected drug dealers and focused new attention on the citys drug 
lords 
a reward fund grew to 130000 thursday with a 25000 
contribution from some members of the new york stock exchange 
city newspapers quoting unidentified sources said scott 
allegedly works for howard pappy mason an associate of reputed 
drug kingpin lorenzo fat cat nichols 
nichols 29 was sentenced feb 25 in queens to 25 years to life 
in prison on drug and gun charges and is awaiting trial on charges 
he had his parole officer killed for revenge mason is awaiting 
trial on charges he was one of the people who carried out that 
killing 
police have speculated that nichols may have ordered byrnes 
killing as retribution for his long sentence 
new york newsday reported friday that the killing was planned 
feb 24 the newspaper quoted police sources as saying that two men 
were approached by men from a nearby housing project and offered 
10000 to hit a cop 
this is from the fat cat the men said according to the 
newsday source and the two drew straws to decide who would pull 
the trigger 
an unidentified detective on the case told newsday that the 
killers twice went past the guarded house and each time they saw 
a black officer and they didnt kill 
they also passed by when a woman sat guard they were waiting 
for a cop like edward byrne who was white the detective daid 
however ward said friday i dont think there was anything 
racial about the assassination of officer eddie byrne 
officer edward byrne was killed because he wore a blue 
uniform said ward 
the rev thomas devita who presided at byrnes funeral monday 
said family members told him they plan to go to the home of the 
witness byrne was guarding to offer moral support 
i think i echo the feelings of others too that justice should 
be done said de vita 
the community has been very helpful ward said thursday 
adding he hoped the drug dealers learned a lesson 
shooting at cops its just bad for business i think 
experienced criminals know that perhaps these inexperienced ones 
will learn it the commissioner said

the hunt accompanied by dozens of calls from all over the dutch

the four republican presidential 
candidates focused on south carolina friday searching for support 
in the waning hours before a saturday primary described by 
frontrunner george bush as an allimportant super tuesday 
preview 
in the hours before the polls opened saturday morning the vice 
president said he was concerned that his lead in opinion polls 
might cause complacency by his supporters 
pat robertson answered questions for two hours on a radio 
callin show after complaining during a 30minute television ad 
thursday night of an effort to discredit me with antisouth 
antichristian bias he paid 75000 for the ad 
kansas sen bob dole campaigned with sen strom thurmond and 
former un ambassador jeane kirkpatrick at his side 
rep jack kemp scheduled appearances in three major cities 
greenville columbia and charleston 
all the gop candidates believe the south carolina primary on 
saturday will offer a preview of how the south is likely to vote 
three days later when 14 southern and border states hold primaries 
or caucuses 
this allimportant super tuesday preview was how bush 
described the saturday vote during an appearance before realtors in 
columbia that message from south carolina is going to shape 
events on super tuesday nd super tuesday is going to guarantee in 
my view whoever wins the nomination of the republican party 
later in beaufort he told reporters he was concerned about 
complacency polls indicate a sizeable lead for the vice president 
here and elsewhere in the south 
one of the reason were driving down to the wire with the 
intensity that we are is exactly that i cannot relax or neglect 
south carolina because things look fairly strong he said 
former television evangelist robertson used his paid broadcast 
thursday to try an reassure voters about his views of the 
separation of church and state 
i believe absolutely in the separation of church and state and 
i do not believe that the president of the united states should be 
subject to the orders or authority of any specific religious 
body he said 
the robertson ad was reminiscent of a tactic used successfully 
in north carolina in 1976 when supporters of ronald reagan bought 
television time to broadcast a speech by their candidate in his 
race against president gerald r ford 
that ad in which reagan raised the issue of the panama canal 
treaty was credited with giving the thengovernor of california 
his first primary victory over the incumbent president 
in personal appearances and in ads kemp was vowing not to turn 
the canal over to panama if strongman manuel noriega was still in 
power 
there is absolutely no way this country could allow that 
international waterway to fall into the hands of a dictator like 
noriega a drug smuggler like noriega said kemp

defense secretary frank c carlucci said 
friday he would strongly oppose any effort to carve out an active 
lawenforcement role for the military in the war on drugs 
that is not the function of the military we are not the 
frontline agency in the war on drugs carlucci said in an 
interview with the associated press 
espousing the same approach as his predecessor caspar w 
weinberger carlucci said he was very much against giving the 
military arrest authority or getting them into law enforcement 
and did not foresee any change in administration policy 
carlucci also called libyan strongman col moammar gadhafi a 
flyspeck who wasnt worth listening to and said he thought the 
us naval force in the persian gulf had been reduced to a proper 
level 
he predicted that a soviet pullout from afghanistan if it 
occurs would have little effect on the kremlins policies and its 
support of countries such as nicaragua 
carlucci also expressed hope that a meeting later this month 
with his soviet counterpart dmitri yazov would at the least 
produce an agreement on steps to avoid small but dangerous 
confrontations such a recent shipbumping incident in the black sea 
and interference with us military observers in east germany 
carlucci who assumed his post in november after weinberger 
retired was asked his views on drug enforcement after education 
secretary william bennett suggested the united states consider a 
broader use of military force against both the production and 
shipment of drugs 
sen bob dole who is seeking the republican presidential 
nomination adopted the same approach on thursday calling for use 
of the full force of our military 
the defense secretary countered the pentagon should continue to 
play only a supporting role in the war on drugs sharing equipment 
and intelligence because otherwise it would lose sight of its 
real mission 
my own view is that the military should be supportive 
he said but i would be very much against giving the military 
arrest authority or getting them into law enforcement 
carlucci reserved his most pointed rhetoric for libyas gadhafi 
who earlier this week demanded once again the united states 
recognize his claim to the gulf of sidra off the mediterranean sea 
the united states recognizes only the standard 12mile 
territorial limit in the gulf us and libyan forces clashed in 
march 1986 after the navy ignored gadhafis line of death in 
the gulf and a month later us jets bombed libya in retaliation 
for libyas alleged involvement in international terrorism 
i think gadhafis a flyspeck carlucci said i dont think 
hes worth paying attention to were certainly not dancing to his 
tune 
carlucci refused to say whether the united states was planning 
any additional naval maneuvers in the gulf but added if your 
question is are we going ahead with the freedom of navigation 
program yeah were going ahead with that program around the world 
based on our schedule 
the defense secretary said he was satisfied with the state of 
us forces in the persian gulf where american ships have been 
protecting reflagged kuwaiti tankers against iranian attack since 
last july the navy fleet was recently reduced in size with a 
battleship and helicopter carrier sailing for home 
we are now on our 39th convoy 38 of which have been without 
incident carlucci said and i think that record speaks for 
itself weve obviously got the capability over there that we 
need 
turning to his march 14 meeting with yazov in bern switzerland 
the first such working session between the us and soviet 
defense chiefs carlucci predicted the talks would focus on 
avoiding dangerous activities or confrontations between small 
military units arms control and human rights soviet defense 
doctrine and planning for meetings of topranking military 
officers 
in the area of what we call dangerous activities i would hope 
that we can reach some meeting of the minds at least set up a 
process so that they can be avoided carlucci said 
the soviets he added are unlikely to change any of their 
military policies as a result of their setbacks in afghanistan 
where they are fighting ussupported rebels 
i guess people have in mind the vietnam analogy carlucci 
said i dont think it works the same way in their system the 
soviet military and the soviet people dont have access to the same 
amount of information that we have in our society 
asked about the huge military buildup during president reagans 
first term when he was weinbergers deputy carlucci said he 
wouldnt secondguess the pace or manner in which those increases 
were pursued 
while political support for the buildup has evaporated forcing 
budget cuts for three years running we could have well have 
ended up with less if the spending hikes had been sought on a 
more gradual basis he said

secretary of state george p shultz said 
friday he has given israel and three arab countries an 
ambitious us proposal for middle east peace talks and 
requested a response within 10 days 
under the plan israel would negotiate with a joint delegation 
of jordanians and palestinians over the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip israel also would negotiate with syria over the golan 
heights 
israel captured the golan heights in the 1967 middle east war 
part of it was returned to syria under a 1974 military 
disengagement agreement and in december 1981 israel annexed the 
portion remaining in its hands 
shultz said both israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir and 
foreign minister shimon peres were willing to negotiate over the 
territory 
egypt was the third arab country to get the us proposal from 
shultz but it would not be involved directly in negotiations 
egypt and israel signed a peace treaty in 1979 and except for the 
small enclave taba they have no territorial disputes 
there is an attitude of a readiness to work to change things 
that should be taken advantage of by everybody shultz said 
the moment can be lost 
he cast the us proposal for talks on an overall settlement of 
the 40year arabisraeli dispute in the form of identical letters 
to king hussein of jordan and to shamir with a copy to peres 
other versions were submitted to president hafez assad of syria and 
to egyptian president hosni mubarak 
in damascus syrian presidential spokesman jibran kourieh said 
after the 2hour meeting that shultz handed assad a written 
message from president ronald reagan containing the american 
proposal for a comprehensive settlement in the region 
shultz explained the contents of the letter to president assad 
and during their discussion president assad expressed several 
remarks on the letter kourieh added 
after the meeting at the downtown muhajerine presidential 
palace shultz left for the aiport and took off for cairo at 730 
pm shultz was expected back in washington early saturaday 
earlier a us official said shamir and hussein had not 
commented on the letter 
shultz did not get a yes or no from either of them the 
official said as shultz stopped in damascus for talks with assad 
the proposal calls for negotiations to open in early april to 
provide some selfrule for 15 million palestinian arabs who live 
in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza 
negotiations for an overall middle east settlement would be held 
by december 
the occupied territories have been marked by violence for nearly 
three months and scores of palestinians have died in clashes with 
israeli troops 
shamir is expected to give his response to the us proposals 
when he visits washington on march 1416 for talks with president 
reagan and shultz 
hussein who has denounced the reagan adminstration as 
hopelessly onesided toward israel has kept away from washington 
jordans response is expected to go through diplomatic channels 
we believe that things have begun to move peres said as he 
saw shultz off for damascus 
not that everything that was difficult disappeared he added 
the foreign minister has been far more inclined to accept 
shultzs plan than shamir the prime minister objects among other 
things to the us concept of israel trading land in exchange for 
arab acceptance of israels right to exist 
shultz met separately with shamir and peres the two main forces 
in a divided israeli government 
hussein meanwhile has sought to gain a seat at the peace table 
for the palestine liberation organization which the united states 
and israel brand a terrorist group 
police on friday discovered a car bomb set on a street about 300 
yards from the hilton hotel in jerusalem where shultz was staying 
and safely dismantled the explosives 
the palestine liberation organization released a statement in 
west beirut claiming responsibility for the bomb and said shultz 
was the target 
police said the intent may have been to carry out an attack in a 
commercial center of jerusalem to protest shultzs visit 
no arrests were reported

the navy awarded a jamaicanborn jet engine 
mechanic 27500 on friday for suggesting a repair procedure that 
is now saving the government 11 million a year 
winston edwards 34 received the check and a commendation 
signed by president reagan during ceremonies hosted by vice adm 
joseph b wilkenson jr the head of the naval air systems command 
edwards a civilian mechanic at the alameda naval aviation depot 
in california previously had received 7500 under the beneficial 
suggestion awards program for prodding his local depot and the 
command to make the change in repair and overhaul procedures 
the additional money presented friday recognizes the high annual 
savings now accruing to the government since edwards suggestion 
was applied throughout the military system 
the combined award of 35000 is the highest cash award that 
can be given to a civilian employees under the beneficial 
suggestion awards program the navy said 
edwards who left jamaica at the age of 11 works as a jet 
engine repairman at the alameda depot his campaign to save money 
began when he suggested to his superiors that instead of just 
throwing out combustion engine liners during overhauls of tf34 
engines the navy could take two bad liners and fashion one good 
one 
the tf34 engine is used to power the navys s3 viking 
subhunting plane and the air forces a10 thunderbolt 
groundattack jet each engine liner costs about 18660 new the 
alameda depot overhauls about 500 tf34 engines every year 
edwards originally suggested the change in overhaul procedures 
in 1981 after a day at work during which he threw away 10 of the 
liners the navy wasnt that impressed however and turned down 
the idea 
edwards persisted however and in 1985 the navy decided to give 
it a try 
according to the service each of the combustion engine liners 
has 18 swirlers parts that mix and atomize the fuel and air 
needed for combustion under the old practice if any of the 
swirlers inside a liner were cracked when the engine came in for 
overhaul the entire combustion liner was simply replaced 
using edwards suggestion the navy and air force now salvage 
enough good swirlers from two bad liners to combine them into one 
good spare

the 21yearold defendant in what has been 
dubbed the preppie murder trial peered through trees on a damp 
gray friday morning as the jurors in his case tramped over the 
central park ground where he left a young woman dead 
robert chambers 21 charged with seconddegree murder in the 
death of jennifer levin sat in the back of a gray car about 40 
yards from where her bruised nearly naked body was found aug 26 
1986 
it was a different vantage point from the low wall behind the 
metropolitan museum of art where he sat as police investigated the 
death shortly after miss levins body was discovered by a passing 
bicyclist chambers admits killing her but says it was an accident 
after she attacked him sexually and hurt him 
the cold damp ground around the tree where the body was found 
was bare and the tree was stripped of leaves a contrast to the 
green grass and foliage in the park on the warm summer morning when 
miss levin was killed 
the jurors walked over to examine the areas where the victims 
body and panties were found and where several police officers 
testified they had seen a ground disturbance suggesting a body had 
been dragged 
fifty reporters and photographers and a few onlookers watched 
the proceeding from a distance kept away by a yellow police ribbon 
the trip came a day after a prosecutor testified he was not 
trying to trick chambers by saying police had not found miss 
levins underpants in the park when in fact they had 
in a videotaped interview assistant district attorney stephen 
saracco is heard telling chambers that his account of how he killed 
miss levin does not make sense in part because no panties were 
found 
chambers lawyer jack litman has suggested that saracco tried 
to trick his client by lying to him 
chambers and miss levin 18 went to the park after meeting in 
an east side bar frequented by children of privilege both had 
attended prep schools miss levin was collegebound while chambers 
was a college dropout 
chambers says the young woman tied his hands behind his back 
with her panties sat on his chest facing his feet and grabbed his 
genitals painfully he says he freed his hands threw the panties 
over his head and reached up with his left forearm and yanked 
against her throat flipping her off him 
detective michael sheehan testified early in the 9weekold 
trial that another investigator passed saracco a note during the 
videotaping to tell him the panties were found he said they were 
recovered some 45 feet from the body 
do you remember a note being put in front of you defense 
lawyer jack litman asked saracco 
i dont recall a note if there was one saracco said i 
dont know if there was a note

the plo claimed responsibility for a car packed 
with explosives that was found near a hotel where secretary of 
state george p shultz was staying the guerrilla group said shultz 
was the target 
police who defused the bomb safely said the car had been found 
accidentally after it was abandoned by its driver there were no 
reports of arrests 
a us embassy spokesman said the bomb was well off the route 
the secretary took from the hotel to israeli government offices 
but yasser arafats mainstream palestinian guerrilla group 
fatah said in a statement in beirut that the driver had an 
accident and the car crashed into a power pole about 30 minutes 
before the time set for the bomb to explode 
the driver deserted the vehicle and managed to escape the 
communique said 
in a communique telephoned to the associated press office in 
west beirut fatah said its military command instructed the 
limassol martyrs group to park a bombladen car in front of the 
hilton hotel in jerusalem targeting shultz the messenger of 
imperial yehudai said later 
the chief police explosives expert passed by and through his own 
experience decided the car was indeed suspicious we found it 
was a car bomb 
the car carried israeli license plates with a sticker reading 
contribute to security 
israel television quoted police officials as saying the car was 
sold to an arab who apparently used a fake identity card 
the car was found less than a quartermile from the hotel where 
shultz spent thursday night 
three officials of arafats palestine liberation organization 
were killed in a car bomb explosion in the cypriot port of limassol

it said the attack was meant to be a response to the zionists 
brutality against our people in the occupied territories 
we warn shultz and all agents of imperialism against reaching 
out for the plo the sole legitimate representative of the 
palestinian people the communique added 
it was the second report of a car bomb in two days on thursday 
one exploded outside the bus station of kfar saba a town in

the ranking republican on the house foreign 
affairs committee on friday called for a protest to the soviet 
union while the state department sought to minimize the 
significance of its statement on microwave beams aimed at the us 
embassy in moscow 
rep william s broomfield of michigan said secretary of state 
george p shultz should lodge an official protest over the 
continuing presence of lowlevel microwave beams aimed at the 
embassy 
how can we trust the soviets to honor sensitive arms reduction 
agreements if they are technically attacking our embassy 
building broomfield said trust is an essential part of 
improving relations with the ussr harassing our diplomats there 
is unacceptable 
he added i want the state department to play hardball this 
time and protest this clear abuse of our fellow citizens serving 
in moscow 
in a statement released thursday in response to questions 
submitted by the associated press the state departments bureau of 
diplomatic security said microwave signals in the 511 ghz 
gigahertz range continue to be detected at the moscow embassy 
chancery 
the microwave signal power levels are typically 01 microwatt 
per square centimeter external to the building it said 
measurements internal to the building are typically less than 
001 microwatt per square centimeter 
the current us voluntary safety standard for exposure to 
microwave radiation set by the american national standards 
institute is 5000 microwatts per square centimeter by contrast 
the soviet unions official safety standard for the microwave 
frequency range is much lower 10 microwatts per square centimeter 
the statement thursday said the department could shed no light 
as to why microwaves have been aimed against the embassy for 
perhaps as far back as october 1953 it said any response would 
be speculation 
at a news briefing friday state department spokeswoman phyllis 
oakley emphasized the low power levels of the soviet signals 
currently being detected at the embassy and denied that the 
situation amounts to bombardment 
the soviets have not resumed microwave bombardment she 
said we have routinely detected some very lowlevel microwave 
activity in our ongoing continuous microwave screening at the 
embassy there are no known risks from the type of low levels 
of exposure in moscow that have continued 
we are of course concerned about this situation mrs 
oakley continued in the past weve protested when levels have 
exceeded those we consider safe were prepared to do so again 
should we determine that they pose any threat whatsoever to our 
staff however remote 
she added what were saying is that there is not a new 
program of bombardment we have watched the situation carefully we 
continue to watch it carefully there have been low levels that we 
have detected but these pose no risk

the state department has denied a visa to 
gerry adams head of the irish republican armys legal political 
wing based on the belief that he is involved in terrorist 
activity a spokeswoman said thursday 
he was ineligible under the section of the immigration and 
nationality act which excludes from admission to the us people 
who are personally involved with terrorist activities said state 
department spokeswoman donna sherman 
asked to specify the activities sherman said our information 
is that as president of the provisional sinn fein mr adams is 
personally and publicly committed to and abets the armed struggle 
in northern ireland and its on that basis he was denied a visa 
the ira is fighting to end british rule in northern ireland and 
is outlawed on both sides of the border although sinn fein is 
legal 
adams had said on his application that he wished to travel to 
the united states for political work sherman said 
martin galvin a spokesman for the irish northern aid committee 
said in a mailgram to the associated press that his group was 
outraged by the state departments action and blamed it on 
pressure from britain 
we regard the continuing denial of a visa to mr adams as 
censorship by visa denial galvin wrote 
the committee also known as noraid charged that the state 
department was refusing to comply with the spirit and letter of 
the new visa provisions 
noraid claims to aid the victims of strife between protestants 
and roman catholics but the us irish and british governments 
accuse it of helping finance ira operations 
sen daniel p moynihan dny and rep barney frank dmass 
introduced an amendment last year which overturned that portion of 
the mccarran walter act which had allowed the us government to 
deny visas to aliens who participate in political activities in 
their native countries which would be legal for us citizens in 
the united states 
however sherman said adams was denied a visa based on another 
part of the law that she said explicitly preserves the 
authority of the executive branch to deny a visa to someone who is 
involved in terrorist activity 
this was at least the third time that adams who is also a 
member of british parliament has been denied a visa to the united 
states earlier rebuffs occurred in june 1986 and february 1985 
sherman said 
in july 1986 canada denied adams entry because he had been 
convicted of attempting to escape from prison in 1974 after being 
held for two years under emergency powers 
adams had been trying to reach canada after being denied a us 
visa to address a conference of irishamericans in buffalo ny

werent libeled by an xrated film in which actors wore the 
departments uniforms a state appeals court ruled thursday 
ten past or present fairfax officers including a policewoman 
had sued the filmmaker distributor and a magazine that had carried 
a publicity photo from the film for libel invasion of privacy and 
emotional distress they sought 240 million 
but the appeals court upholding a lowercourt decision said in 
a 30 ruling that there was no intent to portray actual fairfax 
police officers and no danger that the public would confuse the 
actors with the real officers 
the film nightlife made in 1983 by a nowdefunct 
filmmaker included a segment in which two policemen agree not to 
arrest two prostitutes in exchange for sex 
actors wore surplus fairfax calif police uniforms from a 
costume store in san francisco the appeals court said 
the film did not identify the location of fairfax at a time when 
there were at least six fairfax police departments in various 
states the court said 
the court also noted that between 90 and 105 people had been 
authorized to wear the shoulder patch of the fairfax calif 
police

ten years after the federal government forced a 
change in the stuff that makes liquid spew out of aerosol cans 
some environmentalists are worrying that it was simply a matter of 
swapping one evil for another 
in a sense we did said lon burnam clean air consultant for 
the sierra club in dallas but you can easily make the argument 
that the one that we went to is less harmful than the one that we 
left 
most of todays aerosol products are pushed out of the can by 
hydrocarbons a propellant that gained wide use when a government 
ban on chlorofluorocarbons went into effect in march 1978 
the order to remove cfcs from most aerosols came after 
scientists found the propellants might be reaching the upper 
atmosphere and thinning the ozone layer that shields people and 
plants from the suns potentially harmful ultraviolet rays 
the hydrocarbons that replaced cfcs help form ozone but close 
to the ground where it contributes to the smoggy haze that scores 
of cities are struggling to combat extended exposure is known to 
cause or aggravate respiratory problems 
although hydrocarbons are found in much greater concentrations 
in vehicle exhaust and industrial emissions some officials under 
pressure to clear the air are looking at limiting the use of 
aerosols 
were beginning to run out of things we can do in the 
industrial sector weve also already done quite a bit with the 
automobile said les montgomery director of regulation 
development for the texas air control board consumer areas are 
getting to be the remaining area that we havent done too much in 
new york city officials for instance are seeking the aerosol 
industrys cooperation in reducing the hydrocarbons given off by 
air fresheners and spray pesticides 
well be asking manufacturers by a specified date to submit 
their own plan for reducing the ozonecreating pollutants in their 
products said rw groneman a spokesman for the new york state 
department of environmental conservation 
new york officials expect to propose the regulations by early 
april new jersey officials are keeping tabs on the effort 
groneman said 
but the aerosol industry has been opposed to further regulation 
after its experience with the fluorocarbon ban the biggest 
thing to hit the industry in the 1970s according to evelyne 
mcfeaters of the chemical specialties manufacturers association 
the group represents about 400 makers of household products 
the ban cost the industry 1 billion to retool ms 
mcfeaters said with this proposal wed be seeing an even 
greater cost theyre talking about potentially billions of 
dollars the hydrocarbon propellants are the major propellants in 
use 
last fall the texas air control board proposed a ban on most 
aerosols in dallas and neighboring fort worth one of 14 
metropolitan areas trying to develop air quality regulations 
acceptable to the us environmental protection agency 
the 14 metro areas have been found by epa to be in violation of 
clean air act standards but they won reprieves from federal 
sanctions now their plans for reducing levels of ozone and other 
pollutants are to take effect aug 31 
under the proposed dallasfort worth ban state officials wanted 
different propellants used or wanted stores to clear their shelves 
of the hydrocarbon aerosol products ranging from hair spray to 
insecticides and paint 
the ban on socalled volatile organic compounds eventually was 
scrapped because of opposition from consumers retailers and the 
aerosol industry the industry association estimated the ban could 
have cost the area more than 77 million annually in sales 
besides consumers probably would have skirted the ban by 
driving to neighboring counties to buy aerosols said ralph engel 
president of the chemical specialties manufacturing association 
aerosol manufacturers are skeptical about substitute propellants 
suggested to take the place of hydrocarbons 
many of the possible substitutes could actually increase the 
amount of voc volatile organic compounds in the air ms 
mcfeaters said 
one nonaerosol alternative is the pump spray 
i would think people prefer aerosols to pump sprays because of 
the extra effort involved in using a pump said jim may a 
spokesman for sc johnson and co but the racine wisbased 
company had no research on consumer acceptance of pumpspray 
products 
the company known for its johnsons wax products uses 
hydrocarbons most often propane and butane in more than 90 
percent of its products may said 
montgomery of the texas air control board says he recognizes an 
aerosol ban would be difficult to enforce 
it would need to be a national thing he said its 
unlikely to expect that a major corporation with a national or 
international market is going to reformulate its propellant just 
for the dallasfort worth market 
but burnam noted that automakers have accommodated californias 
stricter air pollution laws by offering cleaneroperating versions 
of their cars in that state 
its not only practical but a reasonable thing to do he 
said of banning aerosols theres a whole range of products that 
are a waste of the consumers dollar and are counterproductive to 
healthy living 
besides aerosol air fresheners and cleaning products the 
proposed texas ban also would have limited solvents used in house 
and car paints as well as other products that give off fumes 
montgomery expected similar proposed limits on consumer products 
may become more widespread 
if the current federal cleanair act requirements keep driving 
areas to try to work on this ozone problem and as we run out of 
other things i guess its a type of control that other areas may 
look at

nestled in the lush jungles of the hawaiian 
islands is a multibilliondollar industry that the local growers 
protect the government destroys the vistors bureau rarely 
mentions and tourists often overlook on secluded mountain trails 
it is marijuana and despite the governments best efforts to 
eradicate it the states largest cash crop continues to flourish 
and enjoy the reputation as some of the best pakalolo in the 
world 
the government destroys more pot plants here than anywhere else 
in the united states but still the crop thrives nurtured by 
yearround nearperfect growing conditions 
a prayer goes into the ground with every plant said roger 
christie spokesman for the marijuana political action committee in 
hilo and a member of the cambridge massbased cannabis corp 
these islands are a magic place for growing pakololo the sun 
the rain the energy of the volcano all combine to create the right 
conditions 
the islands light misty rain which was considered a blessing 
by ancient hawaiians is also a boon to pot growers christie said 
adding that the yearround sunshine is rarely intense enough to 
scorch the plants 
oh the stuff here is definitely legendary said george 
auflick agent in charge at the drug enforcement agency here 
hawaii pot is so highly prized that a lot of growers from other 
pacific islands ship their stuff to honolulu first just so it can 
go to the mainland with a hawaii postmark its just got sort of a 
mythical reputation 
that reputation is reflected in the price auflick said locally 
grown marijuana goes for about 150 an ounce on the islands he 
said but on the mainland what is known as maui wowie kona gold 
and puna butter sells for about 300 to 500 an ounce with the 
highest prices on the east coast in comparison an ounce of 
mexican or californian marijuana fetches 60 an ounce in los 
angeles with colombian selling for about 200 an ounce according 
to the narcotics division of the los angeles police department 
prices here rise after each big raid and lately the going rate 
has been steep that pleases capt richard carter the head of the 
criminal investigation unit of the police department on the big 
island of hawaii where an estimated 66 percent of the states 
crop is grown 
every time the price goes up that means there is less of it 
around carter said and that means were doing our job 
law enforcement officials say marijuana harms the younger 
population that has grown up with it and creates crime and violence 
in 1987 125 million marijuana plants and 752 pounds of dried 
pot were seized on the big island alone carter said each plant is 
considered to be worth 1000 which means more than 12 billion 
worth of marijuana was recovered last year on the big island alone 
authorities figure about 18 million plants were destroyed 
throughout the state but for every plant destroyed two or three 
were left to flourish carter said 
they the growers know we cant get to it all carter said 
so they sort of plant some for us and some for them but lately 
weve been getting to a lot of the stuff theyd thought theyd 
hidden 
the department patrols wellknown growing areas daily carter 
said but operation green harvest is the departments 
twiceayear allout effort to get rid of the crop coinciding with 
the major harvesting times the joint effort between the local 
police and national guard has all the makings of a hollywood movie 
helicopters swoop over acres of green fields carrying specially 
trained officers when a sizable marijuana crop is spotted the 
cops rush into the fields armed with machetes and leave a swath 
of destruction carter said some officers even rappel down from 
the helicopters into hardtoreach mountainside gardens and 
police have a new weapon diesel oil which is even more 
efficient he said sprayed on crops it destroys them roots and 
all he said 
arrests are infrequent during operation green harvest 
carter said because the whirring helicopters warn growers of the 
impending raid 
the authorities increased efficiency has forced growers to be 
more careful about camouflaging their crops scattering them with 
as few as 25 plants to a patch or planting under the leafy canopy 
of ohia trees or in remote canyons or rocky mountainsides 
still many growers are not secretive at all and plant 
marijuana at the edge of papaya or sugar cane fields carter said 
that kind of defiance has some officials on the mainland worried 
about whether hawaii law enforcement officials are really doing all 
they can to rid the state of a drug trade that is said to bring in 
more than 4 billion a year second only to the tourist industry 
the issue got national attention recently after rep charles 
rangel the chairman of the us house select committee on 
narcotics abuse and control released a report claiming that the 
drug trade in hawaii was a major industry that had bought influence 
in the state government 
local reaction to the new york democrats allegations was swift 
and angry with rep daniel akaka dhawaii calling rangels 
contentions unjustifiable after the outcry the committee agreed 
to hold hearings on the issue in hawaii this spring 
anybody who lives here unless they have their head in the 
sand knows we have a drug problem but were doing everything we 
can to fight it said carolyn tanaka press secretary to hawaii 
gov john waihee 
illegal cultivation brings a lot of money to the growers but 
not to the state in general she said adding we dont care 
how much money marijuana would bring in trying to legalize it just 
so it can be taxed is out of the question 
but the marijuana pacs christie who is leading a drive to 
legalize marijuana for medical use in hawaii said the state is 
giving up a valuable source of revenue in its zeal to dictate 
the public morality a derivative of marijuana has been used to 
relieve some side effects of chemotherapy in cancer patients 
eradication of marijuana is not an issue of the government 
caring for the people christie said if that were the issue 
theyd ban the shot glass and the beer mug 
he said marijuana can be used to make rope paper and canvas 
the best efforts of local state and federal law enforcement 
officials will not stop the marijuana farmers christie said 
backyard growers with just a few plants can make up to 20000 a 
year he said while those with larger plots rake in 80000 and up 
annually 
the bottom line is that more people than ever want the 
stuff he said and there is plenty of it here

mister rogers is introducing his young viewers 
to a new neighbor this week and hed like nothing more than for 
everyone to be friends 
the land is the soviet union which he visited last year as a 
guest on moscows good night little ones the neighbor is 
tatiana vedeneeva the soviet television programs host who 
subsequently dropped by mister rogers neighborhood 
the aim both say is to foster a better understanding between 
the two countries through the eyes and ears of the young 
thats the goal of the neighborhood anyway to be able to 
understand and care for yourself better and as you understand and 
care for yourself you look through understanding eyes at your 
neighbor said fred rogers creator and host of mister rogers 
neighborhood 
just like children grow little by little one increment after 
another thats the way human beings grow i think that thats the 
way countries grow in trust just one step at a time he 
explained with the same gentleness that has become his onscreen 
trademark 
this exchange of pintsized culture a year in the making could 
turn those steps into leaps according to rogers and vedeneeva an 
inspired rogers in fact is considering trips to other countries 
even though they children are tiny its a big bridge 
vedeneeva said during her november visit to pittsburghs wqedtv 
home of mister rogers neighborhood for the past 20 years 
rogers visit to good night little ones last september will 
be aired by the public broadcasting service on tuesday the show 
includes street scenes of moscow 
even though i cant see those people right now i can think 
about them and know that theyre somewhere rogers tells his 
viewers and theyre not pretend theyre real just like you 
even though youre not in this room on this couch with me youre 
somewhere and youre real 
ms vedeneevas visit to mister rogers neighborhood will be 
shown thursday rogers greets her with a song he composed just for 
the occasion 
we would like to welcome you its good to be in touch we 
would like to welcome you our friendship means so much he 
sings accompanying himself at the piano 
the message of this weeks programs according to rogers is 
that children in the soviet union start out as babies and get to 
be toddlers and get to be preschoolers and schoolage children 
just like children here 
its also trying to demonstrate that adults throughout the 
world care for children and that people as far away as the soviet 
union have tender feelings about their children just the way 
americans do he said 
for vedeneeva the similarities are just as striking 
our children love the same thing as your children love to 
do she said in russian they would love to get acquainted with 
american children and especially with mister rogers 
soviet children last december got their first glimpse of the 
cardigan and sneakersclad rogers the first guest ever to appear 
on ms vedeneevas nightly 15minute show the broadcast coincided 
with soviet leader mikhail gorbachevs summit meeting with 
president reagan 
except for a few words of russian the 59yearold rogers spoke 
english on the soviet set still he managed to master one phrase 
that he repeated again and again to the many children he met 
boodish li ti moy sawsed or wont you be my neighbor 
ms vedeneeva who speaks little english was assisted by a 
translator for mister rogers neighborhood the interpreter 
figures prominently on thursdays show narrating a segment showing 
how russian matrouska dolls are made 
i dont think weve ever had an interpreter on the set so 
that could help children see what thats like rogers said 
rogers was accompanied to moscow by hand puppets daniel tiger 
and x the owl vedeneeva made her first journey to the united 
states with stepashka the rabbit and xrysha the pig 
the puppets kukli in russian seemed to have as much fun as 
their creators daniel tiger and xrysha the pig in fact shared a 
shy smooch in moscow 
oooh youre such a big pig a bolshoi pig daniel tiger 
told xrysha i like you 
stepashka however seemed to put it best 
girls and boys were going to be your good neighbors it 
means good friends too the rabbit said before leaving mister 
rogers neighborhood 
goodbye it said waving at the cameras i love you

the white house business groups and some 
political office seekers such as george bush just wont let go of 
the matter and so it is seems destined to grow into a major issue 
issues are created by differences of opinion strongly held and 
on this there are many opinions it is controversial debatable 
emotional it can be construed as a battle of haves versus 
havenots rich vs poor 
the question should the capital gains tax which was raised in 
the tax reform act of 1986 be reduced perhaps to a rate even 
lower than before 
central to the issue is another question can revenues be raised 
by cutting the capital gains tax as the white house and bush 
suggest 
backers of a cut cite the us treasurys own statistics in 
support of their view they point to steady increases in revenues 
since the tax was cut from 49 percent to 28 percent in 1979 and 
then to 20 percent in 1981 
in 1978 when the 49 percent maximum rate was still in effect 
tax revenue amounted to 91 billion in 1984 latest year for 
which figures are available the total was 196 billion 
sharp as these statistical differences are some critics 
maintain they are not as significant as they seem stock market 
prices they point out have risen sharply over the years they say 
it is this that accounts for the rise 
why should lower taxes raise revenues because say defenders of 
a lower tax those taxpayers with capital gains wouldnt be afraid 
to take them until those gains are realized they observe uncle 
sam gets nothing at all 
the crux of their argument is that those with big gains in 
securities or other investments including housing decline to sell 
because of the 28 percent tax liability if it were half that they 
say sellers would be more active 
they contend that while this added activity would be taxed at a 
relatively lower rate the government would earn more revenue 
because of the greater volume estimates vary but conceivably 
these gains could be sizable 
david burton of the us chamber of commerce estimates a 
reduction to 15 percent would produce at least 35 billion more 
each year harvard economist lawrence lindsey puts the added 
revenue at 31 billion over three years 
one of the most formidable arguments against the reduction is 
that it might produce a spurt of selling in the first couple of 
years but that the benefits to uncle sam would be decidedly less 
dramatic after that 
in short say these critics the cut itself rather than the rate 
of tax is the important thing they agree that many taxpayers would 
take advantage of the cut to take postponed capital gains but that 
afterward the impact would erode 
defenders also contend that the country not just those with 
capital gains needs lower rates in order to spur investment in 
new businesses new jobs and new technology which of course 
would enlarge the revenueproducing sector 
they indicate that as matters stand a goodly amount of potential 
venture capital is tied up in old enterprises left there by owners 
who cannot afford to pay or who choose to defer paying the 
taxes that would become due 
potentially the hottest dispute of all is the contention that a 
lower capital gains tax benefits the rich and does very little at 
least immediately for the poor it could be a dispute loaded with 
more passion than content 
prof lindsey states that 80 percent of the 31 billion he 
refers to would be paid by taxpayers with incomes greater than 
100000 inherent in that statement however is that most of the 
tax benefits would go to them also 
the subject is at the heart of at least two bills in congress 
over the next few months it could become a political hot potato

just when the winds blowing from the 
soviet union bring the refreshing possibility of greater openness 
and reform hungarians find their oncevaunted economy faltering 
the government is warning them to expect a decline in living 
standards regarded as the best in the east bloc 
all that combined with uncertainty over the tenure of the 
75yearold communist party leader janos kadar is leaving 
hungarians in a bleak and wary mood 
yet the outward signs of economic trouble are few in this 
lovely capital on the danube shops along the glittering vaci 
pedestrian mall are wellstocked and bustling traffic clamors 
along the old chain bridge with bmws and hondas vying with 
sovietmade fiats and czech skodas and women are dressed in 
stylish furs 
its only in the windows said a budapest businessman 
scratch beneath the surface he added and it becomes apparent 
that times are getting harder 
a government austerity program took effect jan 1 imposing the 
east blocs first personal income tax and valueadded tax in 
addition the government says inflation could rise from last years 
8 to 9 percent to 15 percent this year which would make it the 
worst in the countrys postwar history 
compared to some nations in eastern europe hungary remains an 
island of prosperity and economic stability poland is expecting 
inflation of 40 to 45 percent this year inflation in yugoslavia 
reached 170 percent this past fall 
but hungarys economic woes arose over the last few years with 
breathtaking suddenness one party member said therefore we 
are bitter 
the threeyear program of consolidation as the austerity 
measures are called is intended to raise revenues to bridge 
yawning government deficits caused largely by huge subsidies to 
moneylosing industries 
the government plans to phase out unprofitable factories 
raising fears of increasing unemployment some analysts say the 
jobless total could rise from 10000 02 percent today to 200000 
33 percent of the 6millionmember work force 
hungary borrowed in the 1970s to build heavy industry now its 
106 million people are burdened with a gross hard currency debt of 
16 billion the highest per capita in the soviet bloc 
on the positive side exports to the west in 1987 were up 13 
percent to 508 billion and tourism boomed with more than 18 
million people visiting the country hungarys statedominated 
agriculture continues to produce more than the country can consume 
the austerity program is the work of 57yearold prime minister 
karoly grosz who took over government administration in july 
since then he has discussed hungarys problems with a frankness 
that surprised many of his countrymen 
acknowledging calls for greater democratization a communist 
party committee has promulgated a set of theses on political 
reforms and the partys leading role which has been presented 
to basic party cells and is to be put before a central committee 
meeting 
if approved the proposals would probably be forwarded to the 
first national party conference since 1957 which a party source 
said is expected early in june 
the theses generally endorse greater consultation between the 
party and the population more open debate in the party and a 
retreat from daytoday party involvement in the government 
diplomats said the theses appear to generate little enthusiasm 
members of the unofficial opposition said they are disappointed by 
the proposals calling them too vague to bring substantial change 
there are many words about the necessity of political reform 
but i am afraid that the speeches are not so sincere said gyorgy 
gado an opposition writer i am afraid they havent the courage 
to make the necessary changes 
meanwhile the question on everybodys mind is whether kadar 
will retire and who will take his place as head of the party a 
senior western diplomat said 
behindthescenes jockeying for position is practically 
paralyzing the government the diplomat added nobody does 
anything except politics right now 
grosz is considered the leading candidate and the favorite of 
the soviets even though his relations with party regulars and the 
coterie around kadar appear strained said the diplomat speaking 
only on condition of anonymity 
also mentioned as possible successors are chief party ideologist 
janos berecz and as a darkhorse imre pozsgay the leader of the 
national unity peoples patriotic front who advocates more 
dialogue with groups outside the party 
kadar has been at the helm of the party since the soviet 
suppression of the 1956 hungarian revolution described variously 
by diplomats in budapest as a wily old fox and a declining 
king surrounded by courtiers he has given no known indication 
that he will step aside 
but sources in and outside the party said kadar increasingly is 
out of touch with economic problems and is an obstacle to political 
reform 
he has not been a bad dictator even if you disagreed with him 
you could work said a party member now people want results 
people feel as long as hes in power no real changes can 
happen said ferenc koszeg editor of the illegal magazine 
beszelo talker 
and the public mood 
very gloomy said the diplomat compared to a year ago 
the situation is closer to instability although i still believe 
its less than a 5050 chance 
said koszeg people are so disappointed that they dont 
believe anybody any longer this is an important handicap both for 
the government and the opposition

star wars and raiders of the lost ark 
made harrison ford one of americas top box office draws but the 
actor says both he and his audience are maturing 
im not an ingenue anymore the 45yearold actor said 
his most recent effort leaves han solo and indiana jones in 
hyperspace in the justreleased roman polanski thriller 
frantic fords cocksure quality disappears as he portrays a 
bespectacled father and husband caught in a situation beyond his 
control 
it follows witness and the mosquito coast two other 
movies where ford shucked invulnerability for more complex and 
sensitive roles in his next film the mike nichols comedy 
working girls he has a cary granttype part 
im not trying to make a transition into a different kind of 
persona i do whatever i think is appropriate for that character to 
tell the story he said during a recent interview 
but this is also related to growing older he said 
fingering his reading glasses in his right hand i mean star 
wars was almost 15 years ago i am 15 years older theres no 
sense denying it in fact i revel in it ive been more interested 
in those characters that are more mature 
in frantic ford grows more uncomfortable in every scene he 
plays a california heart surgeon at a medical conference in paris 
terrorists kidnap his wife but police and us officials believe 
she willingly left him he meets a sensuous young french woman who 
provides clues to the abduction and joins him in a struggle to find 
his wife 
the whole thing depends on this doctor this fish out of 
water reaching this emotional exhaustion where he does things 
that are well outside of his nature and experience said ford 
a concern for his reallife wifes safety led ford to paris 
polanski and the part he accompanied his pregnant wife 
screenwriter melissa mathison et to meetings in paris on 
an another project with polanski the director of tess 
chinatown and rosemarys baby 
after the first few days roman described the film to me and 
it sounded interesting ford said 
the script was in french a language the actor does not speak 
roman stood up and for two hours he told me the movie ford 
said he played all the parts and he was great when it was 
over i said if youll right that down in english ill do it 
ford calls himself monomaniacal during filming but always 
returns to his ranch in wyoming to go grocery shopping pick up 
the laundry work on the fence plow the snow read a little fish 
a little and go crosscountry skiing 
wyoming is now home for ford he was raised in a suburban 
chicago went to school at ripon college in wisconsin and struggled 
as an actor and carpenter in southern california star wars 
gave him the success and security to buy the ranch and spend some 
time there 
i wouldnt be able to do it acting if i wasnt able to get 
back when it was over he said 
his current project is working girls a comedy set in new 
york about a secretary who fights to retrieve an idea from a boss 
who has claimed credit for it 
one of the pleasures of this comedy is that its a relatively 
smaller part said ford who called the last two pictures 
killers in working girls he plays the boyfriend of 
melanie griffith and sigourney weaver 
this fall production begins on a third raiders movie when 
thats over ford will head back to his wife his 10monthold son

actor rob lowe is best known for his brat 
pack movie roles and romances with actress melissa gilbert and 
princess stephanie of monaco 
but the heartthrob of the teenybopper set also is an active 
crusader against toxic wastes 
he and other young screen actors such as ally sheedy judd 
nelson daphne zuniga and alexandra paul are just a few of 
hollywoods new breed of celebrity political activists 
they represent a new generation of artists who have like 
athletes a tremendous effect at being role models for young 
people said california assemblyman tom hayden 
theyre taken more seriously with americans than politicians 
because people know them its a very healthy tonic for an 
apathetic generation 
hayden was a founder of students for a democratic society one 
of the most visible student radical organizations of the 1960s and 
is the husband of actress jane fonda another celebrity activist 
in 1985 the haydens became curious about the true interests of 
the socalled brat packers who had been labeled selfish and 
selfcentered by critics they invited a few to their santa monica 
home including tom cruise kelly mcgillis demi moore emilio 
estevez gilbert nelson and lowe 
once the haydens saw an interest was there they formed network 
an educational group that explains political issues to actors and 
introduces them to politicians 
they are incredibly effective at motivating and opening up 
your minds sheedy said of the couple its not something where 
theyre trying to brainwash you in any way theres no pressure at 
all 
her involvement in network prompted the young star of war 
games and the breakfast club to throw a mixer with sen alan 
cranston dcalif for her actor friends 
it was so much fun it was so exciting sheedy said 
another hollywood activist group young artists united was 
formed two years ago by paul who starred in dragnet and 
filmmaker daniel sladek yau involves young people in such social 
issues as teen suicide and drug and alcohol abuse rather than 
political issues 
some yau members include sarah jessica parker star of tvs a 
year in the life eric stoltz of mask and most of the network 
members 
yau plans to put about 30 of the young actors on a bus caravan 
this april and cruise the southern california beach communities 
urging young people to register to vote 
i think theres a major transformation going on in the people 
of this generation from the me generation to the we generation 
they realize they can accomplish a lot united said the 
23yearold sladek 
for fear of alienating their fans actors generally remained 
aloof from politics until the 1930s when hollywood threw its 
support behind president roosevelt and his social policies 
hollywood staged massive support for world war ii with war bond 
rallies and entertaining the troops abroad some notables 
especially charlie chaplin supported the soviet cause and their 
activities would haunt them later 
the postwar period brought mccarthyism when many careers were 
harmed or ruined through blacklisting by association with 
leftist causes the reaction caused many actors to eschew support 
of any issues or candidates and continued into the 1960s 
however the civil rights movement brought out such actors as 
marlon brando on marches sitins and rallies the vietnam war 
environmental issues and womens rights also rekindled hollywoods 
social consciousness 
this will be a busy year for network said spokesman patrick 
lippert members will start meeting presidential candidates at 
private meetings in the spring and will probably become active in 
the 1988 elections 
last september members of both groups worked against robert 
borks confirmation to the us supreme court by staging a 
postcard writing campaign with their peers 
in october nelson billionaire boys club the breakfast 
club helen slater supergirl esai morales la bamba 
and mary stuart masterson at close range traveled to the 
soviet union to film a documentary for the national committee for a 
sane nuclear policy 
zuniga spaceballs and paul visited nicaragua where paul 
rode in a sovietmade helicopter with sandinistas 
everyone was saying two years ago this is the most 
selfcentered selfish generation in years lippert said but 
what you see is the most idealistic group of young people you see 
them getting involved in so many things and reaching out to their 
generation 
however not all hollywood observers are jumping with praise for 
the political meanderings of brat packers 
its striking that not one of these stars has a dissenting 
view other than whats the norm in hollywood said michael medved 
of pbs sneak previews 
its absolutely nonsensical that alan cranston should follow 
rob lowes advice to vote against robert bork for the supreme 
court he continued rob lowe daphne zuniga and gregory peck 
who did an antibork commercial we take their position 
seriously because theyre pretty its scary 
i think they are sincerely interested in the issues but part 
of burnishing your image is not to be written off as a prettyface 
airhead so you become politically involved 
also dabbling in politics are such hollywood glamour girls as 
morgan fairchild donna mills and sally field 
field a twotime academy award winner was host of a poolside 
party at her home that featured massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
a presidential contender mills the scheming vixen of cbstvs 
knots landing talked politics with sen paul simon dill 
another presidential hopeful at a gathering at her home 
fairchild who has testified before both the house and senate on 
environmental issues has given up needlepoint and instead spends 
her free time reading such weighty material as abu nidal master 
terrorist or hefty medical reports on the deadly aids virus 
i know that going in a lot of people didnt take me 
seriously said fairchild who has no intention of giving up her 
sexy image but i have a deceptively high iq and so when people 
sat down and started talking to me about some of these things they 
started to take me seriously

while the stock market has rallied in recent 
months from its drastic drop last year some wary analysts caution 
that it is still following the pattern set in 1929 and 1930 
after the great crash in october 1929 the market regained its 
balance and recovered nearly 50 percent of its losses but that 
rise turned out to be a deadly trap 
by the time stock prices finally bottomed out in 1932 they were 
down about 90 percent from their peaks a drop of the same 
magnitude today would put the dow jones industrial average at about 
275 
no market analyst with a wide following on wall street is 
currently predicting anything close to that along with the 
similarities most observers say there are many differences in the 
world of the 1980s from the situation that prevailed nearly 60 
years ago 
furthermore they say if history were prone to repeating itself 
with any reliability in the market the pursuit of making money in 
stocks would be a lot easier than it is 
still a good many people in the business of giving financial 
advice are very mindful these days of what is now known as the 
sucker rally of early 1930 
the entire price action of the past few years has tracked the 
19281930 span like clockwork says martin zweig a new york 
investment adviser in the current issue of his letter the zweig 
forecast 
the odds that this is the start of a new bull market are 
remote at the moment he argues 
eric miller chief investment officer at donaldson lufkin amp 
jenrette securities says stocks at their recent prices reflect 
some hopes about the economic outlook that may go unfulfilled 
we think the probability of a recession and perhaps a severe 
one is fairly high he observes and we also think that the 
current level of stock prices does not discount a recession 
optimists on the market outlook whose numbers have been growing 
lately describe the recent behavior of stocks as healthylooking 
one distinct positive they say is that many smaller stocks 
have been rising faster lately than the blue chips that make up the 
dow jones industrial average after lagging behind through the 
latter stages of the 198287 bull market in theory at least that 
betokens broad support for stocks 
zweig says he is well aware of this view but questions its 
validity in the first three months of 1930 he says a broad 
measure of stock prices he calculated rose 249 percent while the 
dow was up 153 percent 
positive divergence as most call it is normal after 
crashes which lead to continuing bear markets he says 
both zweig and miller acknowledge the possibility that they are 
wrong and both hold some stocks in their recommended portfolios 
as zweig put it if this turns out to be a bull market which 
i doubt then fine we own stocks now if its a bear rally ill 
look for exit signs as we go 
should the advance turn out to be a sucker rally like the 
one in 1930 zweig concedes it will be a tricky mission to pluck 
the bait out before the trap snaps shut 
i suspect that the rally which looks ok on the tape will 
continue to look good why to trap the maximum number of people 
for the next decline

japans latest comic book heros are emperor 
hirohito and former prime minister yasuhiro nakasone 
comic books are widely read in japan by both children and adults 
and often are used as teaching aids for such topics as history 
economics or etiquette and even to explain frictions with the 
united states over trade 
the hirohito comic book which is in hard cover and is titled 
tenno heika emperor follows the 86yearold monarch from 
childhood through world war ii including his historic surrender 
broadcast in 1945 and into his quiet retirement in tokyos 
imperial palace 
the book on nakasone is called yatchans which was the 
former prime ministers childhood nickname it is published 
quarterly by nakasones office and sent to supporters and 
constituents 
japanese prime ministers once they step down traditionally 
fade into the political background and take the role of party 
elder occasionally seen but seldom heard 
but nakasone whose term in office ended this past november has 
stayed in the news through trips abroad and the establishment of a 
thinktank group yatchans helps keep attention focused on him 
the idea for a cartoon newsletter has been gestating for a 
long time and it just happens that it was produced after 
nakasonesan left office said masaki donji a private secretary 
to nakasone there was no deliberate timing to keep him in the 
news 
while purporting to depict faithfully the characters lives and 
careers the comic books seem overly flattering 
hirohito is shown as barrelchested and cheerful rather than the 
aged and stooped man he is now 
nakasone now 67 is shown as burly with round eyes and a 
uncharacteristic full head of hair 
but the comic book presents littleknown facets of nakasones 
life 
an essay by nakasones wife tsutako says that in his younger 
days when he was known as yatchan nakasone pranced about in his 
underwear after baths humming music from swan lake and on state 
visits abroad as prime minister he grudgingly allowed his wife off 
elevators first but upon returning to japanese soil would 
instantly declare ladies first is over 
yatchans opens with nakasones return from the 1987 summit 
in venice italy with photos of the six inflight meals he was 
served on his special jet it then flashes back to the beginning a 
fieryeyed nakasone resigning from tokyos metropolitan police 
department in 1946 to work toward japans postwar reconstruction 
he reveals himself as an idealist who patterns himself after 
sakura sogo a 17thcentury village headman who was executed for 
seeking reduced taxes for poor peasants 
he eats potatoes for lunch an expression of humility and 
chooses a white bicycle for his first political campaign because 
hirohito rode a white horse 
subscriptions to yatchans are 2000 yen 1550 a year 
the booklet also includes reproductions of nakasones paintings 
and samples of his haiku poetry 
the hirohito book divulges some imperial trivia the emperor has 
no surname reached adulthood at age 18 20 for ordinary japanese 
and cannot adopt children or vote 
it also explains that his duties include opening sessions of the 
diet parliament closing sessions of the house of 
representatives receiving foreign ambassadors and formally 
approving laws government decrees amendments to the constitution 
and treaties 
hirohito once regarded as a living god remains a sensitive 
subject in modern japan and ribbing of royalty by the press is 
neither tolerated nor attempted 
but the comic book touches on some sensitive points in the 
emperors life including an assassination attempt the great kanto 
earthquake of 1923 for which hirohito was later criticized for not 
doing enough for his people and a 1936 military rebellion that led 
to the death of one of his favored ministers 
it also touches briefly on his role in world war ii although it 
reveals little about his activities or motivations during the 
conflict and portrays hirohitos famed speech imploring the nation 
in august 1945 to bear the unbearable surrender 
the emperors trips to europe and the united states are shown 
including protesters waving signs saying go home and fascist 
hirohito it ends with him enjoying his favorite pastimes 
walking along the beach and studying marine biology 
an official of the imperial household agency which tends to the 
imperial familys duties and needs said the agency had nothing to 
do with the comic book and extended neither approval or assistance 
in its production

first el salvador then nicaragua now panama 
like chain reactions crises spread through central america 
despite protests despite us pressure panamas military leader 
gen manuel antonio noriega the real boss of the country remains 
in power surviving charges of drug dealing illicit money 
laundering election fraud and violations of human rights here is 
a look at how it all came about in a country the united states 
deems vital to its security 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
many panamanians have lived for years 
with the belief if not the sure knowledge that their government 
is corrupt their elections are unfair and their leaders lust for 
money and power 
there were protests from time to time but they seldom lasted 
more than a few days then the nation would sink back into a 
tropical lethargy abetted by prosperity the voices of opposition 
were few 
now the lethargy seems to be gone 
the country is in turmoil over the military rule of gen manuel 
antonio noriega who has been indicted in the united states on drug 
charges prosperity is threatened by a large foreign debt us 
economic pressure and the freezing of panamanian funds abroad 
in recent years money poured in from the panama canal the new 
offshore banking center an oil pipeline that helped carry alaskan 
crude to atlantic coast markets a thriving reexport industry and 
a large us military presence 
it all helped an economy traditionally based on bananas sugar 
and coffee weather the ups and downs of unstable agricultural 
markets and made panama by far the wealthiest country on the 
central american isthmus 
they were years of indulgence and indifference says roberto 
brenes a panama city investment banker and a leader of the broad 
new opposition movement that took firm root only nine months ago 
the rich were getting richer the middle class was growing and 
the lot of the poor was improving said a diplomat with long 
experience in central america its always been a tolerant 
society and few people saw any need to rock to the boat 
neither did the united states which saw in panama enough 
stability to make a treaty in 1977 that will deliver control of the 
vital canal between the atlantic and pacific to the panamanian 
government at the turn of the century 
omar torrijos herrera a charismatic army colonel seized the 
government in 1968 broke the traditional rule of wealthy merchants 
and land barons and began a costly series of reforms 
he built schools schools hospitals health clinics 
farmtomarket roads and other public works with fervent 
nationalism torrijos brought a new sense of pride and identity to 
the country even its wealthiest citizens 
much of his popularity came from his ability to tweak uncle 
sams nose while maintaining relations with washington few 
panamanian leaders had risked the slightest impertinance with the 
united states 
his ideology became known as torrijismo and survived his 
death in an airplane crash in 1981 four years after he signed the 
canal treaty with president jimmy carter and fulfilled one of the 
fondest dreams of the panamanian people 
although the country maintained the fiction of a president 
torrijos ruled supreme as chief of government and commander of 
the national guard he had no real opposition and the nation 
prospered from economic growth and public spending financed with 
money borrowed abroad 
noriega came to power in 1983 four years after torrijos was 
killed and the first presidential election since the 1968 coup was 
held the following year 
nicolas ardito barletta a respected economist was elected 
president despite the fact that he had spent years with the world 
bank in washington and was little known at home 
his election by a margin of fewer than 2000 votes was tainted 
by charges of fraud opponents held marches and auto caravans 
honking horns waving white banners and banging pots and pans in a 
traditional panamanian form of protest 
like those before them the demonstrations died within a week 
the united states and the rest of the world recognized ardito 
barletta as they had six other figurehead presidents installed and 
removed by the military since 1968 the first vice president was 
eric arturo delvalle in his first elective office 
less than a year later in september 1985 it became ardito 
barlettas turn to go 
he was summoned to military headquarters and held for 12 hours 
after calling for an impartial investigation into the murder of 
hugo spadafora one of noriegas chief opponents ardito barletta 
announced his resignation and delvalle was sworn in to replace him 
once again government upheaval was greeted largely by public 
apathy 
noriega kept building his power increasing the size of the 
military with the help of the united states 
washington poured millions of dollars into the generals newly 
renamed panama defense forces a single command encompassing 15000 
members of the army air force navy police forces and state 
security agency in this nation of 22 million people 
the canal treaty gives panama primary responsibility for the 
security of the waterway beginning with the year 2000 the carter 
administration then president reagan wanted the defense forces to 
be up to the task 
rumors of military corruption recurred then col roberto diaz 
herrera one of noriegas top aides told reporters last june after 
his forced resignation that his former boss had rigged the 1984 
elections was engaged in the illegal selling of visas and had 
engineered the spadafora murder 
spadaforas headless mutilated body was found in august 1985 
stuffed in a canvas us mail bag just across the border in costa 
rica he had threatened to offer proof of noriegas involvement in 
drug trafficking and his family and friends insisted the general 
ordered the brutal murder 
until diaz herrera began talking however no one in the 
militarys tight inner circle had accused noriega of so much as 
fixing a traffic ticket 
the former aides frequent press interviews caused a sensation 
they also spawned the national civic crusade a movement begun by a 
few wealthy businessmen whose disgust and anger at the militarys 
increasingly heavyhanded interference in the government and 
economy had been building for some time 
within weeks the crusade grew to an umbrella organization 
covering about 200 professional business labor and political 
groups and had gained support from panamanians of the middle and 
lower classes

the crusade called its first strike june 10 it had little 
success but was followed by others and a series of mass protests 
despite a state of emergency decree that forbade public gatherings 
and closed opposition newspapers and broadcast stations 
by july 10 noriega had enough he sent soldiers and riot police 
to break up a mass rally more than 100 people were injured many 
peppered by birdshot and up to 600 were arrested and detained for 
four days 
the movement appeared to lose heart but bounced back with a 
successful strike in late july and a rally aug 6 that attracted 
30000 antinoriega demonstrators despite the threat of 
repression leaders of the civic crusade began seeking foreign 
support 
delvalles government responded with pronoriega rallies and 
increasingly virulent attacks on the united states in speeches and 
governmentowned newspapers 
it all was done under the cloak of torrijismo but the 
garment did not fit noriega well in late august a gallup poll 
indicated three of four panamanians wanted him to step down 
after an attack on the us embassy in june the reagan 
administration had suspended all military and economic aid which 
would have totaled 21 million this year that brought howls of 
economic aggression from delvalle and other panamanian leaders 
loss of the aid was particularly painful because panama faced a 
fiscal crisis brought on by years of deficit spending that piled 
up a 45 billion foreign debt and capital flight caused by the 
civil unrest 
early in february two federal grand juries in florida indicted 
noriega on charges of drug trafficking money laundering and 
racketeering 
among other things he is accused of helping colombias 
notorious medellin cartel by providing safe airstrips for its 
cocaine shipments and safe haven for its hired killers 
what he did was utilize his position to sell the country of 
panama to the traffickers said us atty leon kellner of miami 
who led the investigation for one indictment 
events began unfolding rapidly feb 25 when delvalle scorned by 
the opposition as a puppet decided he had had enough and ordered 
noriegas dismissal the united states said it knew of his 
intentions and continued to recognize him as president through the 
ensuing trouble 
noriega arranged for the legislative assembly to remove delvalle 
the next day the special session lasted 10 minutes and hours 
later devalle went into hiding 
the civic crusade called another strike its sixth last monday 
but acknowledged it would not be enough to drive noriega from 
office even the country closed down completely 
opposition leaders said only the united states with or without 
the support of the rest of latin america had the financial clout 
to depose him 
at weeks end roberto aleman a lawyer and civic crusade 
leader summed up the alliances hopes 
the government will find itself besieged by economic and 
diplomatic measures taken in the united states and latin america 
the measures will oblige the regime to take extremely unpopular 
measures such as raising taxes and firing public employees

thomas moscardini talks of manet and warhol in 
the same breath as undercover stings and doing time 
for the new york city police detective the two are as 
inextricably linked as oil and canvas 
moscardini an art history student and former undercover 
narcotics agent works full time on recovering the stolen art of 
galleries museums and patrons his contacts are interpol the us 
customs service art associations and the art underworld along 
with an unspecified number of paid informants 
hes part of an elite fraternity of fulltime art sleuths who 
range in number to perhaps a halfdozen depending on the criteria 
used to define them 
since moving more than four years ago from the dim back alleys 
of undercover drugs to the grand halls and cozy galleries of the 
art world the 42yearold detective has created something of a 
name for himself 
among the artworks hes recovered was a 500000 joan miro my 
best piece was a 1 million renoir he says 
hes great says elizabeth haytatkins director of art 
theft archives at the new yorkbased international foundation for 
art research he plays the part of the knowledgeable art person 
very well he knows the lingo he knows the artists so i imagine 
when he goes undercover hes perfectly plausible 
moscardini looks the part trim impeccably groomed down to his 
manicured nails articulate and artwise the only giveaway that 
hes anything but a connoisseur is the 9mm semiautomatic that 
hangs from his lizardskin belt 
the same gun as james bond used he quips 
and he knows the role 
a frequent weekend visitor to new yorks metropolitan museum of 
art because its one of those places you have to go to quite 
often moscardini himself dabbles in oils and acrylics he also

members of the mormon tabernacle choir and 
church president and prophet ezra taft benson attended the 
inauguration of arizona gov evan mecham himself a former mormon 
bishop mechams beliefs are closely tied to church doctrine his 
ties to church leadership strong so when a storm of turmoil 
engulfed the governor arizonas mormon community found itself at 
the center 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
steve benson has been a lifelong mormon 
active in church affairs he is the grandson of church president 
and prophet ezra taft benson few would question his devotion 
few except impeached gov evan mecham and some of his 
supporters 
benson happens to be the awardwinning cartoonist for the 
arizona republic and a relentless critic of the embattled 
governor mecham happens to be arizonas first mormon governor and 
an unwavering believer in conservative church doctrine 
in arizona these days politics and religion are mixing in the 
mormon community mormon critics of mecham have been scorned by 
other mormons who say they are not true to their religion mecham 
even once told steve benson his salvation was in jeopardy because 
of the biting cartoons 
sides have been taken and swords drawn said the cartoonist 
there have been instances of shunning letters have been written 
questioning ones devotion to the church whether one has the 
moral rectitude to remain in the flock 
with the turmoil have come fears that the brouhaha will damage 
the image of mormons whose roots trace back to the settling of 
arizona 
officially the church has remained neutral on the governors 
plight some members say the only mentions of mecham from the 
pulpit have been reminders of neutrality and the strife is limited 
to a small group of mormons 
is the church worried i think not its a matter that will 
pass in the next few months said phoenix attorney dave udall a 
church leader designated as the official spokesman 
still individuals within the community say passions run deep 
some say families have been split by the issues 
ed pagan a mormon who is a history graduate student at the 
university of arizona and who criticized mecham in a letter to the 
editor called the turmoil gutwretching for church members 
in a sense his platform and ideology have the veneer of 
unofficial church position said pagan whose criticism drew 
letters questioning his own faith there are those who say if you 
criticize mecham youre ultimately criticizing god 
an unofficial church newspaper the latterday sentinel has 
supported mecham and its editor crismon lewis is a sharp critic 
of the republics benson most of the church is extremely 
disappointed in him lewis said 
one cartoon that rankled mechams mormon supporters showed an 
angel atop the mormon temple in salt lake city utah at the end of 
the angels trumpet was a banner reading resign ev 
some remember the controversy that surrounded bensons 
grandfather during eight years as agriculture secretary under 
president eisenhower 
his grandfather was attacked so much by the press that he 
offered his resignation but eisenhower kept him said lewis 
now a couple of decades later youve got the grandson doing the 
same thing 
benson says his grandfather a personal friend of mechams has 
never pressured him to back off churchrelated pressure in 
arizona he said comes from an ultraconservative sect of the 
church not the mainstream 
some individuals and its not unique to my religion 
unavoidably mix religion with politics and as a result think any 
mormon who does not agree with a fellow latterday saint who 
happens to be governor is endangering his position in the church 
benson said 
its intolerant and its silly 
and benson has support among mormons even among some who 
support the governor 
hes got his job to do said democratic state rep jack 
brown who voted against mechams impeachment he can do that and 
still be a good member of the mormon church 
mecham a 63yearold native of duchesne utah was impeached 
feb 5 by the arizona house of representatives on allegations of 
concealing a 350000 campaign loan misusing 80000 from a 
special fund and attempting to thwart an investigation of an 
alleged death threat involving a state official 
trial on the impeachment is under way in the state senate if 
convicted mecham would be removed from office he also faces a 
criminal trial on the campaign loan charge march 22 and a recall 
election set for may 17 
the ultraconservative governor took office 14 months ago and 
immediately plunged himself into controversy by rescinding the 
martin luther king holiday for state workers and making statements 
that have offended women homosexuals jews and japanese 
mormons believe church leaders receive divine guidance and some 
mecham backers have suggested political leaders do as well mecham 
himself has occassionally suggested hes received guidance from god 
to shirley whitlock active in the church and state leader of a 
conservative political group called the eagle forum mormons who 
dont support mecham have lost their religion 
i feel if there are other members of the church who do not 
support the governor they either have allowed themselves to be 
propagandized or are too liberal and dont understand their own 
teachings mrs whitlock said 
if members of the church cant see this man is trying to do 
his duty then theres false belief she said if they dont 
support the governor when he supports constitutional principles 
then they better do more studying 
passions ran high in the legislature too as the impeachment 
vote neared rep brown a former mormon bishop said he received 
letters from followers who tried to intimidate him 
rep mark killian a conservative republican from mesa a 
popular mormon area and site of the churchs arizona temple broke 
into tears as he blasted the governors behavior but voted against 
the impeachment because he didnt believe the evidence was strong 
enough 
udall the arizona church spokesman said he cringes when 
mechams religion is brought into the debate 
is religion really a factor i dont think it is he said 
and wed prefer not to be getting the attention 
brown said he worries about possible damage to the church 
but i think people basically understand that you have 
different kinds of people in the church and some are not 
reflective of the whole group he said 
its a concern said wayne arnett an attorney and mormon 
there will be those who know mecham is a mormon and think less of 
me because im a mormon 
most mormons mesa bishop bob goodman said are sorry the 
church has been involved in it 
but i cant say its hurt any of my members goodman said 
and i cant say its hurt the church the church is just too 
strong for that

the child in david lee roth is taking plenty 
of toys on his next trip a 28foot flying surfboard a huge banner 
featuring bikiniclad women and a regulationsize red white and 
blue everlast boxing ring 
but this is no ordinary summer vaction for the shaggyhaired 
rock star with the trademark scream its a concert tour and the 
playthings are meant to wow audiences for the next nine months in 
arenas from australia to new york 
music should look like it sounds no matter what kind of music 
it is roth said in a recent interview a lot of times this 
music sounds like something thundering up out of the floorboards or 
raining down from the heavens sometimes its like rolling waves of 
sound and whats a wave without somebody to surf it 
despite the props and an endless stream of jokes roth is a 
shrewd businessman he knows the gimmicks will bring attention to 
his craft rock n roll 
theres a lot of aerial tricks but its all built around the 
music the band is doing more musical gymnastics than youve ever 
heard a rock band do he said 
roth 32 is touring to promote his third solo album 
skyscraper the record which includes the single just like 
paradise marks the first time he has tried on the producers 
hat his tour began on march 4 in lakeland fla 
i wanted to try something different roth said always in 
the back of my mind i had thought about producing but i wouldnt 
try a flight like this unless i had the tools and the knowhow to 
do it and i didnt feel secure with that until fairly recently 
the comic booklike showman spoke about his tour with his long 
blond hair tied back in a ponytail wearing camouflage pants and a 
torn tshirt sitting in the second row of his rehearsal hall he 
was careful not to reveal too many of the tours surprises 
during the bands moment of patriotism i climb a ladder to 
the ceiling of the arena jeez i dont want to give it all 
away he said but added its deathdefying stuff 
roths hometown is bloomington ind but he moved to pasadena 
calif when he was about 12 and has lived there ever since as a 
child he was inspired by television he said he figured if all 
these people were entertaining him on television maybe he could be 
some kind of entertainer too 
the influences which led him to music ran the gamut of groups 
and styles 
if i say to you deep purple was a big inspiration to me and so 
were the ohio players youd say oh thats where dave got his 
scream from deep purple no no no i got the scream from the 
ohio players i got the haircut from deep purple 
he began his career after meeting eddie and alex van halen and 
michael anthony at pasadena city college the four formed van 
halen a band that set the standard for many heavymetal bands to 
come especially because of eddies innovative guitar playing and 
roths wildman antics 
the group split up in 1985 and roth moved on to a solo career 
his new band includes lead guitarist steve vai bass guitarist matt 
bissonette drummer gregg bissonette and keyboardist brett tuggle 
roths international tour will include some of the old van halen 
standards in addition to his solo efforts including a remake of 
the beach boys california girls and the bluesy just a 
gigolo 
in his spare time roth climbs mountains as seen on the just 
like paradise video in which he scales a 3000foothigh vertical 
wall of granite he said he may be reverting to his childhood 
because he got the climbing bug when he was a boy scout climbing 
is a kind of therapy for him 
you know the most scariest place you can put yourself in has 
the most calming effect 
although experienced he says the hobby has not made him want to 
conquer mountains such as mount everest 
something like that is a hypercommitment he said i need 
all of my toes in order to jump around with great abandon 
inevitably youre going to lose a finger or a toe on a trip like 
that somebody checks out early taking that kind of risk is not my 
interest the music gives me enough of that kind of adventure 
fooling around with my career burns enough calories 
roth also fools around with martial arts receiving a black belt 
in karate about nine years ago at one point he experimented with 
kick boxing these days he incorporates both disciplines in his 
stage show 
martial arts has a lot of visceral impact you can feel it 
pow and combining it with the music 10000 people say oh did 
you feel that 
despite his devilmaycare manner roth is definitely a success 
two previous albums have sold more that 1 million copies 
certifying them as platinum and skyscraper is well on its way 
this does not include his revenues from the six van halen lps that 
share the same honor 
a lot of what stands for success in rock n roll or showbiz 
after a while seems like so many little trophies and prizes along 
the way he said if theres any real glory to be had its in 
legend 
all kidding aside he insists the money hes made is not for 
things but rather experiences he said experiences provide better 
memories 
if anything roths whole career is built around making a single 
point getting across a single message 
theres a very definite message in all of this music people 
say dave whats the message thats it imagination take a 
chance not just take your best shot thats too dependable

the governments planned sale of the electricity 
industry in england and wales is by far the biggest and most 
controversial venture so far in prime minister margaret thatchers 
huge privatization program 
critics predict poorer service and higher prices and question 
the wisdom of putting nuclear power stations in private hands 
supporters insist it will produce better service with 
safeguards built on the lessons of past privatizations 
but investors weighing this debate also harbor big financial 
concerns in the wake of octobers stock market crash britons 
burned by the selloffs of british gas plc and british 
telecommunications plc shares understandably are wary of buying 
into another public utility 
the stock offering of the electric company now a state body 
run by the central electricity generating board is to be debated 
march 7 in parliament and the energy department already is taking 
steps to fend off criticism 
privatizing the electricity industry has been likened to 
trying to grasp a porcupine the sunday times commented 
the complex sale will take two to three years and could raise 
more money than the entire 165 billion pounds or about 29 
billion raised from all the other stateowned companies sold since 
mrs thatchers conservatives were elected in 1979 promising to 
roll back socialism in britain 
the city londons financial district expects the electricity 
sale to raise from 26 billion to 47 billion 
less controversial have been the sales of nonutility companies 
such as british airways plc and rollsroyce plc the airplane 
engine maker 
mrs thatchers goal has been to make these companies more 
competitive and to get more britons to become shareholders the 
shareowning public has tripled to 85 million in 10 years the 
government says 
the objections have been to the privatization of monopolies 
intact without the intention of introducing competition said 
dieter helm a research fellow at the london business school 
critics also complain that british gas and british telecom were 
insufficiently regulated when they went private in 1986 and 1984 
respectively consequently they claim gas and telephone prices 
have risen while service has deteriorated 
some britons also say they feel less secure without government 
control over such vital public services in the electricity sale 
critics fear higher prices deteriorating service and poor security 
for nuclear stations labor unions fear job losses 
helm said there also were questions over whether the capital 
markets could absorb all the stock to be sold 
moreover he said nuclear disasters in recent years at three 
mile island in the united states and at the chernobyl plant in the 
soviet union increase uncertainty about whether people really 
want to hold shares in this kind of firm 
the sale is opposed by lord marshall chairman of the central 
electricity generating board who says the plan is unlikely to 
serve the consumers interests 
lawmaker john prescott of the opposition labor party attacked 
the plan as a triumph of ideology over common sense and 
accused the government of selling off assets to finance tax cuts 
the government structured the sale defensively addressing some 
of the issues raised by the gas and phone selloffs it set up two 
competing generating companies and promised to implement regulation 
that will protect britains security and consumers rights 
for example energy secretary cecil parkinson plans rebates for 
dissatisfied consumers a privilege not granted to british telecom 
users 
tony boorman deputy director of the watchdog electricity 
consumers council called regulatory safeguards a welcome 
change 
weve always believed that at least in the short term the 
structure of the industry has less relevance to the customer than 
the regulation he said

more than 30 years ago life magazine 
took a look at the burgeoning little desert town of las vegas and 
wondered if it wasnt overbuilt 
the year was 1955 and five new resort hotels had just opened 
prompting the magazine to question where they would get people to 
fill them 
has las vegas pushed its luck too far life asked 
history has proven doubters to be wrong las vegas has grown 
from a dusty town of a few resorts into a booming metropolis of 
more than 600000 people with nearly 60000 hotel and motel rooms 
to accomodate tourists 
now as las vegas undergoes one of the most ambitious of its 
periodic building booms there are few who believe that 
overbuilding is a problem tourism is growing and the gaming and 
resort industries are attempting to capitalize on the trend 
there is still a tremendous amount of demand out there that 
hasnt been satisified said rossi ralenkotter director of 
marketing for the las vegas convention and visitors authority 
were in a very strong growth pattern and all indications are 
that it will continue 
nearly 20000 new hotel rooms either are under construction or 
awaiting groundbreaking as resorts compete to add rooms they hope 
will bring in even more tourists and gamblers in the near future 
part of that optimism is based on figures showing hotels 
averaged 902 percent occupancy during 1987 such extremely high 
rates meant potential guests often were turned away by a lack of 
rooms on weekends it is nearly impossible to get a room and on 
threeday holiday weekends its even worse 
visitor volume nearly has doubled in the last 12 years with an 
estimated 17 million tourists each expected to spend an average of 
23 days in las vegas during 1988 
gaming revenues kept pace growing 14 percent in 1987 to a 
record 274 billion in southern nevada 
were penetrating markets weve never penetrated before 
said dave verbon publicity director at the riviera hotel there 
are vast numbers of people out there we never tried to reach before 
and now were going after them and getting them 
already boasting the worlds two largest resort hotels las 
vegas soon will have five hotelcasinos with more than 3000 rooms 
apiece two resorts the riviera and the flamingo hilton are 
about to begin work on expansions that will bring them to more than 
4000 rooms apiece 
the riviera opened a new 1000room highrise march 1 and plans 
to begin construction of a 1700room tower in the fall 
you have to build towers to have a very high volume of 
business to drive a large casino with a large number of slot 
machines and blackjack tables said verbon we think there are 
enough potential customers to support these huge hotels 
the centerpiece of the new construction is the golden nugget a 
massive resort rising from a desert parcel adjacent to caesars 
palace when finished sometime late next year the 550 million 
resort will have 3200 guest rooms set in a watery tropical setting 
that hotel officials claim will be like nothing las vegas has ever 
seen 
its really on a completely different plane in terms of what 
we presently have said nugget president bobby baldwin its 
very difficult to compare the new nugget to anything 
baldwin says he has few worries that the nugget will be able to 
fill its rooms with gamblers and tourists the companys downtown 
resort regularly sells out its rooms 
were very bullish he said tour and travel continues to 
grow and the individual traveler market continues to expand 
particularly from southern california international business has 
also expanded in the last few months and we hope to see that 
continue 
the tourism economy has been helped by the growth in threeday 
weekends and a national trend toward minivacations of 23 days 
las vegas has also been very successful in landing conventions 
which attracted 16 million people to the city in 1987 
part of the las vegas lure also comes from room rates that 
average 45 a night far below the 100 or more charged by 
nongaming hotels in other cities 
its the bargain aspect the ability to have a very enjoyable 
convention or vacation visit at far less expense than any other 
destination said ralenkotter 
the citys hotels in the past four to five years have begun 
exploiting the vast middleclass and tourism markets they once 
eschewed in favor of attracting a handful of highrolling gamblers 
the expanded customer base hotel operators believe gives them 
protection against a recession or sudden rise in fuel prices that 
could have a negative impact on tourism levels 
in the early 1980s a national recession combined with high fuel 
prices and the legalization of gambling in atlantic city stopped 
the las vegas growth rate in its tracks 
in good times everybody does pretty well and the better 
operators do even better said baldwin in bad times good 
operators dont do quite as well but they still do well the best 
operators do great in both times

the bestliked commercials of 1987 included some 
starring performances from animated characters such as dancing clay 
raisins a hamburger chains moonman and a pizza companys dreaded 
foil called a noid 
few of the commercials mentioned most often by consumers polled 
by video storyboard tests inc featured traditional show business 
celebrities the head of the consumer research firm said thursday 
we seem to heading into a period when we see more created 
celebrities not necessarily human beings in commercials said 
david vadehra president of video storyboard in relasing the 
results of the firms 10th annual survey 
he said that may be partly due to growing dissatisfaction with 
the costs and risks associated with using celebrities the trend 
occurs even as admakers for some cars office phone systems 
computers and insurance products have tried to replicate realistic 
situations and dialogue in their commercials 
video storyboard which is based in new york interviewed more 
than 25000 people about what commercials they liked best last year 
leading the list was the campaign for california raisins which 
used clay models of raisins dancing to the sounds of motown music 
in a construction workers lunchbox and across the kitchen counter 
the ads took top billing despite relatively modest spending of 
54 million to put them on television the survey said makers of 
other wellliked ads spent as much as 344 million mcdonalds 
corp on television placements 
second was bud light beer commercials many of which featured 
the english bull terrier spuds mackenzie while others offered 
numerous variations of what can go wrong if you simply order a 
light without specifying the brand 
the ad campaign for pepsi soft drinks placed third and miller 
lite beer commercials were fourth 
ads for mcdonalds restaurants came in fifth the campaign 
included some commercials that featured a pianoplaying character 
shaped like a moon crescent who extolled dinner at mcdonalds to 
the tune from mac the knife 
the stars of sixthranked bartles amp jaymes wine cooler ads are a 
pair of nonactors who were persuaded to pose as the brands owners

koppers co inc a huge construction and 
chemicals concern has offered no reply to an unsolicited 13 
billion takeover bid from a group led by a major british 
contruction company and a us investment firm 
but traders on wall street seem to think the bidding might go 
higher and sent the price of koppers stock well above the 45 a 
share offer 
koppers rose 662 a share to close at 5175 on thursday on 
the new york stock exchange it was the sixth mostactively traded 
stock with 31 million shares changing hands 
the tender offer for koppers was launched thursday by a concern 
called bns inc whose biggest shareholder is beazer plc a 
londonbased general construction company that owns 49 percent of 
bns 
other participants in bns are subsidiaries of shearson lehman 
hutton inc a new yorkbased investment firm that reportedly owns 
about 46 percent of bns and natwest investment bank ltd a 
british investment bank 
affiliates of bns already own nearly 21 million shares or 
about 745 percent of koppers outstanding common stock the 
company said 
based on koppers nearly 286 million common shares outstanding 
the tender offer would be worth a total of about 129 billion 
several securities analysts said koppers which recently 
completed a restructuring that shed several engineering and metals 
products businesses over the past three years was worth more than 
the offered price 
its main businesses now are construction materials and services 
which mainly involve road construction and chemical and allied 
products 
bns indicated that it planned to sell the chemicals and allied 
products business if its tender offer is successful 
robert kanters senior vice president for the stock brokerage 
legg mason masten in pittsburgh said koppers holds a commanding 
position in aggregates and the coalbased chemicals businesses 
and may be worth 55 to 60ashare 
aggregates are the rock mixtures used in road and bridge 
construction among koppers coalbased chemicals products are 
substances used to treat lumber 
fred siemer who follows the chemicals business for the firm 
chemical research said beazer probably is attracted to koppers 
quarries which are essential to roadbuilding koppers said it 
operates about 150 quarries in 20 states 
beazer has been expanding rapidly in recent years it bought 
giffordhill amp co a cementmaker based in dallas in 1986 and 
also operates phillips builders in nashville tenn tidewater 
construction co in norfolk va and cohn communities in atlanta 
the bid is conditioned on among other things koppers 
stockholders tendering a majority of the companys common shares 
approval by the nonmanagement directors of koppers approval by 
beazers shareholders and the bidding groups satisfaction that 
certain elements of delaware antitakeover laws are invalid 
the offer expires at midnight march 30 unless extended 
brian c beazer chairman of beazer plc told koppers chairman 
charles r pullin in a letter we plan to operate koppers as an 
independent autonomous business and we have no plans to move the 
headquarters from pittsburgh 
bns said shearson had agreed to provide 465 million in 
financing for the offer and that citibank had indicated to arrange 
additional financing 
koppers reported its profit for 1987 fell to 102 million or 
36 cents share from 741 million or 259 a share a year 
earlier the results included a charge of 594 million in 1987 due 
to settlement of a lawsuit 
revenue rose to 152 billion from 14 billion in 1986 
beazer said it earned 828 million on sales of 17 billion in 
its latest fiscal year which ended last june 30

the nations largest general retailers recorded lower than 
expected sales in february prompting analysts to underscore their 
predictions of an economic slowdown this year 
retailers in all market segments from discount chains like k 
mart corp to the more upscale federated department stores inc 
said thursday that their sales suffered last month many companies 
reported sales declines 
the results do not bode well for the economy said fred 
wintzer a retail industry analyst for the investment firm alex 
brown amp sons inc in baltimore 
cautious spending wintzer said could have a ripple effect 
throughout the economy consumer spending is the largest component 
of the gross national product and when spending is sluggish 
retailers order less merchandise and manufacturers in turn cut back 
production sometimes causing layoffs 
laid off workers then decrease their spending sustaining the 
cycle 
consumers have been spending slowly for about a year and 
analysts predicted the trend would continue despite an expected 
pickup in sales before easter 
after that we would expect to see a return to slowing or 
sluggish trends at least for the next few months said jeffrey b 
edelman an analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc 
david wyss an economist with data resources inc in lexington 
mass said consumers were expected to increase their savings this 
year as a hedge against economic uncertainty 
february generally is one of the weakest months of the retail 
year but last months results were disappointing and 
significantly below expectations for most retail companies said 
jeffrey feiner an analyst with merrill lynch amp co inc 
the figures appear to be miserable but may look worse than 
they really are because of comparisons with a strong performance by 
retailers in february 1987 edelman said 
the nations largest retailer sears roebuck and co said its 
sales rose 25 percent from february 1987 
k mart said its overall sales were up 08 percent but sales at 
stores open at least a year known as comparable store sales 
fell 16 percent 
comparable store sales are considered a more accurate reflection 
of a retailers performance than overall sales 
the rapidlyexpanding walmart stores inc reported its overall 
sales rose 32 percent while comparable store sales rose 13 percent 
jc penney co inc said its sales fell 05 percent overall and 
11 percent among comparable stores 
federated the object of a takeover battle between rh macy amp 
co inc and campeau corp said its sales slipped 12 percent 
dayton hudson corp said its overall sales rose 162 percent 
but comparable store sales slipped 13 percent during february 
may department stores co said its overall sales fell 13 
percent while comparable store sales dropped 45 percent 
montgomery ward amp co said its sales declined 25 percent and 
fw woolworth co said its sales rose 94 percent 
the results reported thursday were from general retailers and 
apparel stores they do not reflect sales of auto dealers or 
supermarkets 
apparel retailers who have been among the hardest hit by 
sluggish sales are unlikely to see much relief during the first 
half of this year wintzer said 
last summer consumers became bored with fashions and cut back 
their clothing purchases through the fall and winter when sales 
began to decline it was too late for retailers to change spring 
1988 merchandise that was similar to the 1987 styles so consumers 
are not expected to greet the new lines 
retailers are testing new fashions in hopes of turning their 
performance around later this year wintzer said

general motors corp benefited from an apparent 
resurgence of consumer confidence in late february analysts said 
leading a spurt that saw domestic automakers post a 25 percent rise 
in sales over the yearago period 
in the seven selling days from feb 2129 gm sold 127549 
domestic cars up 334 percent from a year earlier and 59709 
domestic light trucks up 462 percent from a year earlier 
gm said its sales during the final third of february were its 
highest for that period since 1972 
among all eight companies that build cars and trucks in the 
united states sales totaled 378308 in late february up from 
302642 a year ago 
aiding sales were the weaker dollar which pushes prices of 
imports higher and what some analysts said was stronger consumer 
activity 
consumer confidence continues to strengthen and is now 
approaching levels prior to the october stock market collapse we 
are optimistic about the vehicle market for march and the spring 
selling season said cn moore gm vice president for customer 
sales and service 
domestic car sales totaled 246742 during late february up 241 
percent from 198818 a year ago domestic light truck sales were 
131566 up 267 percent from 103824 in late february 1987 the 
companies reported 
for the entire month combined import car and light truck sales 
fell 44 percent from february 1987 while sales of domestic 
vehicles rose 139 percent higher prices helped push sales of 
japanese cars 41 percent lower and european cars 61 percent lower 
against a year ago 
foreign automakers have been forced to raise prices to account 
for the foreign exchange decline of the dollar since 1985 
the domestics are going after market sharestarting to take 
advantage of the import weakness not only have they held down 
prices but they have very heavy incentive campaigns said thomas 
ogrady industry analyst with integrated automotive resources inc 
in wayne pa 
total car and light truck sales imported and domestic rose 
177 percent in february to 2406215 from 2044426 a year ago 
sales are compared on the basis of daily average sales during 
february which had 25 selling days this year and 24 last year 
korean car sales rose 764 percent continuing an unbroken trend 
that began when hyundai motor corp entered the market in 1986 
unlike the currencies of japan and most western european 
nations the korean won has not risen against the us dollar so 
korean cars remain relatively inexpensive in this country 
of the four korean makes on the market two are imported by us 
makers the ford festiva and gms pontiac lemans and one is 
imported by japans mitsubishi motors corp 
in late february car sales increased from a year ago for all 
domestic makers except nissan motor corp whose sales plunged 442 
percent to 1955 from 3501 a year ago 
nissan also was the only domestic maker to sell fewer light 
trucks during the period nissans domestic light trucks sales fell 
25 percent to 2633 from 2701 a year ago 
ford motor cos domestic car sales rose 187 percent to 61049 
from 51411 a year ago fords domestic truck sales were up 108 
percent to 41599 from 37559 a year ago 
no 3 chrysler corps domestic car sales rose 188 percent to 
37481 from 31560 a year ago chryslers domestic truck sales rose 
216 percent to 27625 from 22715 in late february 1987 
honda motor co volkswagen of america inc and toyota motor 
corp also reported increased sales from a year ago mazda motor 
corp began assembling cars in the united states last fall

otis spunkmeyer inc is wagering a 
few million cookies that it has goodyear outblimped when it comes 
to midair advertising 
the gourmet baking company embarks today on a sky tours business 
featuring a vintage 1945 dc3 hoping to capture the romance of 
aviations golden era along with the hearts and wallets of 
wellheeled customers 
kenneth rawlings chairman and chief executive officer of otis 
spunkmeyer sees the tour business as a cantmiss proposition 
even if planefuls of customers dont line up for hourlong flights 
at 75 a pop or 1200 to charter the entire 18seat aircraft 
the promotional value is high 
we look at it as our goodyear blimp rawlings said noting 
that a 95footlong sign bearing the companys name under the wing 
should grab the attention of groundbound consumers 
were just trying to find a way of flying it full at the same 
time were promoting our product 
the company inaugurated its sentimental journeys venture on 
thursday whisking press and invited guests on halfhour trips 
around san francisco bay in the twopropeller airplane complete 
with champagne and crew in 1940s style uniforms 
otis spunkmeyer which expects 30 million in sales over the 
next 12 months bought the dc3 for 165000 two months ago 
rawlings took his first airplane ride on a dc3 as a child and 
says hes been mulling over the sky tours idea for some time last 
summer he decided to go ahead with it after his wife linda the 
company president and a whiteknuckle flier accompanied him on a 
commercial dc3 flight from cape cod to boston and was lulled to 
sleep by its comfort 
victory lap inc the spunkmeyer subsidiary that operates the 
tours has spiffed up the inside of its dc3 and offers deluxe 
limousine service as well 
inside the plane crew members wear 1940sstyle uniforms the 
inflight music features doris day and glenn miller and 
stewardesses distribute champagne gourmet hors doeuvres and of 
course cookies as the slow but steady aircraft flies past the 
golden gate bridge at 1500 feet 
the dc3 revolutionized air travel in comfort and safety and 
accounted for 90 percent of the worlds airline traffic in 1939 
rawlings estimates there are more than 1000 of them still 
operating mostly flying cargo in other countries 
aviation historian ed davies of nearby millbrae calif said he 
believed the dc3 venture was the first of its kind 
if the tours venture is successful rawlings envisions a fleet 
of refurbished dc3s serving the nations major metropolitan areas 
starting with seattle san diego or los angeles 
such a move would mark a new chapter for san leandrobased otis 
spunkmeyer founded by rawlings in 1977 as a california chain of 
freshbaked cookie stores the company moved into selling frozen 
gourmet cookie dough wholesale in 1983 and now employs 250 people

only about a quarter of mexicos creditor 
banks submitted bids in a unique debtforsecurities swap aimed at 
reducing the nations 105 billion foreign debt according to the 
treasury department 
the government said thursday it had accepted 55 percent of the 
67 billion in bids that 139 creditor banks submittd under the 
swap plan which has been hailed by some as a major new initiative 
in dealing with troubled third world debtors 
under the plan the government will issue over 25 billion in 
new 20year bonds to its creditor banks to replace 366 billion 
in old bank debt a swap that will save mexico over 26 billion 
over 20 years 
mexico had invited its international bank creditors to trade 
their mexican loans at a discount for the 20year bonds which are 
backed by us treasury securities 
the plan unveiled last december was seen as a way of reducing 
the banks exposures to troubled mexican loans while minimizing the 
impact on the banks ledgers from having to write down the value of 
those loans 
but there were indications when the plan was announced that a 
number of major foreign lenders would not participate citibank 
for example indicated it was satisfied with its loan portfolio and 
viewed the swaps instead as a way for banks to get out of third 
world lending 
mexicos approximately 560 creditor banks had until feb 25 to 
submit their sealed bids to morgan guaranty trust co which acted 
as exchange agent for the plan 
of the 67 billion in bids received from 139 creditor banks 
mexico accepted bids representing 366 billion in old loans at an 
average discount exchange rate of just over 69 cents on the dollar 
the treasury department said 
the remaining 45 percent of the bids were rejected because they 
sought a price for the old debt that was higher than that sought by 
the government the department said 
by agreeing to issue the 2557 billion in new bonds mexico 
will reduce its debt principal by 1108 billion it also will save 
1537 billion in interest over the 20year term of the bonds for 
a total savings of 2645 billion 
the government will back the bond issue by buying 520 million 
in zerocoupon us treasury bonds it had been prepared to invest 
up to 2 billion to purchase up to 10 billion of the us 
securities 
the department did not identify the banks which had bids 
accepted or detail the amounts 
it did state that the government would continue to actively 
explore new mechanisms to reduce its external debt 
it is hoped that in the futureinternational financial 
organizations can play a more active role in designing and 
assisting other solutions to alleviate the weight of the debt 
the department stated

robert j birnbaum is stepping down as president 
and chief operating officer of the new york stock exchange when his 
contract expires at the end of may and will be succeeded by 
executive vice president richard a grasso 
birnbaum 60 who became nyse president in 1985 after eight 
years as president of the american stock exchange said in a 
statement thursday that he is interested in pursuing other 
interests and opportunities including membership on corporate 
boards and possibly an association with a major law firm 
his successor grasso 41 is a 20year veteran of the nyse who 
has served as its executive vice president for capital markets 
since 1986 and is a member of the exchanges management committee 
there was no indication that birnbaums departure was related to 
the oct 19 stock market collapse when the nyse was strained to 
the breaking point by the plunge in prices and an unprecedented 
volume of trading 
nyse chairman john j phelan jr stated that bob birnbaum has 
been a valuable asset to the new york stock exchange during one of 
the most turbulent periods in its history 
his many years of experience in operations and extensive 
knowledge of securities industry issues contributed significantly 
to the nyses ability to operate smoothly and efficiently during 
the market crisis phelan said 
grasso is known for his expertise with the exchanges computers 
and communications systems which are becoming increasingly 
critical he is responsible for upgrades of the systems that will 
allow the nyse to manage volume of 600 million shares a day by june 
as efficiently as it manages 225 million shares currently 
in an interview grasso said the exchange is working with member 
firms to remove bottlenecks so that the whole trading system will 
be able to handle 600 million shares a day the record volume of 
last oct 19 and 20 
i cant give you the categorical statement that all 600 member 
firms will be at the point where we will be by june but progress 
is being made grasso said 
phelan said in a statement that it is imperative that the 
president and chief operating officer of the nyse be thoroughly 
familiar with these systems 
the nyse said grasso was designated by the board of directors on 
thursday and would be formally elected on june 2

unexpected strength in passenger traffic during 
a typically weak travel season has prompted major airlines to raise 
fares twice in recent weeks 
continental airlines initiated the latest move on thursday 
boosting oneway regular coach fares in amounts ranging from 7 for 
short flights to 45 for longer trips 
continental also tightened restrictions on some of its discount 
fares used by business travelers effective march 15 they will 
have to book tickets four to seven days in advance and pay a 25 
percent cancellation or change penalty 
american united and northwest airlines immediately announced 
they would match continentals regular coachfare increases in 
markets where they compete other carriers were expected to do 
likewise 
under the revised fare structure for example a oneway regular 
coach ticket from new york to denver rose from 350 to 395 a 
oneway coach ticket from newark nj to rochester ny rose from 
118 to 125 
last month airlines raised their deepest discount fares by 
about 10 per round trip partly because of surprisingly higher 
passenger traffic in january airline traffic rose about 4 percent 
more than most industry analysts had expected february traffic 
also appeared to be strong 
american for example reported a 257 percent jump in passenger 
traffic for the month over a year earlier and said it flew a record 
461 billion revenue passenger miles a revenue passenger mile 
represents one paying passenger flown one mile an important 
measurement of an airlines business continental said february 
traffic increased 88 percent over a year earlier 
airline traffic ordinarily slows in the winter which prompts 
carriers to woo travelers with farecuts concern about a winter 
slump intensified after the october stock market crash which 
raised fears that leisure and business travel would decline 
industry analysts have attributed the surprisingly strong growth 
in airline traffic to eased concern about the impact of the stock 
crash they also say the dollars lower value has attracted 
thousands of europeans to the united states where they can exploit 
the buying power of their stronger currencies 
the fare increases announced thursday helped boost airline 
stocks on wall street reflecting an investor belief that earnings 
would benefit if greater numbers of passengers are paying more

batus inc said it launched a 45 
billion hostile tender offer for farmers group inc because the 
insurance giants board of directors declined to negotiate over 
batus earlier 42 billion proposal 
batus began the 63 a share offer on thursday sweetening its 
initial unsolicited 60 a share proposal that farmers had rejected 
on jan 20 as inadequate 
a spokesman for los angelesbased farmers the nations 
seventhlargest insurer said that while the farmers board would 
consider the higher price this highly conditional offer changes 
very little 
wall street reacted to the latest development by sending the 
price of farmers stock up 75 cents to 6275 per share on the 
overthecounter market 
in a statement batus chairman patrick sheehy said the tender 
offer represents a pemium of 47 percent over the 43 price at 
which farmers shares closed on the day before our initial 
proposal 
he said batus would be willing to meet farmers directors at any 
time to discuss all terms of the proposal 
one new york analyst who has followed the maneuvering said 
batus latest attempt may be a ploy to get some action out of 
farmers they have been sitting there ignoring everything that is 
done 
i wouldnt be surprised to see a further offer down the 
line said d gordon luce of brown brothers harriman 
other analysts had said previously that batus needed to sweeten 
its offer by 5 to 20 a share before farmers would consider it 
the tender offer was conditioned upon batus obtaining at least 
51 percent of farmers 69 million outstanding shares and on batus 
gaining required state regulatory approval the offer expires march 
30 
batus is a subsidiary of britishbased bat industries plc a 
tobacco retailing and insurance conglomerate 
batus announced last month that it had lined up a 32 billion 
revolving line of credit from an international group of banks for 
use in its takeover bid 
after rejecting batuss 60 a share offer farmers chairman leo 
denlea jr said his shareholders would be best served if the 
company remained independent 
farmers has about 11 billion in assets mostly in insurance it 
ranks third in the united states in home and auto insurance behind 
state farm and allstate and is the seventhlargest property and 
casualty insurance company

five directors of kaisertech ltd have 
filed suit against alan clore the companys chairman to keep him 
from turning over control of the board to houston financier charles 
hurwitz 
the lawsuit filed thursday in alameda county superior court 
was the second against clore involving kaisertech in three days on 
tuesday the worlds fifthlargest aluminum maker sued the british 
investor for illegal insider stock trading 
among the minority group of directors that sued clore on 
thursday was retired kaiser chairman cornell maier the suit said 
that clores resignation is in order because of an alleged 
breach of contract 
clore agreed earlier this week to sell his 321 percent stake in 
kaisertech for up to 234 million to hurwitz who acquired pacific 
lumber co in 1986 
the five directors wanted clore to sell his shares more broadly 
they also are concerned that all board positions expire in may 
the minority directors claim clore has breached the socalled 
clore agreement which gave clore the right to nominate a majority 
of the board in exchange for a 140 million investment last year 
they said in the lawsuit that driven by his financial 
desperation and in violation of delaware law and his agreement 
with kaisertech clore has entered into agreements with hurwitz 
under which clore will pretend to nominate his own slate of 
directors but in fact will nominate only those hurwitz selects 
in plain english the suit continued the foregoing 
agreements and schemes are a sham designed to enable hurwitz to 
obtain board control all without stockholder approval 
clore and his lawyers could not be reached for comment on the 
suit a representative for hurwitz not a defendant in the 
complaint said the suit is without merit 
besides maier those suing include stephen hutchcraft corporate 
president under maier and now president of kaisertechs only 
operating subsidiary kaiser aluminum john beckett retired 
transamerica corp chairman and the bankamerica corp director who 
helped persuade tom clausen to return as chairman of the san 
franciscobased bank corporation charles lynch chairman of dhl 
worldwide express in redwood city and john merow kaisers former 
vice chairman all but lynch were directors under maier

a federal judge has ruled that trans 
world airlines did not bargain in bad faith to precipitate and 
prolong a 1986 strike by flight attendants a decision that could 
save the airline 300 million 
the ruling thursday went against the independent federation of 
flight attendants which represents about 5000 twa flight 
attendants who were seeking reinstatement with back pay to the jobs 
they lost in the strike 
us district judge howard f sachs rejected contentions by the 
union that twa and its largest shareholder carl icahn bargained 
in bad faith in violation of federal labor laws to precipitate the 
bitter 72day walkout the union demanded its jobs back with back 
pay at prestrike wage rates 
union president vicki frankovich said she was disappointed by 
the judges ruling but was confident we will win on appeal 
if sachs order is upheld upon appeal it will lift from the 
airline a potential financial liability that has been accumulating 
at the rate of 8 million to 15 million a month since the strike 
began march 7 1986 
we are very pleased the court made this decision icahn 
said we try to be fair to our employees we tried to negotiate 
with iffa we are happy the court vindicated us 
icahn said the decision would not alter twas financial plans 
because we never put any reserves aside because we always thought 
we could win it 
the walkout began after icahn bargained unsuccessfully for 
costsaving concessions from the union freed from the supervision 
of a federal mediator who could not resolve the differences icahn 
cut flight attendant wages by 22 percent increased working hours 
and changed work rules the union struck 
twa hired 2700 new flight attendants to replace the strikers 
about 1300 attendants resigned from the union crossed its picket 
lines and continued to work 
on may 17 1986 the union offered unconditionally to return to 
work without a contract 
in one of several lawsuits it filed the union alleged that the 
airline had bargained in bad faith to bring about and prolong the 
strike 
while chastising both sides for their sometimes angry and 
abrasive conduct in negotiations particularly icahn for allegedly 
sexist comments sachs found that the actions of the airline were 
legal responses to economic conditions 
i cannot conclude from the evidence presented that twas 
bargaining was in bad faith the judge wrote in his 78page 
opinion 
sachs said case law permitted an aggressive union to bargain for 
benefits that will increase an employers costs an aggressive 
employer can lawfully bargain for reductions in total expenses of a 
group thought to be considerably overpaid and much less productive 
than is feasible he said 
sachs went on to say that it is not a function of the court to 
insist that an employer cheerfully accept strike losses or show 
generosity in victory

a flight attendants union official said today 
that transportation department plans to test airline crews and 
ground workers for drug use would be unfair and unnecessary 
but transportation secretary james burnley defended the proposal 
announced thursday saying he did not want to wait until hundreds 
of people are killed before taking action to stop any potential 
problem 
vicky francovich president of the independent federation of 
flight attendants said that in the 50year history of the 
industry there have been no accidents blamed on employee drug use 
ms francovich interviewed with burnley on abctvs good 
morning america said the department should be looking for ways 
to combat fatigue among overworked airline personnel and to tighten 
certification procedures 
i think there are more responsible ways to deal with the 
problems she said adding that false positive drug tests could 
lead to an unfair stigma against an employee 
while the government is not dealing with problems in the 
deregulated industry it is attacking a problem here that 
doesnt really exist she said this is not a necessary 
approach 
burnley acknowledged that no airline accidents have been traced 
to drug use but he cited a pittsburgh press survey showing that 
six hospital emergency rooms had treated 23 cockpit crew members or 
flight attendants for drug overdoses 
burnley who was also interviewed on cbs this morning said 
one airline reported that 16 percent of job applicants for 
mechanics jobs were found to be using drugs and at another 
airline 6 percent of flight attendant applicants were drug users 
he did not name the airlines 
there is nothing beyond that anecdotal evidence that would 
indicate that the airline industry is somehow exempt from this 
problem that is plaguing all of american society so i think its 
pretty clear that we need to move in this area he said 
burnley said he expects a final rule to be implemented before 
the end of the year despite several pending court challenges to 
mandatory drug testing 
testing would cover the more than half a million commercial 
aviation employees who hold safetysenstive jobs from pilots and 
flight attendants to mechanics and security workers at airport 
checkpoints 
a fact sheet provided by the department suggested as many as 75 
percent of the 511000 workers who would be subject to the tests 
might show evidence of drug use but burnley sought to distance 
himself from the estimate saying it was included only as a means 
of roughly estimating the possible cost of such a program and not 
meant to indicate the extent of drug use in the industry 
the pilots and otherairline unions promised to challenge any 
random drug testing rule in court once it is made final drug 
testing already is the subject of numerous lawsuits and several 
federal courts of appeal have either upheld testing or knocked it 
down 
we cant wait for weeks and months while these drug testing 
cases wind themselves through the courts burnley said 
in addition to pilots and flight attendants the testing 
requirements would cover aircraft mechanics other cockpit crew 
member such as flight engineers and navigators aircraft 
dispatchers and security personnel who work at screening 
checkpoints at airports 
under the proposal employees would be subject to a 
preemployment test periodic testing whenever a person is taking a 
physical postaccident testing and random testing as well as test 
for reasonable cause an employee would be subject to an initial 
test on a sample of urine and a more sophisticated test if the 
first test shows the presence of drugs

toshio naito the current account includes services and investment 
income as well as merchandise trade

percent from its level a year earlier marking the seventh 
consecutive monthly decline naito 
the seasonally adjusted surplus in merchandise trade a narrower 
measure came to 458 billion down from 570 billion last 
january and 1006 billion in december naito said it was the 
seventh straight monthly decline in the trade surplus compared to 
its yearearlier level 
imports of aluminum platinum textiles food and crude oil 
increased apparently because of the yens continued rise against 
the us dollar and stronger domestic demand naito said the 
higher yen has raised prices of japanese exports overseas and made 
imports cheaper encouraging japanese to buy more foreign goods 
in 1987s januarymarch quarter the current account surplus 
rose 655 percent from a year earlier on the other hand it 
declined 15 percent in the apriljune quarter yearonyear 132

year earlier 
toshiaki kakimoto chief economist for sumitomo bank ltd said 
januarys unadjusted 161 percent surge in exports was somewhat 
disturbing 
kakimoto said japanese exporters in part had boosted their 
shipments in december and january on fears the yen would rise 
against the dollar and make their products less competitive 
in a separate report the japan automobile importers 
association said imported cars sold in japan reached 8212 autos in 
february up 394 percent from the 5890 sold in the same month 
last year

a massive protest and other strong opposition 
from the united auto workers union influenced chrysler corps 
decision not to sell its acustar inc partsmaking subsidiary the 
automaker says 
chrysler said thursday it would keep acustar but would close or 
sell four plants within the next 18 months because of their 
competitive position 
the uaw had threatened plantbyplant strikes if chrysler sold 
the subsidiary which employs 28000 in the united states canada 
and mexico and had 3 billion in sales last year 
last thursday more than 1000 signwaving workers protested the 
proposed sale outside chryslers highland park headquarters 
furthermore workers at chrysler plants throughout the no 3 
automaker also had stopped attending managementunion meetings and 
participating in other joint activities since the automaker 
disclosed the possible sale 
that played a role chrysler spokesman john guiniven said of 
the companys decision workers stated very strongly that they 
wanted to remain a part of chrysler 
chrysler had said it was considering selling the subsidiary 
which represents a fifth of its worldwide operations because it 
didnt want to invest in the research needed to upgrade some 
operations chrysler already buys about 70 percent of its parts 
from outside sources 
the uaw had opposed the sale of acustar on the grounds that it 
would threaten the job security of all chrysler workers 
we looked at all the offers took into account the feelings of 
our employees and decided not to sell guiniven said 
we certainly welcome this announcement since we have 
maintained all along that chrysler is a stronger company with its 
own internal partsmaking capacity uaw president owen bieber and 
uaw vice president marc stepp said in joint statement 
chrysler said the four plants it plans to close or sell amplex 
van wert in van wert ohio trenton chemical in suburban detroit 
detroit forge and detroit trim employ about 2000 workers 
the largest of the four plants is detroit trim which employs 
1177 workers and makes trim for automobiles 
trenton chemical employs 189 and makes chemicals used in auto 
paints amplex van vert employs 333 and makes powered metal 
products and detroit forge employs 419 and makes forged parts 
we are going to sell all four and if not they will be 
closed guiniven said but we feel strongly that ampex and 
trenton chemical will be sold 
the union would not have been able to call a national strike 
over the sale of acustar but union locals were given permission to 
authorize strikes on a plantbyplant basis over unresolved issues 
such as health and safety grievances 
at least seven locals had voted to ask for strike authorization 
including workers at trenton chemical workers also had stopped 
participating in unionmanagement meetings at plants throughout 
chrysler in protest 
chrysler said it expected the companyunion joint activities 
suspended last month would resume in the wake of its decision 
bieber and stepp said they believed workers who had stayed away 
from the meetings probably would begin cooperating as a result of 
the decision 
the company also said it was ready to open negotiations for a 
national contract to replace the agreement that expires sept 14 
stepp said thursday he would recommend to the unions 140member 
chrysler council that negotiations which normally begin in 
midsummer be started early this year 
it surprised me a bit that they offered to open talks early 
but im very interested in getting a new agreement like ford and 
gm that covers workers being laid off by plant closings stepp 
said thursday night 
harley shaiken a professor and labor relations expert at the 
university of california at san diego said chrysler misjudged its 
workers when it said acustar was up for sale 
chrysler miscalculated thinking that they might only have 
problems with acustar workers he said instead acustar became 
a lightning rod for union discontent throughout the corporation

auctions which are designed to meet increased demand by selling 
governmentowned stocks of the grain 
the agency hit its target on tuesday but fell far short on 
wednesday easing fears among traders that the increased 
availability of wheat could depress cash prices another auction 
was scheduled for this afternoon

bonds prices tumbled in heavy trading and 
interest rates jumped sharply this morning in reaction to the 
governments surprisingly strong february employment report 
the treasurys key 30year issue fell more than 1 points or 15 
per 1000 in face amount its yield which moves inversely to 
price and is a barometer of interest rate trends surged to 844 
percent from 831 percent late thursday 
the deterioration is quite obviously a response to the 
employment situation said william sullivan director of money 
market research at the investment firm of dean witter reynolds inc 
the labor department said the economy created half a million 
jobs last month dropping the civilian unemployment rate to 57 
percent its lowest since the summer of 1979 the january rate had 
been 58 percent 
creditmarket analysts said the jobcreation figure was more 
than twice the general estimate and suggested there would be 
heightening demand for credit and rising inflation which depresses 
bond prices 
nevertheless some saw elements of weakness in the labor 
department report particularly a slowdown in the creation of 
manufacturing jobs suggesting future inventory buildups and 
production cutbacks 
after a detailed analysis of the report filtered through the 
bond market prices were likely to stabilize or recover somewhat 
some analysts speculated 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
governments fell point intermediate maturities fell one point 
and longterm issues fell more than 1 points the financial 
information service telerate inc reported 
the movement of a point equals a change of 10 in the price of a

movements on all outstanding treasury issues with maturities of a

treasury secretary james baker said today that 
the new commission created to find solutions to the governments 
huge budget deficits would be making a mistake if it became 
embroiled in electionyear politics 
the national economic commission was holding its initial meeting 
today behind closed doors with baker scheduled to address the 
group before entering the session baker told reporters he would 
urge the commission to keep a low profile during the 1988 
presidential campaign 
we will simply be making a point that the commission will be 
more effective if it is not politicized to be effective it should 
not be viewed as a political apparatus of the 1988 campaign 
baker said 
the treasury secretarys position has drawn criticism from one 
member of the commission house budget committee chairman william 
gray iii who on thursday charged that the white house was trying 
to dictate how the commission would function before it had even had 
its first organizational session 
he claimed that the administration in an effort to cover up its 
biggest economic failure was lobbying to keep the national 
economic commission under wraps until after the presidential 
election 
the blue ribbon panel which includes chrysler corp chairman 
lee iacocca and new york investment banker felix rohatyn as 
members was expected to select a chairman today 
sources close to the panel said robert strauss a washington 
lawyer and former head of the democratic national committee was a 
likely pick to head the group 
gray one of six democrats on the panel took issue thursday 
with remarks made by baker who had suggested that the commission 
should hold its deliberations in secret and not release any reports 
before the november presidential election 
baker had said earlier this week that the administration was 
eager for the commission to go to work but he also said that 
the commissions findings would carry more weight if the panel did 
not become embroiled in electionyear politics 
baker said the best way to avoid this was to meet in secret and 
not release any interim reports the panel which was created by 
congress is scheduled to present its final recommendations by 
march 1 of next year 
i dont think this commission should start off being dictated 
to by the white house gray told reporters someone is 
suggesting that we meet in a cave and roll a stone over the 
opening 
supporters of the deficit commission hope that because of its 
bipartisan nature it will be able to break the logjam which has 
prevented the government from crafting solutions to the budget 
deficit which this year is expected to top 150 billion 
gray suggested that baker and other republicans were trying to 
keep the commission under wraps so that it would not become a forum 
for airing the administrations biggest economic failure the 
doubling of the national debt 
i dont think it is appropriate for the white house to say 
there should be nothing said or done until they get out of town 
gray said that is like the guilty party saying dont hand down 
sentence until we leave town 
the commission is considered by many to be the best hope the 
next president will have to reach a quick consensus with congress 
on significant ways to reduce the budget deficit

mailing a letter will soon cost 25 cents 3 
cents more than at present 
the independent postal rate commission today recommended a 
series of postage increases including boosting the price of a 
firstclass stamp from 22 cents to a quarter 
a final decision on implementing the new rates is up to the 
board of governors of the us postal service which requested the 
increases 10 months ago calling for a 25cent stamp for first 
class mail 
the detailed and complex package of rate hikes recommended by 
the rate commission included increases in most classes of mail the 
postal service had wanted increases averaging 16 percent 
the new rate decision called for 
raising the rate for post cards from 14 cents to 15 cents the 
postal service had requested a 16cent rate 
increasing the secondclass rate for periodicals from 91 cents 
to 98 cents per pound and the peritem rate from a range of 31 to 
49 cents to a range of 49 to 59 cents 
for thirdclass advertising mail the minimum bulk rate would 
rise from 125 cents to 167 cents the nonprofit minimum would 
rise from 85 cents to 90 cents 
the postal rate commission also recommended establishing a 
special type of mail to give consumers a break in paying bills or 
answering advertisements 
the commission urged the postal service to come up with a 
discount from regular firstclass rates for such mail but did not 
propose a particular amount 
the rate decision did however suggest giving businesses a 
twocent cut from the present sevencent minimum in their cost for 
businessreply envelopes that the agency said would encourage 
the use of such envelopes 
the last increase in postage rates was feb 17 1985 when 
firstclass stamps climbed to 22 cents 
the planned higher rates are not related to recent cutbacks in 
postal hours and collections which resulted from budget cuts 
mandated by congress in december 
the commission ruling will go to the postal service board of 
governors probably early next week it can put the new rate into 
effect within a few weeks institute the rates under protest or ask 
the rate commission for reconsideration depending on its opinion 
of the recommendation 
because it had no way of knowing what new rates the commission 
would settle on the postal service has printed nondenominated 
stamps to cover eny eventuality 
when the new rates take effect the first class stamp will carry 
the letter e the stamp carries a colorful spacebased image of 
the earth and the word domestic to indicate that it can be 
used only within the united states not for mail going to other 
countries 
the same procedure was used the last four times rates were 
raised with those undenominated stamps all carrying images of 
eagles and the letters a through d 
in seeking the rate hike postal officials noted that the agency 
is required to break even it lost more than 220 million last year 
after the postal service was made an independent agency in the 
early 1970s its taxpayer subsidy was eliminated 
john n griesemer chairman of the postal services board of 
governors said the proposed increase should cost the average 
individual less than 10 per year 
in addition to raising the price of a firstclass stamp from 22 
cents to 25 cents the postal service proposed a multitude of 
changes in its complex structure of rates for the various types of 
mail 
prices for the expensive but highly competitive overnight mail 
would drop somewhat for example while rates for advertising bulk 
mail would rise 
the postal service has been in the black five of the last 10 
years it finished 1986 with a 305 million surplus after an 
intensive campaign to cut costs but had losses of 200 million or 
more in both 1985 and 1987 
in addition to increasing the firstclass base rate to 25 cents 
the postal service called for an increase in the charge for each 
additional ounce of weight for first class mail from 17 cents to 20 
cents post cards would increase from 14 cents to 16 cents

president reagans fiscal 1989 budget would 
leave a federal deficit of 165 billion 35 billion higher than 
the white house says the congressional budget office reported 
today 
most of the difference results from the administrations more 
optimistic view of the economy said james blum acting director of 
the nonpartisan agency in testimony to the senate appropriations 
committee 
cbo foresees less rapid real growth higher inflation and 
higher interest rates said blum who defended his agencys 
prognosis as in line with private forecasts 
the projection provoked sen ted stevens ralaska to express 
frustration over the differences between the cbo and administration 
forecasts 
why havent you gotten together with omb the office of 
management and budget he asked 
blum noted that over the years white house economic forecasts 
have been more optimistic than those coming from cbo and said 
choosing between them is a political judgment call congress 
must make 
the congressional agency also sees federal programs including 
entitlement programs as costing more than the administration 
predicts in its 11 trillion plan he said 
the administrations budget would cut the projected deficits 
only modestly said blum fiscal 1989 red ink would be 12 
billion higher or 177 billion if the presidents proposals or 
other deficit reduction were not enacted he said 
the house and senate budget committees will soon begin drafting 
their versions of the governments spending program however they 
are not expected to do more deficit cutting this year than the 
president proposed since his plan was crafted under the guidelines 
of a budget agreement he reached last fall with congressional 
leaders 
the cbo estimates that the economy will grow 18 percent in 
calendar 1988 and 26 percent in 1989 compared with white house 
growth predictions of 24 percent and 35 percent the cbo also 
sees consumer prices rising more quickly with higher interest 
rates and higher unemployment 
lower growth cuts into tax revenue projections while higher 
interest rates force the government to pay more to finance its 
programs 
the grammrudman law calls for slashing the deficit to 136 
billion in the fiscal year beginning oct 1 as an interim step 
toward a balanced budget by fiscal 1993 it also mandates 
automatic broadbased spending cuts if congress and the president 
dont approve legislation to come within 10 billion of the target 
the cbos projections show those targets being missed by a large 
margin but the congressional agencys figures carry little legal 
weight since official grammrudman estimates are done by the white 
house alone a revised version of grammrudman approved last year 
left the cbo in only an advisory capacity 
the cbos latest revised projections show deficits higher than 
the administration estimates from this year straight through fiscal 
1993 the white house predicts only 23 billion in red ink 
remaining by then while cbo estimates an annual deficit still in 
excess of 100 billion 
longrange economic estimates can vary widely but the cbo and 
the white house deficit estimates also show a wide gap in the 
current fiscal year which is nearly half over 
the white house predicts 147 billion in red ink for fiscal 
1988 which ends sept 30 while cbo figures 161 billion will be 
added to the national debt

savings bank last july faces one count of obstruction of justice 
two counts of perjury and one count of encouraging perjury said 
assistant us attorney gary c crossen 
he also was charged with one count each of insider trading wire 
fraud and mail fraud in a federal indictment today in new haven 
conn 
arthur silverman 62 a west hartford conn stockbroker was 
charged with one count of perjury in the boston indictment and the 
same three counts as digennaro today in new haven silverman was 
not in court in boston to enter a plea 
digennaro who was arraigned in boston before us magistrate 
joyce london alexander pleaded innocent on all four charges and 
was released on his own recognizance his travel was restricted to 
within new england and he was ordered not to try to obtain a 
passport crossen said 
it was not immediately clear if silverman and digennaro had 
entered pleas to the charges in new haven 
the charges are came out of a federal securities and exchange 
commission investigation into the merger between suffield savings 
and coastal bank of portland maine 
the boston charges were based on allegedly perjured testimony by 
the two men before sec officials in boston in 1987 
us attorney frank mcnamara said his office is conducting a 
comprehensive investigation into insider trading across new england 
mcnamara said no one involved in the case made more than 50000 
and that the total amount of profit was in the midsix figures 
you dont have to be an ivan boesky to be concerned about the 
problem of insider trading mcnamara said insider trading and 
perjury in the whitecollar world of the kind we deal with is a 
problem federal authorities in new england are going to ferret 
out 
crossen said a federal investigation of digennaro on insider 
trading charges is pending in the us attorneys new haven conn 
office 
according to the indictments digennaro was not personally 
involved in insider trading but did profit from the alleged deals 
it said silverman purchased more than 2000 shares of coastal stock 
for clients and family members in the days leading up to the merger 
the indictments charge digennaro with providing a number of 
people with secret information about the merger while he was 
discussing the possibility of a merger with coastal between 
february 1986 and july 1986 when the sale became public 
based on information they got from digennaro a number of people 
purchased stock in coastal before the announcement of the merger 
the indictments say the indictments said silverman learned about 
the secret merger discussions from a man who said he got his 
information from digennaro 
each count carries a penalty of up to five years in prison and a 
250000 fine 
suffield savings was purchased by coastal on july 9 1986 for 
52 million or 40 a share authorities began investigating the 
case because the day before the merger coastal stock rose 2 a 
share on heavy trading to close at 3125 the stock rose another 
3 a share the day the merger was announced

japans toshiba corp sold machines for making 
computer parts to czechoslovakia and east germany but broke off a 
third deal last summer after it was discovered by us officials 
according to congressional sources 
a pentagon spokesman denied that the deals had occurred but 
several members of congress said intelligence analysts have 
prepared reports that the illegal technology transfers did take 
place 
toshiba has been involved over the last seven years in 
enhancing the microchip capability of the warsaw pact nations 
said an aide to rep duncan hunter rcalif 
the aide who spoke on condition of anonymity said he had no 
direct knowledge of classified reports from the central 
intelligence agency and the military defense intelligence agency 
those reports were described in todays editions of the 
washington times another congressional source also speaking on 
condition of anonymity confirmed those allegations which come six 
months after toshiba admitted that a subsidiary had sold the soviet 
union machine tools for making quiet submarine propellers thereby 
neutralizing a portion of us antisubmarine defenses 
according to congressional sources toshiba sold czechoslovakia 
a complete factory in 1979 to make computer chips sold east 
germany a similar but more advanced computerchip assembly line in 
1986 and negotiated a deal for a second assembly line in east 
germany in 1987 
the deals have become known as toshiba 2 toshiba 3 and toshiba 
4 toshiba 1 is the submarine case 
a pentagon spokesman col arnold williams said that the 
information that we have is that we feel these actions toshiba 2 
3 and 4 have not occurred 
williams said he was unable to discuss the cia and dia reports 
officials in the office of stephen bryen the deputy 
undersecretary of defense for trade security also declined to 
discuss the allegations 
according to congressional sources the czechoslovak deal was of 
questionable legality and the 1986 east germany deal was illegal 
under western export laws 
defenders say the first deal was legal the second never 
happened and in the third instance toshiba voluntarily acted out 
of publicrelations concerns to halt what would have been a legal 
sale 
toshiba attorney david houlihan called the allegations the 
result of a vendetta by a group of cia analysts against toshiba 
and japan according to the published report 
as a result of the sale to the soviet bloc house and senate 
conferees are working on a bill that could ban toshiba sales in the 
united states for two to five years said duncans aide 
the congressman has organized classified briefings for about 30 
lawmakers by cia and dia analysts who are convinced that the 
transactions did occur said the aide 
intelligence officials have confirmed them to our 
satisfaction said the aide 
there has been a lot of pressure from the administration not 
to damage trade relations with japan said the aide the strength 
of the conflict between the congress and the administration is 
intense

american standard inc today intensified a 
struggle to escape a hostile 21 billion takeover from black amp 
decker corp by sweetening a rival recapitalization plan that 
analysts valued at about 23 billion 
the move disclosed by the new yorkbased plumbing and air 
conditioning giant would add 5 cash to the payment of cash and 
securities that american standard has offered shareholders to woo 
them away from the 68ashare cash payment black amp decker has 
offered for each of the targets 31 million shares 
wall street analysts figured the sweetened american standard 
offer of 64 in cash 5 in debt securities and one share of stock 
in the recapitalized company was worth about 74 a share the 
companys stock surged 150 a share to 7012 on the new york 
stock exchange by early afternoon 
black amp decker a tool and appliance maker based in towson md 
said it was studying the sweetened american standard offer but had 
no other comment 
american standards move came a few days after it disclosed 
discussions with unidentified parties regarding the possible sale 
of debt securities to sweeten the cash portion of its 
recapitalization 
under the revised proposal american standard will sell 160 
million worth of debt securities to emerson electric co as part of 
the transaction american standard also will purchase some 
unidentified products from emerson a st louisbased maker of 
electronics tools and cooling and heating systems 
a recapitalization in which a company restructures its amount 
of debt and equity is used often to thwart unwelcome takeovers 
the strategy usually plunges a company into debt making it less 
attractive as an acquisition 
american standards revised plan which would raise the 
companys longterm debt from 412 million to about 246 billion 
would pay shareholders about 206 billion plus give them a stake 
in the recapitalized company 
black amp decker has been attempting since late january to acquire

the nations economy created half a million 
jobs last month dropping the civilian unemployment rate to 57 
percent its lowest since the summer of 1979 the government said 
today 
total employment grew by 280000 the labor departments monthly 
household survey said with the number of jobless americans falling 
by 108000 to 69 million 
januarys civilian jobless rate had been 58 percent 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater applauded the news 
saying that these strong employment gains confirm that the 
longest peacetime expansion in us history continued into its 63rd 
month jobs are the best indicator of a sound economy 
a separate survey of business payrolls showed a net increase of 
531000 jobs in february 40 percent of which were in service 
industries health services added 60000 workers while business 
services added 55000 
retail trade employment adjusted for seasonal variations 
climbed by 110000 despite evidence of declines in consumer 
spending 
the commissioner of labor statistics janet l norwood said the 
gains in retailtrade employment reflect postchristmas cutbacks 
this year that have been much smaller than usual 
the only service industries that did not show job gains were 
finance insurance and real estate in fiance which includes 
banks savings and loans and investment houses employment 
actually fell by 10000 after several months of minimal increases 
this probably resulted from the employment retrenchment 
following last octobers financial market upheavels ms norwood 
told the congressional joint economic committee 
meanwhile factory job growth which had been averaging 50000 
jobs a month moderated in february with a gain of just 20000 
employment in the furniture and electronic equipment industries 
fell by 3000 while automobile industry employment held steady at 
822000 
construction jobs jumped by 105000 after a drop of 60000 in 
the preceding month 
the percentage of the nations adult population with jobs rose 
to a record 622 percent in february the labor department said 
recent job growth has been particularly strong in the 
administrative and management areas accounting for more than 
onethird of the growth of 3 million jobs in total civilian 
employment over the last year 
the biggest beneficiary of that trend and the recent rebound in 
manufacturing and construction has been adult men whose jobless 
rate has dropped from 58 percent in february 1987 to 49 percent 
last month 
the jobless rate for women also at 58 percent a year ago was 
52 percent in february 
jobless rates for minority groups remained high despite the fact 
that blacks and hispanics have obtained one of every three new jobs 
over the last year 
black unemployment at 126 percent last month was more than 
double the 48 percent for whites hispanic unemployment after 
declining to 72 percent in january bounced back to 83 percent 
last month to return to the level that generally prevailed through 
most of the last half of 1987 
teenage unemployment fell from 160 percent to 154 percent last 
month among white teenagers the rate fell from 140 percent to 
124 percent among black teens the rate rose from 350 percent to 
383 percent 
an alternate jobless rate including the 17 million members of 
the uniformed armed services stationed in the united states also 
dropped 01 percentage point last month to 56 percent 
all the calculations are adjusted to discount for predictable 
periodic influences

with more than a halfmillion new jobs last 
month the nations civilian unemployment rate dropped to 57 
percent the government said friday indicating a much stronger 
us economy than most analysts had thought 
only once since 1974 in may 1979 when the rate was 56 percent 
has the percentage of jobless americans been lower with a 
onetenth percentage point drop from decembers and januarys 
jobless rates of 58 percent the rolls of the unemployed declined 
by 108000 in february to just over 69 million the lowest jobless 
number since early 1980 
the bureau of labor statistics said its survey of households 
showed 280000 more americans going to work last month with an 
alltime record 622 percent of the nations workingage population 
age 16 and over now holding jobs 
business and other employers reported in a separate survey 
increasing their payrolls by a net 531000 new jobs 115000 of 
them in business and health services 110000 in retail trade 
105000 in construction 68000 in government and 20000 in 
manufacturing 
these numbers have killed all discussion about no growth this 
quarter said james cochran chief economist for texas bancshares 
in houston 
the economy is doing pretty well cochran said and to 
everyones surprise the strength is coming from basic domestic 
activity rather than companies hiring people to produce things to 
sell overseas 
donald straszheim chief economist for merrill lynch said the 
february job numbers were the most surprising economic statistics 
he has ever seen 
theres 400000 more people working now than we had thought 
he said the housing market is weak construction is weak and 
except for automobiles consumers dont seem to be buying anything 
some of it just doesnt make any sense 
nonetheless straszheim joined a chorus of other economists in 
saying that the unemployment report effectively negates their 
earlier predictions of little or no economic growth this year 
this report makes it clear there is no recession in the 
cards said allen sinai chief economist for the boston co a 
new yorkbased financial consultant the real question is how 
much steam the economy will gather as incomes start flowing from 
this surge in jobs the future looks pretty bright 
the jobless report shines brightest on republican presidential 
candidates seeking to retain gop control of the white house the 
economic gurus agreed 
the economic statistic that has more political import than any 
other is unemployment said straszheim and this is a very 
strong report 
george bush ought to be running over to kiss the people at the 
bureau of labor statistics said david wyss chief financial 
economist of data resources inc of lexington mass people vote 
their pocketbooks and right now their pocketbooks look pretty 
full 
at the white house reagan administration officials also basked 
in the numbers 
both the february increase in employment and the decline in 
unemployment exceeded the expectations of private forecasters 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said jobs are the best 
indicator of a sound economy 
sinai said the unemployment rate down from a full percentage 
point from 12 months ago can only be a big plus for 
republicans 
it certainly doesnt argue that we need protectionism to help 
our job market said wyss referring to rep richard gephardts 
campaign theme for winning the democratic presidential nomination 
democrats however could utilize some of the figures in the 
report despite inflation running at an annual rate of 42 percent 
so far this year average wages dropped by 2 cents last month to 
912 an hour the bls said 
thats both bad and good news straszheim said if youre 
working it means your wages arent keeping you up but if youre 
fearful about inflation dont be 
the figures also indicate that 199000 of the 280000 increase 
in the number of americans holding jobs were people working 
parttime only because they could not find fulltime employment 
however the labor department said recent employment growth has 
been strongest in highwage administrative and management 
occupations accounting for more than onethird of the 3 million 
new jobs in the past year 
the biggest beneficiaries of that trend and the recent rebound 
in manufacturing and construction employment have been adult men 
whose jobless rate has dropped from 58 percent in february 1987 to 
49 percent last month 
the jobless rate for women also at 58 percent a year ago was 
52 percent in february 
jobless rates for minority groups remained high despite the fact 
that blacks and hispanics have obtained one of every three new jobs 
over the last year the government said 
black unemployment at 126 percent last month was more than 
double the 48 percent for whites hispanic unemployment after 
declining to 72 percent in january rose to 83 percent last month 
an alternate jobless rate including the 17 million members of 
the uniformed armed services stationed in the united states also 
dropped 01 percentage point last month to 56 percent

government and construction industry officials 
friday expressed regret over a us refusal to award a contract to 
a joint venture between japanese and american construction firms 
for a subway extension project in the united states 
it is indeed regrettable that a concerned japanese firm was 
excluded from an american public works project at a time when 
japanese and us officials in washington are discussing opening 
some of japans largescale construction projects to us firms 
said chief cabinet secretary keizo obuchi in a nationally televised 
news conference 
the washington metropolitan area transit authority thursday 
rejected a bid from kajima corp a major japanese contractor 
together with peter kiewit and sons corp of the united states to 
construct a 1200meter subway tunnel and station in washington 
dc officials said 
according to the japan broadcasting corp nhk it was the 
first time a japanese construction firm involved in bidding for an 
american public works project was rejected since the us congress 
last year passed legislation calling for reciprocity in awarding 
such contracts 
local reports said the bid by the two companies totaled 63 
billion yen or 488 million the lowest offer among an 
unspecified number of international bidders 
hajime sako chairman of the japan federation of construction 
contractors inc said in a statement that the fact that the 
japanese firms tender was actually canceled is extremely 
regrettable 
sako also chairman of taisei corp a major japanese 
construction firm said the local construction industry strongly 
hopes the latest us measure will be retracted as soon as 
possible and that such a measure which will adversely affect 
friendly japanus relations will not be taken again 
kishio nagayama president of kajima engineering and 
construction inc a wholly owned us subsidiary based in los 
angeles california that handled the latest bidding also 
expressed regret over the decision 
in a statement issued by the companys head office in tokyo 
nagayama said his company will decide how to respond by consulting 
with its us partner 
japanese and us officials resumed workinglevel talks in 
washington thursday to discuss access to japans largescale 
construction projects both sides failed to reach agreement in a 
previous meeting held in tokyo last month 
access to the japanese construction market has been a major 
trade issue in recent years between the two countries to date 
us firms have had access to only two semipublic projects in 
japan the tokyo bay bridge and the multibillion dollar kansai 
international airport project 
japanese firms won about 23 billion worth of contracts in the 
united states in 1986 while us companies did about 500 million 
dollars worth of business in japan according to construction 
officials

the centuryold wente bros winery has 
completed its first shipment of wine for japans bullet train the 
winery reported on friday 
the delivery to japan railways marks the first order of american 
wine by the toyota motor co according to debra sanchez 
spokeswoman for toyota motor sales usa 
its just the beginning she said the japanese are 
falling in love with california wines 
the first order was for 29000 minibottles of chablis blanc de 
blancs and white zinfandel chosen after exhaustive taste tests of 
the livermore winerys 14 wines said toyota motor sales usa 
vice president robert best 
exporting california wines to japan is another example of 
toyotas commitment to increase japanese purchases of us 
products said best 
im excited not only for wente brothers but the entire 
california wine industry said wente spokeswoman carolyn wente 
her ancestor carl wente acquired his first vineyards in livermore 
in 1883 growing sauvignon blanc and semillon grapes wente whites 
have been sold in the united states for 100 years 
the wines for japan were chosen for their expected popularity on 
the trains the choices virtually parallel american popular tastes 
the blanc de blancs is a light sweet blend that includes chenin 
blanc chablis is regarded around the world as the typical dry 
white table wine 
wente has been exporting small amounts of wine to japan for 20 
years but thwarted by extremely high tariffs that found a bottle of 
wine that sold for 4 in califoria selling for 1820 in japan the 
taxes were lowered a couple of years ago and the retail price in 
japan is now reported to be about double the california price 
the united states today already is the second largest exporter 
of wine to japan behind france with germany in third 
best said toyota acted in this instance as a broker ordering the 
wine exporting it and selling it to the railway in japan 
the 63ounce bottles will be sold on the 120 mph trains that 
travel from tokyo the wines will go for about 250 each he said 
toyota established a us exports office in 1985 to search out 
american products appropriate for the japanese market and to reduce 
the us deficit in the balance of payments best said wente is 
the first us wine taken on by toyota he said 
there has been a doubling in japanese consumption of wine over 
the last several years and wine sales have grown over 400 percent 
in the last five years said best

the us dollar fell against most major currencies 
in european trading friday gold prices rose nearly 10 an ounce in 
london and 3 in zurich 
merrill lynch metals specialist ted arnold said gold bullion 
climbed to 43750 bid per troy ounce because of a shortcovering 
rally and a dip in monthly us unemployment figures gold closed 
at 42780 an ounce late thursday 
he said the figures which showed that the february rate fell to 
57 percent from 58 percent in january rekindled fears of 
inflation 
in zurich gold rose less sharply to 432 bid an ounce from 
429 dollars on shortcovering prompted by gains in silver and 
platinum dealers said 
in a short sale traders sell borrowed gold in expectation of 
covering those sales by replacing the gold with new lots bought 
at cheaper prices 
foreign exchange dealers said us unemployment figures briefly 
pushed up the us currency but the improvement in the rate was not 
enough to have a lasting effect on the dollar 
in tokyo the dollar inched lower to a closing 12922 japanese 
yen from 12930 yen in london it fell further to 12895 yen 
other late dollar rates in europe compared with late thursday

the biggest investmentgrade corporate bond 
issue ever sold in the united states 11 billion in 10year 
notes went off with pictureperfect ease this past week 
and experts say they werent surprised since the seller was 
eastman kodak co which priced the issue generously to compensate 
for a recent drop in its credit rating 
a lot of people love to own the name explained anthony 
naylor a senior vice president in fixedincome securities for 
rodman amp renshaw inc but theyve always had to pay through the 
nose before 
the record issue undertaken partly to help finance kodaks 
recent 51 billion acquisition of sterling drug inc was priced 
at par to yield 9125 percent a percentage point more than 
comparable treasury securities 
the 10year notes are noncallable for seven years and rated a2 
by moodys investors service and aminus by standard amp poors corp 
both wall street rating services lowered kodaks senior debt 
rating in response to the sterling deal and legal problems with 
polaroid corp over an instant photography patent 
but analysts say that probably added to the allure of the 11 
billion issue because the lower the rating a company receives the 
higher the interest it must pay to compensate for the increased 
credit risk 
it was very generously priced said naylor of the notes 
noting that previous issues by the bluechip company have had a 
much narrower yield spread 
for instance kodaks 300 million in fouryear notes issued in 
october yielded 60 basis points above treasury securities with 
similar maturities and 125 million in fiveyear notes from last 
spring had only a 25basis point spread he said a basis point is 
onehundredth of a percentage point 
naylor said the fact that the issue was so large also 
contributed to its success since everyone can get in and play 
giving it plenty of liquidity or the ability to sell at any time 
without depressing the market price 
kodak also came out ahead by the fact that the bonds were sold 
at par or the full face amount in less successful deals bonds 
are sold at a discount to increase their attractiveness 
the rochester ny company originally had planned to sell only 
750 million in 10year notes but increased the size by 350 
million because of the strong demand by domestic institutions 
explained richard w swift a principal at morgan stanley amp co 
underwriters of the issue 
i think it was one of the hottest deals i ever experienced 
he said adding that one institution snapped up 75 million of the 
notes theres magic to the kodak name 
some analysts said the popularity of the issue could be read as 
a vote of confidence in kodaks management and its ability to 
digest the sterling deal which had been criticized as overly 
ambitious by some who follow the company 
before this past weeks issue the single largest issue by a 
us corporation with investmentgrade ratings came from occidental 
petroleum corp which sold 1 billion of debentures in march 1986 
swift said about two years earlier chevron corp sold 1 billion 
in threeyear notes he said 
kodak filed a shelf registration dec 30 with the securities and 
exchange commission for 15 billion worth of bonds the company 
has 400 million left from that registration

when new postage rates go into effect 
americans will be using special e stamps on an interim basis to 
mail firstclass letters 
the stamps were printed with the letter e on them instead of 
the amount of postage because the new firstclass rate was not 
known 
the postal rate commission on friday suggested postage rate 
increases that included a 25cent firstclass stamp but those 
recommendations still must be accepted by the postal service board 
of governors the new rates could go into effect in 10 days to two 
weeks after a decision is made perhaps as early as next week 
a similar procedure has been used four times in the past 
although the basic design of the undenominated stamp has changed 
the a b c and d stamps all showed the head of an eagle each 
in a different color 
the e stamp carries a multicolored spacebased image of the 
plant with the word earth printed beneath 
the stamp also carries the notation domestic since it can be 
used only for mail within the country mail traveling to other 
nations requires stamps that show their demoninations

international business machines corp confirmed 
friday it has discussed a deal involving its new personal computer 
line with siemens ag of west germany but said the executive who 
made the talks public feels his comment on siemens was premature 
and inappropriate 
ibms unusual statement was in reaction to an article friday in 
the wall street journal that quoted william c lowe the vice 
president in charge of personal computers on ibms plans for its 
personal system2 line 
siemens executives were very disturbed by what appeared in the 
journal but the statement friday will probably help matters 
said martin weitzner a spokesman for siemens us operations 
according to the journal lowe said that if a pact was reached 
siemens would either license or buy from ibm the crucial parts of 
ibms ps2 line and incorporate them into its own computers lowe 
said it was even possible that some companies might buy ps2 
computers whole and sell them under their own labels 
the journal said ibm was in similar talks with ing c olivetti 
amp co of italy but ibm said that lowe had only mentioned olivetti 
as an example of a company that could be considered 
such deals would be a major departure for ibm which 
traditionally keeps a tight grip on its own technology but they 
might benefit the company by helping establish the personal 
system2 as an industry standard

irving bank corp the target of a hostile 108 
billion takeover bid said friday it plans to appeal the federal 
reserve boards recent decision to allow a proposed merger with 
bank of new york co 
irving filed a notice of appeal in the us court of appeals for 
the district of the columbia earlier this week saying it would ask 
the court to reviw the central banks decision irving spokesman 
don phelps said 
he said irving also asked the fed to delay the effect of its 
ruling until the appeals court can review it 
irving has rejected takeover efforts by bank of new york which 
has offered 60 a share in cash and securities for irvings 181 
million common shares 
the takeover fight launched last fall has attracted attention 
because hostile acquisitions are unusual in banking some analysts 
speculate that if it succeeds it may encourage other unsolicited 
takeovers in the banking industry 
the fed and the new york state banking board concluded last 
month that a merger of the two new york banks wouldnt hurt 
competition in the nations biggest financial center 
the central bank said federal law does not draw any 
distinction between acquisitions that are agreed to between the 
parties and those where as here there is no agreement 
a merger would create the nations 12th largest banking company 
with assets of nearly 12 billion

northwest airlines flew two 
unairworthy jetliners improperly delayed aircraft repairs and 
broke other safety rules the federal aviation administration said 
friday 
the faa made disclosures with the release of 110page report 
detailing a monthlong investigation of the airlines operations 
the report drew no overall conclusion and an faa spokesman at its 
suburban chicago office said the minneapolisbased carrier had a 
very good safety record 
however the faa report said the airline also failed to ensure 
pilots flew no longer than allowed and did not keep proper records 
of repairs classifying some major repairs as minor 
northwest acknowledged in a statement that the faa inspection 
identified 139 findings or areas of concern some of which 
could result in enforcement actions 
of course any finding is of concern to us and as a result 
we have told the faa we will respond completely to each and every 
one of the findings on march 25 said benjamin g griggs jr 
northwests executive vice president of operations 
at least two northwest airlines jetliners both dc10s flew 
several flights between jan 1 and feb 11 in an unairworthy 
condition the report said 
one of the jets flew while missing a small inspection cover 
on top of an engine pylon the report said a second jet flew 
several trips even though the crew failed to neutralize or 
identify the exact cause of a problem with a gauge monitoring the 
speed of an engine turbine 
this is not something that would make an airplane fall out of 
the sky said faa spokesman mort edelstein 
faa authorities studied northwests operations from jan 20 to 
feb 19 as part of an industrywide program of conducting indepth 
inspections of all major airlines edelstein said 
edelstein said the faa would make no decision on whether to fine 
northwest until the airline had a chance to respond and the 
inspection report had been reviewed several times by agency 
officials 
a similar inspection at eastern airlines two years ago led to 
fines totaling 95 million for hundreds of violations mostly 
involving maintenance discrepancies pan am world airways was fined 
195 million in 1986 
despite the safety violations identified at northwest edelstein 
said the airline has a very good safety record they fully 
complied with the safety inspection 
northwest said the findings of the final inspection are likely 
to change after it responds to the faa report which the agency 
said was still being checked for accuracy 
a number of items already have been resolved griggs said 
in our view some of the findings are subject to interpretation 
and we will address these with our faa inspectors 
the faa inspectors found that northwest does not have a system 
to monitor flight and duty time for management pilots to ensure 
compliance with flight time limitations 
in another violation the faa found that the pilot in command of 
northwest flight 49 on feb 10 smoked a cigarette while the no 
smoking light was on 
the inspection also found evidence of deferred maintenance the 
report said for example that a boeing 757 was operated from nov 
1 through jan 7 while having problems with its auxiliary power 
unit repairs on the unit were deferred 13 times before the 
equipment was replaced the report said 
the report found that northwest flight dispatchers were burdened 
with an excessive workload and contended the airline does not 
provide enough qualified dispatchers at each dispatch center to 
ensure proper operational control of each flight 
edelstein and northwest noted that the airline had conducted a 
fivemonth internal audit before the faa inspection began 
the report said northwests own audit could serve as an 
industry model and enabled the faa to conduct a much more 
thorough and comprehensive inspection than would otherwise have 
been possible 
northwest which calls itself the nations fifth largest 
carrier serves 135 cities in 21 countries in asia europe and 
north america the company acquired republic airlines in 1986 and 
has a fleet of 313 aircraft

here are some of the findings released 
friday by the federal aviation administration from its report on 
the results of a monthlong inspection of minneapolisbased 
northwest airlines 
in the area of operations the inspectors found that 
northwest airlines inc does not provide enough qualified 
dispatchers at each dispatch center to ensure proper operational 
control of each flight anonymous letters phone calls and flight 
crew complaints that dispatcher workloads were excessive and that 
the monitoring of flight progress was untimely were substantiated 
by observations of faa inspectors at both the tokyo and minneapolis 
dispatch centers 
in several instances northwest pilots flew more than 30 hours 
during a sixday period faa regulations prohibit pilots from 
flying more than 30 hours in a sevenday period 
on seven flights the weight and balance information and 
flight release data did not accurately reflect the total number of 
infantscrew memberspassengers 
the first officer on northwest airlines flight 455 on 
21288 did not have in his personal possession an appropriate 
current medical certificate nor a current pilot certificate 
northwest has no provisions in their flight training program 
to check an individual pilots proficiency in handflying a 
nonprecision approach 
in the area of airworthiness the inspectors found that 
on jan 14 a northwest dc10 pilot indicated a small 
inspection cover on top of no 3 engine pylon was missing the 
jetliner flew in an unairworthy condition from 11488 until 
2388 when the inspection cover was properly replaced 
the airline flew a dc10 in an unairworthy condition several 
flights between 2188 and 21188 because it failed to 
neutralize or identify the exact cause of a problem with a gauge 
that monitored turbine speed in the jets no 3 engine 
a boeing 747 experienced over 40 repeat discrepancies 
relating to performance problems on installed engines during 
this period from sept 27 1987 through jan 13 one fuel control 
and two engines were replaced

a bushel friday on the chicago board of trade in a late selloff 
led by large investment funds grain futures closed mixed to lower 
a combination of bearish factors including weak export demand 
and expectations of a large south american soybean harvest had 
weighed on the soybean market for most of the week 
heavy selling of soybean futures by the chicagobased 
professional trading firm campd commodities late in fridays session 
sparked fear among other traders that soybean futures prices had 
reached a seasonal peak analysts said 
what youre really getting here is a delayed winter break that 
was expected back in january or february and its coming now 
said richard loewy an analyst for prudentialbache securities inc 
wheat futures were supported by some new export bids and by news 
that the agriculture department had sold much less surplus wheat 
than expected in an auction on wednesday 
corn exports were down for the week which set a bullish tone 
for corn futures loewy said 
at the close wheat was cent lower to 1 cent higher with the 
contract for delivery in march at 303 a bushel corn was 1 
cents to 2 cents lower with march at 199 a bushel oats were

takeover battles for retail companies mostly 
dormant after the stock market crash exploded into outandout war 
this past week as rh macy amp co inc and campeau corp fought 
over who will acquire federated department stores inc 
macy and campeau had competing tender offers for federateds 
stock and although macy and federated signed a definitive 
agreement by weeks end no one was sure who would win 
federated the nations fifthlargest retailer is a likely 
takeover target the company owns more than 650 department 
specialty and discount stores and supermarkets including the 
bloomingdales burdines lazarus and bullocks department store 
chains 
mergers and acquisitions in retailing and other industries were 
sharply curtailed after the oct 19 stock market collapse many 
pending takeover attempts were abandoned including dart group 
corps 662 billion bid for dayton hudson corp the nations 
sixthlargest retailer 
but several factors have combined to revitalize takeovers in 
many business sectors 
relatively low stock prices have lured companies into starting 
tender offers said peter solomon cohead of investment banking 
for shearson lehman hutton inc 
retail stock prices began to slip before the crash and remain 
depressed now because of sluggish consumer spending a lower stock 
price makes it easier for a prospective suitor to finance a 
takeover 
the lower dollar has made american companies a relative bargain 
for foreigners such as australias hooker corp ltd which in 
recent months has acquired b altman amp co in new york and sakowitz 
inc in houston 
there are political factors too including the upcoming 
presidential election said monroe h greenstein a retail industry 
analyst for the investment firm bear stearns amp co inc 
you have an administration here that has a very liberal 
interpretation of antitrust laws which means theyre almost not 
enforced said greenstein 
no matter who succeeds ronald reagan in the white house it is 
doubtful the relaxed attitude will survive the change in 
administrations so many wouldbe acquirers want to buy companies 
while there is a more favorable climate greenstein said 
in addition more and more states are passing antitakeover 
laws and investors want to make their acquisitions before it 
becomes too difficult he said 
for existing retail companies buying another retailer means 
immediate growth solomon noted that few shopping centers are being 
built which cuts down the opportunities for retailers to expand 
analysts see this as the primary reason for macys interest in 
federated 
greenstein cited another benefit of acquiring a retail company 
real estate and store divisions that can be sold or mortgaged to 
help finance the acquisition 
when campeau bought allied stores corp at the end of 1986 he 
sold 16 of its 24 store divisions to pay off loans taken out to 
acquire allied he has already announced he will sell federateds 
foleys and filenes divisions to the may department stores co if 
his tender offer is successful 
campeau a shopping center developer is said to be interested 
in federated because many of its stores will provide him with 
immediate access to malls 
one analyst sees the battle over federated as having 
ramifications that could affect the direction of retailing for 
years to come 
whoever wins federated would be sitting in the seat to 
determine whether the major companies get larger or whether youre 
going to see entrepreneurs spurring growth in the industry said 
thomas tashjian who tracks retailers for seidler amdec securities 
inc in los angeles 
larger companies may not promote change he said adding 
youre going to end up seeing the same thing everywhere 
when smaller companies or management groups buy retailers they 
may be more inclined to change and update stores tashjian said 
after dillard department store inc bought the joskes 
department store chain from allied stores they improved the 
profitability of those stores they improved the customers 
selection they improved the pricing structure tashjian said 
campeau said it had no plans to sell any federated divisions 
beyond foleys and filenes but their sale to may the nations 
seventhlargest retailer was bad news to tashjian 
filenes and foleys which have distinct franchises may 
start to look like a maycalifornia or a lord amp taylor two of 
mays other department store divisions he said 
macy is also a large retailer but it is more likely than 
campeau to reenergize federateds stores having rejuvenated its 
own stores tashjian said

shareholders of first city bancorporation of 
texas inc gathered friday to consider chicago banker a robert 
abbouds 15 billion rescue plan that would be the largest 
government bank bailout since 1984 
a twothirds vote of the bankholding companys 37 million 
shares is required to approve the plan which includes nearly 1 
billion in federal assistance a spinoff of poorly performing 
assets and an infusion of privatelyraised capital 
first city which grew quickly during the oil boom to become the 
states fourthlargest bank was hammered by energy and real estate 
loan losses when oil prices plummeted 
for 1987 the company posted a 11 billion loss it has assets 
of 11 billion and operates 59 banks in texas and one in south 
dakota 
abboud an investor seeking to become first citys chairman of 
the board and chief executive officer has promised banking 
regulators to rehabilitate the wobbly company 
in a 200page singlespaced proxy statement sent to 
shareholders abboud said an investor group he heads would raise 
500 million to serve as the primary source of capital for the 
restructured company 
in addition first city subsidiary banks would spin off 179 
billion in book value of nonperforming and other assets to 
collecting bank a new national bank 
in exchange first city would receive about 764 million in 
collecting bank notes and about 970 million in federal deposit 
insurance corp notes 
the fdic pledge is the largest such government rescue since the 
1984 federal bailout of continental illinois bank and trust of 
chicago

rescue within weeks of shareholder approval

holding company 100 shares of common stock in collecting bank and 
the right to buy more securities in the new company

modified on jan 26 to allow common shareholders and the four 
classes of preferred shareholders to vote as one group

separately with a rejection from any one group sufficient to 
scuttle the deal 
the earlier arrangement inadvertently provided rancher frederick 
erck a san antonio preferred stockholder potential veto power 
over the deal 
erck a former first city director who resigned in november has 
said he opposes the deal not only because it could hurt him 
financially but because abbouds team would reap too much profit 
from the restructured company 
erck said he did not plan to attend fridays meeting and did 
not disclose how he planned to vote
