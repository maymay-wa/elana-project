a physician recommended for the us surgeon 
generals post says the nation must begin thinking about aids as a 
disease that strikes whole families not just adults 
we have to think of the children who will be sick dr 
antonia c novello said monday we also have to think of the 
children who will be orphaned when the parents die its a family 
context if we think of aids in a family context i think we will 
be much more forceful 
novello 45 has been recommended by dr louis sullivan 
secretary of health and human services to succeed dr c everett 
koop as surgeon general she is deputy director of the national 
institute of child health and human development at the national 
institutes of health 
novello a native of puerto rico has yet to be nominated by 
president bush she spoke to about 500 people from 15 states 
attending a symposium on health career opportunities for hispanics 
the fact that she has been recommended for the job novello 
said sends a message that the bush administration is interested in 
recruiting minorities for powerful positions 
its an honor for me and for being hispanic and for being a 
woman she said at a news conference 
novello who chairs the pediatric task force for aids said 
health officials must obtain the true number of children 
infected with the hiv virus the hiv virus causes acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome 
the task force estimates that by 1991 10000 to 20000 children 
will be infected with the virus and 3000 youngsters will have the 
disease 
however it is feasible to believe that there are many more 
children infected she said adding that not all infected 
children have been tested

a young man panicked and buried a friend 
in his parents back yard after the friend died in his car then 
agonized for a week before telling his mother police said monday 
an autopsy was conducted on the body of alan istvan 28 of new 
fairfield conn said suffolk county police lt john gierasch 
gierasch said there would be no decision on whether to charge 
michael montheard a 24yearold house painter from danbury conn 
until montheard had been interviewed and autopsy results were in 
so far everything he has told us seems to be holding up 
gierasch said 
the death and burial came to light sunday night when montheard 
telephoned his mother virginia eckstein said the family attorney 
john byrnes montheard told her he had buried istvan in her back 
yard in this long island city of about 15000 people 65 miles east 
of new york city 
the police were notified and they found istvans body in a 
3footdeep grave covered with leaves behind the eckstein home 
according to byrnes istvan fell asleep in montheards car when 
they went out with another friend after work oct 13 montheard and 
the other friend left istvan alone in the car for a little while 
byrnes said when they returned they found him dead 
he apparently had vomited and became asphyxiated on his own 
vomit byrnes said 
montheard and the friend who has not been identified by byrnes 
or police threw a blanket over istvans body drove to long island 
early the next morning and buried it in his mother and 
stepfathers yard 
if montheards story holds up the only charge he could possibly 
face would be unlawful disposal of a body a misdemeanor violation 
of state health law gierasch said

every time i kiss my wife and little 
boy goodbye i hold them a little longer and little tighter a 
reporter says 
in the last eight years 45 employees of colombias news media 
have been murdered eight since the government war on cocaine 
cartels began nine weeks ago drug gangs have blown up two 
newspapers and tried to bomb two radio stations 
every day in print and on the air the traffickers are faced 
with tough editorials and reports of police or army raids on their 
ranches arrests destruction of cocaine labs and by their side 
assassinations and bombings 
in the forefront of the battle has been the 102yearold bogota 
daily el espectador whose publisher guillermo cano was killed by 
the drug lords two years ago 
the paper called colombias congress a pack of cowards this 
month because some members favored negotiations with the 
traffickers and opposed extraditing colombians to face narcotics 
charges in the united states 
a car bomb exploded outside the papers office sept 2 causing 
25 million in damage and nearly causing it to close 
luis gabriel cano brother of the slain publisher said last 
week newspapers in the united states and other countries had 
offered 1 million in aid 
he said el espectador would not take gifts but would accept the 
money as a 15year loan free of interest 
drug traffickers realize murder and bombing wont silence el 
espectador and they have begun threatening advertisers cano said 
causing a decline in advertising volume of 2530 percent 
the threats keep coming by telephone he said and many of 
el espectadors 1200 workers say they have been threatened with 
death 
gunmen on a motorcycle killed two employes oct 10 in medellin 
base of the most notorious cartel the paper closed its medellin 
offices and cano said distribution there became impossible because 
of threats to delivery boys drivers of delivery trucks and even 
newsstands 
it unnerves me every time i hear a motorcycle come up behind 
me an el espectador columnist said 
assassins riding double on motorcycles are a favorite weapon of 
the traffickers but one el espectador reporter was killed by 
gunmen who burst into his home and a radio reporter was shot down 
by killers waiting in shadows outside his house 
vanguardia liberal a newspaper in the northwestern city of 
bucaramanga also has been a target a car bomb exploded outside 
its plant oct 16 destroying 80 percent of the facilities and 
killing four people 
it published a slim edition the next day including news of the 
drug war 
executive editor enrique santos of the bogota daily el tiempo 
the main competitor of el espectador said im afraid there will 
be dark days for another two years never in the history of 
colombia has there been such a dangerous and grave threat as the 
press is suffering through now 
santos worked for el tiempo when its plant and el espectadors 
were burned in 1948 at the beginning of a civil war that lasted 
seven years and took 250000 lives 
a military dictator seized both papers in 1955 when they refused 
to submit material to military censors or stop publishing stories 
about demonstrations agaist the regime 
of the threat from drug traffickers santos said it is awful 
not knowing where the enemy is no one knows when how or where 
they might strike 
el tiempo yet to be attacked carries frontpage stories daily 
about the antidrug war and has published editorials encouraging 
the government 
at least eight leading journalists have left the country because 
of threats from the traffickers 
among them are two university of kansas graduates associated 
with el tiempo partowner daniel samper pizano who led the 
investigative reporting team and managing editor rafael santos 
son of publisher hernando santos 
others who have left are fabio castillo and antonio caballero of 
el espectador alberto aguire of the medellin daily el mundo ligia 
riveros of the weekly news magazine cromos mauricio gomez 
director of the tv news program 24 hours and cesar fernandez 
director of the program 7 oclock news 
many who remain tell of looking over their shoulders constantly 
while walking on the street keeping an eye on the rear view mirror 
while driving in case a motorcycle approaches and wondering 
whether someone is waiting when they arrive home 
some threats are telephoned to wives 
a us reporters wife said she and her 10yearold son have 
been threatened several times and she worries every day 
especially if the school bus bringing him home is a bit late 
because three schools have been bombed 
she does not let her son play outside movies are out because a 
bomb went off in a theater and there have been no trips to 
shopping centers since a car bomb was found and defused outside the 
citys largest one 
the family stocks up on groceries to reduce the number of trips 
to supermarkets several of which have been bombed they gave up 
eating out because a bomb wrecked a restaurant and fear of the 
darkened streets in bogota a city of 6 million people has nearly 
ended their social life 
i hear a motorcycle or a car slowing down as it goes by the 
house and i wonder if this is it the reporters wife said 
since the crackdown began 164 bombs have killed 16 people and 
wounded 195 
i think about how easy it would be to throw one through our 
windows she said

president bushs veto of a bill expanding 
federally financed abortions promises to keep alive an emotional 
issue republican candidates suddenly wish would fade away before 
this falls offyear elections 
in races for governor of virginia and new jersey and for mayor 
of new york city republican candidates are doing their best to 
keep the debate away from abortion an issue that now appears to be 
helping their democratic opponents 
theres no question this is going to hurt the republican 
party sen robert packwood rore said after bushs veto 
saturday 
the issue is very much alive in the country this is an issue 
that threatens to divide the reagan coalition added republican 
consultant roger stone 
lawmakers and lobbyists who back abortion rights see little hope 
of overriding the veto but they say they will mount an effort in 
the house anyway 
clearly well try to override clearly thats probably not 
going to happen so he wins a disheartened rep pat schroeder 
dcolo said after saturdays veto 
the abortion funding expansion was attached to a 157 billion 
spending bill packwood said on cable news networks evans amp 
novak show that if the override fails lawmakers should pass the 
spending bill again and send it back to bush 
the bill bush vetoed saturday had passed the senate by a 
decisive 6731 margin but it squeaked through the house 216206 
far short of the twothirds vote necessary for an override 
the measure which congress sent to bush last week despite his 
pledge to veto it would permit poor women who are victims of rape 
and incest to obtain abortions paid by medicaid 
that covers a relatively small group by most estimates yet its 
passage and bushs public anguish before announcing his veto 
plans have given it broader symbolic importance while compounding 
difficulty for righttolife candidates who find polls shifting 
against them 
in new jersey republican james courter has been accused of 
waffling on abortion and trails democrat james florio courter has 
tried to push the campaign onto the issues of crime drugs taxes 
and automobile insurance 
we would prefer the race to be fought on other traditional 
issues says kenneth connolly courters campaign manager 
in virginia marshall coleman won the republican primary with a 
tough antiabortion position but has been pounded for that position 
by democrat douglas wilder who reversed a deficit in published 
polls while his abortionrights ads were running 
coleman responded by attacking wilders character and past 
record on crime 
its our responsibility to get another issue out there and 
thats what youll see from coleman said michele davis director 
of the republican governors association 
we have to demonstrate very clearly that abortion is an issue 
but it is not the only issue adds bruce hildebrand colemans 
press secretary 
national republican strategists acknowledge privately however 
that the abortion issue is proving a problem for some of their 
candidates who have staked out firm antiabortion stands 
while that once seemed a safe political position polls show 
republican candidates are losing some voters because of the 
abortion issue primarily younger voters and women 
the equation changed with the supreme courts decision last 
summer giving states more room to regulate abortions that gave the 
issue increased relevance and raised the prospect in voters minds 
that abortion rights could be restricted 
in order to retrieve the republican female vote which we are 
losing we have to focus on other issues that voters care about 
like child care the environment said one republican strategist 
who spoke only on condition of anonymity 
these republicans hope that bushs veto on the medicaid abortion 
bill wont be seen by most voters in state and congressional races 
as directly relevant to the question of maintaining abortion rights 
but they acknowledge that to the extent bushs veto keeps public 
attention focused on abortion it can impede their candidates 
efforts to move the public debate to other issues

the monitor the ironclad civil war ship that 
sank in a gale after a celebrated battle with the confederate ship 
merrimack 127 years ago still finds itself surrounded by 
turbulence 
the governments refusal for safety reasons to allow anyone to 
dive to the ironclad monitors watery grave for the last 10 years 
has angered divers who believe the ship is on the verge of 
collapsing 
if that happens it will be the end of part of our national 
heritage a divers lobbying group said last week underlying 
this controversy is how far the government should go to protect the 
individual from undertaking a somewhat dangerous activity said 
the international scuba association 
photographing the monitor has become an obsession for marine 
explorer gary gentile 43 of philadelphia who has enlisted the 
aid of his congressman and fellow scuba enthusiasts to help him get 
permission for the dive 
in the last five years gentile said he has filed 11 permit 
applications and written 51 letters to the national oceanic and 
atmospheric administration which oversees the wreck 16 miles off 
the cape hatteras coast in north carolina 
gentile who said his quest has cost him thousands of dollars 
has begun filing federal freedom of information act requests to try 
to obtain information from noaa that he believes will not be 
forthcoming any other way 
last week he sat through a daylong hearing before a noaa 
administrative law judge who considered previous denials of three 
of his requests each varying slightly to make the 220foot dive 
using scuba gear the judge will study the case further before 
making a recommendation to the national ocean service a branch of 
noaa 
the problem is bureaucratic territoriality gentile said in 
an interview after the hearing noaa wants to preserve the wreck 
for themselves 
the currents and weather can change quickly in the area where 
the monitor went down 
they dont call that the graveyard of the atlantic for 
nothing said noaa spokesman dane konop who has been to the 
site its a very tricky situation out there the most dangerous 
conditions imaginable 
gentiles attorney fellow diver peter hess noted at the 
hearing that noaa allowed french explorer jacques cousteaus party 
to dive to the monitor in 1979 
cousteau society spokeswoman karen brazeau said last week that 
the weather and the visibility on the trip was poor and that 
little or no usable footage was produced 
no one has dove on that site since konop said you can 
say noaa learned its lesson from the cousteau dive they were happy 
to make it back aboard safely 
noaa now considers the dive too deep and dangerous to be made 
using the compressed air that cousteaus group used and that 
gentile proposes konop said at certain depths nitrogen in the 
air can cause divers to lose concentration or impede motor skills 
but gentile said he has made many deeper dives on scuba 
including 24 expeditions to the 33yearold wreck of the andrea 
doria off nantucket island in massachusetts 
gentile has now applied to make the dive using a mixture of 
oxygen and helium a combination that is more expensive than 
compressed air but which he hopes noaa will find more acceptable 
that request is still pending 
anyone who has put this much blood and sweat into it it would 
be terrific if he could meet noaas conditions said peter 
decoursey spokesman for rep robert borski dpa who has been 
trying to speed up the administrations consideration of gentiles 
requests 
a union ship the 172foot monitor was built with iron both the 
monitor and the merrimack survived their famous battle in 1862 but 
neither stayed around long 
the monitor sank in bad weather and the merrimack renamed the 
virginia was destroyed by its crew to keep it from being captured 
by the union 
in 1987 konop and other noaa officials journeyed to the monitor 
site and returned with photographs and measurements obtained from a 
remote device they sent into the water based partly on noaas own 
statements gentile and his attorney said they fear the ship is 
collapsing 
konop conceded the ships situation is dynamic but said 
ive never seen anything from us that says its in imminent 
danger of collapsing on itself 
gentile said he wants to capture the ship on film from an 
artists perspective 
noaa got a fantastic amount of information but theres no 
human interest in it i want something people can relate to it 
should be photographed before it collapses he said

no flat predictions yet but one of the 
agriculture departments chief grocerywatchers thinks consumer 
food prices in 1990 wont go up as fast as they did this year 
food prices did rise sharply in 1989 an average of around 6 
percent over the calendar year economist ralph l parlett jr 
says adding that not much is in the works over the next couple of 
months that will alter that preliminary reading 
according to usda records based on official labor department 
statistics this years 6 percent allfood increase which 
includes meals eaten out as well as at home is the biggest gain 
since a 78 percent jump in 1981 
retail food prices averaged 41 percent higher in each of the 
last two years and had hovered at or below that level since the 
hefty 1981 increase 
parlett interviewed by telephone last friday said he was in 
the midst of preparing the 1990 forecast for release at the 
departments annual outlook conference in late november 
i dont think therell be the increase weve seen this year 
parlett ventured its not going to be near the 6 percent level 
i dont think 
although parlett said the 1990 food outlook is still a bit 
cloudy there are some points that can be made about this years 
situation and how those might bear on the immediate future 
some of our price increase this year was caused early on by 
bad weather with vegetables particularly he said we dont 
forecast bad weather for 1990 so maybe thats one thing that wont 
happen hopefully 
parlett added but we still have the carryover from the 1988 
drought that left a lot of pipelines empty in terms of the 
processed vegetable market prices will be high and supplies are 
still going to be tight 
despite a respectable harvest of vegetables this year 
supplies for processing will be tight as inventories continue to be 
replenished he said but this will gradually be corrected 
come next year theres no reason to see those vegetable prices 
processed or fresh to be screaming higher parlett said 
meat poultry fish and eggs account for more than 30 percent of 
the labor departments foodathome price index based on december 
1988 computations 
by comparison cereals and bakery products are about 14 percent 
of the index dairy products 12 percent fresh fruits and 
vegetables 11 percent and processed fruits and vegetables 7 
percent 
the big story really is in poultry parlett said demand 
for poultry isnt going to change considerably but producers 
have continued to increase production so i would expect some 
decrease in poultry prices weve already seen them start coming 
down from june 
red meat supplies mostly beef and pork probably will decrease 
slightly in 1990 he said but there is uncertainty about what will 
happen to prices partly because poultry has an impact on beef and 
pork and vice versa 
last week parletts agency the economic research service said 
that the farm price of milk has risen sharply this year meaning 
that consumers will also see brisk increases including cheese 
and nonfat dry milk 
for the first time in many years rises in retail dairy prices 
will surpass those of allfood or all consumer items the 
report said 
the national milk producers federation said that from 1975 
until 1982 consumer prices for dairy products climbed at about the 
same rate as milk prices since 1982 federal milk supports have 
dropped more than 23 percent and farm milk prices also declined 
over the same period of time the federation said in a recent 
newsletter 
consumers pay when farm milk prices go up but they have not 
reaped the expected benefits when farm prices decline it said 
the labor departments report last week noted that consumer food 
prices overall rose a moderate 02 percent in september after 
rising sharply earlier in the year food and beverage prices shot 
up at a 93 percent annual rate through may but from june to 
september climbed at only a 17 percent rate 
but the price index for dairy products rose faster than the 
general tide jumping 14 percent in september the largest monthly 
increase since may 1980 
parlett said usda has been forecasting retail dairy prices 
rising around 6 percent this year compared with a 24 percent 
increase in 1988 when overall food prices rose 41 percent

the american soldiers who invaded grenada six 
years ago are rightly hailed as heroes but the official us 
rationale for the mission was bogus says a british officer 
involved in the attack 
retired maj mark adkin says the us military action was not 
necessary to save the lives of american medical students on the 
caribbean island as claimed by the reagan administration and in 
fact endangered them 
he also says us soldiers succeeded despite weak advance 
planning and haphazard coordination by leaders of the different 
military services involved 
adkin who took part in the invasion as caribbean operations 
staff officer for the barbados defense force recounts the mission 
in a new book titled urgent fury the battle for grenada 
he lauds the outcome of the invasion which occurred six years 
ago this week and says it prevented grenada from becoming a 
communist bastion in the region but he dismisses us claims 
at the time that the 700 american medical students on the island 
were in danger of being taken hostage 
thenpresident reagan repeatedly said the 6000 combat troops 
staged a rescue mission on oct 25 1983 to prevent the 
students from being taken hostage by a radical marxist government 
if anything adkin says the invasion increased the chances that 
the students would be taken hostage 
us citizens were in no danger until the operation was 
launched he writes the assault on the island could easily 
have precipitated the taking of hostages by desperate men driven to 
desperate means to save their own lives 
the administration decided to intervene in grenada on the 
basis of seizing a fleeting strategicpolitical advantage which 
had the added merit that inevitable military success would raise 
us flagging morale he says 
the predawn attack by combined elite units of all the us armed 
forces came days after leftists on the island executed marxist 
prime minister maurice bishop and imposed a 24hour curfew the 
invasion forces ousted the leftists and flew the students home 
a former reagan administration official langhorne anthony 
motley disputes adkins claims about the students saying hes 
totally incorrect 
motley a former assistant secretary of state for interamerican 
affairs said a cia officer spoke with the students before the 
troops arrived and they were concerned about being taken 
hostage 
regardless of the reason for the mission adkin says the us 
troops deserved the heroes welcome they received from both the 
islanders and the american public upon their return 
the people who had been invaded welcomed the invaders 
regarded them as liberators even going so far as to want us 
troops to remain far longer than they did the island was to be a 
communist bastion an ever more menacing reminder to the rest of 
the region that their way of live was threatened he says 
this is what it would have become that it did not was because 
president reagan acted albeit primarily for reasons of national 
selfinterest 
nineteen american soldiers died in the initial assault and 
several days of skirmishes adkin says two army rangers also died 
when their parachutes failed to open 
he argues that the american soldiers had to overcome a lack of 
intelligence information on the island and poor preparation for the 
joint operation 
the us military has done its own assessments on grenada 
finding fault with the lack of coordination and intelligence many 
details of those assessments remain classified however 
a retired us military officer who served in the planning and 
execution of the grenada invasion acknowledged some problems but 
said adkin doesnt tell the whole story 
the officer who spoke only on condition he not be further 
identified agreed that the troops operated without maps and 
uptodate intelligence information but said adkin should have 
noted that a lot of decisions were made on the ground by ground 
commanders they were able to adapt 
however he agreed that the various armed forces were 
illprepared to work together and said the decision to use a 
combined force at that time was wrong 
the grenada operation later was cited by sen william cohen 
dmaine as the main reason for a 1986 bill mandating a joint 
special operations command 
that it succeeded as it did without costly setbacks was due 
primarily to incredibly good fortune adkin says 
still he concludes that for all the errors for all the 
confusion for all the suffering grenada and its people remain 
grateful to those bold enough to launch the operation and those 
bold enough to undertake it

an exhibit of sexually explicit 
photographs that ignited a debate over government funding of the 
arts got mixed reviews from an overflow crowd as it was denounced 
by a small band of protesters 
the exhibit of photos by the late robert mapplethorpe opened 
saturday at the wadsworth atheneum the collection includes photos 
of homosexual acts as well as more conventional nudes celebrity 
portraits and still lifes of flowers 
about 15 religious activists picketed denouncing the exhibit as 
gay pornography but the line of patrons extended out the door 
officials said 2000 people paid to see the show more than four 
times the usual saturday attendance 
the overall quality was superb kathy cemino said as she 
left the museum there was really nothing obscene about it the 
flowers are really beautiful 
conservatives in congress led by sen jesse helms rnc were 
angered to learn that the mapplethorpe exhibit at washingtons 
corcoran gallery of art originally was funded in part by the 
national endowment for the arts congress last month defeated a 
helms proposal to ban federal funding of art considered obscene 
or indecent 
instead congress voted to bar government financing of works 
that may be obscene and lack serious literary artistic 
political or scientific value the supreme courts 1973 
guideline on obscenity 
the exhibit had opened to large crowds and critical acclaim in 
chicago and philadelphia before its stormy stop in washington 
atheneum director patrick mccaughey said he was happy to show 
the photos because an art museum mustnt just lie back and sit 
like a tabby cat he said the turnout challenged the outsiders 
view of hartford that its the insurance capital that its 
staid 
the hartford museum charged a special 3 admission fee to offset 
the cost of showing it and required that minors be accompanied by 
an adult 
demonstrators carried signs that read promote true art not 
obscenity and federally funded gay pornography 
mary ann pressamarita who has helped defeat gay rights bills in 
the legislature and fought topless bars said the exhibit contained 
a lot of beautiful pictures along with absolute pornography 
the protest drew a counterdemonstration from two men who 
embraced and kissed on the lips for several minutes in front of the 
protesters 
oh my god screamed one demonstrator are they crazy 
inside during a panel discussion art critic bernard hanson 
defended the artist telling an audience of about 300 that the 
photos contain nothing new 
those of you who have squinted hard at the dirty greek vases 
in the vatican know what im talking about he said what is 
the big deal

rescuers euphoric over finding a survivor 
in a collapsed freeway had to suspend their search late sunday 
because the rubble became so unstable and earthquakeshaken 
northern californians mapped strategy for mondays commute through 
gridlock 
authorities sent crews home for the night because so much 
further damage had been done by aftershocks and heavy construction 
equipment that they had no idea how to safely shore up interstate 
880 large sections of concrete have crumbled and there was no 
estimate of when work could resume 
its kind of minute by minute said california department of 
transportation spokesman kyle nelson said 
more than 100 people were evacuated sunday afternoon from an 
oakland housing project located within 10 feet of a fourblock 
stretch of i880 abutting the portion that gave way in the quake 
the evacuation came after a cement column fell from the 
structure and new cracks were discovered in the section of 
doubledeck freeway that had previously been thought to be stable 
longshoreman buck helm who spent four days in a tomb of i880 
concrete and steel was in criticalstable condition at highland 
general hospital in oakland with some slight improvement hospital 
officials said 
engineer steven whipple hailed as a hero of the rescue said he 
was checking the fallen doubledeck freeway for stability on 
saturday when he spotted the back of helms head with his 
flashlight and then saw a hand wave at him 
it stopped my heart i thought maybe the wind was blowing and 
thats what caused it i thought i might be losing it said 
whipple 29 
the number of dead pulled from the i880 disaster rose to 38 
including a 4yearold boy bringing the earthquakes toll to 59 
with thousands injured and homeless and dozens still missing 
we know there are more victims more cars but we dont know 
how many said california highway patrol capt mike garver 
damage estimates topped 7 billion making the quake the 
costliest natural disaster in us history according to the 
independent insurance agents of america 
baseball commissioner fay vincent announced sunday that the 
world series would not resume until friday night three days later 
than originally hoped the championship between the oakland as and 
the san francisco giants was suspended the night of the quake 
sunday was a day for both mourning the dead and giving thanks 
for the living at churches across the bay area 
special services were set because some damaged churches remain 
too dangerous and congregants praying for peace with the earth 
were encouraged to share their quake experiences 
by the uncertainties of this hour we pray to be spared from 
further suffering archbishop john r quinn told 700 people at 
st marys cathedral here 
we pray that we may be spared further earthquakes quinn 
said we pray for all those who have suffered heavy losses i 
weep for the parents for the elderly for the children i pray for 
the relief of suffering and anxiety i cannot forget to pray for 
the dead and the bereaved 
in oakland parishioners of the st francis de salles cathedral 
had to move services to a baptist church because the cathedrals 
tower was filled with cracks and leaning precariously 
sometimes in life god shakes us and says pay attention 
there is something more important than the ordinary things in your 
life father joseph m powers said 
it wasnt just the ground that shook tuesday the earthquake 
shook a lot of things that we do the ordinary things on our 
agenda powers said 
phone calls telegrams and bouquets of flowers for helm the 
burly longshoreman deluged highland general hospital sunday 
helm regained some function in his kidneys damaged by severe 
dehydration and his lung condition improved slightly dr will fry 
said he was still in the intensive care unit being fed through a 
tube and still was having difficulty moving his left leg 
he is not out of the woods yet fry said 
a nonsmoker helm had high blood pressure and mild diabetes 
that did not require insulin before the earthquake 
i think its more amazing that he has been able to come 
through as well as he has despite those medical problems fry 
said hes proven that he has a strong will to live 
crews sawed the fallen fivelane section of the upper deck of 
the bay bridge in half and lifted one section down to a barge for 
repairs sunday 
a barge floating on chopping san francisco bay is supporting a 
towering white crane capable of lifting the 100ton separate 
sections of roadway that collapsed in the earthquake killing a 
woman who drove her car into the gap the vital link between san 
francisco and oakland is expected to be closed for four weeks 
the us army corps of engineers on sunday reported major cracks 
in three dams within 5 miles of the epicenter lexington newell 
creek and lake elsman but said they posed no public threat at 
this time because water is low behind them 
at the i880 rescue site in industrial downtown oakland six 
sweeps of the area where helm was found with sniffing dogs and 
electronic gear turned up no signs of other survivors 
digging to remove cars and bodies was delayed because the 
doubledeck freeway which collapsed on top of itself shifted 
under the strains of aftershocks wind and even the rescue work 
itself 
workers placed giant airbags hydraulic jacks and wood timbers 
under concrete sections and used truckloads of dirt to build a 
sturdier foundation according to kyle nelson a california 
department of transportation spokesman in oakland 
they also installed seismic monitors on the structure 
the problem is we still have to proceed cautiously and 
deliberately even though people are encouraged said jim drago 
another caltrans spokesman 
despite the slow pace rescue workers still had a renewed vigor 
sunday 
we need to use every trick in the rescue books to make sure no 
ones still up here alive said bill bromely a construction 
worker moving debris we know now that its possible were going 
as fast as we can 
a halfdozen impromptu tent cities have sprouted up around 
watsonville the battered largely hispanic city south of san 
francisco and closer to the epicenter 
hundreds of residents there are so traumatized by the quake its 
aftershocks which have been both strong and numerous and the 
memory of the mexico city earthquake that they refuse to go indoors 
this place is a disaster pamela cote of the santa cruz 
county human resources agency said as she tried to coax 50 
survivors living in calaghan park to move to 22 army tents erected 
several blocks away by the national guard 
people are everywhere on the streets in this town 
the red cross opened a permanent tent shelter with large 
olivecolored military tents in a watsonville park sunday 
throughout the quake area the red cross said the population at 
its 19 shelters dropped to 2000 saturday night it had been above 
10000 
in the bay area officials were doing everything they could to 
scare commuters off the streets monday the first work day for tens 
of thousands since tuesdays quake 
numerous freeways remain closed in addition to the bay bridge 
an armada of ferries has formed and transit authorities touted 
subways and buses as well 
employers were offering flexible work schedules but with many 
routes into the bay area and silicon valley blocked the monday 
morning forecast called for gridlock 
driving to work alone amounts to an antisocial act said

life insurance co spokesman tom greaney said of the loss 
aetna adjuster toni johnson said the frye home was the worst she 
had seen so far adding that it would take weeks to determine how 
many homes in the bay area were destroyed in the quake 
there are just too many to count she said 
the fryes were paid 20000 on friday as an advance to their 
earthquake insurance claim the couple had argued a year ago over 
whether to buy insurance and reluctantly paid the 440ayear 
premium 
we really debated about it before we signed up thank god we 
did said mrs frye 
the couple bought the 22yearold house five years ago its one 
of 112 houses in the villa del monte estates area about 50 miles 
south of san francisco and just southwest of san jose

rep george w crockett jr dmich is 
inviting more than 100 colleagues on a taxpayerfinanced trip to 
jamaicas montego bay next month and hes apparently getting quite 
a response 
the trip scheduled for nov 26 and intended to explore 
caribbean development issues has attracted so much interest that 
aides said they may not be able to accommodate everyone 
by the time the air force jet leaves however aides expect no 
more than 20 house members plus some spouses and staffers to be on 
board by friday the state department which handles travel 
arrangements for congressional delegations going overseas said it 
only had the names of six people who were going 
crockett chairman of the house subcommittee on western 
hemisphere affairs did not respond to calls about the trip friday 
his office refused to release a copy of the invitation he sent 
to as many as 150 house members or a list of people who planned to 
attend the long weekend event at montego bays half moon club 
victor johnson the staff director said a final list of 
participants probably would not be available until takeoff 
the purpose of the trip is to try to get lawmakers in touch with 
a wide variety of people including academics union heads and 
farmers and labor organizations johnson said 
steve hellinger codirector of the development group for 
alternative policies inc a nonprofit group that is sponsoring 
the event said the seminars and meetings are hard work the 
conference should not be considered play even though it is held at 
a resort he said 
atherton martin who works with hellinger said a number of 
members of congress had expressed interest in the trip but his 
group had been asked not to release names given the whole things 
with junkets and ethics 
the group provided an agenda for the fiveday program 
after arriving nov 2 participants are invited to a reception 
a series of speeches and conferences are scheduled for the next two 
days generally running from 9 am to 5 pm 
sunday is a free day for recreation on the final day lawmakers 
will receive a briefing from the us embassy staff before flying 
back to washington 
the lawmakers will hear from crockett and michael manley 
jamaicas prime minister before the seminars start 
topics include narcotics toward a new understanding a 
panel discussion on structural adjustment and debt an open 
discussion on internal constraints and a presentation on 
options and strategies regional development food security and 
the role of regional institutions 
the jamaica conference is an outgrowth of two earlier 
conferences on barbados attended by members of congress rep dante 
fascell dfla chairman of the house foreign affairs committee 
with responsibility for approving members trips attended the 
barbados conference in february 1988 
but barbara burris fascells spokeswoman said her boss would 
not travel to jamaica this year rep ted weiss dny who also 
traveled to barbados declined the trip because of the upcoming new 
york mayoral race according to his assistant miles lackey 
among those who intend on taking the trip are rep bill frenzel 
rminn and jaime fuster puerto ricos delegate in congress 
their aides said 
frenzel is a member of the house ways and means subcommittee on 
trade which had jurisdiction over the caribbean basin initiative 
a stalled us development plan for the region he is also a 
cochairman of friends of the caribbean a loosely knit task force 
on the region 
both groups as well as the subcommittee on the western 
hemisphere are expected to send members to jamaica 
martin said the results of the barbados conference have already 
borne fruit crockett introduced a 93 million caribbean aid 
package which has passed the house and is pending in the senate 
although the us government picks up the cost of travel and 
pays a per diem for members of congress the development gap raised 
money for the conference hellinger said sources include 
foundations like the carnegie corp and private contributions 
from grassroots groups such as churches he said

author james michener helped open a new 
art museum with advice for politicans let private individuals buy 
public art 
michener said sunday at the new berman museum of art at ursinus 
college that elected officials dont know what theyre doing 
they are terribly vulnerable to public opinion and it is unfair to 
saddle them with decisions which it takes even a brilliant 
connoisseur years to develop 
the collection of great art must be left to private 
individuals and then structure society so that later on they will 
give it to the public said michener the author of such 
bestselling novels as tales of south pacific hawaii 
space and centennial 
the author has a home in bucks county 
the berman museum was named for philip i and muriel m berman 
of allentown who contributed 1500 art works from their 
collection berman is the former owner of the hess department 
store chain 
the opening exhibit features art by edgar degas rembrandt

jim bakker says god has forgiven him for 
his sins but his lawyer is afraid the tv evangelist will have a 
tougher time setting things straight with a nononsense federal 
judge they call maximum bob 
bakker could be sent to prison for 120 years and fined more than 
52 million when he goes before us district judge robert potter 
on tuesday for sentencing for fraud and conspiracy 
maximum bob will probably knock a year off the maximum 
defense attorney george davis joked ruefully 
the judge lived up to his moniker last month when he sentenced 
former bakker aide david taggart to 18 years and five months in 
prison for tax evasion 
one can only speculate jim will get a heavier sentence than 
taggart its a foregone conclusion davis said in an interview 
taggart also was fined 500000 
assistant us attorney jerry miller said prosecutors will ask 
for a prison sentence but he refused to elaborate 
miller also declined to say if the government will ask that 
bakker be taken into custody immediately after sentencing 
prosecutors unsuccessfully tried to jail him after his conviction 
bakker 49 was convicted oct 5 on 24 counts of fraud and 
conspiracy for overselling 158 million in lifetime vacations or 
partnerships at ptls resort hotels the jury found that 
bakker used more than 37 million to buy luxurious homes fancy 
cars jewelry and expensive vacations 
the sixweek trial was briefly interrupted by bakkers 
commitment to a mental hospital after a breakdown 
god has forgiven me for my sins he told followers from the 
pulpit last week at his new covenant church in orlando fla im 
not guilty 
taggart and his brother james were convicted of diverting more 
than 11 milion in ptl money for their own use and cheating the 
government out of 525000 in taxes 
james taggart drew the maximum prison term 17 years and nine 
months and was fined 500000 both taggarts testified against 
bakker 
potter a reagan appointee on the bench for eight years can 
be harsh when its called for compassionate when its justified 
charlotte lawyer george laughrun said last month 
if a defendant admits his guilt potter is likely to weigh that 
in his favor laughrun said if potter thinks a defendant is lying 
hes likely to hold that against him the lawyer said 
before sentencing the taggarts potter said he thought they had 
lied on the stand but potter gave former ptl executive richard 
dortch eight years out of a possible 10 after dortch pleaded 
guilty apologized and agreed to testify for the government

a centuriesold tradition of opium 
poppy cultivation in pakistan and afghanistan has blossomed into a 
major heroin industry during a decade of political turmoil in 
southwest asia 
it has spawned what many anxious pakistanis call a heroin and 
kalashnikov culture of crime referring to the preferred 
automatic weapon of the regions drug lords 
most of the brightly colored poppies are grown in neighboring 
afghanistan where 11 years of civil war have precluded any attempt 
to control their cultivation 
officials say the flowers sticky yield of opium is refined into 
heroin powder in makeshift laboratories along the rugged 
pakistanafghan frontier it is then spirited through pakistan to 
markets in the united states and europe 
western narcotics agents estimate that up to 80 percent of the 
heroin sold in europe and 25 percent sold in the united states 
comes from the socalled golden crescent region of southwest 
asia 
the remainder comes from mexico and southeast asias golden 
triangle us sources say 
pakistani officials say its hard to estimate how much of the 
drug passes through their country khalim dilkhan chairman of the 
pakistan narcotics control board said that in 1988 alone local 
agents seized 13670 pounds of heroin compared with 950 pounds 
seized in 1980 
he said heroin addiction was virtually unknown in this moslem 
country of 109 million people 10 years ago but now more than one 
million mostly poor urban pakistanis are hooked 
their preferred method of using the drug is to smoke it whereas 
most addicts in the west inject heroin 
in 10 years the problem has multiplied a thousand times 
dilkhan said 
there are no statistics on addicts in afghanistan 
poppy cultivation has declined steadily in pakistan but it has 
risen sharply in afghanistan where fighting between the marxist 
government and moslem rebels has turned tribal areas along the 
mountainous afghanpakistan frontier into a haven for drug lords 
dilkhan said 
he said opium production in pakistan was about 140 tons in 1988 
down from nearly 990 tons in 1980 in afghanistan this years 
yield will be anywhere from 935 to 2200 tons pakistani and 
western narcotics experts estimate 
opium production and to some extent export have existed for 
centuries in both countries but experts say three major events in 
1979 combined to help build the multimilliondollar heroin industry 
the turkish governments crackdown on heroin labs in eastern 
anatolia forcing production into western iran 
irans islamic revolution which ousted the shahs government 
and purged corrupt officials who secretly participated in the opium 
trade 
the war in afghanistan which began after a sovietsupported 
communist coup in 1978 and has hindered efforts to control poppy 
cultivation 
opium production declined in the first years following the 1979 
soviet military intervention but increased steadily in the 
mid1980s experts say 
the united states which together with pakistan backs 
afghanistans anticommunist rebels has only recently started 
working with guerrilla leaders to discourage poppy cultivation 
washington is mounting a 10 million program that over the next 
three years hopes to promote drug awareness among afghanistans 
mujahedeen rebels and offer incentives to substitute the opium 
poppy with other crops us officials say 
american and pakistani experts deny reports that the insurgents 
systematically sell heroin to buy weapons 
there is no evidence of organized heroin activity but as 
individuals yes some of them are doing it dilkhan said of the 
guerrillas 
experts say that pakafghan heroin follows three routes from the 
frontier westward 
across northern pakistan then south to bombay for shipping 
through the arabian sea 
due south through pakistans desert province of baluchistan 
often by camel or jeep caravan to the arabian sea 
south to baluchistan then west through iran and turkey 
the new pakistani government of prime minister benazir bhutto 
who took office after november elections declared war on heroin 
traffic the government has received more than 60 million in us 
aid for the effort 
dilkhan says the government campaign focuses on poppy crop 
substitution destruction of plantations through aerial spraying 
interdiction of overland shipments and drug awareness among the 
population 
narcotics agents are reluctant to discuss official corruption 
which many describe as a main obstacle to pakistans war on drugs 
lets face it were talking about huge amounts of money that 
attracts corruption said a pakistani narcotics official 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
dilkhan said police arrested a number of midlevel drug 
barons this year but that it was difficult to collect enough 
evidence to bring them to trial 
the money factor is tremendous its highly profitable he 
said 
agents say one kilogram 22 pounds of 97 percent pure heroin 
fetches 1000 at the pakistanafghanistan border 
multiply that about 100 times for new york city dilkhan 
said 
crop substitution is unattractive to most poppy growers because 
they are accustomed to handsome profits he says

congressional democrats reeling in disarray 
just three weeks ago are using shrewd legislative maneuvering and 
a couple of political windfalls to regain the upper hand with 
president bush according to lawmakers in both parties 
the new house and senate leadership came in for criticism last 
month even from their own party operatives for seeming to be too 
accommodating with the president the griping intensified after 
house speaker thomas foley and his team made a highprofile stand 
against bushs capital gains tax cut and lost 
but in washington such conditions are transitory the past week 
has seen congress defeat bush on his constitutional amendment to 
ban flag desecration overwhelming house approval of an aid package 
for poland and hungary that is nearly twice what bush wants and a 
showdown over federal funding for welfare abortions in rape and 
incest cases 
bush on saturday vetoed a spending bill that included the 
abortion funds and while members of congress concede an override 
attempt probably would not succeed they are talking of sending the 
same measure to bush again 
i think were back said rep david bonior dmich a 
senior member of the house leadership timing strategy and some 
luck have added up to our being able to score some points 
asked about the democratic resurgence house gop leader robert 
michel of illinois shrugged 
its like a ball game some innings you hit well and score 
runs he said recalling the wave of high popularity his 
party enjoyed a few weeks ago but the winds have shifted he 
acknowledged if theyre feeling good about some of the 
developments in the last day or two so be it 
democrats also seem increasingly emboldened to take bush on 
directly particularly for his response to the radical changes 
taking place in eastern europe 
in a speech last week majority leader richard gephardt dmo 
concluded george bush appears to be determined to go down in 
history as the hesitation president at least his first year in 
office could be titled the year of living timidly 
the spending bill vetoed by bush included money to pay for 
abortions for poor women who are victims of rape and incest the 
bill would have reversed a decadeold federal policy a move 
propelled by resurgent prochoice forces 
but many republicans are uncomfortable with a bush veto fearing 
it will put them on the losing side of another hot political issue 
this is just the wrong front on which to fight that battle 
said rep bill green rny 
theres no question this is going to hurt the republican 
party sen bob packwood rore an abortion rights backer said 
on cable news networks evans amp novak show 
and on the flag issue bushs early endorsement of a 
constitutional amendment at the iwo jima memorial has proved less 
than the brilliant stroke it seemed at the time democrats 
strategy to wait the issue out and evoke the sanctity of the bill 
of rights has been vindicated 
in fact it was two lastminute republican converts sens john 
danforth of missouri and warren rudman of new hampshire who 
helped take the amendment down to defeat in the senate 
house and senate negotiators this week will wrestle with the 
issue which represented bushs biggest policy victory to date the 
cut in the tax rate on capital gains from the sale of holdings like 
stocks and real estate while bushs position prevailed in the 
house three weeks ago he later lost in the senate when it was 
dropped from an antideficit bill 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine has said he 
doesnt think the senate will pass a capital gains cut this year 
and said it was irresponsible to be pushing the initiative when 
what congress needs to do is cut the deficit 
i would like to see the president devote as much time to 
historic events in western and eastern europe id like to see 
him devote a fraction of the time to that that he is to this

the house ethics panel should keep looking 
into republican whip newt gingrichs ties with a georgia 
businessman even though the panels lawyer says further 
investigation is not needed a leading house democrat says 
rep beryl anthony jr of arkansas said the ethics panel should 
send its own staff to investigate gingrichs contacts with two 
federal agencies on behalf of real estate developer chester roush 
jr because it cannot ignore an article published this weekend 
in the atlanta business chronicle 
roush a longtime political patron of gingrich was among the 
supporters who raised 13000 for gingrich to tour europe in 1977 
for research on a novel gingrich a history professor at west 
georgia college at the time was elected to congress the following 
year and never wrote the book 
the article which was distributed to news organizations by the 
democratic congressional campaign committee that anthony chairs 
said gingrich attempted to intervene with government agencies on 
behalf of roush projects twice in 1986 once with the farmers 
home administration and once with the department of housing and 
urban development 
in both cases the agencies reaffirmed their decisions denying 
the relief sought by gingrich for the carrollton ga businessman 
richard galen a spokesman for gingrich said he had not read 
the article and could not comment on the specifics however he 
said it sounded like the article recounted a typical 
congressmanconstituent relationship 
thats what people in congress do and theyre generally proud 
of it helping businessmen in their area wend their way through the 
labyrinth of the federal bureaucracy galen said 
last week the ethics committees outside counsel concluded 
there was no basis for opening a formal investigation into charges 
by another arkansas democrat rep bill alexander 
alexander had accused gingrich of violating house rules and 
campaign finance laws through the 1977 book partnership involving 
roush and another one in 1984 
merely reading through documents is not enough anthony said 
in a statement distributed along with the article the committee 
now needs to send its own staff to georgia to interview individuals 
involved

hundreds of looters and 
curiosityseekers overran the wreckage of a honduran jet crash 
hampering efforts to determine the cause of the weekend crash that 
left 131 dead 
everyone trampled everything down said barry trotter head 
of a national transportation safety board team investigating the 
crash 
honduran officials were unfamiliar with the importance of 
sealing off a plane crash site trotter said sunday 
the tansahsa boeing 727200 crashed on approach early saturday 
on the last leg of a flight from san jose costa rica with a stop 
in managua nicaragua a survivor said the plane shook violently 
and seemed to plunge just before it crashed in flames into a 
hillside 
fifteen of the 146 people aboard including the pilot survived 
us embassy spokesman terry kneebone said 15 americans were on 
the plane and three survived two were transferred to hospitals in 
the united states but all three were out of danger doctors said 
trotter said the looting would not necessarily cripple the 
investigation but that evidence had been obscured 
there are no ground scars that would show the angle the plane 
hit at how it broke up and dissipated energy how it slid he 
said 
the first people to reach the site were peasant farmers some of 
whom live in houses only 75 yards away they helped rescue 
survivors and rushed them to hospitals in pickup trucks 
within an hour after the plane crashed at 750 am saturday 
the site was overrun by more than 100 people sifting through 
luggage clothes and papers 
soldiers were seen sorting clothing children stuffed toys and 
clothes into bags one fireman was observed leaving with a suitcase 
under his overcoat wallets and billfolds also disappeared 
few corpses arrived at the morgue in tegucigalpa wearing watches 
maj carlos aguilar the honduran armed forces liaison to the 
investigators said the site was not secured until sunday 
afternoon almost 36 hours after the crash 
some looters were peasants who earn about 1 a day but aguilar 
said roads in the area 20 miles south of tegucigalpa were jammed 
with curiosityseekers on sunday outings 
there were people hauling out burned suitcases trying to open 
melted zippers i even saw children taking away bits of twisted 
metal as souvenirs said andres torres a member of the honduran 
congress who visited the site sunday 
the black boxes that record pilots conversations and flight 
data were found saturday and sent to washington for evaluation 
kneebone said 
hundreds of people gathered at tegucigalpas morgue as doctors 
continued the slow task of identifying charred bodies 
speculation on the cause of the crash centered on bad weather 
along the approach path tegucigalpas airport is at the base of a 
ring of often cloudcovered mountains as if it were at the bottom 
of a soup bowl 
there was also speculation about the 727s age more than 20 
years leaving it open to possible metal fatigue which has 
affected other older jets 
maj alejandro arguello director of nicaraguas civil 
aeronautics quoted regional air controllers as saying the roof of 
the plane tore away before the crash 
passenger evenor lopez a honduran businessman who was badly 
burned in the crash said the plane shook as though from heavy air 
turbulence and seemed to dive more steeply than normal moments 
before the crash 
i was on fire when the plane stopped i tell you i thought i 
was going to die he said 
boeing co officials said the plane was sold to continental 
aitlines in 1968 continental leased the plane to tansahsa 
according to continental spokesman ned walker but he didnt know 
when

polands economic reformers have vowed to 
transform socialism into capitalism so far poles are learning one 
element poverty 
soup kitchens are opening across the country and the east blocs 
first food stamp program is being readied as poland prepares to 
deal for the first time with a problem that officially never 
existed under communist ideology 
with government controls lifted food prices are up 300 400 or 
even 1200 percent in three months and hunger looms for pensioners 
and even schoolchildren 
there is the new prospect of unemployment as inefficient 
factories close for lack of government subsidies 
when taduesz mazowiecki became the only noncommunist prime 
minister in the east bloc he warned that poles do not know just 
how painful it will be to revive the nations ruined economy 
poland has practically no sensible social welfare system 
says labor minister jacek kuron a veteran solidarity activist 
charged with organizing protection from the worst effects of 
economic reform 
such a system can be introduced but that will take one two or 
even three years yet people need to be helped right now he said 
in a recent newspaper interview local communities must organize 
themselves for such help this is where private initiative has an 
enormous task before it 
every day newspapers carry reports of new soup kitchens 
opening in tarnow 500 people are getting free meals and 100 more 
will be helped starting nov 1 a kitchen has opened in rzeszow and 
a second is planned a solidarity chapter in gdansk is collecting 
food donations 
milk bars used to be the mecca for poor people but since milk 
and cottage cheese prices have increased tenfold many old age 
pensioners were sentenced to a forced fast the peasant party 
newspaper said in a report on coupons distributed in poznan for 
free meals at the small seedy restaurants that serve dairy 
products eggs soup and bread but usually no meat 
up to 45 million pensioners poor children up to age 6 and 
others will receive coupons good for free milk bread and cottage 
cheese when the food stamp program starts in december 
a recent state television special showed the homeless under 
highways on park benches and in train stations a shop clerk 
reported a rise in shoplifting a divorced woman despaired about 
how she would provide for her two children now that their 
kindergarten fees demand nearly half her salary 
the irony is not lost on poles who for decades saw the homeless 
and unemployed in the united states in television footage backing 
the official ideology that socialism cares for all and only 
capitalism breeds poverty 
for four decades the price of food and other basic supplies 
were kept artificially low by government subsides shortages were 
rampant but bread potatoes and milk were very cheap 
the burden of those subsidies became clear when the new 
prosolidarity government threw open the account books on a huge 
budget deficit and began to do battle with deeply rooted waste and 
inefficiency 
at least with the new government we are feeling better about 
ourselves as poles said an elderly woman waiting at a warsaw 
soup kitchen but what can the government do with an empty 
treasury we are feeling more free but we cannot live on freedom 
alone we have to eat something 
the transition to a marketdriven economy from a vast 
centralized bureaucracy required lifting controls on food prices 
the outgoing communist government took that step on aug 1 but 
was criticized for not protecting people whose incomes lagged 
behind 
i worked for 30 years in peoples poland and i have a pension 
of 68000 zlotys 32 a month which means i cant afford 
anything says a 65yearold woman named kristina 
she pays 8000 zlotys a month for her room and that leaves 2000 
zlotys a day for everything else 
a halfpound of butter costs 3800 zlotys up from 300 zlotys 
three months ago and a small loaf of bread is 560 zlotys two 
pounds of pork is out of the question at 15000 zloty the woman 
points to her yearsold shoes and the winter coat from her niece 
she shrugs 
i worked as a teacher for so many years and now i cant even 
afford stockings for the winter said another woman she was 
among the mostly elderly people bowed over bowls of potato soup and 
bread at a polish red cross kitchen in warsaw that opened last 
month and serves 300 free meals a day 
since late september the organization has opened soup kitchens 
in 20 of polands 49 provinces said marta kukla deputy directory 
of social assistance 
she said poverty has increased sharply since august when the 
new government took office we are sure that for some people 
this is the only meal they have 
in lublin 90 miles southeast of warsaw 340 people a day are 
served soups and dumplings in a small basement kitchen run by the 
roman catholic churchlinked brother albert society 
organized to help alcoholics and the mentally ill the society 
has now found many others in need said the rev jan mazur 
the number of people coming here has doubled since june they 
are normal people made helpless as a result of the current 
situation said mazur 
among them are disabled children from a government institution 
that cannot afford to feed them lunch he said 
the society runs a shelter for 30 homeless women and hopes to 
open one for men soon plans also include a free health clinic and 
a telephone help line all common elements of western 
philanthropy virtually unheard of in poland

buzz aldrin the second man to walk on the 
moon wants nonastronauts such as teachers writers or singers in 
space 
the space program doesnt belong to just those in the space 
business he said its something that requires the support of 
the american people it belongs to them and i think we have to 
begin to make that accessible 
he made his comments saturday at a convention of the new 
hampshire association of broadcasters as the space shuttle atlantis 
was in the midst of its mission which included deployment of the 
nuclearpowered galileo probe 
nasa suspended its program to send private citizens in space 
following the 1986 challenger space shuttle tragedy that killed 
concord teacher christa mcauliffe and six other crew members 
aldrin said it was time to restart the program 
professional astronauts are talented in commanding spacecraft 
or controlling them or understanding the technical contributions 
but were not necessarily that talented in being able to convey 
the philosophy of what the meaning of this is what the beauty of 
this is because thats not our expertise 
he said it would be wise to take a cue from the ancients who 
passed on stories through songs and myths 
in modern days you put it to some sort of a catchy tune he 
said you send a silvertongued journalist up there and he is 
going to write something and well read it or he will say something 
and well listen to it but were not going to play it over and 
over again as we would a song 
aldrin 59 also criticized nasa in general for what he called 
its lack of foresight 
he applauded presidents bushs call for americans to return to 
the moon and head to mars but questioned whether nasa was ready to 
set in motion those ideals 
he said the united states should be planning spaceports and 
transportation depots for interplanetary travel which could be 
used with smaller rockets and less fuel instead of launching huge 
payloads which require large expensive rockets

sen claiborne pell the courtly chairman of 
the senate foreign relations committee is considering ending his 
30year senate career but democrats say they are pushing him 
hard to run for reelection 
pell will be 71 next month and these democrats say he has every 
right to retire 
but they also say his decision to step aside would make the 1990 
rhode island senate race highly competitive perhaps leaving an 
otherwise virtually safe seat vulnerable to a strong republican 
drive 
republicans say that if the veteran rhode island senator does 
retire there is a betterthaneven chance that rep claudine 
schneider rri the almostcertain gop candidate can prevail 
spurring the gops drive to regain the senate majority it lost in 
1986 
the democratic party and his own colleagues are pushing him 
hard to run said a senate source close to pell adding that one 
of those doing some gentle pushing is senate majority leader george 
mitchell of maine 
we are telling him we need you we want you you are an 
important part of this body said anita dunn communications 
director for the democratic senatorial campaign committee 
senator pell has said he is undecided there is every 
indication that he has not made up his mind she said i think 
his colleagues would clearly like him to run 
i think its a blow if he doesnt run said sen john kerry 
dmass a former chairman of the democratic campaign committee 
kerry said that is because pell is widely regarded as all but 
certain to retain his seat if he does seek a fifth sixyear term 
but its really his choice kerry said its a very 
personal thing and its hard for the committee to intrude its 
hard for the democratic caucus to intrude 
pell has done no fundraising leaving the strong impression he 
will choose to retire he has repeatedly told associates he is 
genuinely undecided but that he will announce a decision possibly 
by midnovember 
i will make my views known at an appropriate time pell says 
when asked the question directly 
hes clearly considering stepping down and is looking for 
alternative ways to pursue his foreign policy interests said 
sen richard lugar rind the senator pell succeeded as chairman 
pell has much to ponder he will be 72 shortly after the 1990 
elections 78 at the end of a new sixyear term 
in rhode island pell has two conflicting precedents to follow 
he holds the seat vacated by sen theodore francis green 
dri who was 92 when he retired 
but pell has often quoted with apparent approval the line used 
by sen john o pastore dri when he ended his political career 
in 1976 at age 69 it was good to leave pastore said while the 
music is still playing 
on the other hand pell is the chambers fourth most senior 
member he is the author of the pell grant program for college 
tuition aid the chairmanship of the foreign relations committee 
represents an ambition realized 
but pell a softspoken and reserved liberal has had to face 
constant often grating guerrilla warfare from sen jesse helms 
rnc the panels archconservative he has often had difficulty 
persuading the panel to face up to its legislative burden 
repeatedly failing to obtain the quorums needed to do business 
party officials offer varying assessments of the impact if pell 
decides to retire 
wendy de mocker communications director for the national 
republican senatorial committee asserted that pell himself is 
vulnerable to a strong campaign by rep schneider 
speaking for the democrats anita dunn said pells retirement 
would move a fairly safe democratic seat onto the playing field 
and make it a competitive race 
but she said that should not develop into an opening wedge that 
causes democrats to lose their majority in the senate which the 
party now controls 5545

two 100ton chunks of the upper san 
franciscooakland bay bridge were painstakingly cut up and lowered 
onto a barge 200 feet below to start the job of repairing the 
critical earthquakedamaged span 
for 53 years the bridge has been the main link between oakland 
and san francisco tuesdays 69magnitude earthquake dislodged a 
portion of the upper deck and sent it slamming onto the lower 
portion 
the dangerous job of removing the collapsed 200ton section of 
the upper bridge started sunday to remove the 74foot by 50foot 
section california department of transportation workers sawed the 
200ton slab in half 
the first part of the upper bridge was lowered sunday afternoon 
said caltrans spokesman greg bayol a little before midnight the 
second stretch of the upper span was lowered work on the lower 
bridge was scheduled to begin today 
during the next month alternate routes will have to be found 
for 260000 vehicles that had been using the bay bridge each day 
those include other bridges a makeshift fleet of ferries and the 
rapid transit system 
everything will take a lot longer than it ordinarily would 
said a dispatcher for the quicksilver delivery service in oakland 
the company will use a system of riders on the bay area rapid 
transit tunnel under the bay to deliver letters and small packages 
to runners posted at transit stations in the cities said the 
dispatcher who would not allow his name to be used 
ordinarily we wouldnt use bart at all he said 
a huge crane was used to hoist the damaged pieces of the upper 
deck off the 85milelong bridge opened in 1936 bayol said 
officials say it will cost up to 1 million to repair the bridge 
nationally broadcast pictures of the broken bridge with the 
upper deck dangling like an open trap door provided the first 
graphic illustration of the magnitude of tuesdays quake one woman 
died when she drove her car into the gap 
the bridge had also been in the logo created for the 1989 world 
series between the san francisco giants and the oakland athletics 
but its closure contributed to sundays decision to delay 
resumption of the sevengame baseball championship until friday 
officials hope the added delay will reduce traffic problems 
the section of lower roadway that took the brunt of the impact 
when the upper level fell open must also be removed but the lower 
roadway is not repairable so it will be ripped out in smaller 
pieces later and a new section installed bayol said 
state officials hope to reuse the steel portions of the upper 
span and hoist them back into place he said it was cut in half 
with concrete saws and blow torches to make it easier to move

khmer rouge guerrillas claim to have 
seized the gemrich cambodian border town of pailin and routed 
government troops after months of combat 
if true it would be a major psychological military and 
economic victory for the khmer rouge the largest of three 
guerrilla groups fighting the prohanoi government in cambodia 
in a radio broadcast the khmer rouge military command described 
the taking of pailin on sunday as a victory of strategic and 
historic meaning 
during a decade of guerrilla war before vietnams professed 
september withdrawal the khmer rouge had been unable to establish 
a viable liberated zone inside cambodia 
the short preliminary report said the guerrillas utterly 
routed the defending government troops and inflicted severe 
casualties to provincial and district forces the report could not 
be independently verified 
it said parts of three vietnamese divisions whose soldiers were 
disguised as cambodian troops were also routed and forced to 
retreat east of route 10 the khmer rouge claims vietnam has left 
behind tens of thousands of disguised soldiers 
the khmer rouge report said the victors seized 13 artillery 
pieces hundreds of antiaircraft guns four tanks eight trucks 
and tons of ammunition 
the report was broadcast just 15 minutes after the alleged 
capture of pailin a transcript was made available by a western 
embassy today 
pailin located opposite thailands chanthaburi province is 
rich in rubies and sapphires which have been mined in the area 
since at least the late 19th century 
some analysts have speculated the khmer rouge want pailin not 
only to boost morale among its fighters but as economic insurance 
should thailand and china lessen or cut their support 
the khmer rouge ruled cambodia for four years until vietnams 
1978 invasion sending hundreds of thousands of people to their 
death as it tried to convert the country into a radical agrarian 
commune many cambodians fear the khmer rouge will return to power 
fighting in pailin has been regarded by analysts as a major test 
of strength between the khmer rouge and the government 
i dont see any possibility it can fall into enemy hands 
cambodian prime minister hun sen told foreign journalists in phnom 
penh a month ago 
at the time prominent phnom penh editor khieu kanharith also 
said the best troops of each side were contesting the town the 
editor said on some days as many as 2000 mortar shells were 
falling on pailin 
by most accounts the khmer rouge and its coalition partners 
hope to seize significant territory in western cambodia and force 
the phnom penh government to the negotiating table a probable 
target is the regions largest urban center battambang about 40 
miles northeast of pailin 
the broadcast by the khmer rouge command urged fighters to 
fully defend the strategic town of pailin continue attacks and 
force opponents to the negotiating table 
the khmer rouges two noncommunist partners have also scored 
gains since the vietnamese troop withdrawal in late september 
western diplomats and resistance leaders say the partners fortunes 
have been boosted significantly by sophisticated antitank weapons 
that have arrived in the past few months 
the sources say many of the weapons were sent by france which 
denies shipping any arms to the resistance 
reliable sources also say the united states pays the cost of 
some of training in the antitank weapons washington denies 
providing lethal aid to the resistance 
officials in bangkok said meanwhile that prime minister 
chatichai choonhavan of thailand will meet four top beijing leaders 
and perhaps cambodian resistance chief prince norodom sihanouk in a 
threeday visit to china 
cambodia is excepted to be a major topic of discussion the 
officials said chatichai is to leaves for china on tuesday 
china and thailand are key backers of cambodias guerrilla 
coalition the thais allow military supplies principally from 
china to travel through its territory to rebels

it was a battle of world chess champions man 
vs computer and the mind proved mightier than the microchip for 
now 
the world champion 26yearold garri kasparov coasted to two 
victories sunday over deep thought a chessplaying computer that 
can analyze over 700000 moves a second 
kasparov said at first he missed the psychological tension and 
energy of a human opponent 
but then he felt a burst of energy from the audience wanting 
me to really crush the computer because we all have something in 
common we are all human beings 
the champion said computers are moving in the right direction 
and predicted machines will be able to beat strong grandmasters in 
two or three years 
im very happy i could do in both games what i wanted said 
kasparov who hasnt lost a tournament since 1981 in the first 
game with black i played quietly in the second game i tried to 
crush it in the opening 
the winner of the 1989 world computer chess championship retired 
from the first game after kasparovs 52nd move 
playing white in the second game kasparov took deep thoughts 
queen in move 18 the computer hung on for 19 more moves before 
resigning 
the champion noted that the computer kept playing long after a 
fleshandblood opponent would have resigned 
i think the computer needs to be taught something how to 
resign he said 
kasparov said he accepted the challenge because i want to 
foresee the future 
the world champion was paid an undisclosed sum for the days 
workout said al landa a spokesman for the new york academy of 
art the site of the match 
the computer didnt travel for the match it remained in 
pittsburgh with a telephone line to relay its moves to a computer 
terminal in new york where someone moved the chess pieces on a 
board 
deep thought created by researchers at carnegiemellon 
university in pittsburgh can search 700000 positions per second 
and analyze from five to 20 upcoming moves by each side as well as 
each moves implications 
last november deep thought beat the worlds 96th ranked player 
denmarks bent larsen the first time a computer had defeated a 
grandmaster in tournament play 
kasparov who lives in the soviet city of baku in azerbaijan 
became a grandmaster 10 years ago and captured the world 
championship in 1985 
before the match chess commentator shelby lyman said deep 
thought is clearly the first chess computer with the potential to 
draw blood and defeat the world champion 
lyman predicted the computer would make moves to catch kasparov 
off guard 
but it was kasparovs moves that caught the computer by surprise 
he said he realized early in the first game that he would win 
when the computer missed some tactical opportunities and was unable 
to analyze all of the champions decisions 
kasparov said if a person had beaten another person as badly 
he wouldnt be able to stand the second game 
in the second game kasparov explained he wanted to create a new 
opening that the computer wouldnt be able to break down 
kasparov said that the computer was fully aggressive but 
that its mind was too straight and too primitive 
chess is much wider than just calculations its even wider 
than logic you have to use fantasy intuition and some kind of 
prediction kasparov said 
but the computer does have some advantages he said we can 
lose hope a computer cant lose hope 
one of the main goals of the match is to learn something about 
deep thought said murray campbell who with fenghsiung hsu 
created the computer program at carnegiemellon 
campbell said it appeared there was a bug in the computer during 
the match which was part of an annual chess competition sponsored 
by ags computers inc 
it wasnt looking at the right moves he said it wasnt 
given a chance to show its best style of play

california leads the nation and much of the 
world in construction rules for earthquake safety but future quakes 
will kill many people unless more is done to make buildings and 
bridges tougher experts say 
authorities also say that forecast does not apply to shaky 
california alone many parts of the united states have earthquake 
potential and could learn lessons from last tuesdays 69magnitude 
jolt in northern california 
the lesson of this quake is that we have the technology to 
radically reduce death injury and damage in case of an earthquake 
lets get on with using it said state sen don rogers of 
bakersfield the only geologist in californias legislature 
unreinforced brick and brittle concrete structures need 
strengthening and tax incentives should be given to foster design 
of new buildings with shock absorbers in foundations quakedamping 
devices in walls and automatic gasshutoff valves to prevent 
fires rogers said 
tuesdays san francisco bay area quake claimed scores of lives 
many in the collapse of the doubledeck nimitz freeway in oakland 
others in toppled buildings yet the overwhelming majority of 
structures stood 
in contrast the quake in armenia last dec 7 which also 
measured 69 on the richter scale of ground motion killed many of 
its 25000 victims in collapsed apartments built with unreinforced 
masonry walls and precast concrete floor slabs 
armenian cities were also close to the fault while last weeks 
epicenter was in a rural area 50 miles from san francisco and 
oakland armenia lacks timber many us homes are built with 
quakeresistant wood frames 
nevertheless we would have experienced a tremendous amount of 
devastation without the building codes and standards we have in 
california said state architect michael j bocchicchio the 
number of lives lost and the amount of damage would have approached 
some quakes in other parts of the world 
but tuesdays quake was not the ultimate test we should not 
rest on our laurels he said warning of deadly hazard from 
californias thousands of unreinforced brick buildings and 
softstory concrete buildings with stiff upper levels atop 
inflexible frames 
a 1988 us geological survey study reported that southern 
california is 60 percent likely to be rocked by a magnitude75 to 
8 big one within 30 years while the bay area faces 5050 odds 
of a magnitude7 quake possibly on the hayward fault beneath 
berkeley oakland and hayward 
the usgs said a repeat of san franciscos 83magnitude 1906 
quake is only 10 percent likely within 30 years but a 1980 federal 
report said it could claim 11000 lives the report said the 
southern california quake could kill 14000 people a magnitude74 
hayward fault jolt might kill 7000 
unless we take the threat seriously we could have an 
appalling death toll said richard eisner director of the 
oaklandbased bay area regional earthquake preparedness project 
past quakes did spur improvements 
the 1933 magnitude63 long beach quake killed 115 people and 
many schools collapsed after students went home laws soon required 
seismic resistance in new buildings and old school buildings were 
strengthened 
los angeles sylmar quake of 1971 with a magnitude of 64 
toppled freeway overpasses and killed at least 58 people many in a 
collapsed hospital the temblor prompted stringent hospital 
construction standards a 1976 revamp of model building codes and 
the 58million first phase of a program to strengthen freeway 
bridges 
a later phase not yet started would have attempted to 
strengthen columns that gave way during the nimitz collapse 
much damage from tuesdays quake wasnt surprising including 
collapse of old unreinforced brick buildings destruction of homes 
sitting on soft fill and fires from natural gas leaks 
seismic disaster threatens much of the nation quakes are most 
frequent in alaska and california but great earthquakes rocked new 
madrid mo in 181112 and the pacific northwest in prehistoric 
times the east coast has sustained strong jolts

to complete that scary halloween costume an 
optometrist has designed glowinthe dark contact lenses 
dr john herron colors the lenses by dipping them into commonly 
used ophthalmic dyes after being treated the dyes become 
florescent green and red in the dark 
youll be weird herron promised but the rest of the 
world looks like it really is 
herron began making them for others after he played a trick on a 
patient and she insisted on having a pair 
the lenses last about a week and cost 750 a pair 
theyre interesting and a conversation piece herron said 
and i thought it would be fun especially for halloween 
the dallas optometrist said he plans to put on a pair and light 
up a halloween party

sue rakes concedes it may be tough to sit in a 
boat for an eighthour bass fishing tournament without a bathroom 
break but she doesnt think it should keep her out of the 
competition 
i take my fishing seriously and i deserve the same 
opportunities as the males she said i dont want to be pushy 
and feminist but i want people to understand the situation im in 
i just want to be treated fairly 
organizers for a state tournament sponsored by the north 
carolina bass federation have told her she couldnt 
participate partly because they say men want their privacy if they 
need to go to the bathroom 
mrs rakes has fished her way into the tournament for the past 
two years this year she qualified by finishing 18th out of 122 
fishermen who competed in a regional contest 
lyn wheatley the director of the bass federation in 
montgomery ala said the reason women are banned from state and 
national tournaments was simple 
sometimes when youre out on the water mother nature calls 
he said even though we dont encourage fishermen to answer the 
call sometimes they do 
partners are matched randomly for the competition he said 
pairing two females in a boat would be a case of discrimination 
the state bass tournament will be held on lake norman near 
charlotte in april

batmen and jokers will be on the loose halloween 
night but a shortage of the trickortreat getups will keep such 
encounters down 
managers of dallasarea costume stores say they are swamped with 
requests for batman and joker costumes following this summers 
blockbuster movie but red tape involving copyrights has meant a 
limited number of caped crusader outfits in stores 
the supplier hasnt been able to keep up with the demand 
said howard hale manager of the magicland on forest lane in dallas 
dusty thompson owner of costumes by dusty in arlington 
followed a hunch that halloween would be big on superhero costumes 
while other area stores have sold out their batman and joker suits 
he still has some costumes available 
he said the batman the joker and even superman have beat out 
his more imaginative costumes such as giant broccoli and hot dogs

rhode island oysters as famous as 
maine lobsters until pollution and overfishing wiped them out 
during world war ii may be making a comeback 
the numbers are tiny as yet but shellfish dealers report buying 
occasional batches of oysters from fishermen who normally harvest 
quahog clams 
there are quite a bit of oysters around said mark boucher 
manager of top quality shellfish in bristol two three years 
ago you wouldnt see anybody digging them 
but some rhode island oyster beds remain offlimits because of 
pollution 
the largest oyster population is in the pawcatuck river which 
has been closed to shellfishing for years said arthur ganz 
senior marine biologist with the state department of environmental 
management 
to assess the extent of the comeback the narragansett bay 
project next month will start an 18month study to pinpoint the 
bays oyster beds 
the speculation now is that they are remnants of the 
cultivated oyster industry that was flourishing here in 1900 to 
1940 said caroline karp the projects director 
michael rice assistant professor of fisheries at the university 
of rhode island said the drop in metal pollution in the upper bay 
in the last few years might be one explanation for the oyster 
revival adult oysters can live in extremely polluted waters but 
metal contamination can be fatal to oyster larvae 
metal pollution at the narragansett bay commissions sewage 
treatment plant in providence dropped from 954000 pounds per year 
in 1981 to 180500 pounds per year in 1988 said chip young 
spokesman for the environmental group save the bay 
parts of the bay distant from the plant are open to shellfishing 
the oyster industry flourished in narragansett bay in the early 
part of the century because oysters spawn best in comparatively 
fresh water but grow best in saltier water the baby bivalves were 
imported into the bay 
the oysters were dredged from coves in connecticut schoonered 
over to narragansett bay and left to grow until they were big and 
fat and succulent ganz said 
the old discarded shells would be shoveled back on the 
schooners sent back to connecticut and used as cultch the 
ragged surface that young oysters need to attach themselves to in 
order to grow 
rhode island oysters in those days were known as the best in the 
country smaller but less salty than those raised in the chesapeake 
bay rice said 
they had a mystique about them something like the maine 
lobsters rice said 
increasing pollution and the destruction of reefs by silt and 
overuse of oyster tongs wiped out the oysters around world war ii 
and many shellfishermen turned to quahogs or hardshell clams 
that recently have become a rhode island state symbol rice said 
ironically a shortage of quahogs may be helping fuel the 
renewed interest in oystering said boucher 
they are digging them now more so because of the shortage of 
littlenecks boucher said the upper bay isnt open as much 
anymore to quahogging so theyre looking for any other way to 
make a dollar 
oysters bring anywhere from 70 cents to 120 a pound at rhode 
island docks about the same price as steamer clams but less than 
the prized littlenecks the smallest and most tender of the quahogs

one month after hurricane hugo 
bashed this shrimping village 65foot trawlers remain sprawled 
along the shattered waterfront bulldozers remove oaks on roads 
and mattresses dry on porches 
but as the nation focuses on the earthquake in the san francisco 
bay area 3000 miles away this community of 500 is entering the 
most difficult part of its recovery 
hugo hit just as the fourmonth shrimping season was getting 
under way 
everything is tied to the seafood in one way or another 
said rutledge leland mayor of the 150yearold village located 
about 40 miles north of charleston i think the biggest problem 
is the reality of the fact that so much of our economy has been 
destroyed and that there are so many people that have lost their 
businesses and their boats 
hugo roared ashore sept 21 with 135 mph winds and storm surges 
of 10 to 15 feet the storm ultimately killed 18 and caused at 
least 4 billion in damage in south carolina alone before fading 
into the northeast 
shrimping is one of those things where you make it all in 
about 120 150 days a year leland said last week if you 
havent made it by thanksgiving thats it and thats just about 
the time most of these guys are going to get back to work 
lelands seafood packing plant which he estimates accounts for 
about 70 percent of the towns 7 million in annual seafood sales 
was largely ruined he hopes to be operating at 50 percent capacity 
by the time the shrimping season ends in december 
about 60 percent of mcclellanvilles 35boat fleet was knocked 
out of service for at least 30 days to 60 days when the hurricane 
swept ashore leland said 
only 30 feet of the towns 2500 feet of dock survived the storm 
farrell white 50 has been a shrimper for the past 35 years 
now his 73foot boat daddys girl lies aground some 30 feet 
from the harbor with an estimated 50000 in damage 
shrimping seasons over for us white said 
he hopes to refloat his boat and obtain a small business 
administration loan which could supply up to 500000 for lost 
equipment and wages at interest rates as low as 4 percent 
national relief efforts have flooded the village with food 
clothing and volunteers so much so that some has been distributed 
to other nearby communities 
but housing for the newly homeless still remains a problem 
precise figures are unavailable but officials say nearly 400 
people have asked for federal assistance in repairing their homes 
or relocating to temporary housing 
lincoln high school remains closed indefinitely it was flooded 
with 7 feet of water the schools 330 students returned to classes 
last week 25 miles away in charleston suburbs where teachers are 
newly trained in stress counseling 
for adults as many as five mental health counselors have been 
in town every day since the hurricane counselors plan to stay into 
next year 
leland is concerned about the time it will take the town to 
rebound 
i dont know how you put a town under leland said it was 
a real thriving seafood town but its going to take us four or 
five years to even come close to where we were before

life for farmworkers was never 
predictable even before an earthquake destroyed at least 370 homes 
and forced hundreds of people onto the streets of this farming 
community 
its a situation many have faced before even in the best of 
times 
being homeless is only a couple of dollars away and they are 
trying to figure out daytoday where they are going to live 
said estella mejia who works for salud para la gente a community 
health clinic 
lifes very unstable and when something like this happens it 
adds to it they live with crises already mejia said 
but normally those crises are personal families living 10 to 
a home or workers combing the region for jobs when the harvests are 
over 
this time the people are suffering as a community 
when we go on the streets and into camps to visit its a 
little chaotic but what gives me hope is there are a lot of people 
who care mejia said 
watsonville a community of 30000 is near the epicenter of 
tuesdays quake about 80 miles south of san francisco it is a 
frozen food processing center for vegetables grown in the areas 
fields 
city councilman rex clark said the disaster brought the 
community together 
i see neighbors whom ive known for a long time and only say 
hello to and now suddenly you stop to talk and see whats happened 
to their houses clark said 
a halfdozen tent encampments have sprouted in vacant fields 
where officials estimate 500 are living about 1000 others are in 
three shelters countless others are living in cars or yards 
many residents were so frightened by the quake and its 
aftershocks they refuse to go indoors even though their homes had 
been declared safe 
its just scary i think another disaster is going to 
happen said rosa chavez who has spent nights since the quake 
with her 8monthold baby and other family members in the back of 
her fathers truck the little kids are afraid of going into any 
building 
raymundo leyva is one of those who fear another tremor could 
topple the weakened walls of his house after tuesdays quake as 
soon as he could get to a working telephone line leyva called his 
grandparents in mexico who had survived their own powerful 
earthquake four years ago 
everyone was crying they said they were happy to hear from me 
because they thought watsonville was gone leyva said they 
thought it was going to happen the same thing that happened in 
mexico city i did too 
city spokeswoman lorraine washington said no attempt will be 
made to ban camping until all homes are inspected and it is 
determined who was left truly homeless workers so far have marked 
330 homes unsafe to enter near the hardhit downtown area that 
total is expected to rise dramatically as workers travel into the 
outskirts of town she said 
damage to the city has been estimated at 122 million with the 
loss of downtown businesses making up a quarter of that total 
almost an entire block of businesses bordering a central plaza 
where townspeople normally gather in the evenings will have to be 
demolished several landmarks including fords department store 
and the town clock are among those will have to be razed 
thats going to dramatically change the appearance of the 
downtown plaza because those buildings were the backdrop said 
clark 
theres a lot of victorian architecture and no ones going to 
replace it with that style he said hopefully we wont become 
glass and steel

the earthquake that left them spiritually 
homeless hasnt shaken the faith of the parishioners at st francis 
de sales cathedral 
the centuryold roman catholic cathedral was declared unsafe 
after tuesdays 69magnitude earthquake its tower cracked and 
leaning many parishioners kept away by a wire fence sought 
spiritual comfort sunday in a baptist church down the street 
sometimes in life god shakes us and says pay attention 
there is something more important than the ordinary things in our 
lives the rev joseph m powers told the congregation 
it wasnt just the ground that shook tuesday the earthquake 
shook a lot of things that we do ordinary things on our agenda 
st francis has served people in this community for 102 years 
it stands in an older section of town across from the bus station 
it rarely draws a huge crowd senior citizens neighborhood 
families and some commuters come together to form what priests call 
an urban community 
yet it is loved and its damage has brought pain to the 
congregation 
i need to cry i need to let go its a heavy burden on the 
heart said ona solom who assisted at sundays service 
but the rev james keeley notes that a church is more than a 
structure 
a building is important he said but people they are 
more important 
and while the parishioners at st francis sang from our exile 
god bring us home people here and in surrounding communities were 
joining together to make sure they were all right and to find 
comfort and to offer help to others 
some churches encouraged congregants to share stories either at 
prayer breakfasts or services 
churches and synagogues collected money food and clothes a 
group of protestant churches started a counseling service sending 
ministers to visit those who need help 
at the shiloh christian fellowship congregants were urged to 
donate their skills to help those whose homes had been damaged 
we dont want to offer only prayers we want to offer 
something more we want to help people who need it said the rev 
david kiteley shilohs minister

in the late 1960s and early 1970s when many of 
her fellow college students were demonstrating for peace karen 
macnutt was encouraging women to join her schools shooting team 
later she opposed a ban on firearms at the university of 
massachusetts and in one way or another since then macnutt has 
been fighting for the right to bear arms 
her latest battle is against a proposed boston ban on 
semiautomatic weapons 
for macnutt a lawyer the fight is more than an abstract cause 
she owns and uses semiautomatic rifles including an m1a rifle 
and an sks carbine 
i basically use guns for three reasons she says i use 
them for protection i use them for target shooting and i also do a 
little bit of collecting 
a bill to ban the weapons in boston been approved by the state 
house and the senate is scheduled to take up the legislation 
monday in its present form the bill would require owners of 
assault weapons to get special permits from the police commissioner 
to keep them and would all but ban any new militarystyle guns in 
the city 
the legislation a socalled home rule petition which is 
proposed by the city but which must be approved by the legislature 
would outlaw specific types of semiautomatic rifles by model it 
also would create a board that could add weapons to the banned list 
a lifelong gun enthusiast macnutt says the measure would 
unfairly punish those who have legally and responsibly owned guns 
for years 
macnutt belongs to the national rifle association and also is on 
the board of directors of the gun owners action league a 
statewide group leading the legislative charge against the proposed 
ban 
her experience with guns dates back to childhood when an 
antique gun was part of family folklore 
the revolver belonged to her greatgrandfather a ships captain 
in the late 1800s according to family stories he used the gun to 
quell a mutiny aboard his leaky ship some crew members wanted to 
abandon the ship for lifeboats but macnutts grandfather kept them 
pumping water instead 
he saved his crew and saved his cargo and it was a good thing 
he was able to keep control macnutt said 
her parents encouraged macnutt and her siblings to ask questions 
about the gun and handle it under their guidance 
firearm safety was impressed upon us at an early age she 
said there was never any mystique about it there was never any 
forbidden fruit 
macnutt got her first gun as a christmas present at age 13 she 
still has the 22caliber bolt action rifle 
i had wanted it and wanted it when i was 13 they figured i 
was old enough she says 
today she owns several semiautomatic weapons including the 
m1a rifle a version of the m14 rifle refitted for civilian use 
and the sks simonov carbine a semiautomatic weapon with a fixed 
magazine that holds up to 10 rounds 
those who favor the ban question the value of such weapons for 
sport shooting they say the guns only pose a danger to people 
macnutt disagrees 
theyre not the type of gun that i think anybody in their 
right mind would carry into a holdup because theyre large theyre 
heavy she said 
macnutt argues that people who own guns legally dont misuse 
them people who own guns illegally cause the problems she said 
and they arent going to be stopped by legislation to further 
regulate gun use 
macnutt lives with her mother in the dorchester section of 
boston an area beset by drugrelated violence she has never had 
to use a gun in selfdefense but says feels safe because she can 
handle firearms 
fascinated by gun history macnutt gives a minidiscourse on the 
evolution of modern firearms with little prompting 
beginning in her college days macnutt has worked hard to 
integrate women into the sport she belongs to a number of clubs 
and she shoots competitively on weekends during the warm months 
there is nothing alarming or exotic about the sport she said 
adding its much like a bowling club

president daniel ortega met in 
emergency session with his top security officials after a weekend 
attack by usbacked contra rebels in which 18 soldiers were 
killed the government said 
the soldiers were ambushed on their way to register for feb 25 
national elections and the defense ministry accused rebels of 
trying to disrupt voter registration 
ortega met late sunday with his brother defense minister 
humberto ortega and interior minister tomas borge to consider 
measures against rebel attacks it was not immediately clear what 
those might be 
the ambush late saturday occurred near cerro del mono about 145 
miles north of the capital 
the soldiers were armed but it was a surprise attack they 
fell into an ambush and could not return fire said ronald 
martinez a defense ministry spokesman at matagalpa province where 
the attack occurred 
the attack was part of a contra campaign to disrupt the 
electoral process the defense ministry alleged 
sunday was the last day for nicaraguas 13 million people of 
voting age to register 
officials said government troops on sunday also fought off 
rebels in chontales province 90 miles east of managua lt marlon 
rodriguez said 15 rebels attacked the voter registration office 
but there were no casualties 
two other rebel attacks were reported elsewhere sunday but no 
one was reported killed or injured in those attacks either 
nicaraguas leftist sandinista government and the contra rebels 
agreed march 21 to suspend offensive operations but talks aimed at 
a permanent end to their 7yearold war are at a stalemate and 
there has been sporadic fighting 
there was no immediate comment from the contras on sundays 
reports 
the elections come under a regional peace plan under which five 
central american presidents agreed to disband the contras based 
in neighboring honduras by dec 8 in exchange ortega moved up 
the election date from 1991 and promised free balloting 
last year the united states cut off military aid to the 
contras but washington still gives them nonlethal aid 
on saturday president bush signed a 9 million aid package 
designed to support nicaraguan opposition groups the 14party 
opposition coalition formed for the election has denied any 
connection to the contra attacks 
both the bush administration and contra leaders want to maintain 
the rebels as a fighting force until the election to make sure 
ortega fulfills his pledge

the directors of a vietnam war museum 
resigned after acknowledging they falsely claimed experience in the 
war 
gaylord o stevens and kenneth m bonner the director and 
assistant director of the vietnam war museum in san antonios alamo 
plaza both had displayed photocopies of military discharge papers 
that falsely credited them with serving in elite special forces 
during the war the dallas times herald reported 
both men resigned after being presented with evidence by the 
newspaper that their claims of vietnam military service were 
fictitious 
rather than being a navy seal in vietnam in 196869 stevens 
served in the coast guard from 1969 until 1972 and never left the 
united states according to information provided by the national 
personnel records center in st louis 
this is fact this is me said stevens when handed a copy 
of his actual service record last week 
bonner 31 who added seven years to his age to claim having 
served in the us army special forces in vietnam in 197172 
conceded last week that he did not even enter the service until 
1978 three years after the war ended the newspaper said 
the two said that the end justified the means 
no matter what you say about us we did something that no one 
else has done and no one had the guts to attempt bonner said 
i knew the museum had to be built stevens said i still 
believe the only way it could have been built was the way it was 
built i assumed a role and i assumed i could take it off just as 
easily 
since its july 4 grand opening thousands have taken tours 
conducted by vietnam veteran volunteers to view the donated war 
artifacts 
its basically a shame that these things occur said tony 
poncik president of the san antonio vietnam veterans of america 
the museum is a good idea too bad it was carried out under less 
than honorable pretenses

thousands of people living near a gas pipeline in 
western siberia were evacuated after an explosion and fire caused 
by a rupture in the line which was under repair soviet television 
reported 
in a report from tobolsk 1000 miles southeast of moscow the 
evening news program vremya said sunday night that the rupture 
occurred on a section of the same pipeline that exploded june 4 
killing 607 people in a nearby train 
no injuries or deaths were reported in the blast in a remote 
sparsely populated area the report did not specify how many people 
were evacuated or when they would be allowed to return 
vremya said the blast ocurred when workers tested the line with 
water when the pipe burst not only water but heavy steam which 
was still left in the pipe exploded from the rupture the report 
said 
the blast was seen by experts as a warning that other explosions 
may occur on the pipeline executive councils of the tumen region 
were forced to evacuate thousands of people from the danger zone 
along the pipeline the report said 
according to vremya it will be unsafe to fully resume pumping 
gas through the pipeline for at least two years 
we believe that two years at least are needed to bring the 
pipeline into an operational state chief engineer vn chepursky 
told vremya if the pipeline is reopened too quickly he said 
the lives of thousands of people who live alongside the pipeline 
will be threatened 
the report said the more thoroughly repair teams work the 
more faulty places on the pipeline they discover 
the june explosion severely crimped the countrys gas supply 
officials said in july gas minister viktor s chernomyrdin said at 
the time that the pipeline normally carried 13500 of the 17000 
tons of liquefied gas sent daily to the countrys center from 
western siberia 
after the explosion the daily supply was cut by 5000 tons 
the 1155mile pipeline carrying a mixture of benzene propane 
and butane from western siberia to the center of the country burst 
june 4 as two passenger trains were passing in a nearby valley 
an electric spark from one of the trains touched off an 
explosion and fire killing 607 passengers near ufa 745 miles

commonwealth leaders today accused 
british prime minister margaret thatcher of disloyalty for 
repudiating the groups new strategy to pressure south africa on 
reforms 
prime minister brian mulroney of canada said mrs thatcher 
ignored fair play by issuing a separate dissenting statement 
without telling the others just an hour after the summit released 
its south africa declaration sunday 
the dispute flared when the 49nation summit of britain and its 
former colonies resumed in closed session on its penultimate date 
britain had signed the commonwealth declaration which 
incorporated mrs thatchers objections to key provisions those 
included giving the whiteled government six months to fulfill 
promises of dismantling apartheid and calling for tighter financial 
pressure on pretoria 
in her dissenting statement mrs thatcher endorsed the 
declarations stipulation that current embargoes should be 
maintained but charged that they have strengthened white extremism 
in south africa 
today with the leaders sitting round the conference table 
mulroney and australias bob hawke the main authors of the 
declaration criticized mrs thatcher 
the price of commonwealth membership is loyalty mulroneys 
aides quoted him as saying 
british officials reported mrs thatcher replied she was 
astounded and utterly appalled at the attacks 
mulroney told reporters after the heated session i believe if 
you are going to function in a commonwealth you have to follow the 
basic british tradition of fair play 
where would we be if 49 countries did this he said you 
sign a deal at five oclock and repudiate it at six saying by 
the way what i signed really doesnt reflect all my views 
prime minister hawke told mrs thatcher this is not the way 
business should be done australian officials reported 
hawke and mulroney said they had wide backing from the other 
leaders in the mainly third world organization which includes 
black african countries that are deeply hostile to south africas 
whiteled government and apartheid 
the contretemp was the latest over south africa which quit the 
commonwealth in 1961 
for most of the 1980s the sanctions issue has split the 
organization which prides itself on being a unique family with 
a shared language and history 
mrs thatcher is the commonwealths sole opponent of imposing 
tough embargoes she has argued forcibly at kuala lumpur that south 
africas new president fw de klerk deserves encouragement in 
moves toward reform not more sanctions 
in pretoria south african foreign minister pik botha said 
sanctions can only further delay the negotiation process in south 
africa 
any efforts to prescribe a time schedule or an agenda is 
rejected by the south african government he added 
the declaration says the sanctions aim to bring the pretoria 
government to the negotiating table 
mrs thatcher leaving the conference hall said she was 
entitled to spell out her different view 
youve got to be fair youve got to be fair she said 
new zealand tried to smooth things over 
prime minister geoffrey palmer said mrs thatchers way of 
doing things isnt calculated to make the heads of government 
happy 
but i dont think it is good for the commonwealth to turn it 
into an organization that orchestrates hymns of hate against the 
united kingdom he said 
british foreign secretary john major claimed late sunday that 
britain has dragged the largely third world organization into 
softening its position on south africa 
australia and canada denied this saying south africa will face 
new reprisals unless it has set about the irreversible 
abolition of apartheid by april 
in the delaration the commonwealth said it would call for 
greater financial pressure on south africa that includes asking 
international banks to restrict south african trade credits to a 
maximum of 90 days and make it more difficult for south africa to 
secure loans 
the body also decided to appoint a new body to scrutinize south 
africas trade links 
mrs thatcher objected to these provisions 
britain has refused to implement most of a list of 11 
nonmandatory commonwealth embargoes adopted in 1986 black 
southern african commonwealth members also continue to trade 
because of their economic dependence on south africa

the government said today china will again take 
back illegal immigrants caught crossing into hong kong in a sign of 
easing tension between beijing and the british colony 
chinese authorities have refused to repatriate citizens who 
sneaked into the british colony illegally since early this month 
when hong kong allowed a dissident chinese swimmer flee to the 
united states 
the terse statement said an agreement was reached after 
discussions between the hong kong government and the local branch 
of xinhua news agency the de facto chinese embassy in the 
territory 
about 1100 chinese were awaiting repatriation today a 
government spokeswoman said she did not know how many would be 
returned tuesday 
its quite good as far as were concerned in that were back 
to normality with the chinese a hong kong official said on 
condition of anonymity 
he said he expected the agreement would reduce tension quite a 
bit 
relations between beijing and hong kong which reverts to china 
in 1997 have been delicate in recent months 
many of the colonys 57 million people supported the spring 
prodemocracy movement in beijing china warned the colony not to 
become a base for efforts to topple the communist government 
beijing was angered when hong kong let the dissident swimmer 
yang yang travel to the united states after he overstayed his 
visa instead of repatriating him yang had participated in the 
prodemocracy movement 
the local xinhua office said the colonial government set a bad 
precedent in handling the case 
china then decided to stop accepting the return of illegal 
immigrants and said cooperation would not resume until the british 
and hong kong governments showed their sincerity beijing did not 
elaborate 
the government statement issued today said both sides reaffirmed 
understandings on the return to china of illegal immigrants and 
chinese who overstay their visas in hong kong 
the hong kong government has sent back all illegal immigrants 
from china since 1980 more than 12000 have been sent back to 
china this year

workers have programmed an xrated game into the 
computer system used by new york citys ambulance corps and an 
expert fears it could drag out emergency response times according 
to a report published today 
ambulance dispatchers and other emergency medical service 
workers could be distracted by the sex game or the program could 
spread a virus into the computer system and cause it to break down 
the new york post reported 
the newspaper quoted john petrofsky a senior management 
consultant for the ambulance system who said he was fired last 
week after he notified his superiors about the threat posed by the 
game foreplay 
its a disaster waiting to happen petrofsky said 
petrofsky said he warned top emergency medical service officials 
for eight months while he was demoted and then fired 
officials will search the system today for the sex game to 
see whether we can get a hold of this program lynn schulman a 
spokeswoman for ems said sunday 
the time it takes to dispatch an ambulance to a medical 
emergency would double from three to six minutes if dispatchers had 
to work manually during a computer crash said alexander kuehl a 
former medical director of ems 
its very possible calls will get lost kuehl added

searchers ended their quest sunday for engine 
pieces from a jetliner that crashed in july with no luck in 
finding a part important to investigators 
search teams from metal detector clubs turned up some engine 
fragments over the weekend when they ranged over corn and soybean 
stubble but a flange remained missing 
investigators hope farmers completing their harvest may come 
across the flange which connected the forward fan shaft to the 
disc in the tailmounted dc10 engine made by general electric 
aircraft engines the flange was held together with 20 bolts 
of the parts still missing the flange is the most important to 
investigators said jerry clark flight safety investigator for ge 
which called off the search after two straight weekends of hunting 
theres one square mile yet to be harvested along the primary 
path of fragments weve found he said sunday the location of 
parts in fields helps investigators determine what pieces came in 
contact with others he said 
the no 2 engine flew apart as united flight 232 was flying 
north of alta spewing metal and severing hydraulic lines for 
flight controls pilots wrestled the jumbo jet to the sioux gateway 
airport in sioux city but the plane cartwheeled down a runway in a 
fiery crash that killed 112 of the 296 aboard 
volunteers on sunday found a fragment of a fan blade from the 
no 2 engine and a piece of a track for engine ball bearings clark 
said on saturday searchers north of alta found two blade 
retainers that were part of the engine rotors and a part of the 
hydraulic pump 
along with airplane debris searchers found artifacts from more 
than a century of farming and rural living including a sledge 
hammer and old horseshoes with spikes which provided animals with 
traction while pulling oldtime farm implements 
the search by about 90 volunteers centered sunday on the ed 
anderson farm 
i told them that the area they were searching used to have a 
farmstead on it so im sure theyll find all sorts of things 
said anderson 
another resident konny droegmiller will keep an old brass 
sleigh bell that was found 
ill make it into something to hang on the front door for 
christmas she said 
general electric which called off its search sunday offered 
more than 270000 in rewards for engine parts farmer janice 
sorenson received 119000 earlier this month when she found most 
of the rear engine fan disc as she worked in a field the rest of 
the disc was found on the nearby farm of harold halverson who 
received about 40000 in reward money 
this weekend a 1000 reward was paid for a set of shrouds for 
a fan blade the shrouds help dampen vibration and also serve as 
spacers between fan blades

contracts three including the newspaper guild have rejected

major provisions of the contract offer were wage increases of 4 
percent a year the introduction of a drugtesting policy and the 
elimination of a sympathy strike clause

offer was the establishment of a twotier wage system under 
which some new employees would be paid at a lower scale

was disappointed with the vote and surprised that union members 
authorized a strike vote when the current contract did not expire

christian leader gen michel aoun put his 
forces on alert today after rejecting parliaments peace plan as a 
road to hell because it lacks a specific timetable for a syrian 
troop withdrawal 
in a speech before 5000 cheering supporters and broadcast live 
on his governmentcontrolled radio station aoun indicated he might 
dissolve the lawmaking body 
the accord approved sunday by a special parliamentary session 
held in saudi arabia suffered another jolt when the two main 
militias of lebanons 12 millionstrong shiite moslem sect also 
rejected the arabbrokered plan 
aoun told a latenight news conference sunday that he accepts 
more powersharing with moslems for which the accord provides but 
what the deputies approved in taif is a crime i will not 
accept he said 
i have demanded a syrian withdrawal from lebanon but they came 
up with a peace plan full of ambiguities about this issue which 
constitutes lebanons sovereignty aoun added 
the 54yearold maronite catholic has repeatedly demanded 
withdrawal of the 40000 syrian troops from lebanon and in march 
sparked the latest outbreak in the countrys 14yearold civil war 
by blockading illegal militiarun ports 
moslem militias allied with the syrians responded by shelling 
the christian enclave more than 900 people were killed and at 
least 2000 wounded in savage shelling duels until an arab 
leaguesponsored ceasefire took hold sept 22 
throughout the shelling aoun portrayed his military campaign as 
a crusade to rid lebanon of syrian troops who arrived in 1976 
under an arab league peacekeeping mandate but later sided with the 
moslems 
aoun said a referendum should be held on the accord and offered 
to step down if they support it 
if they support me i shall lead them to achieve lebanons 
sovereignty otherwise i will relinquish authority because i cannot 
commit the crime of approving such a plan aoun told the news 
conference this accord is the road to hell 
the civil war has prevented parliamentary elections which were 
last held in 1972 and it was unclear how a referendum could be 
held 
in his radio address today aoun told the crowd outside his 
shellpocked presidential palace that members of parliament must 
understand that their role is over and that now it is your turn 
yours alone 
you have to come forth to assume the mantle he said what 
happened in taif is a mistake that should be corrected 
that was seen as an indication that aoun who heads a christian 
military cabinet might dissolve parliament to scuttle the peace 
plan 
the demonstrators mostly students responded to aouns speech 
chanting with blood with our souls we defend you general 
aoun had ordered schools and universities in the christian enclave 
to close for the day 
aouns response compounded by the shiite rejection put the 
future of the plan in doubt and raised fears that shelling battles 
would resume 
a senior official at aouns command center who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said today that all leave was canceled for 
aouns 20000 mainly christian troops and they were ordered to stay 
in their barracks 
he called it a defensive measure 
meanwhile aoun discussed the taif accord with intellectuals 
industrialists bankers and militia leaders in the christian 
enclave 
lebanons lawmakers have been meeting in taif since sept 30 
under arab league auspices and removed from the strife of their 
homeland 
on sunday 59 of the 62 deputies present voted for the draft 
plan but made their action contingent on approval by aoun and his 
rival acting prime minister salim hoss two deputies abstained 
one voted no and another was absent because of illness 
hoss who heads a cabinet vying for power with aouns christian 
government welcomed the taif accord in a statement issued today 
and called for its adoption without any reservations 
the only alternative we envisage to the accord is suicide 
hoss said no one has the right to take a decision to commit 
suicide on behalf of the people and the nation 
today the deputies prepared to pack and travel to the red sea 
port city of jiddah for a closing parliament session tuesday to be 
attended by king fahd conference sources said it would be largely 
ceremonial 
the prosyrian mainstream shiite amal militia and the 
proiranian fundamentalist hezbollah or party of god rejected the 
accord because they want a bigger representation corresponding to 
their status as lebanons largest single sect 
under the peace plan the number of seats in parliament would be 
raised from the current 99 to 108 equally divided between moslems 
and christians in the taif talks moslems had called for raising 
the number to 128 but that was later lowered in a compromise 
amal leaders are demanding that the number be raised even higher 
than 128 to give a wider representation to all militias and 
institutions 
in a separate statement hezbollah said any solution from 
taif does not concern us the only system that safeguards 
justice and equality is islam 
hezbollah advocates the creation of an islamic republic in 
lebanon patterned on the fundamentalist revolutionary regime in 
iran 
druse warlord walid jumblatt whose progressive socialist party 
militia fought alongside the syrians said he would accept the 
accord upon syrias request but added he was not happy about 
it 
george saadeh who heads the lebanese national front a 
coalition of various rightwing christian factions in lebanon 
supported the taif accord

clean streets and tradition of progressive government are 
mobilizing to turn back the tide of violence 
many neighborhoods are forming block watch groups and in other 
cases residents are simply taking it on themselves to call the 
police when they see drug deals or other illegal activity said 
alderwoman marlene e johnson who represents an innercity ward 
there have been a lot of busts lately and many of those have 
been due to citzen alerts she said the key is the people in 
the community saying hey this is enough of this 
the number of murders has been climbing since 1985 except for a 
drop last year there were 73 murders in 1985 85 in 1986 95 in 
1987 and 73 in 1988 
that is despite a decline in city population that started at 
least two decades ago the latest population estimate of about 
600000 in january 1988 was down by about 36000 from the 1980 
census total 
as is the case in other cities drugs get much of the blame for 
the increase in killings 
at least 12 of this years homicides have been directly linked 
to drug activity and many of the remainder are believed to have 
involved alcohol or drug intoxication hegerty said 
the violence has included socalled driveby shootings where 
someone fires from a car and then speeds away police blame gang 
activity for three driveby shootings last summer including one 
that killed a 30yearold man standing outside a tavern less than a 
block from his house 
our problem is serious hegerty said but fortunately as 
bad as it is i dont think its as bad as it is in other major 
cities 
karen hendrickson a milwaukee native and president of a block 
watch group in her neighborhood on the citys near north side 
bemoans the change rising crime has brought to her community fear 
she noted is changing the traditional halloween 
when we were kids we went out when it was dark and our 
parents let us have the run of the neighborhood she said we 
would never let that happen today we ought to be alarmed by that 
the roots of the problem go deeper than the current drug 
problem to poverty and racial discrimination that keeps minorities 
unemployed say ms hendrickson and others 
give people a better environment to live in and give them 
something constructive to do then youll see a turnaround says 
the rev lehavre buck director of harambee an organization 
working to improve conditions for innercity residents 
now as usual were in a position of reacting he said 
were trying to shut the gate after the horse has gone

former white house chief of staff donald t 
regan renewing his feud with nancy reagan said today the former 
first lady has no gratitude for anyone 
i think she takes too much pity on herself regan said in an 
interview on nbcs today television program about mrs reagans 
new book my turn 
in the book mrs reagan is critical of a number of her 
husbands associates 
she says james baker at one time white house chief of staff and 
now secretary of state did a fine job at the white house but 
also cultivated the press assiduously perhaps too much because 
he leaked constantly 
although jim did a lot for ronnie i always felt that his main 
interest was jim baker she says 
edwin meese a white house aide before he became attorney 
general was a jumpoffthecliffwiththeflagflying 
conservative she said and one of those who are so rigid in 
their beliefs that theyd rather lose than win a partial victory 
she says meeses personal financial problems made me squirm and 
he should have resigned earlier as attorney general after an 
investigation of them began 
she accuses regan of taking her interest in astrology and 
twisting it to seek his revenge on ronnie and me in the book of 
memoirs that regan wrote after being fired as chief of staff in the 
aftermath of the irancontra affair 
she doesnt seem to realize whats been going on during those 
eight years regan said she has no gratitude to anyone in 
yesterdays los angeles times they had a full spread on this book 
and in it they showed 20 people all of whom nancy reagan 
criticizes 
of mrs reagans charge that he betrayed her confidential 
relationship with astrologer joan quigley regan said of course 
only the two of them were privy to that conversation but 
nevertheless mrs quigley is the one that determined when the 
president of the united states would leave to go on a trip when 
were the best days for a press conference what were the best days 
for him to do certain speeches that in a way is a controlling of 
the schedule and when one controls the schedule of the most 
powerful man on earth one has an awful lot of power 
mrs reagans book makes light of her influence at times but 
leaves no doubt that she expressed herself strongly on many 
personnel and other decisions of reagans administration 
had it been up to me she writes ronald reagan might well 
have been a oneterm president 
the book coauthored with william novak is scheduled for 
publication friday by random house 
mrs reagan says that in 1983 missing her friends and her home 
in california and concerned for her husbands safety after one 
attempt on his life she tried to persuade him not to run again 
reagan was determined to seek reelection so that he could work 
for his policies for another four years and because he believed it 
had been too long since a president had served a full two terms 
she says 
mrs reagan also dicusses her marriage to the future president 
on march 4 1952 saying they experienced a difficult first year 
during that year we had our first child patti who was born 
go ahead and count a bit precipitously but very joyfully on 
october 22 1952 
in an interview published in the sunday editions of the los 
angeles times mrs reagan said of pattis conception 
uh if youre asking if i ever lived with ronnie no i did 
not um but youre also talking about a man in his 40s and a 
woman what in her late 20s were not talking about 
teenagers and we knew we were going to get married 
the former first lady says her husband was never a 
warmonger but his calling the soviet union an evil empire 
was not particularly helpful in establishing a dialogue with the 
other side 
mrs reagan says she believes acceptance of her advice might 
have saved the president trouble in several instances 
she says reagan did not ask her opinion of david stockman the 
white house budget director who expressed his misgivings about the 
reagan administration economic plan in a 1981 magazine article but 
she says she gave it to him anyway 
had it been up to me stockman would have been out on the 
street that afternoon she writes 
she says she and the president also disagreed about secretary of 
labor raymond donovan who resigned after being indicted on fraud 
and larceny charges of which he was later acquitted he had done 
nothing wrong she says but as i told ronnie on any number of 
occasions it would have been better for everyone if hed stepped 
down earlier

a miami police officer went on trial today for the 
shooting of a black motorcyclist whose death touched off three days 
of racial violence in january 
the trial of officer william lozano opened amid tight security 
and pleas for calm lozano is charged with two counts of 
manslaughter in the deaths of the motorcyclist clement anthony 
lloyd 23 and his passenger allan blanchard 24 
lloyd was shot to death during a police chase and blanchard 
died when the machine wrecked 
lozano has said he fired in selfdefense because the speeding 
motorcycle headed straight for him but other witnesses in the 
overtown neighborhood dispute that version calling the shooting 
unwarranted 
defense attorney roy black opened the trial by saying it will be 
impossible to seat an objective jury in miami he asked that the 
trial be moved to another city 
we are going to show that what jurors who sit on this case 
will have on their minds is that if officer lozano is acquitted 
there is going to be a riot he said 
assistant state attorney richard shiffrin said the government 
was convinced that an objective jury can be seated and he opposed 
defense efforts to introduce television tape newspaper articles 
and witnesses to tell the story of the january riot 
to replay everything that has transpired since january would 
be unnecessary and in addition tends to inflame the community 
the prosecutor said 
circuit judge joseph farina said he would consider starting jury 
selection immediately and then sequestering the panel during 
subsequent pretrial motions so they will not be affected by 
publicity before testimony starts 
outside the metrodade justice building lozanos friends and 
family members waved colombian flags and placards of support as 
they marched up and down a sidewalk 
a smaller group denounced the colombianborn officer one man 
who loudly proclaimed lozano a coldblooded murderer was taken 
into custody when he tried to enter the courtroom 
police killings of blacks or the subsequent trials have 
triggered violence in miami four times in the 1980s and crisis 
teams were in place today around the racially tense city the fear 
of renewed violence was a key to the defenses effort to move the 
trial from miami 
the jan 16 slaying touched off burning and looting in 
predominantly black neighborhoods one person was killed 11 were 
wounded by gunfire and 13 structures burned down only days before 
the miami area was host to the super bowl 
tensions especially between blacks and hispanics remained high 
after the violence at one point an attorney for the hispanic 
officers association wrote a letter to police chief perry anderson 
asking that its members be pulled from black neighborhoods because 
of residents anger the chief who is black denied the request 
blanchards family has filed a 10 million federal lawsuit 
against the city accusing the police department of displaying a 
pattern of violence especially toward blacks 
many hispanics have taken up lozanos cause collecting money 
for him during radio pledge drives 
the metrodade police force which patrols part of the largely 
black liberty city area hit by riots in january has given its 
officers riot classes and new gas masks and has two armored trucks 
on standby 
even while urging calm black leaders including willie sims of 
dades official community relations board acknowledge that blacks 
are intently watching the trial the board has been training teams 
that will head into any neighborhood where violence begins 
i wont sit here and tell you that nothing absolutely zero 
will happen sims said but we are optimistic that whatever 
does occur we will be able to reduce the level drastically 
the board has proposed an interracial pop concert on nov 10 and 
a unity summit to help keep the peace

several hundred east german workers at an 
electronics plant outside east berlin have formed the communist 
nations first independent labor union a spokesman said today 
roelf boerger said the unions platform includes a demand for 
the right to strike and he urged all 6000 employees of the 
wilhelm pieck factory in teltow to join the new labor movement he 
said the unions name is reform 
boergers statement was distributed to western news media in 
west berlin 
despite a more candid approach to news reporting in recent days 
the staterun adn news agency made no immediate mention of the 
electronics workers declaration 
boerger said the union declares solidarity with new opposition 
political groups in east germany and calls for a thorough 
restructuring of the communist states economy 
the new leaderships attitude toward the reform trade group was 
not immediately made clear the factory where it was founded is 
named after east germanys first president 
on sunday the head of the statecontrolled trade federation 
called for more independence for labor organizations 
since egon krenz took over the nations leadership from erich 
honecker on wednesday the official news media have been filled 
with unusually frank articles about the nations troubles 
but neither krenz nor other senior communists have indicated any 
willingness to share power with opposition groups or allow an 
independent trade movement like polands solidarity to take root 
the communist party newspaper neues deutschland today devoted 
four pages to reform discussions that it said were going on all 
across the nation 
the newspaper also gave prominent play to a lively public 
exchange between top communist officials in east berlin and 
prodemocracy activists on a downtown east berlin street on 
saturday 
neues deutschland devoted nearly a full page to discussions held 
in leipzig on sunday concerning east germanys economic and social 
problems 
for the first time the newspaper quoted a member of the 
outlawed neues forum new forum opposition group as saying the 
group does not consider itself a real opposition party because 
we want to improve socialism 
but democratic reforms are necessary the newspaper quoted 
neues forum member petra lux as saying 
east germanys liberal democratic party which like others in 
the country is allied with the communist party has urged the 
government to recognize neues forum which was banned as 
antisocial by authorities last month

smuggling operation he was convicted following a 7month trial

morning traffic was heavy and stormy 
weather played havoc with the elaborate transit plans of 3 million 
commuters many of whom abandoned their cars to board buses trains 
or ferries on the first major workday since an earthquake ravaged 
the city 
normally crowded freeways and the bay bridge which links san 
francisco and oakland remain closed because of damage commutes 
that usually take 45 minutes were forecast at two hours 
california highway patrol spokesman don gappa reported fewer 
accidents than normal and no major problems 
the volume of traffic is worse than normal gappa said if 
we didnt have rain we probably wouldnt have as many problems as 
we do there are more problems with flooding and trees down than 
traffic accidents 
traffic on the golden gate bridge was bumpertobumper but 
moving shortly after 5 am pdt and many people appeared to be 
carpooling highway 101 was a sea of lights some parking lots at 
subway stations were full and one ferry that normally sails with 
140 people carried 572 on an early trip 
gale warnings were posted early today rain was heavy in some 
areas and one ferry was turned back because of rough waters on the 
san francisco bay authorities said 
on the 6 am ferry from oakland to san francisco a 30minute 
crossing took 55 minutes through heavy seas with swells 
occasionally washing over the top of the boat 
ive just been through hell but heck i have to admit i made 
it through it said passenger john trowbridge 27 of alameda 
who normally would drive across the bay bridge it can only get 
better this cant get much wors 
everybodys just going to have to go into slowmotion that 
includes all the bosses said karen meyer 42 of oakland 
the effort to avoid gridlock reached a feverish pitch 
sunday when rod diridon chairman of the metropolitan 
transportation commission declared riding alone in a vehicle an 
antisocial act 
weve got to convince people that its not business as usual 
and that it wont be business as usual in some places for years 
diridon said 
a fleet of ferries was called into service to make more than 225 
trips shuttling an estimated 10000 stranded residents from the 
east side of the bay to san francisco 
but at best conceded joel markowitz mtcs manager of transit 
coordination postquake planning might avoid a total disaster 
on the roads 
were optimistic but i think that realistically a lot of 
people are still going to try to squeeze on the roads he said 
experts predicted that twothirds of commuters in the 
ninecounty bay area would experience delays as they tried to get 
to and from work 
the collapse of a portion of the bay bridge which typically 
carries 65000 people during rush hour every weekday created the 
biggest headache and snarls were expected on other major arteries 
as commuters tried alternate routes 
in oakland the ruin of interstate 880 cut off a major 
thoroughfare that used to carry 170000 vehicles daily repairs are 
expected to take years 
the embarcadero freeway along the waterfront in san francisco 
which connects downtown with the north beach district and 
fishermans wharf has been deemed unusable until at least 
mid1990 a fivemile stretch of interstate 280 in san francisco 
was closed from us highway 101 to sixth street 
in santa cruz state highway 17 was closed to through traffic 
because of landslides and mudslides that fourlane road provides a 
critical link for 20000 people who commute daily to work in 
silicon valley it will be closed indefinitely although one lane 
is open to buses and emergency vehicles 
the bay area rapid transit district which runs trains through a 
tube under the san francisco bay beefed up service and planned to 
start running trains around the clock beginning at midnight 
bart telephone information lines were jammed sunday with delays 
of several minutes common once callers got through the busy signals 
callers to a carpool service that matched riders with drivers 
also had to be patient as workers fielded a steady stream of calls 
theres two of us here and its kept us busy said kathleen 
mckinney of solano rideshare a statefunded carpool operation 
mtcs markowitz said many large corporations had expressed 
interest in offering flextime schedules to help dilute the 
commute but no one dared predict how many workers would work 
offhours 
markowitz who expressed hope the crisis would force longterm 
changes in the way people get around in the bay area had only one 
wish 
i think were going to see a lot of people who havent tried 
transit try it he said i just hope theyll be tolerant 
patient and have a good sense of humor

officials said today 
the republicans running candidates for the first time in many 
cities of badenwuerttemburg often garnered more than 10 percent 
of the vote in sundays balloting according to preliminary figures 
the results are expected to put further pressure on chancellor 
helmut kohls conservative christian democratic union cdu which 
lost more than 5 percent of the vote in the largest cities 
the republicans wont improve anything they will just make 
politics more difficult said stuttgarts cdu mayor manfred 
rommel after the republicans picked up its first five of the 60 
city council seats or 96 percent of the vote 
the cdu lost four of its 24 seats in stuttgart the state 
capital falling from 388 percent to 331 percent of the vote

a campaign account as a democratic candidate he has sought public 
office unsuccessfully on two prior occasions 
i would be an inspirational leader for the people said

i got fired by people who didnt read or understand the 
dynamics of the evidence as it was presented hastings said of 
his removal from us district court i believe myself to be a 
man of honor and integrity i have not committed any crime at any

a killer whale has been swimming 
alongside a norwegian ferry for the past week in what the captain 
said monday looked like a case of whale courtship 
its hard to say who fell in love with whom said olav 
mundal captain of the ferry bf voksa passengers and crew are as 
taken with the black and white whale as the whale is with the black 
and white ship 
mundal said by radio telephone the whale seldom leaves the 
ferrys side as it sails a 12mile route through a fjord near 
aalesund 
the 13foot whale hugs the ships hull sometimes gently bumps 
against it and often sprays passengers with water school classes 
have been buying tickets on the ferry to see it 
people are very interested sometimes when we dock there is a 
crowd of people waiting on the wharf for it he said 
the courtship doesnt endanger the whale or the ship he said 
mundal said the whale has not disappeared for more than a few 
hours at a time it may have adopted the ship after straying from a 
killer whale flock seen in the area three weeks ago he said

hungarians today for the first time 
officially marked their antistalinist revolt that soviet tanks 
crushed in 1956 with more than 100000 people cheering for closer 
ties with the united states 
over national television acting president matyas szueroes 
proclaimed hungary a republic in a symbolic rejection of communist 
dominance and church bells pealed across the country 
as of today our nations name is the republic of 
hungary said szueroes after parliament last week voted to 
change the name from peoples republic communists had renamed 
the country after assuming power in 1948 
hoots and whistles greeted szueroes call for cooperation with 
the soviet union but the crowd estimated at more than 100000 
cheered and clapped when he urged warmer ties with the united 
states 
we continue to view the uninterrupted development of our ties 
to the soviet union as in our nations interests szueroes said 
at the same time we also seek to improve contacts with the 
other superpower the united states of america 
a reference to planned democratic elections next year also drew 
prolonged applause 
the republic of hungary has become a state governed by law 
where the values of western democracy and democratic 
socialism are equally valid szueroes said 
many people sported lapel pins showing the red white and green 
hungarian flag with a jagged hole in the middle symbolizing the 
communist emblem cut out during the revolt others displayed 
buttons with the precommunist coat of arms that was resurrected 
briefly in 1956 
it was one of the largest gatherings since oct 23 1956 when 
an estimated 200000 people marched on parliament to press 
democratic demands 
szueroes proclamation was a highlight of numerous officially 
organized events and of rallies staged by the political opposition 
to mark the anniversary it was the latest step in hungarys rapid 
transition from 41 years of communist rule toward a multiparty 
democracy 
in czechoslovakia the slovak communist party newspaper pravda 
today condemned the hungarian parliaments reform as a political 
coup detat turning hungary into a bourgeoisdemocratic 
republic 
more than 1000 people packed the st stephen basilica in 
downtown budapest and crowded outside the doors earlier today to 
hear a mass and sing hymns for the thousands who fell during the 
revolt which began oct 23 
mothers paraded young girls whose hair was festooned with 
ribbons in the red white and green national colors and thousands 
of flags flapped in the warm breeze throughout the capital police 
presence was lowkey with the usual sidearms and truncheons 
conspicuously absent from the belts of officers 
one year ago thousands of police moved in to block 
demonstrations of the the anniversary the 1956 revolt in which as 
many as 32000 people died is now considered a popular uprising 
after being condemned as a counterrevolution abetted from 
overseas by dark imperialist forces 
on that day 33 years ago mass student demonstrations calling 
for greater democracy a multiparty system and the withdrawal of 
soviet troops quickly escalated into armed clashes with hungarian 
and soviet troops the revolt ended 12 days later after soviet 
tanks rumbled into the hungarian capital and crushed all resistance 
in the last three historic weeks the communist party was 
dismantled and transformed into a socialist party professing 
democratic ideals and parliament rewrote the constitution to 
embrace multiparty democracy ahead of free elections next year 
premier miklos nemeth in a televised address sunday evening 
said the parliamentary session marked the closing of an era in 
our history 
he also said hungarians today would be commemorating the 
sacrifices of 33 years ago he said the anniversary was a 
reminder that we can never try to erase the past 
szueroes today provisionally assumes the powers of the newly 
expanded president until a head of state can be elected either 
later this year or after next years parliamentary elections 
the new socialist party is espousing democratic ideals though 
it will continue in power until the parliamentary elections it has 
promised to hold by june the party issued a statement friday 
rejecting the soviet intervention that crushed the revolt and 
opposing all external intervention or restrictions of sovereignty 
on june 16 tens of thousands of hungarians attended the funeral 
of imre nagy the leader of the 1956 revolt after the government 
rehabilitated him he was formally reburied in the same plot where 
his body was dumped in an unmarked grave after his execution for 
high treason in 1958 
last week parliament also summarily exonerated all those tried 
for roles in the uprising as well as all those who suffered 
reprisals between 1948 and 1962 the period now officially termed 
hungarys stalinist period

shipyard who elected him head of their local solidarity chapter 
that he would mind their interests despite his many other duties a 
newspaper reported monday

union chapter at the shipyard where he helped found the independent 
solidarity movement nine years ago and unexpectedly decided to run 
for the office saturday according to the prosolidarity newspaper 
gazeta wyborcza 
the electrician defeated alojzy szablewski a veteran shipyard 
worker and longtime fellow union activist by a vote of 8737 
i dont want honors i dont want to be artificial i want to 
rule walesa told the workers explaining why he did not want to 
become only the honorary chairman according to gazeta wyborcza 
the solidarity leader is still an employee of the shipyard but 
he has been delegated for union work since solidarity became legal 
again on april 17

organization after the 1980 strikes that led to legalization of the 
east blocs first independent trade union he was chosen solidarity 
leader at a national congress in gdansk in 1981

of the union chapter in the shipyard and his role as national union

his deputies in the shipyard and promised to visit the workers once 
a month 
after martial law was declared on dec 13 1981 to crush the 
union walesa guided the movement through nearly eight years of 
underground activity and participated in the two strikes at the 
shipyard in 1988 that prompted authorities to start a dialogue with 
the opposition 
two months of talks this spring resulted allowing the 
reinstatement of the union and democratic elections in june that 
brought victory to the solidarityled opposition and paved the way 
for a noncommunist government 
some disgruntled solidarity members say walesa has too much 
power and want a national congress to be convened as soon as 
possible 
piotr konopka walesas spokesman said sunday the congress is 
likely to be held in the spring after solidarity chapters have 
chosen their delegates

president hashemi rafsanjani today offered 
to help gain freedom for 18 western hostages in lebanon if 
washington releases frozen iranian assets or helps resolve the 
cases of three kidnapped iranians 
he appeared to refer to iranians kidnapped by the lebanese 
forces militia in north lebanon in 1982 along with their lebanese 
driver a shiite moslem all four are believed dead 
speaking to a news conference attended by mostly foreign 
reporters rafsanjani also ruled out any participation by us 
corporations in irans postwar reconstruction 
i dont think american companies can play any role in iran 
he said 
sitting behind a small table in the highceilinged hall of the 
presidential office in downtown tehran rafsanjani spoke in a soft 
voice smiling frequently as he played with a string of worry 
beads his remarks were translated by an interpreter 
if the conditions are right we might be able to do something 
about the abducted westerners he said 
it was not the first time iran has linked its help in releasing 
western hostages to the unfreezing of the assets or the release of 
the iranians kidnapped seven years ago 
the hostages who include eight americans are believed to be 
held by proiranian groups rafsanjani said hostagetaking is an 
inhuman action that can produce no positive political results 
in washington white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
said our position has not changed we do not link the iranian 
assets to the hostages and we do not make deals for hostages 
as for irans influence over the hostages fitzwater said we 
have always said we believe that they have an influence on the 
hostages that they have considerable knowledge but we cant gauge 
how specific that is 
he said the united states has provided iran with all the 
information it has on iranians kidnapped in lebanon 
responding to a question from an american reporter rafsanjani 
said he had proposed two methods that the united states could 
use to facilitate release of the hostages adding 
the first is that as a sign of goodwill you release our 
assets this is something that you will have to do and sooner or 
later you will be forced to do it so do it now 
secondly if you do not want to give us our money at least 
you can get your agents your lackeys in lebanon to release our 
hostages if you say they are not alive at least you can give us 
back their bodies or show us their graves 
the assets estimated at more than 1 billion have been frozen 
since students seized the us embassy in tehran in 1979 fiftytwo 
americans were held hostage there for 444 days 
the iranians kidnapped in lebanon in 1982 are ahmad 
motevaselian commander of the contingent of iranian revolutionary 
guards based in the bekaa valley of east lebanon iranian charge 
daffaires hussein musavi and kazem akhavan a correspondent for 
irna along with rastegar moqadam their driver 
all were kidnapped at a lebanese forces checkpoint 25 miles 
north of beirut 
lebanese forces commander samir geagea said in august 1988 that 
after he took over the militia in 1986 he found no trace of the 
missing men and blamed his predecessor elie hobeika for their 
disappearance and apparent murder 
geageas disclosure was the first formal comment by the lebanese 
forces that it had been involved in the seizure of the missing 
iranians all four men are believed dead 
eighteen westerners are held in lebanon eight americans four 
britons two west germans two swiss an irishman and an italian 
the longest held is american journalist terry a anderson chief 
middle east correspondent for the associated press who was 
kidnapped march 16 1985

nato defense ministers grappling with 
fastpaced changes in the soviet bloc probably will call for a 
fresh look at how much nuclear firepower should be kept in western 
arsenals officials say 
us defense secretary dick cheney will join defense chiefs of 
the north atlantic treaty organization for two days of nuclear 
strategy talks beginning tuesday on the southern coast of portugal 
there are no major decisions required at this meeting said 
a senior nato official the nuclear affairs of the alliance are 
running along very smoothly at this time 
another official said it will be a good occasion to take 
stock of nuclear matters a third added its going to be a 
rather uneventful meeting but thats not necessarily a bad 
thing all spoke on condition of anonymity 
the meeting should be free of the tensions marking previous 
sessions of the nuclear planning group when us and british 
officials clashed mostly with west germans over development of a 
new theater nuclear missile 
president bush and other leaders of the 16nation alliance 
resolved the dispute at their 40th anniversary summit in may 
with that on the backburner the defense ministers can discuss 
the dramatic events shaping eastwest relations and how they 
should react 
nato secretarygeneral manfred woerner was expected to call 
attention to the very positive changes in the soviet bloc 
countries said the senior nato official 
another official suggested the ministers urge the soviet union 
to do more in reducing its nuclear stockpile soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev has promised to pull out 500 shortrange 
nuclear weapons from europe this year 
according to western estimates the soviet union has 1450 
shortrange nuclear missile launchers in europe nato has 88 lance 
launchers most based in west germany 
the ministers also were expected to discuss fresh contacts with 
east bloc officials cheney met recently with soviet defense 
minister dmitri yazov 
but it appeared the key outcome would be asking top aides to 
make a thorough study of the alliances nuclear role in an era of 
reduced tensions 
an official said the ministers would likely want an 
examination of the implications of an agreement on conventional 
forces in europe for alliance nuclear forces 
nato negotiators are bargaining with the sovietled warsaw pact 
in vienna to reach a quick agreement on sweeping reductions in 
conventional or nonnuclear weapons in europe 
the positive nature of those talks gives us some hope that 
we can look forward to a reduction in conventional forces and 
subsequent to that a reduction in nuclear forces said the 
official the deeper the conventional cuts he said the greater 
the impact on natos nuclear strategy 
i certainly wouldnt rule out that at some point in the future 
we decide certain elements of our nuclear posture are not 
necessary he said but i think were going to have to see 
some major changes on the other side before thats true 
he also said the allies see no time in which we will not need 
some nuclear weapons 
the united states also was expected to bring its allies up to 
date on bargaining with the soviet union on reducing longrange 
nuclear forces 
bush and other nato leaders in may worked out a compromise on 
negotiating with moscow cuts in conventional and nuclear arms in 
europe the formula links reductions in conventional forces to the 
start of talks on trimming shortrange nuclear missiles in europe 
west germany had demanded immediate negotiations with the warsaw 
pact on slashing theater nuclear missiles but us and british 
officials said attention should be focused first on cutting the 
easts enormous superiority in conventional arms 
they also agreed the question of deploying a new more powerful 
generation of surfacetosurface nuclear missiles would be dealt 
with in 1992 the united states had wanted a strong endorsement of 
its development program to replace aging lance missiles the work 
is designed to more than triple the missiles range to just under 
the limits of the 1987 intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty 
defense ministers meet twice a year to discuss nuclear matters 
france which is outside natos integrated military structure does 
not attend iceland which has no armed forces has observer status

malawis shortest and cheapest route to 
the sea the nacala railway line through mozambique has reopened 
for the first time after five years of rebel sabotage 
the government has urged malawis merchants to reroute external 
trade through the indian ocean port of nacala which is only 500 
miles from this landlocked country a distance three times 
shorter than the current route through durban south africa 
tobacco tea and sugar are the main exports likely to be 
transported on the nacala line 
tobacco alone earned 60 percent of this impoverished nations 
export income last year 
no goods have yet traveled on the line which reopened last 
week but armorplated locomotives have made test runs since late 
may according to a diplomatic source in the malawi capital of 
lilongwe 
since 1984 malawis traditional rail routes to the indian ocean 
ports of nacala and beira have been closed because of repeated 
attacks by mozambique national resistance guerrillas fighting 
against the leftist frelimo government in maputo the capital of 
neighboring mozambique 
malawi depended on links through south africa to carry more than 
90 percent of its trade as well as a new northern route through 
tanzania that carries the remaining traffic 
until now malawi paid one of the costliest transport bills in 
the world amounting to more than 100 million last year according 
to finance minister louis chimango 
the new northern route through tanzania is being rehabilitated 
for 160 million 
freight will be transported in stages by road to lake malawi 
container vessel across the water by road again to the tanzanian 
border and then by the tazara railway to the port of dar es salaam 
once the nacala line is at full steam it would be able to carry 
more than threequarters of malawis trade and cut its transport 
bill by twothirds said a spokesman for malawi railways 
since 1983 the ninenation southern african development 
coordination conference largely has been responsible for restoring 
malawis lifeline to the sea 
the regional bloc which includes angola botswana lesotho 
mozambique swaziland tanzania zambia and zimbabwe has pledged 
to loosen south africas traditional stranglehold on their 
economies 
the line is guarded by some 1000 malawian soldiers a fifth of 
the national army and an undisclosed number of frelimo troops 
britain west germany and the united states are contributing 
only small amounts to the development of the line but their 
governments are providing uniforms trucks and communications 
equipment to malawian troops

with both the plo and israel rejecting us 
proposals for dialogue efforts to arrange palestinianisraeli 
negotiations appear to have reached a low point 
among the reasons for the stalemate is the fierce opposition of 
hardliners on both sides and the lack of strong leadership that 
can overcome the resistance 
we are not in an era of great leadership said avraham sela 
a political science professor at hebrew university in jerusalem 
the problem is that both sides are in a quandary because of 
internal politics 
daoud kuttab a palestinian journalist said there is no 
farsightedness in israel not enough statesmanship in the united 
states and general apathy in the arab world 
in israel prime minister yitzhak shamir 74 has portrayed 
egyptian and us efforts to bring about talks with palestinians as 
disguised attempts at forcing israel to negotiate with the 
palestine liberation organization 
digging in his heels shamir said in a speech last week that 
this is our land from the dawn of history and it will be so 
always we will not be pushed nor pressured 
however defense minister yitzhak rabin of the leftleaning 
labor party today opened fresh debate about the latest american 
proposals by saying israel was considering them despite shamirs 
objections 
the us proposals have not been rejected or accepted nobody 
has been authorized to accept or reject them rabin told 500 high 
school students in the tel aviv suburb of kfar sabah adding that 
washingtons latest ideas should be put to a cabinet vote 
while shamir has eased his rhetoric following criticism by the 
us state department his ability to compromise is limited because 
hawks in his own rightwing likud bloc led by exdefense minister 
ariel sharon have put conditions on his peace proposals 
the hawks oppose trading land for peace curtailing the building 
of jewish settlements in the occupied west bank and gaza strip or 
even starting talks until the 22month palestinian uprising has 
been put down 
part of the reason for a lack of progress however also lies in 
shamir himself he lacks the strength of likud founder and 
expremier menachem begin who armwrestled skeptical colleagues 
into making peace with egypt in 1979 
shamir is also viewed by some analysts as an inflexible 
ideologue who did not support the peace treaty with egypt and who 
does not want to risk getting into any process now that would lead 
to yielding land or allowing exiled palestinians to return 
shamir sees clearly the eventual result and doesnt want to 
get into it it is not a matter of discussions and proposals 
said sela the political scientist 
the rival labor party advocates negotiations without further 
delay but its leader finance minister shimon peres has lacked 
the muscle in his party to force the issue although there are 
hints he may take action if shamir returns emptyhanded from a trip 
to washington next month 
the internal palestinian debate is almost as intense as that in 
israel the only united stand came in baghdad iraq recently where 
plo leaders rejected us secretary of state james a baker iiis 
compromise proposals as an attempt to circumvent the plo 
plo chairman yasser arafat has spent most of his time battling 
hardliners within his movement rather than assuaging israeli 
doubts about his sincerity in pledging to renounce terror and 
accepting the jewish state 
palestinian islamic fundamentalists have rejected any idea of a 
peace agreement and george habash a leading plo leftist has 
threatened to assassinate hosni mubarak if the egyptian president 
continues to promote a palestinianisreli meeting in cairo 
the confusing rhetoric from the palestinian side has failed to 
persuade the israeli in the street of arafats sincerity in seeking 
peace or his ability to live up to an agreement 
hence there is little pressure on shamir to make concessions or 
rein in his own hardliners 
arab countries with the exception of egypt have been silent or 
negative about the peace efforts this has reinforced israeli 
doubts about arab intentions and has led to bitterness on the part 
of palestinians 
saeb erakat a leading palestinian activist and political 
scientest at an najah university in the west bank says arab 
countries have failed to provide adequate political or financial 
backing to the palestinians he says arab states fear a successful 
uprising against israel could prompt challenges to their own 
regimes 
the arab masses might imitate and revolt against their 
regimes thats why the arab world does not support the uprising 
he said 
the united states also has been the target of criticism from 
palestinians and israelis for not taking a more active role 
in an editorial the laboraffiliated davar newspaper said the 
proposal to hold palestinianisraeli talks in cairo about shamirs 
plan for elections in the occupied territories was headed for 
failure 
the responsibility for that is mainly with the americans 
the newspaper said predicting a slow slide into violence unless 
the bush administration stakes its prestige on forcing agreement

a former official on a defunct 
segregationist panel says it investigated the backgrounds of jurors 
who were selected for a 1964 trial of a man accused of killing 
civil rights leader medgar evers 
erle johnston jr the former executive director of the 
mississippi sovereignty commission which spied on civil rights 
groups in the 1960s says that while the review of potential 
jurors backgrounds in the first of two trials was unethical 
it wasnt jury tampering 
johnston also said in a newspaper interview monday there was 
nothing in the commissions stillsecret records that could be used 
if the case were reopened against byron de la beckwith the man 
charged with the murder 
beckwith was tried twice in 1964 by allwhite juries for the 
june 12 1963 slaying of evers field secretary of the mississippi 
chapter of the national association for the advancement of colored 
people evers was gunned down outside his jackson home 
both trials ended in deadlocked juries 
prosecutors contended that beckwiths fingerprint was on the 
sight of a gun found in bushes near the slaying witnesses placed 
beckwiths car near the scene that night 
a federal judge will decide whether to take action regarding the 
findings of an fbi investigation into possible illegal leaks of 
materials from mississippi sovereignty commission records 
the fbi said there was a request by us district judge william 
barbour jr to look into a report that some information may have 
been released 
the segregationist panel was created in 1956 and infiltrated 
civil rights groups until its demise in 1973 when thengov bill 
waller vetoed its funding 
the 1977 legislature ordered the commissions files sealed until 
2027 
barbour ruled this summer that the panels principal records 
held in a vault at the state department of archives and history in 
jackson should be made public 
however the records remain sealed pending an appeal in the 5th 
us circuit court of appeals by the rev ed king of jackson and 
john salter jr of grand fork nd who are both are mentioned in 
the files 
johnstons comments to the the clarionledger monday came during 
an interview about a book he is writing that details the 
commissions activities

atlantis astronauts 
swooped out of orbit to a safe early landing in the mojave desert 
today after a fiveday mission that sent the galileo spacecraft 
streaking across the solar system toward jupiter 
commander donald williams and pilot mike mcculley guided the 
97ton winged spaceship to a stop on a hard clay lakebed runway at 
933 am pdt concluding a flight that covered 17 million miles 
they landed into a light headwind of about 8 mph 
congratulations on an outstanding mission ken cameron a 
spacecraft communicator at mission control in houston told the 
shuttle crew youve extended the shuttles reach to the outer 
planets 
its nice to be home williams replied 
the space travelers remained in the cabin about 45 minutes 
shutting down systems then made the traditional walkaround 
inspection of their spaceship except for some minor scratches on 
heat protection tiles the craft looked to be in good shape 
they rode a van to a nearby building where they showered and 
underwent brief medical examinations they were to fly back to 
their training base in houston later in the day 
the five astronauts started their descent from orbit an hour 
before touchdown when williams fired atlantis braking rockets 180 
miles above the indian ocean that slowed the ships 17400 mph 
speed by 219 mph and started it on a fiery hourlong dive through 
the atmosphere 
two sonic booms crackled over the california desert as atlantis 
glided powerless through the clear sky making wide circles to 
reduce speed as it descended 
mission control decided sunday to shorten the shuttles trip by 
two 90minute orbits because the calmest winds at edwards air force 
base were predicted early in the day 
weather officials said the winds at the time of touchdown were 
well within safety limits for a shuttle landing 
controllers radioed weather information to the astronauts up to 
moment of engine ignition and told them the best wind conditions 
were on lakebed runway 23 one of six available at edwards 
if the winds had been too strong the landing could have been 
postponed until tuesday or wednesday 
as the five astronauts were ending their journey the galileo 
probe they dispatched on wednesday was more than 1 million miles 
from earth on a sixyear voyage to explore the mysteries of giant 
jupiter 
the astronauts adjusted their schedule for the early landing by 
going to bed 2 hours early sunday night and 90 minutes early the 
previous night 
they were awakened early today to strains of fly like an 
eagle by the steve miller band 
good morning atlantis mission control radioed to the craft 
well im not sure were flying like eagles but its been fun 
so far williams replied 
on sunday williams who flew a 1985 shuttle mission described 
what todays reentry would be like 
reentry heating is rather spectacular if you see it in the 
darkness it looks like youre inside a fire looking out 
williams said during a television interview from space he 
described the fireball created by the friction created when the 
shuttle plunges through the atmosphere 
summing up the mission flight director bob castle termed it 
very successful we had only minor problems with the orbiter the 
science return was very good and galileo was released on time 
the main goal of the fiveday mission was to deploy the 
nuclearpowered galileo and that was accomplished about 6 hours 
after blastoff wednesday from cape canaveral fla 
the 15 billion probe continued to operate flawlessly as it 
raced across the solar system on a 24billionmile roundabout 
journey to jupiter traveling at nearly 9000 mph the probe had 
logged more than 1 million miles early today 
we all certainly breathed a sigh of relief when it went 
according to plan and we kept hearing all the good news from the 
ground that the spacecraft had done all the things that it had to 
do to get on its way astronaut franklin changdiaz said sunday 
during an interview with cable news network 
also aboard atlantis were shannon lucid and ellen baker 
if all goes according to plan galileo will take six years to 
reach jupiter where its expected to give the best look yet at 
another planet and provide clues to the origin of the universe 
before it gets there galileo will swoop past venus once and earth 
twice to gain momentum from the planets gravity for the long 
voyage 
the astronauts also conducted several scientific experiments 
including one that measured the earths protective ozone layer 
two other shuttle experiments involved processing materials and 
growing corn plants the astronauts also photographed lightning 
systems for a weather project and grew ice crystals for a student 
experiment 
time also was spent photographing various parts of the world 
with the imax movie camera the footage will be used for a 
documentary film about earth 
on sunday williams and mcculley successfully tested atlantis 
flight control systems and fired one of its steering thrusters to 
prepare for the trip home

condemned by most capitalist countries for 
crushing prodemocracy protests china has turned to the socialist 
world for support and comfort so have its nowsilenced protesters 
since the june army attack on studentled protesters caused 
japan and the west to halt highlevel exchanges chinese diplomats 
have busied themselves with meetings with east bloc and third world 
envoys 
chinese vice premier yao yilin visited east berlin in october 
and exchanged condolences with theneast german president erich 
honecker over their mutual problems from imperialist class 
opponents 
a succession of soviet and east european scientific educational 
or communist party delegations have visited beijing many 
expressing agreement with chinas position that reforms are 
intended to strengthen socialism not topple it 
but back in the visiting delegations home capitals changes are 
occurring that can be of little comfort to the chinese government 
but warm the hearts of the dissidents the widening of perestroika 
in the soviet union the rejection of communism in hungary and 
poland and the mass exodus of east germans have reinforced some 
dissidents belief that they not the conservatives will 
eventually prevail 
we are watching what happens very closely said a woman 
intellectual who supported chinas democracy movment 
theres a tide sweeping the socialist countries and china 
cant shut itself off from it it cant become isolated again even 
if it tries she said 
several former student protesters said the east europeans 
demand for reform reinforced their beliefs that radical change is 
necessary if china is to catch up with the developed world 
it shows that socialism has failed everywhere not just in 
china and not just because of chinas size and historic 
backwardness said one 
chinas tv news has ignored the east german marches dissidents 
believe because of the similarities to chinas mass protests for 
democracy in the spring 
in both countries angry populations expressed impatience with 
aging outoftouch leaders both east german and chinese youth 
used visits from soviet president mikhail s gorbachev to call for 
reforms modeled on gorbachevs perestroika 
the xinhua news agency which provides all foreign dispatches 
has carried only a few brief official east german reports on the 
marches 
its other reports from the east bloc have created the impression 
that oldfashioned hardline marxism predominates in the socialist 
world 
xinhua has quoted east german attacks on the western media a 
bulgarian condemnation of western human rights groups and 
czechoslovakian communist leader milos jakes pledge to never 
concede to antisocialist forces 
in the soviet union the capitalist road wont do read a 
headline in mondays peoples daily quoting conservative politburo 
member yegor ligachev 
other headlines on the same page read soviet unions pravda 
warns western countries dont plot to rock the socialist boat 
and yugoslav peoples army opposes multiparty rule 
chinese say they follow developments by reading between the 
lines of xinhua reports and listening to voice of america and bbc 
radio reports 
a western diplomat said that in internal debates some chinese 
theorists have dusted off the word revisionist to denounce the 
reforms in the soviet union poland and hungary revisionist 
was the late chairman mao tsetungs word for the soviet union 
which he accused of being too conciliatory toward the west 
there are some arguing that china should come out in the open 
and draw attention to the split in the international communist 
movement and that the ones who are faithful should draw 
together the diplomat said speaking on condition of anonymity 
he listed north korea bulgaria and cuba among the hardline 
faithful 
but he predicted that chinas current official stance that 
each socialist country must follow its own road will prevail for 
practical reasons snubbed by the west china cannot afford to snub 
its remaining friends

the legendary rothschild banking 
family on monday ended an 88year absence from germany by opening a 
new office in frankfurt the famed jewish familys historic 
hometown 
the rothschild family that had lived in this main river city 
since the middle ages closed its last german firm in 1901 when 
financial activity had migrated elsewhere and family interests in 
paris and london eclipsed those in their traditional home 
the new frankfurt office located at friedrich street 48 will 
deal primarily in corporate financing rather than consumer banking 
rothschild offices in paris and london joined forces to open the 
new office in frankfurt said jan von trott spokesman for 
frankfurt mayor volker hauff 
trott said the city views the opening of frankfurts new 
rothschild operation as a positive signal in connection with 
european economic community plans for free trade in the community 
by 1992 
it is a joining together of tradition and the future trott 
said the rothschilds have a magical meaning for frankfurt as the 
original bankers here 
hauff joined barons elie and david rothschild of paris and 
amschel rothschild of london in opening ceremonies for the new 
office in frankfurts west end district 
the office will initially be staffed by three people under the 
supervision of erich stromeyer a former managing director of 
shearson lehmen hutton ag in frankfurt 
plans call for the offices activities to include business 
mergers and acquisitions in addition to regular portfolio 
management banking sources say 
mayer amschel rothschild the son of a jewish moneychanger in 
the frankfurt ghetto started the family financial empire in the 
18th century 
the rothschild family later expanded its banking business to 
other major cities including london vienna naples and paris 
berlin eventually became germanys banking center and in 1901 
when baron wilhelm carl von rothschild died leaving no male heirs 
the family closed its operations in frankfurt 
for a rothschild family member the return to frankfurt is a 
meaningful event baron david rothschild associated manager of 
rothschild amp cie in paris told reporters at a press conference 
the frankfurt office is owned by nm rothschild amp sons ltd in 
london rothschild bank ag of zurich and the parisbased 
rothschild amp cie 
the rothschild family gained prominence by financing such 
projects as the construction of european railroads and the british 
military campaign that led to the final defeat of napoleon at 
waterloo in 1815 
the familys original home on the banks of the main river was 
destroyed by allied bombers in world war ii 
in november 1988 west germanys only museum devoted exclusively 
to jewish life and culture opened in the restored rothschild 
palace exhibits range from jewish traditions in the city to 
documentation of the horrors of the holocaust that claimed the 
lives of 6 million european jews

mayor mardi wormhoudt had planned a 
party this fall in the heart of her city but nows not the time 
for revelry rubble and ruin surround her 
the downtown of this coastal community is littered with cavedin 
buildings shattered windows and piles of brick stark tesimony to 
15 seconds of natures fury 
one week ago the earthquake struck santa cruz but if the shock 
is over the painful reality is just settling in for the mayor 
its really hard and gets harder each time i see it she 
said her eyes brimming with tears as she surveyed the ravaged 
pacific garden mall the downtown business district 
this week people are really taking care of each other she 
said next week were not the medias favorite their 15second 
sound bite everyone will go away and well settle in the long 
haul putting it back together 
rebuilding is a far cry from what this community of 50000 had 
planned for this fall in a few weeks santa cruz was supposed to 
be celebrating the 20th anniversary of the mall several blocks of 
shops and offices in renovated wood and stucco buildings 
this was a dying downtown this was a downtown that had lost 
its vitality the mayor said people had creativity and 
vsion rebuilding and renovatng adding greenery and 
pedestrianonly areas benches and outdoor cafes 
instead of celebrating the city is mourning the three people 
who died here a week ago and trying to assess the damage thirty 
percent of the stores may be lost in this business district part 
of which is cordoned off with yellow police tape 
thats just part of the devastation total quake damage in santa 
cruz has been estimated at 160 million about twothirds of it 
private property 
still the mayor serving a rotating oneyear term from city 
council is confident the city can rebound and the business core 
can be rebuilt but she said timing is critical 
its going to take massive infusion of assistance from every 
level of government to get the city back on its feet again she 
said if that help isnt immediate its not going to do any 
good these are people that cant stay shut six to 12 months its 
got to be now 
the mayor conveyed that message to president bush and health and 
human services secretary louis sullivan who made separate trips to 
santa cruz in recent days 
business leaders are already talking about setting up temporary 
headquarters for merchants theres a lot more cooperative spirit 
then there was on monday the day before the quake said louie 
rittenhouse president of the downtown association of santa cruz 
everybody has put their other problems behind them 
but anxiety remains especially among some small merchants near 
the mall we were a flea on the hide of the elephant lillian 
smith kaiser said to explain her used bookstores relationship to 
the mall now the elephants gone will people come back what 
will they come back to 
the mall along with the wharf beach and boardwalk are among 
the many attractions in a community that evokes images of the 60s 
its not uncommon to see ponytailed men in tiedyed shirts or a 
rainbowpainted volkswagen bus cruising the streets 
were a timewarped kind of town said resident russell kane 
its also a university community with the university of 
california at santa cruz and politically active 
theres a protest going on all the time here said joyce 
ulrich whatever your cause is its ok 
and the mall was not only the business core but a social 
congregating spot 
its heartbreaking said laura martin some of us will be 
forced into a totally new lifestyle 
it certainly will never be the same all those wonderful 
little stores said smith kaiser the old lady wont be 
recognizable anymore shell get a new dress 
but thats not necessarily bad said rittenhouse who lost four 
buildings in the quake 
the mall he said is going to come back bigger and 
better the majority of them merchants are pretty tough people 
theyre already saying tell us when we can come in to pick up the 
pieces so we can start over again

leggy fashions with a lightasair appeal took over 
in summer readytowear shows monday by fashion heavyweights karl 
lagerfeld at chanel and gianfranco ferre at dior 
luxury fabrics and curvy silhouettes are ruling the runways as 
strong silhouettes are bowing to the feminine appeal of bows and 
softness 
lagerfeld turned the chanel woman into a young girl with a raft 
of flared shorts tiny skirts beautiful fitted long or short 
jackets and some asymmetrical draping to vary the menu 
it was all a shadow game of black and white pepped up by 
pastels and some hotcolor prints as lagerfeld played with a 
girlish silhouette outlining typically chanel jackets in black 
passementerie piping 
he led off with a transparentopaque contrast in asymmetrically 
draped chiffon skirts under piped white jackets later varying the 
idea with transparent duster jackets over vnecked tunics and 
microminis 
this coy idea of pairing seethroughs with solids is a solid hit 
in most paris collections and most beautifully done at chanel 
some of the jacket ideas rich women will want to wear or copy 
include tulip or decollete shapes done up with seed pearl patch 
pockets and piping or sexier versions in black satin with 
jetbead trim and chains at the waist 
the youth kick here means that the newest chanel bag is worn as 
a chic bikers pouch on a belt the regular chain belt has become a 
bold hip chain with huge links 
the older chanel client shouldnt panic theres lots of choice 
especially in the ivory and white suits that dont have to be worn 
open to show the bosom 
lagerfeld also offered soft semitransparent blouses with 
floppy bows or deepdraped decolletes and dozens of lovely long 
pajamas 
gianfranco ferres first readytowear collection for dior also 
was a symphony in grays black and white beginning with 
tinychecked suits and flared shortie coats 
he too showed shorts but topped them with billowy chiffon 
babydoll jackets raincoats and artists smock tops 
the ferre signature big bow here became so outsized in organza 
and taffeta that it made the strong silhouette of the outfits 
the gift blouses were offshoulder organza with big puffed 
sleeves or a fitted lace version with black linen shorts or long 
pants 
the youth kick here became black workout suits with black 
leather jackets or with ruffled wraparound stoles and skirts for 
evening 
color finally came out at dior in shades of periwinkle blue with 
polka dots plus some fitted linen or silk tulip jackets in tomato 
bright yellow and violet often over black pants 
for informal beachwear ferre offered bikinis and onepiece 
ivory or offwhite maillot swimsuits topped with terrycloth 
like angelo tarlazzi he also used some hemstitched 
handkerchiefdraped outfits right out of the linen closet 
designer hanae mori celebrated her 35 years in the industry with 
fashions that look younger than ever last week she became a knight 
of the legion of honor for her years as a member of the chambre 
syndicale the powerful fashion association 
her sportier clothes were excellent in some soft day wear with 
short skirts wide shorts long and flared skirts in striped 
chiffons with a deauville regatta appeal 
her gray and white cloud prints and graphic kabuki faces on 
billowy kimono tops nevertheless didnt hide the female form it 
came out in fitted bustier trouser suits and fitted suits with 
skirts above the knee younger than moris usual styles 
she too went overboard for bows she put her signature butterfly 
bow on piped colorful or navy linen suits then the bow turned 
giant on layers of chiffon in two colors for an iridescent evening 
effect

lt gov l douglas wilder is striving to 
be the nations first elected black governor but has avoided 
emphasizing his race in a campaign without even a drive to register 
black voters 
the 58yearold democrat who grew up in the segregated south has 
conducted a campaign designed to appeal to the moderate urban 
voters who helped put him in the states no 2 office in 1985 when 
he got 44 percent of the white vote 
but he showed a rare moment of anger on a matter close to the 
hearts of black voters last week when his republican opponent j 
marshall coleman invoked the name of slain civil rights leader 
martin luther king jr in a televised debate 
wilder told coleman a 47yearold former state attorney 
general that the late gov john dalton cast a veto that you 
encouraged of a bill to create a holiday honoring king wilder 
pushed for years for a king state holiday 
on monday at a rally at the university of virginia in 
charlottesville wilder criticized a coleman proposal to limit 
outofstate admissions to 10 percent at statesupported 
universities and colleges 
this universitys richness and diversity are a result of 
people coming from all over the world wilder told about 250 
students at the rally 
for the most part wilders political success has been built on 
a mixture of playing by the rules of the mostly white power 
structure while challenging the establishment on occasion 
wilder played little part in the civil rights movement that 
divided his home state in the 1950s and 60s he has stayed away 
from national black leaders such as jesse jackson winner of 
virginias 1988 presidential primary 
wilder did not endorse jackson and jackson has not been invited 
to campaign here this year on his behalf im running a virginia 
campaign wilder said a comment directed at president bushs two 
campaign trips to the state to support coleman 
when he first ran for the state senate in 1969 wilder was 
chiefly known only as a criminal trial lawyer in richmond but he 
became a symbol to richmond blacks defeating two white candidates 
and taking the oath as the first black member of the chamber since 
reconstruction 
about 17 percent of the states 27 million voters are black 
wilder allied himself with a group of younger democrats who were 
about to overthrow the oldline conservative leaders in the senate 
eventually he rose to chairman of four committees including the 
powerful rules panel which makes committee assignments 
he became identified with the king holiday bill which 
eventually became law and an unsuccessful effort to change the 
state song carry me back to old virginia because of racially 
offensive lyrics 
sometimes wilder turned against his allies in 1982 he 
singlehandedly scuttled the us senate candidacy of owen b 
pickett who was thengov charles s robbs choice for the 
nomination 
pickett offended wilder by praising the two men who held the 
seat for a halfcentury harry f byrd sr and harry f byrd jr 
whose legacy included resistance to school integration 
robb released a series of letters in 1986 in which the former 
governor now a us senator accused wilder of being ungrateful 
and unreliable he took the action after wilders top aides said 
robb was getting too much credit for wilders 1985 victory 
weve had differences and weve had serious differences 
robb said but notwithstanding that im still in dougs corner 
still robb has criticized both campaigns this year for focusing 
too much on abortion 
coleman who has used the robbwilder feuds as fuel in his 
campaign said the abortion criticism was directed at wilder who 
has run television ads that point out colemans antiabortion views 
a wilder aide disagreed with robb saying voters consider the 
issue important 
but wilder scarcely mentioned abortion in the debate last week 
coleman won the endorsement sunday of the richmond 
timesdispatch a week after wilder got the nod from the washington 
post

eight african national 
congress leaders including seven freed from prison this month 
held a strategy meeting monday unhindered by police even though 
their movement remains outlawed 
a statement issued after the meeting said the men would consult 
with exiled officials of the anc and would address policy issues 
sunday at a mass rally at a soccer stadium near johannesburg 
the meeting marked a reunion for the seven recently released men 
and a colleague govan mbeki who was freed from prison in 1987 
mbeki 79 has been barred from traveling and attending 
political gatherings since his release but the government sunday 
lifted the restrictions for one week he flew to johannesburg on 
monday from his hometown of port elizabeth 
the other seven were released unconditionally and have spoken 
out freely on behalf of their guerrilla movement they have 
endorsed the ancs use of violence as part of its campaign to end 
whiteminority domination and have demanded a series of concessions 
from the government as a precondition for negotiations 
the eight men met with other antiapartheid leaders for more 
than three hours behind closed doors at a community center in 
soweto they engaged in an indepth exploration of the way 
forward according to a statement issued by a coalition of 
activists 
mbeki and five of those freed this month received life sentences 
in 1964 along with paramount anc leader nelson mandela after 
being convicted of treason for planning antigovernment sabotage 
mandela remains imprisoned although the government is considering 
his release 
his freed codefendants include walter sisulu 77 andrew 
mlangeni 63 raymond mhlaba 68 ahmed kathrada 60 and elias 
motsaoledi 65 
also released oct 15 and present at mondays meeting were 
wilton mkwayi 66 convicted of sabotage in a separate 1964 trial 
and oscar mpetha 80 who began a fiveyear sentence for terrorism 
in 1985 
the unconditional release of the anc leaders and the 
governments decision to allow sundays rally have been depicted by 
south african newspapers as a de facto legalization of the movement 
government officials have made clear in recent days they no 
longer expect the anc to make a formal repudiation of violence as a 
precondition for joining negotiations president fw de klerk said 
monday that groups such as the anc group could join the political 
process by committing themselves to the concept of peaceful 
solutions 
if perspective participants in the negotiation process insist 
on victories before entering negotiations success will evade us 
he told a party congress what is necessary is a change of 
heart 
he said the anc if it distanced itself from violence could 
help achieve its demand for lifting of the state of emergency 
de klerk has offered to negotiate a new constitution that will 
extend political rights to the disenfranchised black majority he 
envisions a system which stops short of oneperson onevote and 
provides whites with some type of veto power over major policy 
decisions

the us postal service has decided to start 
selling picture postal cards for the first time entering a 
business private firms have found lucrative for decades 
the government agency will issue only a few cards however it 
says it doesnt plan on jumping into the market to compete 
nationwide for sales of the cards that are tourist favorites 
bearing beautiful photos of local attractions in cities across the 
land to make the folks back home envious 
but visitors to washington and others interested in washington 
landmarks will be able to purchase two official government picture 
postal cards featuring the white house and the jefferson memorial 
the white house card will go on sale nov 30 and the jefferson 
memorial card dec 2 both being issued in washington the cards 
will sell for 50 cents apiece which includes 15cents postage 
the government has sold plain postal cards for years of course 
and recently many have carried colorful commemorative designs in 
the corner the new cards merely expand that to photos filling one 
side of the card 
privately made cards will remain on sale of course 
buyers will still have a wide choice of post cards featuring 
many different photos of the white house and jefferson memorial 
the difference will be that the two postal cards sold by the 
government include the 15cent postage already printed on the 
card while a stamp has to be added to privately produced cards

workers raced ahead of a storm monday to 
lower a 100ton section of the san franciscooakland bay bridge to 
a barge but then suffered a frustrating delay when choppy seas 
kept the barge from moving to shore 
a portion of the troubled bridge over troubled water collapsed 
like a trap door in tuesdays earthquake closing it to the 260000 
vehicles that cross it each day 
engineers could not get a closeup look at the damaged sections 
monday morning because the rain and high wind that wracked the bay 
area forced the barge to cling to a bay bridge tower for safety 
said jim larson of the california department of transportation 
officials hope to reuse the steel portions of the road section 
this is a very key element in this whole transportation system 
in the bay area said department spokesman bob halligan it is 
incumbent to get it open in a minimum time 
repair time for the doubledecked bridge remains about four 
weeks but transportation department officials admitted monday that 
the target was largely a motivational tool 
if we put a goal of three months it would be three months 
halligan said 
the department set a nov 16 goal for the reopening but the 
work may take longer perhaps six weeks he said it is expected to 
cost 1 million 
there has been considerable skepticism about the departments 
repair prediction with some officials of other agencies estimating 
the work would take several months 
without the bridge thousands of commuters are forced onto other 
jampacked bridges or to use public transportation 
transportation department officials also expressed satisfaction 
at the decision to remove a 100ton slab from the bridge in the 
dark early monday just a few hours before a storm struck the bay 
area the wind and rain would have prevented the dangerous and 
delicate work later halligan said 
a portion of the upper level 50 feet long and five lanes 
across had been sawed in half to make it easier to remove the 
first half was lowered 200 feet to the barge on sunday afternoon 
and then a crane had to be moved to the other side of the bridge 
and set up again for the second half 
for 53 years the 85milelong bridge has been the main link 
between oakland and san francisco tuesdays 69magnitude 
earthquake dislodged a portion of the upper deck and sent it 
slamming onto the lower portion 
the lower section is considered destroyed and will have to be 
removed and replaced officials have said 
nationally broadcast pictures of the broken bridge provided the 
first graphic illustration of the magnitude of tuesdays quake 
the bridge also had been a symbol for the 1989 world series 
between the san francisco giants and the oakland athletics but its 
closure contributed to sundays decision to delay resumption of the 
sevengame baseball championship until friday

a decision by lithuania to make it harder 
for poles to visit the soviet baltic republic was denounced in 
polands press monday as discriminatory and political 
schizophrenia 
the restrictions could further strain relations between the east 
bloc neighbors whose histories are closely connected and who are in 
the forefront of change in the communist world 
some poles have voiced concern about the treatment of the ethnic 
polish minority in lithuania while lithuania holds bitter memories 
of historic polish dominance including a 1920 invasion in which 
poland seized lithuanias capital of vilnius and held it until 1939 
the current dispute while economic in origin underscores how 
the decline of strict communist party control in eastern europe is 
allowing repressed nationalist tensions to emerge 
under the restrictions announced by the lithuanian council of 
ministers on friday poles and other east bloc residents are 
allowed only one visit to lithuania a year visitors are barred 
from mailing parcels to poland currency must be changed to rubles 
when entering lithuania and regular train service between vilnius 
and warsaw is down to once a day 
the prosolidarity newspaper gazeta wyborcza ran a dispatch on 
the restrictions under the headline stop tourist 
the communist youth newspaper sztandar mlodych asked monday that 
polands foreign ministry take quick diplomatic action 
erecting at our borders more and more obstructive barriers 
represents a kind of political schizophrenia it said 
the resolution simultaneously causes surprise and alarm 
it said this is another in a long list of decisions of various 
socialist countries limiting for economic pseudoreasons the 
freedom of travel between the countries of eastern europe 
the newspaper said the decision clearly was directed at poland 
the rules about parcels and train service mention poland 
specifically it noted and the number of visitors from all other 
east bloc countries together is less than half the number that come 
from poland annually 
polish foreign ministry spokesman stefan staniszewski and 
consular department officials declined to comment monday 
lithuania said it was taking the action to prevent goods on its 
domestic market from being bought out by visitors throughout the 
soviet union many goods ranging from tea to school composition 
books to meat are running short because of the countrys economic 
difficulties 
many poles active as blackmarket traders are expert at finding 
goods in neighboring countries that can be bought cheaply and sold 
at home or elsewhere in the east bloc 
aside from traders however the restrictions will strike hard 
at poles who visit friends and relatives on the soviet side of the 
border 
about 8 percent of lithuanias 35 million population or about 
280000 people are ethnic poles concentrated along the border 
in vilnius and in salcininkai in southern lithuania last month 
the district of salcininkai where poles are dominant even 
declared it wanted to be treated as an autonomous polish region 
poland and lithuania were allied from the 14th century on 
through the jagiellonian dynasty and then formed a joint 
commonwealth from 1569 until 1795 when lithuania and most of poland 
succumbed to russian rule 
over the centuries the gentry in lithuanian became 
polishspeaking while the peasantry spoke lithuanian the countrys 
native baltic language but in the late 19th century a lithuanian 
nationalist movement emerged aimed at fighting polish cultural and 
russian political domination 
for most of the period between the world wars the newly 
independent polish and lithuanian states were at war or in a tense 
truce because of conflicting territorial claims 
but in september 1939 both lithuania and eastern poland were 
occupied by the soviet union poland regained statehood within the 
soviet orbit after world war ii but lithuania remained a soviet 
republic after having been incorporated into the soviet union in 
1940 
in the past year the solidarity movement in poland and the 
sajudis movement in lithuania have expressed support for one 
another in their parallel efforts to increase independence from 
moscow 
the border restrictions are clear proof that politicians 
linked to solidarity were wrong to support sajudis rather than 
the propolish union of poles in lithuania sztandar mlodych said

a flotilla of ferries and extra trains 
helped keep rainsoaked traffic moving today but only at a 
bumpertobumper pace rescuers halted the search for survivors at 
an earthquakeflattened freeway when the rubble became too unstable 
and hospital officials said today survivor buck helm had 
improved and they were considering upgrading his condition from 
critical to very serious doctors said he was no longer in pain 
and they were hopeful the longshoreman pulled from the freeway 
rubble would not have permanent kidney problems 
in the next 24 to 48 hours if he continues the way he is now 
he will be out of the woods dr floyd huen said 
the death toll rose to 61 today with the recovery of two more 
bodies in san francisco the coronors office said a female body 
was found in the remains of a marina district fire and a 
68yearold woman died of injuries suffered from the quake near 
downtown dozens remained missing and thousands were injured and 
homeless 
at the interstate 880 disaster in oakland where 38 bodies have 
been recovered officials said today crews began dismantling a 
100yard section of the doubledeck freeway that was near collapse 
it is a dangerous operation said kyle nelson a spokesman 
for the california department of transportation 
congress began putting together a 3 billionplus package of 
federal disaster but put off until later how to come up with the 
money to pay for it 
there is an urgent need for help for people now sen pete 
wilson rcalif told the senate environment and public works 
subcommittee on transporation and resources 
gale warnings were posted early today rain was heavy in some 
areas and one ferry was turned back because of rough waters on the 
san francisco bay authorities said the union ferry building the 
terminus of all ferries when they reach san francisco was closed 
for an hour because of high waves and the boats were diverted to a 
pier about a mile away 
but most made it to work without major problem despite 
predictions of commuter gridlock on the first full workday since 
the earthquke closed crucial freeways and broke a section of the 
vital bay bridge linking san francisco and oakland 
considering everything my commute has really gone smooth 
said maggie faulkner of oakland who rode a ferry across the choppy 
bay to san francisco 
highway 101 was a sea of lights starting shortly after 5 am 
pdt and the golden gate bridge was bumpertobumper but moving bay 
area rapid transit which runs trains underneath the bay had 
carried 70000 passengers by 830 am more than double the normal 
load 
damage estimates from tuesdays earthquake topped 7 billion 
eclipsing hurricane hugo as the costliest natural disaster in us 
history according to the independent insurance agents of america 
on sunday 150 residents of a housing project just 10 feet from 
collapsed i880 joined thousands of homeless because of fears that 
more of the highway could fall 
the unstable ruins forced authorities to halt rescue work late 
sunday 
we know there are more victims more cars but we dont know 
how many said california highway patrol capt mike garver 
speaking about i880 
there was no estimate of when work could resume 
its kind of minute by minute said nelson 
the first phase of the bay bridge repair started when workers 
sawed a 50foot collapsed section in half and lowered both halves 
200 feet by crane sunday to a barge on windwhipped san francisco 
bay 
without the bay bridge 65000 rushhour motorists were forced 
to seek other ways to work daily 260000 cars use the bridge the 
most crucial of the regions earthquakedisrupted roadways repairs 
will take at least four weeks 
you just cant squeeze all the traffic onto other bridges 
there just isnt enough room said joel markowitz a traffic 
planner with the metropolitan transportation commission were 
going to have a crisis until people adapt a little 
traffic planners took extraordinary precautions to avoid 
rushhour paralysis on the first full workday since the earthquake 
commuters were urged to take public transportation buddy up in 
carpools and come in earlier or later than normal fourteen ferries 
were added to ease the bridge crisis and extra police and tow 
trucks were placedin choke zones in case something goes wrong 
about 3 million people commute on a typical workday in the 
ninecounty region authorities warned that 2 million of them could 
be disrupted in a nightmarish obstacle course 
mtc chairman rod diridon said any motorist driving alone would 
be doing an antisocial act 
extra subway trains and ferries can accommodate an additional 
45000 riders other bridges must handle the rest of the traffic 
that normally crosses the 85milelong bay bridge 
other freeways also are devastated a 1mile section of i880 
is flattened and the embarcadero freeway and the i280 extension 
are closed farther south landslideclogged highway 17 is open 
only to buses and emergency vehicles 
the hospital where helm was taken was deluged with flowers 
telegrams and phone calls for a survivor who had been given up for 
dead 
helm 57 regained some functions in his kidneys which were 
damaged by dehydration during his 89hour ordeal he was also 
breathing better but he was still having trouble moving his leg 
and was being fed by a tube in intensive care said officials at 
oaklands highland general hospital 
highway engineer steven whipple the hero who found helm said 
he was checking the ruins for stability when he spotted the back of 
helms head and a slight movement in his flashlights beam 
it stopped my heart said whipple 29 who works for the 
state transportation department 
in six subsequent sweeps of the section sniffing dogs and 
sensitive listening devices failed to detect any more survivors 
rescuers were clearly buoyed at finding someone alive after four 
grisly days of removing bodies and crushed cars from the crumpled 
concrete they placed giant airbags hydraulic jacks and wooden 
timbers under concrete slabs and trucked in dirt to firm the 
foundation they also installed seismic monitors on the structure 
meanwhile the us army corps of engineers on sunday reported 
major cracks in three dams within five miles of the epicenter in 
the santa cruz mountains but said they posed no public threat at 
this time because water is low behind them 
a halfdozen tent cities have sprouted in watsonville a city of 
30000 about 80 miles south of san francisco many residents were 
so frightened by the quake and its aftershocks that they refuse to 
go indoors even if their homes have been declared safe 
the red cross even opened a fullblown shelter of olivegreen 
military tents complete with medical and feeding facilities in 
the battered community 
resumption of the world series the first ever between the two 
bay area teams was pushed back until friday it had been hoped 
play would resume three days earlier 
football was played sunday but not in san francisco the 49ers 
beat the new england patriots 3720 in a game moved from 
candlestick park to stanford university and a collection was taken 
among the 75000 fans for earthquake victims a moment of silence 
honored the dead 
throughout the region sunday was a time for mourning the dead 
and giving thanks for survival 
we pray to be spared from further suffering archbishop john 
quinn told 700 worshipers at st marys cathedral in san francisco 
i pray for the relief of suffering and anxiety i cannot forget 
to pray for the dead and the bereaved 
in oakland parishioners of the st francis de sales cathedral 
held services in a baptist church because their tower had been 
cracked and leaned precariously

rightist extremists won six 
stuttgart city council seats and garnered more than 10 percent of 
the vote in several other municipal elections in the southern state 
of badenwuerttemberg officials said monday 
the successes in sundays balloting at the cost of chancellor 
helmut kohls conservative christian democratic union were the 
latest in a series of strong showings by the party led by former 
nazi waffen ss soldier franz schoenhuber 
schoenhuber said the republicans will make an allout effort to 
win seats in the federal parliament in bonn in national elections 
in december 1990 
i am convinced that the party will be represented with at 
least 10 percent of the vote schoenhuber said in munich 
however several public opinion polls have indicated the 
republicans may not reach the 5 percent hurdle needed to gain any 
parliamentary seats in bonn 
the republicans have run on a platform of lawandorder want to 
slash the number of foreign workers to combat unemployment running 
at about 9 percent and have blamed established parties for a 
growing housing shortage 
leftist protesters demonstrated sunday night in stuttgart and 
stormed city hall in karlsruhe where the republicans won 69 
percent of the vote to gain about four out of the 60 city council 
seats no arrests or injuries were reported 
the republicans already have 11 of the 138 seats in the west 
berlin legislature as well as seats in city councils in major 
cities such as duesseldorf cologne and dortmund and in parts of 
hesse state 
under west germanys complicated election laws the republicans 
in west berlin will send two nonvoting members to the parliament 
in bonn after the 1990 elections based on the results in the 
western part of the divided city 
their 71 percent of the vote in june gave the republicans six 
seats in the european parliament and made them eligible for federal 
campaign funds from bonn 
an angry mayor manfred rommel of stuttgart vowed that he and his 
christian democrats will have nothing to do with the republicans in 
city hall 
the republicans wont improve anything they will just make 
politics more difficult rommel said after the polls had closed 
officials initially had said that the republicans 96 percent 
of the vote would give the party five of the 60 city council seats 
but late monday said the number would be six under a complicated 
apportioning system 
the christian democrats share of the vote stuttgart fell from 
388 percent to 331 percent although rommel will remain head of 
the local government 
republican candidates did even better in other key cities in 
west germanys richest state including 106 percent in heilbronn 
119 percent in pforzheim and 142 percent in heidenheim the party 
even picked up a seat on the city council in the traditional 
leftist stronghold of freiburg 
it was the first time the republicans had won seats in 
badenwuerttemberg the party founded in 1983 was virtually 
unrepresented in the states last municipal elections held the 
following year 
the results are expected to put further pressure on chancellor 
kohls party which lost more than five percentage points of its 
share of the vote in stuttgart and the states other largest cities 
kohls party has been buffeted by ultraconservatives calling 
for a tougher stance to win back voters from the republicans while 
the left has accused the christian democratic union of already 
making too many concessions to the far right

dealers are continuing to sell allterrain 
vehicles for use by children despite an agreement between the 
government and manufacturers to curtail such sales a consumer 
group charged monday 
the us public interest research group a private organization 
affiliated with consumer advocate ralph nader said 54 percent of 
dealers surveyed told volunteers who called on the telephone that 
an adultsized vehicle would be appropriate for use by children 
under age 16 
in addition 75 percent of the dealers responding said it would 
not be difficult for a 10yearold to learn to ride an adultsized 
atv the consumer advocacy organization said 
too many atv dealers would rather make a buck than tell a 
customer that atvs are death traps for children under 16 said 
pamela gilbert consumer program director for the organization 
ms gilbert said volunteers called 215 dealerships in 
california connecticut florida illinois maryland new jersey 
new mexico vermont and washington 
the volunteers represented themselves as potential customers 
saying they were interested in buying an atv for a child of 10 
according to the survey salespeople at otho williams buick 
honda in forestville md and sun cycles yamaha in wheaton md 
told the callers that some atvs would be safe for a child of that 
age 
dan donahue general sales manager for otho williams said he 
knew of no such incident and added that it is the dealerships 
policy not to make such sales i have personally chased people 
away who wanted to buy one for somebody under age he said it 
is our policy here not sell to anyone under age 
donahue added however the one that i know for sure that i 
turned away went to another dealer and bought one 
mac seavey sales manager for sun cycles said i have 
instructed our sales personnel to adhere to these guidelines we 
have had some turnover in sales personnel i dont know who they 
spoke with on the phone but we stick to it to the letter 
in january 1988 five atv manufacturers honda kawasaki 
suzuki yamaha and polaris agreed to ban sales of threewheel 
atvs in the united states the atv makers also agreed to restrict 
the sales of certain fourwheelers for use by children over 16 and 
adults 
the agreement resulted from a suit by the consumer product 
safety commission 
when the consent decree was signed many people thought the 
atv problem had been solved said ms gilbert now we know that 
atv dealers are still misleading the public about the vehicles 
dangers 
fiftyfour percent of the dealers said they would sell large 
fourwheel atvs for use by a 10yearold in violation of the 
agreement the public interest research group said 
manufacturers are responsible for making dealers aware of the 
provisions of the agreement a spokesman for the consumer product 
safety commission said 
atvs are motorized machines that can traverse rough offroad 
terrain they range in engine size from 50 to 500 cubic centimeters 
under the agreement only atvs smaller than 90cc are permitted 
for sale for children 12 to 16 years old 
in 1988 about 40 percent of the atvrelated deaths and injuries 
reported to the consumer product safety commission involved 
children under 16 
the commission has received 1346 atv death reports for 1982 
through june 21 1989 thirtysix deaths involving the vehicles 
were reported this year with 20 involving the fourwheel machines

president bush intends to meet with nicaraguan 
opposition candidate violetta chamorro during a summit in costa 
rica but does not plan to have talks with nicaraguan president 
daniel ortega who also will be there the white house said monday 
bush will fly to san jose costa rica on friday at the 
invitation of president oscar arias to take part in a meeting 
marking 100 years of democracy in that central american country 
leaders of about 18 countries are expected to participate in the 
summit the talks which conclude before noon saturday are to be 
held at a resort complex about five miles from san jose 
ortega will attend as president of nicaragua while ms chamorro 
will be there as part of an observer delegation she is the 
presidential candidate of the national opposition union in 
elections scheduled for feb 25 
following a policy he inherited from ronald reagan bush is 
trying to drive oretaga from office arguing that he leads a 
marxist government 
on saturday bush signed a 9 million aid package intended to 
help the opposition defeat the ruling sandinista government 
while no meeting with ortega is planned white house press 
secretary marlin fitzwater noted that that the nicaraguan leader 
will be in the same room with bush during two plenary sessions and 
again during dinner 
fitzwater said the summit may be a very unique opportunity for 
us and the other countries of the hemisphere to impress on 
nicaragua the importance of democracy and the folly of their ways 
however fitzwater said bushs role will be somewhat limited 
because he will not have any remarks or speeches related to the 
summit 
bush is expected to make departure remarks at nearby andrews air 
force base before dawn friday as he heads for costa rica 
after the close of the summit bush is supposed to speak to 
employees at the us embassy in costa rica fitzwater said the 
president probably will meet outside the summit with some of the 
leaders 
because the theme of the summit is democracy the leaders of 
cuba panama haiti and chile were not invited fitzwater said the 
united states did not dictate or comment on the guest list

the house voted monday to tighten restrictions 
on weapons sales to countries that support terrorism approving 
legislation that was spawned by the reagan administrations 
armsforhostages deal with iran 
the bill expected to be approved later by the senate would 
strengthen the current ban on arms sales to countries officially 
designated as repeatedly supporting international terrorist acts 
that list now includes iran libya syria cuba north korea and 
south yemen both government and private sales are affected 
the measure was approved by a voice vote 
it also would put tighter controls on the presidents ability to 
waive the prohibitions requiring that the ban be lifted only if 
national security requires it and then only after congress is 
notified 
current law controlling arms sales abroad is sloppy and 
confusing said rep howard berman dcalif who sponsored the 
bill in an effort to eliminate the loopholes that allowed the us 
sale of missiles to iran in 1986 
the measure imposes new penalties on violators and requires more 
detailed reporting of arms exports including authority for 
transfers of us weapons from the initial purchaser to a third 
country 
it is similar to legislation passed last year by the house but 
which died in the senate berman said the measure has been endorsed 
by the white house this time around and is now more likely to 
receive senate approval

leaders of upper crust palm beach say 
the limited clothing stores would attract the wrong element and 
should remain limited to shopping malls and other less ritzy venues 
but a landlord who wants to rent to the chain on exclusive worth 
avenue an east coast equivalent of beverly hills rodeo drive 
is crying snobbery and will seek to overturn the ban in palm beach 
circuit court beginning this week 
the town councils rejection was arbitrary and capricious 
according to j michael burman attorney for landlord burton 
handelsman 
several residents earned applause for speaking against the 
limited at a council meeting in march 1988 
ive been in their other shops and its nothing you cant buy 
in a mall resident elise mackintosh complained at a council 
meeting in march 1988 its not very dignified 
elizabeth summers complained that the shops sell very 
inexpensive clothes they are always on sale 
she said when another chain store moved to worth avenue 
merchants were all extremely upset with the type of merchandise 
that they were carrying plus the type of people they would 
attract 
mackintosh and other residents were not swayed by the assurances 
of a spokesman for the limited who told them jacqueline onassis 
meryl streep and mrs william f buckley to name a few have 
shopped in our madison avenue store in new york city 
according to town ordinances drafted in 1980 large retail 
stores must prove the majority of their customers do not come from 
offisland locations said john devault a jacksonville lawyer 
representing the town 
handelsmans attorney countered that the landlord is not subject 
to the standard because the site was in use as a restaurant before 
the ordinance was enacted and is grandfathered in handelsman 
bought the site for 32 million in july 1983 
the landlords attorney also said the town fails to define 
methods on how to prove the customer base for a proposed store

president hashemi rafsanjani on monday 
offered help in getting western hostages freed in lebanon if the 
united states releases billions of dollars in frozen iranian assets 
or helps settle the cases of three kidnapped iranians 
rafsanjani said hostagetaking is an inhuman action hat can 
produce no positive political results eighteen westerners 
including eight americans are believed to be held by proiranian 
groups in lebanon 
while rafsanjani said his government was maintaining indirect 
contacts with washington his offer and demands were not new 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said rafsanjanis 
comments did not change the us position 
we do not link the iranian assets to the hostages and we do 
not make deals for hostages he said 
rafsanjani spoke at a threehour news conference attended by 
about 50 foreign media representatives issued visas specifically 
for the event sitting behind a small table in the highceilinged 
hall of the presidential office in downtown tehran rafsanjani 
spoke in a soft voice smiling frequently as he played with a 
string of worry beads 
responding to a question from a us reporter rafsanjani said 
he had proposed two methods that the united states could use to 
facilitate release of the hostages 
the first is that as a sign of goodwill you release our 
assets this is something that you will have to do and sooner or 
later you will be forced to do it so do it now 
secondly if you do not want to give us our money at least 
you can get your agents your lackeys in lebanon to release our 
hostages if you say they are not alive at least you can give us 
back their bodies or show us their graves 
the assets estimated at at between 9 billion and 12 billion 
have been frozen since the us embassy was seized by students in 
tehran in november 1979 nine months after the islamic revolution 
seized power overthrowing the prowestern monarchy 
christian lebanese forces militiamen kidnapped the three 
iranians in north lebanon in july 1982 the missing are ahmad 
motevaselian commander of the contingent of iranian revolutionary 
guards based in the bekaa valley of east lebanon iranian charge 
daffaires hussein musavi and kazem akhavan a correspondent for 
the islamic republic news agency 
their lebanese shiite driver rastegar moqadam who also held an 
iranian passport was grabbed with them at at a lebanese forces 
checkpoint 25 miles north of beirut all four are believed dead 
lebanese forces commander samir geagea said in august 1988 that 
after he took over the militia in 1986 he found no trace of the 
missing men and blamed his predecessor elie hobeika for their 
disappearance and apparent murder 
geageas disclosure was the first formal comment by the lebanese 
forces that it had been involved in the seizure of the missing 
iranians 
rafsanjani earlier had argued that the united states was keeping 
the issue of the american hostages in lebanon alive mainly as a 
bridge in order to approach us and establish relations with the 
islamic republic of iran and this is a mistake 
at one point during the news conference rafsanjani said the 
thing is that your governments are not as much interested as you 
foreign journalists are in the question of hostages youd better 
make your governments interested in the matter 
in addition to the americans the hostages are four britons two 
west germans two swiss an irishman and an italian held longest 
is american journalist terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press who was kidnapped march 16 
1985 
speaking through an interpreter rafsanjani made contradictory 
statements on the hostage issue 
though at one stage he said iran could assist in the release of 
the hostages he later declared that we do not want to become 
involved in this issue and denied that iran could exert any 
influence on the captors 
he admitted iran has close relations with hezbollah or party of 
god widely believed to be behind the hostage taking but he 
maintained that the kidnappers were outside hezbollah 
asked about prospects of improving relations with washington he 
said there had been no direct contacts between the two governments 
since a secret visit by former us national security adviser 
robert mcfarlane in 1986 
three american hostages were released between november 1985 and 
september 1986 in return iran secretly received weapons and spare 
parts from the united states 
but there have been indirect contacts rafsanjani said we 
have received messages through two neighboring countries from the 
united states he did not identify the countries 
in these messages they told us they have no illwill toward us 
and want to solve the problem with us he said but we still 
have no confidence in what they say we ask for signs and 
indications of goodwill on their part 
rafsanjani said these views had been relayed to the united 
states through the unspecified neighboring countries 
he ruled out any participation by us corporations in irans 
postwar reconstruction saying i dont think american companies 
can play any role in iran

solidarity could gain control of city hall 
in lodz polands secondlargest city following a meeting monday 
in which local officials agreed to leave the choice up to prime 
minister tadeusz mazowiecki 
a meeting by representatives of solidarity the communist party 
and other political groups decided after a lengthy discussion that 
the mayoral crisis is ripe for a decision by the prime 
minister the state pap news agency said 
organizer andrzej grabski said some names were discussed at the 
meeting that he could not reveal based on the discussion he said 
he was optimistic the matter would be settled soon 
the appointment would end a nearly fivemonth impasse over the 
selection of mayor of lodz it could also mark solidaritys first 
victory in taking control of provincial and municipal governments 
from the communist party 
solidarity already has assumed leadership of the national 
government after the election of solidarity adviser mazowiecki as 
prime minister aug 24 and fully democratic elections for local 
governing councils are being planned for sometime next year 
with communist power on the wane in the central government and 
in governmentowned enterprises provincial and municipal 
governments remain the last bastion of communist power 
the post of mayor for the city of 850000 people has been vacant 
since may 29 when the previous communist city president was ousted 
in a noconfidence vote following complaints of poor administration 
an oct 11 attempt to elect a mayor failed when the 
communistdominated city council refused to approve either of the 
two rival solidaritylinked candidates approved by mazowiecki 
mazowiecki earlier had declined to nominate either of two 
candidates proposed for the post by the communist party 
grabski said he could not guarantee the council would not reject 
mazowieckis nominee again but he said a consensus emerged during 
mondays discussion to give mazowiecki full trust in his 
decision 
in the past all provincial and municipal governments were under 
the central government and the communist party 
under reforms being prepared by solidarity and the mazowiecki 
government local governments would be elected in fully democratic 
voting by their communities and they in turn would choose mayors 
and other local officers independent of warsaw

california lawmakers today asked congress for 
an initial 38 billion package of federal aid for the 
earthquakeravaged san francisco bay area while the bush 
administration proposed up to 25 billion in relief 
the house appropriations committee arranged a lateafternoon 
meeting on a bipartisan package put together by californias 
47member congressional delegation with action by the full house 
scheduled tuesday 
white house aides and committee leaders worked in advance of the 
session to try to reach a compromise on the aid figure 
our current estimate is that the total federal contribution 
will probably have to be a little over 24 billion white house 
budget director richard darman said upon emerging from a meeting 
with rep jamie whitten dmiss chairman of the appropriations 
committee 
thats obviously subject to refinement darman said adding 
the white house wants to avoid the kind of situation where you 
have a bidding war and then a veto threat 
rep leon panetta dcalif the house budget committee 
chairman said the californians package included 11 billion of 
direct aid through the federal emergency management agency for a 
wide variety of relief programs and 1 billion for rebuilding 
highways and bridges 
another 12 billion in disaster loans would be provided through 
the small business administration for rebuilding damaged homes and 
businesses the bill also includes 100 million in loan guarantees 
for public and private companies in lowincome areas and 400 
million in discretionary spending president bush would determine 
how the discretionary money is spent 
in an indication that congress and the administration may not be 
far apart darmon said his figure did not include raising the 
ceiling on the ability of the small business administration to 
issue loans 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said up to 1 billion 
could be taken from existing programs including 250 million of 
unspent money authorized for aiding victims of hurricane hugo 
he said the adminstration was abandoning an effort to assemble 
its own relief package and would work with congress in fashioning 
one because of the shortness of time involved 
it sounds to me they are trying to set a parameter to cut a 
deal panetta said of the white house proposal ultimately i 
think we will resolve a final number between the administration and 
congress 
rep jerry lewis rcalif chairman of the house republican 
conference described the administrations 25 billion figure as 
an early number reached before the damage estimates escalated over 
the weekend 
its my feeling the 25 billion in the minds eye of the 
administration has already been raised lewis said 
panetta whose district south of san francisco suffered severe 
damage in last tuesdays earthquake said the aid package still 
could become a vehicle for raising gasoline taxes or other levies 
but he acknowledged the prospects for that are uncertain 
the bottom line is that we are going to need to develop more 
resources he said if not youre looking at this basically 
feeding into the deficit i dont like that approach but our first 
priority is to help the victims of this kind of disaster 
there is an urgent need for help for people now sen pete 
wilson rcalif told the senate environment and public works 
subcommittee on transportation and natural resources fema is 
stretched very thin 
bush last friday declined on several occasions to say whether he 
would consider breaking his no new taxes pledge to help pay for 
disaster relief saying only that the government would do what it 
had to do 
however fitzwater said today that we do not intend to raise 
taxes to deal with the earthquake aftermath 
president bush viewed the human agony and the physical 
destruction associated with this disaster when he toured the area 
on friday the spokesman said 
he is committed to providing all the federal help that is 
possible short of proposing a tax increase fitzwater said 
us officials said the administration as in the congressional 
plan would propose tapping the 12 billion federal highway trust 
fund to help california rebuild highways and bridges damaged in 
last tuesdays quake 
the federal gasoline tax is the major source of revenue for the 
trust fund 
barbara clay a spokeswoman for the office of management and 
budget said omb officials had worked through the weekend and were 
still at work today on coming up with a preliminary cost estimate 
for the damage 
however sen alan cranston dcalif warned reporters on 
sunday in san francisco unfortunately all the cost cannot be 
covered by government aid 
there will be some loss said cranston who predicted the 
federal government would provide 35 billion in aid but estimated 
property loss and damage to roads and highways at more than 7 
billion 
in addition to the amount of aid to be determined congress must 
also decide how to raise the funds 
bush sidestepped questions friday about whether he would support 
a tax increase to finance the package some lawmakers have proposed 
an exemption in the grammrudman deficitcutting law to accommodate 
the aid needed

british prime minister margaret 
thatcher battled the rest of 49nation commonwealth the former 
british empire over south africa at this weeks summit meeting 
but this time the others had had enough 
canadas prime minister brian mulroney accused mrs thatcher of 
ignoring a cherished british tradition fair play when she 
issued a dissenting statement against plans by the 49nation 
commonwealth to pressure south africa on reform 
the price of commonwealth membership is loyalty mulroney 
told her as the presidents and prime ministers of excolonies 
gathered round the conference table in closed session monday the 
secondlast day of the weeklong summit 
australias bob hawke said this is not the way business 
should be done 
mrs thatcher responded that she was astounded and utterly 
appalled at the attacks and owed the other leaders no 
explanation whatsoever 
the anger provoked by what was a matter of procedure not 
substance reflected the deep frustration in the largely third 
world organization over what its sees as mrs thatchers constant 
obstruction of the fight against apartheid 
south africa left the commonwealth in 1961 under threat of being 
thrown out because of its apartheid policy which denies the black 
majority the vote britain a major south african trading partner 
argues sanctions hurt the black majority and increase white 
resistance to change 
south africas deeply hostile black southern african neighbors 
mostly commonwealth members also continue trading because they 
depend economically on south africa 
mrs thatcher has refused to impose most of a list of 11 
nonbinding commonwealth embargoes against south africa including 
bans on air links new investment and imports of agricultural 
products iron steel coal and urnanium it was drawn up in 1986 
after australia canada and new zealand the other white founding 
members joined the effort 
the new south africa declaration was drafted by 10 foreign 
ministers after 17 hours of tough negotiations british foreign 
secretary john major argued that moves toward reform by south 
africas new president fw de klerk made sanctions especially 
inappropriate now 
everyone compromised a bit the british agreed that current 
embargoes should not be lifted and african nations held off demands 
for new trade sanctions the final document called for tighter 
financial pressure but that other sanctions would be considered 
only if the whiteled government fails to take measures dismantling 
apartheid in the next six months 
the declaration incorporated an australian proposal that the 
commonwealth call on international banks to restrict south african 
trade credits to a maximum of 90 days and urge governments to make 
it more difficult for south africa to get credits 
they all signed on sunday with mrs thatcher personally 
proposing its adoption she didnt mention that within an hour 
shed be releasing a fivepage statement setting out her objections 
to sanctions and crediting the south african government with 
important and positive changes 
it was this tactic that angered hawke and mulroney the main 
authors of the report 
where would we be if 49 countries did this mulroney said 
speaking to reporters you sign a deal at 5 oclock and repudiate 
it at six saying by the way what i signed really doesnt 
reflect all my views 
i think its despicable said zimbabwe president robert 
mugabe whose country however is among those that has continued 
trading with neighboring south africa what turns out to be the 
majority view should bind us all thats how democratic systems 
work 
on the environment the commonwealth issued a declaration 
saturday calling for assurances that poor countries are not blamed 
for problems beyond their control nor shortchanged in the fight 
against global pollution 
malaysias prime minister mahathir mohamad said industrialized 
countries in the west cause most pollution while poor countries are 
asked to stop cutting down trees and take other measures to protect 
the environment 
the deserts of the world can be made to bloom if the rich 
countries are prepared to spend money to draw up underground water 
and plant trees instead of just building golf courses in 
california deserts he said without elaborating 
referring to fears that pollutioncaused global warming could 
melt polar ice and raise sea levels maldives president maumoon 
abdul gayoom said his indian ocean island nation was willing to 
host the commonwealth summit in the year 2050 but might have to do 
it underwater

the justice department on monday called 
totally offbase the irancontra prosecutors contention that 
attorney general dick thornburgh is using procedural delays to 
thwart the trial of a former cia agent 
the justice departments effort as it has been all along is 
to protect the national security of the united states while 
allowing the trial to go forward thats our bottomline objective 
and we are trying to bring that about said spokesman david 
runkel 
i think the attorney general feels that those comments that 
were made in the court filing last week to be totally offbase 
runkel said of the charge made in court pleadings by independent 
counsel lawrence e walsh 
we are having discussions with a number of people on how best 
to resolve the case of former cia agent joseph fernandez runkel 
said 
the spokesman refused to say whether the justice department was 
pressing the cia and other intelligence agencies to release 
material the cia wants kept secret 
walsh asking a federal appeals court to lift a stay in 
fernandez trial accused thornburgh of using unjustifiable 
delaying tactics designed to tie this case in a knot of endless 
litigation 
thornburgh was much less emphatic when asked about walshs 
charge saying the court record speaks for itself 
mary belcher a spokeswoman for walsh refused to comment 
in his filing last week walsh asked the 4th us circuit court 
of appeals to rescind its order granting the justice department at 
least another months delay to give thornburghs attorneys more 
time to ponder secrecy issues raised by the fernandez case 
at issue is a trial judges order that the defense could 
disclose the locations of three cia stations in central america 
when fernandez was station chief in costa rica 
the justice department wants to block references to the 
locations during the trial even though they have been publicized 
walsh said the cia was merely trying to preserve a diplomatic

advocates for people displaced 
by the civil war accused the government monday of holding up the 
return of 1300 refugees suffering illness and exposure because of 
the delay 
the national resettlement coordinator and members of a us 
churchworkers delegation called on the rightist administration of 
president alfredo cristiani to remove all obstacles to the 
refugees return 
the government says it has nothing against the refugees return 
but that they must be documented in honduras by salvadoran 
officials before coming back the resettlement coordinator accused 
the government of prolonging the documentation process to delay 
the refugees return 
about 13000 salvadorans live in three refugee camps across the 
northern border in honduras most fled to the camps in the early 
1980s because of heavy fighting between leftist rebels and 
government forces in the northern sector of el salvador 
more than 7000 refugees have returned since 1987 to rebuild 
their lives in the north still a combat zone in the 10yearold 
civil war the usbacked government considers the returned 
refugees sympathizers and collaborators of the farabundo marti 
national liberation front the rebel army 
about 1300 refugees from the mesa grande camp had planned to 
return oct 17 the return was to have been coordinated by the un 
high commission for refugees 
col carlos figueroa said saturday the documentation has begun 
in mesa grande and that as soon as it is finished the refugees 
will be allowed to return 
the un commission said it cannot provide transportation and 
other logistics for return without government approval 
the resettlement coordinators allegation of government delays 
was seconded by a delegation of 30 american churchpeople who 
traveled to honduras and el salvador this month to accompany the 
returnees 
the rev marilyn chilcote a presbyterian pastor from oakland 
calif said three people have died in mesa grande from exposure 
since the refugees dismantled their shacks last week in 
anticipation of departure she also said an epidemic of dengue 
fever has afflicted many refugees 
about 300 refugees accompanied by salvadoran and us 
churchworkers left mesa grande by foot last week for the border 
they reached san marcos ocotepeque where they remain in precarious 
conditions in a church awaiting documentation the refugee 
advocates said

farmers who rotated their traditional spring 
crop to land where winter wheat was destroyed by drought or 
freezing weather are entitled to disaster payments for their 
losses the agriculture department announced monday 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas called the decision by the 
agricultural stabilization and conservation service good news for 
some farmers but said it does not go far enough in reversing usda 
regulations that would cut disaster assistance to many other 
farmers who had also planted a second crop after the drought 
a senate aide said the usdas decision monday apparently applies 
to only winter wheat farmers who would traditionally plant a second 
crop such as milo on nonwheat acres in the spring those farmers 
who planted their second crop on the wheat acres instead to take 
advantage of fertilizer already on the land will not see their 
disaster checks cut the aide said 
mondays decision does not cover cotton farmers who also planted 
a second crop or farmers who planted nontraditional second crops 
on their wheat acreage officials said 
i am still unhappy that people who did not plant a second 
crop who waited for the government to help are in some cases 
better off than the people who planted a second crop said sen 
phil gramm rtexas 
farm state lawmakers contend usdas formula for calculating 
disaster payments under an 895 million relief program for farmers 
hurt by this years severe weather was unfair to producers who 
planted a second crop 
legislators and usda have been wrangling over the regulations on 
ghost acres for two months and one senate aide said mondays 
decision came because we hand to force their hand on this 
according to bentsen some farmers in texas kansas oklahoma 
and elsewhere on the great plains planted milo or cotton on their 
failed wheat acres this year 
the acres that would have been planted to the spring crop were 
often left fallow with the intention of planting this falls wheat 
crop there said bentsen dtexas such a rotation allows the 
spring crop to use the fertilizer and water put down for the failed 
wheat crop and it allows for the control of troublesome weeds 
such as johnsongrass on the fallowed land 
but bentsen said those farmers were told by ascs that their 
disaster checks would be reduced if they instead planted their 
spring cotton or milo crops on the winter wheat land 
had they planted the spring crop normally without rotating it 
to the failed wheat acres there would be no reduction in the 
disaster checks bentsen said 
bentsen said usdas initial plans were unfair and went against 
congress intentions when it passed the disaster relief package 
it is obviously unfair to penalize farmers when they are 
following normal farming practices by simply rotating their crops 
on the farm bentsen said

commuters tried many unfamiliar routes to their

</TEXT>
<TEXT>
boarding one of the first 
ferryboats pressed into emergency service monday to carry commuters 
across san francisco bay i expected a romantic ride through the 
fog reality brought nausea 
the worst storm of the season struck just an hour before tens of 
thousands of residents in alameda and contra costa counties east of 
san francisco began the trek to work 
this 127foot ocean vessel one of 14 being run on routes unused 
by ferries for decades met blustery winds giant swells that 
crashed across the bow and waves that sent it constantly lurching 
from side to side the song of the journey should be i left my 
stomach on san francisco bay 
the 55minute voyage made necessary because of the collapse of 
a 50foot section of the vital san franciscooakland bay bridge 
during last tuesdays quake was twice what was expected 
the tripledeck monohull pulled away from the dock 40 minutes 
late because of weather worries and a low passenger count the 
captain announced some boats might be turned back a big groan 
i arrived dockside before dawn naively thinking i could relive 
idyllic bay crossings created by writers like jack london and in 
such classic movies as humphrey bogarts dark passage 
i wasnt alone 
ive just been through hell but heck i have to admit i made 
it through it it can only get better this cant get much worse 
said an ashenfaced john trowbridge 27 of alameda who came onto 
the deck to alleviate sea sickness 
i moved up to the bow where a giant swell drenched me since i 
was downwind i figured it would be best to remain there in case i 
lost my breakfast 
the ferry with a capacity of 700 people and carrying 338 was 
supposed to dock at the union ferry building in san francisco but 
waves craching there forced the boats to divert to fishermans 
wharf 
altogether my commute from hearth to work station took 3 
hours i used to do it in 45 minutes at the wharf i tried to 
catch a cable car into downtown only to find it shut down i 
walked another seven blocks in the drenching rain and caught a city 
bus to work 
roughing it across the bay didnt dampen everybodys spirits 
considering everything my commute has really gone smooth 
said maggie faulkner 46 of oakland 
karen meyer 42 of oakland used to work on long island ny 
ferries and was unflappable 
everybodys just going to have to go into slow motion she 
said that includes all the bosses 
elena pierini 44 of oakland recalled taking ferries to 
berkeley as a child she relived those memories monday morning 
this makes up for all the bad things that came out of the 
earthquake said the san francisco general hospital research 
nurse 
the weather was trying for dick simpson vice president of 
marketing for crowley maritime which operated the ferries he rode 
the catalina empress which normally operates between long beach 
and catalina island in southern california 
mother nature is testing our mental state normally this bay 
is as smooth as glass at this time said simpson about 3000 
people used the ferries monday morning crowley said 
the bays ferryboat industry to the east bay which began in 
1863 grew to include hundreds of boats at its height in the early 
1930s it was discontinued shortly after the bay bridge opened in 
1937

an underground cavity in a salt dome 
where two nuclear weapons were tested in the 1960s may be leaking 
radioactive materials state officials say 
at least one federal official says there is no problem 
i think a study should be done to answer questions we still 
have about whether there are cracks in the dome and whether its 
leaking said james pinson who helped the department of energy 
conduct what he calls an inconclusive 19791980 study at the site 
pinson a nuclear chemist at the university of southern 
mississippi at hattiesburg said the study of the tatum salt dome 
left many unanswered questions about activities at the test site 
another underground salt formation near carlsbad nm is the 
site of the federal governments waste isolation pilot plant a 
complex of chambers intended for permanent storage of military 
radioactive waste the wipp was supposed to open last october but 
questions about the longterm safety of the salt bed and 
transportation of waste to the site have delayed the opening 
tests near the tatum dome show tritium levels are increasing in 
overflow ponds when they should be decreasing he said 
some scientists fear the formation of solid salt may be cracked 
allowing potentially hazardous radioactive isotopes such as tritium 
to escape from the cavity formed by the explosions a halfmile 
beneath lamar county in 1964 and 1966 
another theory is that the salt is squeezing together forcing 
radioactive brine from within the dome up toward the surface 
pinson said 
test samples taken by the state board of health have found 
relatively high levels of tritium at the surface above the salt 
dome during the dry season these levels diminish as the wet season 
encroaches and water runs off into swollen creeks and overflow 
ponds near ground zero 
since the levels of tritium appear to be restored each year 
some experts theorize a leak in the dome continually replenishes 
the isotope in soil near the surface 
federal guidelines for safe drinking water limit tritium to 
20000 picocuries per liter a picocurie is a measure of the rate 
at which atoms disintegrate radioactively 
tritium has been found at levels as high as 1 million picocuries 
per liter in mud around ground zero the point directly above the 
blast chamber records show 
obviously theres a pretty good source of tritium down there 
at the site said ron forsyth manager of the state energy plan 
development and weve been asking ourselves for a decade 
where its coming from whether its leaking of course thats 
something we wonder 
the dome is free of leaks said stuart black nuclear radiation 
advisor to the us environmental protection agency thats a 
pretty good salt dome he said 
stuart said epa tests have not found hazardous levels of tritium 
of the seasonal cycle of tritium he said we dont consider 
that to be a problem 
the pattern of tritium found in shallow test holes several yards 
from ground zero is also difficult to explain said bob bell a 
health physicist for the state department of healths radiological 
health division 
bell said tests taken the farthest from ground zero should 
reflect the lowest levels of tritium 
but he found tritium levels decrease in tests of shallow wells 
along the periphery of the dome site then increase in wells 
farther away 
we would not expect this activity to show up bell said 
and the department of energy is in fact trying to evaluate why we 
are seeing these levels so far from ground zero 
two nonnuclear natural gas explosions detonated inside the dome 
on feb 2 1969 and april 19 1970 may have released some 
radioactivity formerly trapped in recrystallized salt on the walls 
and floors of the nuclear cavity a 1978 doe report says

miners are threatening to resume strikes in two 
coal basins where walkouts this summer brought much of the soviet 
unions coal industry to a standstill the news media reported 
monday 
tass the official news agency reported that in the western 
siberian town of mezhdurechensk in the kuznetsk coal basin about 
20000 miners and transport workers participated in a twohour 
warning strike monday morning 
the government newspaper izvestia said in the arctic circle town 
of vorkuta workers stopped loading coal at one mine and workers at 
12 other mines are planning walkouts beginning wednesday 
reports said the miners claim the government has failed to 
fulfill promises it made in order to end the summers strikes that 
involved hundreds of thousands of miners in the ukraine siberia 
the far north and central asia 
the mezhdurechensk strike and planned stoppages in vorkuta 
violate a new strike law passed this month by the soviet 
parliament the law requires unions to submit disputes to 
arbitration before calling a strike and prohibits walkouts in such 
vital industries as transport energy and defense 
local leaders in mezhdurechensk 1550 miles east of moscow 
accused the strikers of showing disrespect for the new law tass 
said 
but it reported a strike committee member y shikharev told 
tass the strike was only a warning measure and would not harm the 
mines output 
tass quoted shikharev as saying julys strike was only 
temporarily stopped we only renewed it because our demands are not 
being fulfilled 
among the concessions won during the summer strikes were 
government promises to improve supplies of consumer goods provide 
better working conditions and grant the mines more financial 
independence 
izvestia said workers in vorkuta complained that officials were 
finding loopholes to avoid delivering some of the promised benefits 
it said the workers sent telegrams to the kremlin and the main 
soviet mining areas advising them of the planned strike the 
newspaper also said several legislators were going to the mining 
areas to inform the miners that the government was doing its best 
to fulfill its promises 
during the summer strikes president mikhail s gorbachev said 
in a televised interview that he sympathized with the miners but 
the strikes could cause an economic disaster

women nationwide were urged monday to lobby 
congress to salvage medicare coverage of breast cancer tests from 
the catastrophic health insurance program the house recently voted 
to repeal 
if this were a mans issue it wouldnt be a problem 
deborah dingell chairwoman of the national womens health resource 
center said following a ceremony honoring people who have raised 
awareness about breast cancer which strikes one in 10 american 
women 
rep mary rose oakar dohio was cited for her efforts in 
congress such as including mammography tests in the medicare 
catastrophic coverage act of 1988 
ms oakar noting that the house recently voted to repeal the 
act urged the 275 doctors community leaders and others on hand to 
lobby congress to accept a senate provision retaining coverage for 
breast cancer tests she called on women across the country to join 
the lobbying effort 
house and senate negotiators are trying to work out differences 
on the program the mammography program would initially cost 60 
million but would ultimately save millions more through early 
detection that would save hospitalization costs ms oakar said 
if congress allows mammograms to remain covered by the insurance 
program then medicare as of jan 1 would pay for the tests every 
two years for women aged 65 and over women over age 35 who are 
eligible for medicare because of disability would also be covered 
for exams either yearly or every two years depending on their risk 
according to the american cancer society breast cancer will be 
diagnosed in 142000 women this year and will cause 43000 deaths 
susan ford bales spokeswoman for national breast cancer 
awareness month said 37 percent of american women over age 40 have 
never had a mammogram even though medical experts say breast 
cancer deaths could be reduced by onethird if all women over 40 
had regular mammograms

secretary of state james a baker iii called 
monday for a new military relationship with the soviet union to 
sharply reduce the first strike nuclear weapons that could be 
devastating in a surprise attack 
baker in his first major armscontrol speech also urged a 
reluctant congress to approve white house requests for funds to 
produce mobile midgetman missiles otherwise he said the soviets 
could exploit differences between capitol hill and the bush 
administration 
united we stand divided we fall baker said in a speech to 
the private commonwealth club of san francisco copies were 
distributed in washington by the state department 
bakers emphasis on reducing us and soviet firststrike 
weapons such as soviet ss18 intercontinental ballisic missiles 
signals the strategy the united states will pursue in trying to 
conclude a treaty with the soviet union in geneva 
there us and soviet negotiators began work in the reagan 
administration to cut arsenals of strategic weapons 
oceanspanning bombers missiles and submarines by 30 percent to 
50 percent critics such as former secretary of state henry a 
kissinger have urged the united states to put greater stress on 
slashing firststrike weapons instead of concentrating on 
acrosstheboard numerical reductions 
baker made no reference to a 30 percent to 50 percent cutback in 
his speech this did not suggest the bush administration would 
abandon that goal in the strategic arms reduction talks start 
but his emphasis on curbing firststrike weapons indicated a more 
selective approach in negotiating reductions 
like the ss18 designed to destroy us intercontinental 
ballistic missiles in their silos firststrike nuclear weapons 
have the potential of wreaking havoc on the other sides nuclear 
forces 
president reagan responded to the perceived threat by launching 
a program known popularly as star wars designed to destroy 
soviet ballistic missiles in space before they could approach their 
targets 
baker in his speech encouraged the soviets to concentrate 
their efforts on defense as well while the bush administration 
pursues the strategic defense initiative 
he said in the geneva negotiations the united states would 
explore a cooperative and stable transition to a greater reliance 
on stabilityenhancing costeffective strategic defense 
in fact baker said we want to see soviet defensive military 
operations made habitual 
he said the bush administration was emphasing in negotiations 
the relative merits of slowflying weapons such as cruise missiles 
and bombers which are not suitable for a first strike 
baker said the us goal was a new relationship in which the 
capabilities and incentives to attack first are minimized and the 
possibilities of strategic defense are pursued 
meanwhile baker used the speech to publicly prod congress to 
drop its objections to the midgetman which is designed as a 
safeguard against a soviet firststrike because of its mobility 
the house has eliminated the 100 million requested by the white 
house but the senate gave its approval for the money a conference 
committee is trying to resolve this and other differences over the 
305 billion defense authorization bill 
we will need to rely upon the deployment of mobile missiles as 
a key component of our nuclear modernization program baker said 
referring to the negotiations in geneva baker added congress 
needs now to support start not undercut it by funding this 
program 
baker initially planned to speak to the commonwealth club on 
arms control last thursday the earthquake caused the postponement 
answering questions later on other subjects baker reaffirmed 
us support for the reunification of east and west germany in a 
way in which east germans will be integrated into a community of 
democratic european nations 
he acknowledged however that the idea of joining the two 
germanies together conjures up visions of a return to 1937 
borders or perhaps a reunification that is not achieved in peace 
and freedom 
on another subject baker said that despite a sustained effort 
to arrange arabisraeli negotiations i dont see it as anything 
more than a possibility

several hundred employees of an east german 
factory have formed an independent union a worker spokesman said 
monday stirring memories of solidaritys challenge a decade ago to 
an equally stern polish regime 
in leipzig at least 100000 people marched for democracy 
workers at the wilhelm pieck electronics factory in teltow a 
suburb of east berlin call their union reform 
it is the first independent labor union in this communist 
nation as solidarity was the first in the soviet bloc and 
includes the right to strike among its demands there was no 
comment from the government 
zdf television in west germany quoted a reform spokesman as 
saying workers in entire sections of the plant had resigned from 
the state freie deutsche gewerkschaftsbund labor federation it 
said workers had appealed to comrades in other factories to spread 
the new union 
a crowd estimated at 300000 by supporters and over 100000 
by the official news agency adn marched through downtown leipzig 
demanding a more democratic society for the first time a roman 
catholic church was made available to activists for the weekly 
demonstrations and rallies 
lutheran church sources said police did not interfere with the 
peaceful parade more than 120000 people filled the streets of 
leipzig a week ago to demand reform 
marchers carried placards reading egon who asked us and 
we want dialogue not lies 
in east berlin 3000 prodemocracy activists held a vigil in 
the gethsemane lutheran church to support their comrades in 
leipzig adn said about 40000 people rallied in schwerin a 
northwestern city in an event sponsore by the communist party to 
encourage dialogue between citizens and the leadership 
prodemocracy spokesmen said there would be demonstrations 
tuesday when the parliament elected egon krenz head of state 
krenz 52 took over wednesday as communist party chief replacing 
erich honecker his 77yearold mentor 
honecker who led the nation for 18 years was forced from power 
by growing unrest at home and the flight of tens of thousands of 
east germans most of them young skilled workers to freedom in 
the west 
official media have carried calls for reform since honeckers 
departure but opposition spokesmen remain skeptical about krenzs 
willingness to implement the kind of broad change under way or 
comtemplated elsewhere in eastern europe 
mondays editions of the communist party daily neues deutschland 
devoted four pages to discussions of reform going on all across 
the nation 
discussions start again and critical discussion are going 
on everywhere it said in a commentary 
in bonn officials said monday the krenz regime had agreed to 
let about 100 refugees at the west german embassy in prague 
czechoslovakia join 2000 east germans going to the west from 
warsaw poland on monday a plane carrying 154 refugees left 
warsaw for west germany 
the number of east germans arriving at west germanys embassies 
in eastern europe has continued to grow despite the first signs 
that some change may come to their homeland 
krenz has accepted an invitation to visit the soviet union and 
meet with president mikhail s gorbachev and east german media 
suggested over the weekend that something might be learned from the 
kremlin leaders reforms no date for the visit has been announced 
on the independent union the krenz government remained silent 
east germanys 86 million workers have been represented by the 
official federation which is run by a member of the communist 
party politburo 
the party has said it will retain its leading role even if 
reform comes and that ngotiations with the opposition are 
unnecessary because the nation has enough official organizations 
for discussing reform 
it appeared certain the government would try to prevent the 
independent union from gaining the mass support that eventually 
carried solidarity to political power in poland 
a statement from union spokesman roelf boerger said reforms 
goals include the right to strike he urged all 6000 employees of 
the pieck factory named for east germanys first president to 
join 
boerger said the official federation represents communist party 
interests and doesnt enjoy the confidence of the workers 
factories must become more independent and set prices and 
salaries themselves he declared in place of patronizing 
bureaucratic treatment and being led around like children we need 
worker participation in the factories 
his statement distributed to western news media in west berlin 
did not say when the union was founded it said reform supports 
east germanys new opposition political groups and favors complete 
restructuring of the economy

the house that highperformance 
plastics helped build was unveiled monday a gracious colonial 
dwelling with some decidedly 21st century dream house technology 
tucked behind its facade 
we are very excited in sharing with you what we feel the 
future of home ownership is uwe wascher vice president of 
marketing for ge plastics said at the opening of the living 
environments concept house at the divisions headquarters 
general electric officials were quick to point out that the 
engineering plastics used in the house have little in common with 
the stuff of toys or with the highly futuristic spaceage type of 
plastic housing that has been experimented with over the past 40 
years 
about onethird of the light beige house is plastic the total 
cost is estimated at 10 million but that includes research and 
model development 
the engineering plastics used typically have high melting 
points create little smoke when they burn and have good 
sounddeadening properties but the hime is so airtight it requires 
strong ventilating systems 
the house has curved bay windows generous decks and huge atrium 
windows in front and back it is clearly in the dream house 
category with such amenities as double showers that convert to 
steam rooms power windows and movable walls 
tour guides showed off some of the features such as a 50gallon 
reservoir in the basement in case of drought liquid quartz 
technology to make naked windows opaque and refrigeration systems 
set into the kitchen walls 
cutaway sections throughout the house showed the plastics molded 
into walls and floors and in one bathroom the tub was sliced in 
two right down to a bisected rubber duck 
ge officials say the house will serve as a laboratory to explore 
use of engineering polymers in construction markets but also 
contains some practical concepts that are already in use roof tile 
panels of highperformance plastics are already on the market as 
are some of the window units which feature snapin moldings 
you get used to it you dont paint it you just replace it 
said tour guide rob gillette 
the 3000squarefoot twostory house with a splitlevel 
basement was built for a family of four with a large master 
bedroom luxuriously appointed with a jacuzzi window seat and 
stateoftheart japanese toilets featuring a builtin exhaust fan 
and automatic bidet 
company officials conceded it will be some time before all of 
the innovations in the concept house become commonplace 
we dont think we can change the industry overnight dickens 
said 
the plastics used in the building are now two to 10 times more 
expensive than traditional building materials but ge expects them 
to become competitive as builders look toward prefabricated and 
component assembly to hold down costs 
eventually the plastic construction which may feature prefab 
wall panels complete wmth insulation and siding that snaps 
together will provide a more efficient way of building company 
officials said 
more than 45000 pounds of plastics are used in the house in 
such areas as the roof windows siding plumbing foundation and 
electrical and mechanical systems 
but much of the visible material in the house is unabashedly 
traditionl such as the maple floors and company officials said 
that was intentional 
we never intended to replace all wood glass stone and 
steel wascher said

rightwing extremists yelling that the holocaust 
was a lie had a shouting match monday with a concentration camp 
survivor outside an international conference on nazi war crimes 
you are nazis you are nazi terrorists shouted rabbi hugo 
gryn you probably would have killed me 
experts from the united states canada australia and britain 
had to pass the 14 protesters who were waving british flags 
shouting six million lies and passing out newspapers headlined 
holocaust story an evil hoax at the entrance to the royal 
westminster hotel 
for gryn of the west london synagogue who was born 59 years ago 
in czechoslovakia and spent 194445 in the birkenau concentration 
camp it was too much 
i lost my temper he said theyre really obscene and 
theyre young and the awful thing is they would have put in the 
gas pellets theyre the haters what breeds them 
the clash highlighted some of the opposition to changing british 
law to allow prosecution of alleged nazi war criminals living in 
britain the theme of a conference called time for justice 
sponsored by the allparty parliamentary war crimes group 
sir thomas hetherington coauthor of a report recommending the 
prosecution of alleged war criminals said there is enough evidence 
to prosecute three people living in britain whom he refused to 
identify 
he said three other cases that had been investigated in detail 
needed further inquiries and another 75 cases should be 
investigated he also appealed for information on 46 alleged war 
criminals whom his inquiry team had been unable to trace 
i am quite unshaken on this that having weighed all the pros 
and cons we in this country ought to legislate to take the 
necessary jurisdictional powers hetherington said 
efriam zuroff of the los angelesbased simon wiesenthal center 
said he had turned over the name of one more alleged nazi war 
criminal living in britain to the british home office on monday 
were talking about a person who served in a unit which 
carried out the mass murder of thousands upon thousands of innocent 
men women and children he said in a british broadcasting corp 
television interview he did not identify the person 
parliament is due to debate the war crimes report this autumn 
and vote on whether to introduce legislation enabling prosecutions 
to take place 
labor lawmaker merlyn rees chairman of the parliamentary war 
crimes group predicted victory for those favoring prosecution 
would not be easy 
i believe there will be those particularly among the younger 
generation perhaps among the older generation too who will say 
it is all 50 years ago he said 
opening the conference on behalf of home secretary douglas hurd 
home office minister john patten gave a hint of the governments 
position saying it is his view and it is my view that we should 
certainly forgive but we should certainly not forget 
patten led a string of condemnations of the flagwaving 
protesters saying they were trying to clothe their own attempts 
to rewrite history in some form of public acceptance 
he added i think what they are doing outside is perfectly 
disgusting and i condemn it utterly in every way 
one demonstrator richard edmonds said they were all members of 
the british national party a small white supremacist party 
the gas chambers were lies produced by britain and america to 
justify their activities in world war ii edmonds said these 
war crimes trials are absolutely wicked they are trials based on 
evidence of the kgb and who believes them 
if parliament approves legislation britain would be following 
the united states canada australia east germany and west germany 
in prosecuting war criminals 
it truly is an issue which should have no territorial 
boundaries said neal sher director of the office of special 
investigation at the us justice department 
he said more than 1200 people had been brought to the attention 
of us authorities using existing laws on extradition and 
deportation more than 30 war criminals had been kicked out 35 
others had been stripped of us citizenship and 25 cases were in 
the courts he said 
sher stressed the importance of prosecuting all nazi war 
criminals even the small fry but he guessed that possibly 
10000 small fry nazi criminals living in the united states 
were getting away with their crimes because nobody knows who they 
are

the house approved legislation monday that 
expands the federal governments program to restore abandoned coal 
mines to a safe and environmentally acceptable condition 
the bill approved 28163 but opposed by the white house 
extends through fiscal year 2007 the interior departments 
authority to collect fees on coal under the 1977 surface mining 
control and reclamation act 
but it also makes changes in how the money is used reduces the 
fees in states that have completed all their abandoned mine 
reclamation projects and creates a fund for reclamation of 
abandoned noncoal mines 
the legislation now goes to the senate 
rep larry craig ridaho who led the opposition to the bill 
said house action was extremely premature because the 1977 act 
was not due to expire until 1992 he said he opposed the expansion 
of reclamation efforts to noncoal mine sites and said more time 
should be given to get reports from agencies involved in mine 
reclamation 
he accused the proponents headed by rep morris udall dariz 
chairman of the house interior committee of rushing the bill and 
said it was not fiscally responsible to expand the provisions 
of the 1977 law 
the fund should be narrowed not expanded said craig 
rep nick rahall dwva who led floor debate for the bill 
said that despite the work to remove scars left by previous mining 
practices the number of abandoned sites is still overwhelming 
he acknowledged that the problems addressed by the bill are 
regional ones but said that many compromises were made to satisfy 
the western states 
rep carl perkins dky said thousands of acres are still in 
need of reclamation and spoke graphically of the landslide 
problems caused by the combination of flooding and abandoned mines 
fees mandated by the legislation are used to pay for reclamation 
of mine sites abandoned before 1977 when no one else has the 
responsibility under federal or state law 
the fees would be unchanged under the bill 35 cents per ton 
for surfacemined coal 15 cents a ton for underground coal and 10 
cents a ton for a type of coal known as lignite or brown coal 
the congressional budget office estimates that extending 
collection of coal reclamation fees beyond 1992 would increase 
federal revenues by 234 million in 1993 and 213 million in 1994 
but that fee compliance activities in those two years would 
increase outlays by 11 million 
the new abandoned noncoal mine reclamation fund would total 6 
million in fiscal 1991 through 1994

a consultant supplied a texas company with 
details of closed sessions of the us postal services governing 
board according to testimony at a criminal trial monday 
robert buzard president of electrocom automation inc of 
arlington texas testified that his firm hired lobbyist mark bragg 
in the companys effort in 1985 to win hundreds of millions of 
dollars in postal contracts 
braggs business partner at the time was lyn nofziger the 
former white house political director in the reagan administration 
who was convicted of illegal lobbying in matters unrelated to the 
postal service nofzigers conviction was overturned by a federal 
appeals court in june bragg was a codefendant at nofzigers trial 
and was acquitted 
electrocoms competitor recognition equipment inc and two of 
reis top officers are on trial in us district court for 
conspiring to defraud the postal service in connection with the 
award of automation contracts 
buzard testified that electrocom hired bragg for about a year 
to keep the playing field level in the competition with rei 
at the time rei had hired a politically wellconnected 
consultant john gnau at the suggestion of thenboard of governors 
vice chairman peter voss voss later pleaded guilty to taking an 
illegal gratuity from gnau in connection with the competition for 
the postal automation equipment 
during one hectic week in the competition with rei in november 
1985 buzard said bragg supplied him with names of governors who in 
a closed session had given speeches in support of electrocom 
buzard also acknowledged it was bragg who reported to him that 
reis closeddoor presentation to the board on the automation 
contract hadnt been persuasive and had provided nothing new 
buzard sought to deemphasize the information bragg provided 
saying it dealt with the quality not content of board of 
governors meetings 
under questioning from rei legal counsel john cooney buzard 
said he hadnt been aware the information bragg was providing was 
from meetings that were closed 
buzard said he never asked and that bragg never said where he 
got his information about board meetings 
buzard acknowledged that in 1986 he refused to identify bragg by 
name to postal inspectors investigating allegations of contract 
irregularities buzard simply told them that electrocom had hired a 
washington consultant who was wellplaced 
buzard said he refused to identify bragg because the consultant 
didnt want the identity of his clients disclosed 
electrocom has been awarded the work for the automation 
equipment 
in a brief interview bragg said he was unfamiliar with buzards 
testimony and so would have no immediate comment 
outside the courtroom buzard declined to say how much 
electrocom had paid bragg

christy andrews who weighed just 15 ounces 
when she was born three months prematurely and was given little 
chance of survival celebrates her first birthday friday 
shes doing extremely well christys 28yearold mother 
leslie andrews said monday 
when she was born oct 27 the baby measured 10 inches 
specialists at our lady of lourdes medical center gave her a less 
than a 5 percent chance of survival she was hospitalized for five 
months before her discharge in march 
today the brownhaired browneyed infant weighs a little more 
than 12 pounds and is 23 inches high 
her survival and the fact that she has done medically so well 
is remarkable when people hear about her they cant believe it 
said dr margaret fernandes dsouza director of the intensive care 
unit for newborns 
christys survival boosted morale among nurses and other staff 
members in the unit where another infant who was as small as 
christy at birth is recovering the doctor said 
its made us feel really good said fernandes dsouza who 
has cared for christy since the childs birth this has shown 
us even if we save one out of 20 its worth it 
mrs andrews said she no longer thinks of her child as the 
miracle baby as the infant was called at the hospital but she 
remembered her daughters struggle for life recently when she read 
a journal she began when the girl was nine days old 
it just seems like so long ago said mrs andrews it 
seems like a different lifetime a different baby 
the past year hasnt been easy for the family which is 
struggling to pay about 7000 in hospital bills not covered by 
insurance 
mrs andrews said the family plans a quiet private party for 
christy on friday at their home in tabernacle 25 miles southeast 
of camden which is across the delaware river from philadelphia 
shes not like your typical 1yearold who can sit there and 
open gifts said mrs andrews who also has a 9yearold 
daughter michelle maybe well save that for her second 
birthday 
christy suffered a urinary tract infection during the summer 
but otherwise has been relatively healthy since her release from 
the hospital medical checkups have been scaled back from once a 
week to once a month 
she is beginning to roll over on her stomach and can sit up with 
a boost her mother said her social skills are equivalent to an 
8or 9monthold baby and her speech and physical development are 
on the level of a 6monthold 
the baby has about an 80 percent chance of living a normal life 
but will require constant medical attention in her early years 
said fernandez dsouza 
because of lung damage christy will have to breathe from a 
oxygen tank for several more months and will continue to be fed 
intravenously until she gains more weight 
mrs andrews gives the child chest therapy four times a day to 
help her breathe and a nurse helps care for christy eight hours 
each week a therapist will continue to visit once a week until the 
child is 3 years old to monitor her speech hearing and motor 
development 
its taken her a long time to catch up mrs andrews said 
shes pretty behind where she should be

damaged by dehydration that he might need dialysis the rest of his 
life appeared to be resuming normal function huen said 
when a person is severely dehydrated the kidneys shut down to 
preserve the fluids in the body huen said however doctors had 
feared that byproducts of muscle damage could have poisoned the 
kidneys 
in his case he has responded so quickly we feel it was just 
severe dehydration huen said 
doctors felt helms recovery was coming along so well that they 
began feeding him through a tube inserted in his stomach and gave 
him a pencil and a tablet of paper to communicate 
helm 5foot11 and 230 pounds cant talk because a respirator 
tube has been run down his throat 
however the broken ribs and chest wall separation appear to be 
mending and doctors have been lowering the amount of oxygen 
delivered through the respirator huen said 
mrs helm said she has read newspaper accounts of the earthquake 
to him and he understands although he drifts in and out of 
consciousness he communicates by nodding blinking squeezing her 
hand she said 
the night before the earthquake helm apparently slept as he 
usually did in his rusty yellow chevrolet panel truck parked at 
the docks 
on the left side of the truck helm had painted in orange the 
words weaverville flash referring to the little logging town 
250 miles away in the trinity mountains of northern california 
where he drove every weekend to be with his children 
on the right side he painted a cartoon rabbit and desireess 
delight after his 12yearold daughter 
he always calls me his rabbit desiree said at the news 
conference i love him 
inside the van helm had a mattress a snoopy sleeping bag two 
alarm clocks some clothes and a panel of photographs of his 
children including one of a small child in a huge pair of football 
shoulderpads 
before work helm usually drove to a ymca to wash up then 
arrived at his job a little before 8 am said ralph bucher chief 
clerk at the terminal 
he was a weaverville local said bucher he has tried 
living down in this area he had several business enterprises 
around alameda i believe he had a sandwich shop and a rentawreck 
type auto rental which kind of went sour 
helm worked out of a small cubicle paneled in tan t111 siding 
where he checked through the big trucks hauling shipping containers 
bound for overseas 
inside the cubicle there is nothing to identify helm just a 
computer terminal a digital readout for the truck scale outside 
and a printer for papers directing truckdrivers with their loads 
during his coffee break helm routinely joined the other ships 
clerks at a round table in the back of a mobile office to play 
tonk the card game of the docks at a quarter a hand 
at lunchtime none of the other clerks knew where helm went but 
he might have taken a walk because he was trying to lose weight 
said clerk joe marotto 
some of the ships clerks took off early to watch the world 
series but helm said he was going to emeryville to the oaks club 
to play poker ships clerk roger phelps said 
maybe he felt lucky because that day hed been a winner at 
tonk ships clerk enrique roman said 
bucher said helms car had more than 200000 miles logged from 
the commute to and from weaverville you look at it and think 
that any collision would kill the occupant

senate republican leader bob dole said monday 
that president bush is exercising necessary prudence in vowing to 
keep some chemical arms in us arsenals until all such weapons are 
eliminated worldwide 
but senate majority leader george mitchell in his third 
consecutive speech on the issue said the bushs decision 
represents a major step backward that can only result in 
delay and confusion at talks in geneva aimed at banning chemical 
arms 
dole responding to the criticism by mitchell and other 
democrats said bush only seeks to keep a deterrent a modern and 
credible deterrent until we are certain there is worldwide 
participation in a treaty banning chemical weapons 
it seems to me this is a reasonaable and responsible policy 
the kansas republican said 
mitchell dmaine noted that the us position and that of 
other western powers has been that a global ban on the production 
of chemical weapons would take effect soon after a treaty entered 
into force 
mitchell complained there is evidence contained in published 
reports not denied by the white house that the united states will 
continue to produce modern chemical weapons for eight years or more 
after a treaty goes into effect updating the chemical weapons 
stockpile even as its overall size is reduced 
disputes over bushs policy could cause such delay at the geneva 
talks that the opportunity to achieve progress on a global ban on 
chemical weapons will be lost perhaps forever mitchell asserted 
the efforts of other countries to attain this capability will 
proceed while the arms control process will be stalled as the 
result of american indecision and inconsistency he said 
but dole argued tghat we need some insurance in case we do 
not get worldwide participation keeping our chemical deterrent 
credible will provide us with that insurance 
as much as we may want to see arms control progress in the 
area of chemical weapons and elsewhere the united states needs to 
look for action not words especially when us national security 
is involved dole said 
in an address to the united nations security council last month 
bush announced that as part of a global treaty banning chemical 
weapons the united states would reduce its stockpiles of such 
weapons by 98 peercent over eight years if the soviet union did the 
same 
the president said the united states would eliminate the 
remaining 2 percent at the 10th year but only if all other nations 
had eliminated their chemical weapons capability 
shortly after bushs speech press reports quoted unnamed 
administration officials as saying the united states would produce 
modern bigeye chemical weapons throughout the reduction period to 
make sure the reduced stocks of such arms are as potent as possible 
mitchell referred to these reports and asked how can the 
united states possibly expect other countries to observe a ban on 
production if we reserve to ourselves the right to ignore a ban 
mitchell said other nations would insist on such production 
rights for themselves 
this means that verifying a chemical weapons ban hard enough 
under the best of conditions will become enormously more 
difficult he said

the senate opens debate tuesday on a 
bill to legalize abortion in a showdown that has been put off for 
16 years by legislative maneuvers in this predominantly roman 
catholic country 
the issue has divided the centerleft government of prime 
minister wilfried martens 
it the senate approves the bill and a vote could be held by 
friday the measure then goes to the more powerful chamber of 
deputies 
the measure would allow abortions during the first 12 weeks of 
pregnancy for women in distress 
abortions have been illegal in belgium for more than 100 years 
but in 1973 proabortion lawmakers sought to introduce legislation 
changing the law catholic legislators successfully blocked all 
efforts to bring the issue before parliament until this year 
the senates justice and public health committees voted to 
change the law that bans abortions and provides for a penalty of up 
to five years jail for women who have an abortion and those who 
perform it 
in the committees the socialists voted for legalizing abortion 
while christian democrats voted against 
the dispute has divided martens fiveparty coalition of 
socialists and christian democrats each split into dutch and 
frenchspeaking factions and the flemish peoples union 
the greatest opposition comes from martens dutchspeaking 
christian democrats belgiums largest single political force 
many political observers believe the christian democrats are 
willing to risk the fate of martens government on the outcome 
opinion polls have shown a majaority of belgians favor 
legalizing abortions 
although the procedure is banned enforcement of the law has 
been spotty and the courts have been lenient to those convicted of 
violating the measure 
it is estimated that 16000 women have abortions in belgium each 
year and many more go to neighboring holland where abortions are 
legal 
on the eve of the parliamentary debate there were indications 
some christian democrat legislators would approve a change that 
would approve abortions if granted by a special panel that would 
hold hearings with the women seeking abortions 
proabortion forces reject such a compromise saying the 
decision must be made only by the woman and her doctor

the kremlin admitted monday the krasnoyarsk radar 
station violates the sovietus abm treaty and offered to 
negotiate an end to the nato and warsaw pact military alliances 
in a major foreign policy speech in the soviet legislature 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze also criticized the 
decision by leonid i brezhnev in 1979 to send soviet soldiers into 
afghanistan he said it involved gross violations of our own 
laws intraparty and civil norms and ethics 
a decision that had very serious consequences for our country 
was made behind the back of the party and the people he said 
about the military alliances shevardnadze said we are 
prepared to head toward the dissolution of the militarypolitical 
blocs in europe on a mutual basis but added that all our 
obligations remain in force despite recent changes in eastern 
europe 
poland and hungary have moved away from oneparty communist rule 
in recent months and the soviet union has made no move to stop 
them shevardnadze said the soviet union would observe strict 
principles of nonintervention and absolute freedom of choice 
he said the soviet union is prepared to liquidate all foreign 
bases and withdraw its military forces to its own territory by the 
year 2000 what the conditions for such a withdrawal would be was 
not clear 
shevardnadze said the radar station in siberia would be 
dismantled he said it took mikhail s gorbachevs government four 
years to determine that its location violated the 1972 treaty as 
western arms experts contended 
as the soviet union tried to move forward on arms treaties based 
on the abm pact there stood the station the size of an egyptian 
pyramid representing to put it bluntly a violation of the abm 
treaty shevardnadze declared 
shevardnadze said that the decision to dismantle the giant 
phasedarray radar at krasnoyarsk was criticized within the country 
as going against the soviet unions interest 
in fact he said we are saving the abm treaty and opening the 
way to the conclusion of a treaty on strategic weapons and were 
gaining the legal and moral right to demand clarity on the question 
of american installations in greenland and england which were 
modernized as we understand in violation of the treaty 
the united states has claimed the treaty does not apply to its 
modernization of the stations in thule greenland and fylingdales 
moor england because they were in place before the abm accord was 
signed 
in washington the bush administration welcomed shevardnadzes 
admission 
it reflects a different kind of mindset said a us 
official its encouraging it builds a degree of confidence it 
builds a degree of trust he told reporters at a briefing on an 
arms control speech secretary of state james a baker iii was 
making in san francisco ground rules of the briefing prevent use 
of the officials name 
after shevardnadze and baker met last month in jackson hole 
wyo they said in a joint statement the soviet union stated 
that guided by its longstanding goal of strengthening the abm 
treaty regime it had decided to completely dismantle the 
krasnoyarsk radar station the us side expressed satisfaction 
with this announcement 
shevardnadze in a news conference at jackson hole told 
reporters we have decided to fully dismantle that facility and 
we expect that the us side too will act in order to remove our 
concern with respect to its radars in greenland and great britain 
the soviet government has offered repeatedly to turn over the 
siberian radar to a civilian agency and partially dismantle it but 
always stopped short of admitting the station violated provisions 
of the abm treaty 
the united states rejected as unsatisfactory any plan short of 
complete dismantling of the station saying the abm treaty 
prohibited the deployment of large radar stations capable of giving 
early warnings of missile attacks anywhere except on the periphery 
of the us or soviet territory 
the krasnoyarsk station is deep within soviet siberia several 
hundred miles north of the chinese border 
the dispute was among the differences that soured ussoviet 
arms control talks for years 
it was not the first time highplaced soviets have disclosed 
that the decision to intervene in afghanistan was made by a small 
circle around the late soviet leader leonid i brezhnev but it had 
not previously been characterized by a government spokesman as an 
outright violation of law 
shevardnadze noted that for the first time in many years not 
a single soviet soldier is participating nor im sure will 
participate in military actions anywhere in the world 
he said the soviet union is prepared to liquidate all its 
foreign bases and withdraw its military forces to within its own 
territory by the year 2000 it was not clear what the condition 
would be for such a withdrawal

president bush seeking to smooth relations 
with congress said monday he has no differences at all with 
the chairman of the senate intelligence committee on the ground 
rules for covert actions overseas 
bush grew testy when questioned by reporters about the issue at 
the end of a 3hour golf outing at andrews air force base in 
suburban maryland 
bush complained to senate republican leaders in private last 
week about congressional restrictions on actions by us agents 
overseas 
the president reportedly griped that the restrictions if 
narrowly interpreted could have required american officials to 
warn panamanian gen manuel antonio noriega in advance of any 
impending coup that could endanger his life 
sen david l boren dokla the chairman of the intelligence 
panel responded angrily sunday night saying the american people 
are being deliberately misled by selective leaks of highly 
classified correspondence 
but bush told reporters i have no differences at all with mr 
boren on all of this and he knows it and we know it and thats a 
good thing for the whole situation 
asked specifically about borens complaint about leaks bush 
replied hes in good shape he and i are thinking together on 
these things 
bush brushed aside another question about rewriting the 
intelligence guidelines 
let me tell you something said the president who was once 
director of the central intelligence agency i dont discuss 
intelligence matters its just not intelligence if you do that 
thats not the way you treat it 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said earlier that bush 
and boren had discussed the whole question of micromanagement and 
of intelligence activities in these areas the president feels that 
any differences they may have had have been ironed out 
fitzwater said bush was working with boren and the committee on 
possible changes but added there will be no change in the ban 
on assassinations bar none 
a policy imposed by thenpresident gerald ford in 1976 bars 
american agents from taking part in any effort to assassinate 
foreign leaders 
defense secretary dick cheney has complained that intelligence 
committee guidelines inhibited the administrations flexibility in 
responding to events in panama leading up to the failed attempt 
oct 3 to oust noriega who is under federal indictment in florida 
on charges of drug trafficking 
boren said the report of bushs complaints about the policy was 
a selective leak that distorted the situation at the time of 
his panels october 1988 letter to thenpresident ronald reagan 
while not acknowledging details of the policy boren said his 
letter merely restated the committees understanding of cia 
guidelines to carry out a 14yearold ban on us involvement in 
assassinations of foreign leaders 
our letter stated their policy as it had been told to us 
said a committee source 
boren in a statement said the plain truth is there are 
ambiguities in the record on both the congressional and executive 
side

the trial of a police officer who killed a black 
motorcyclist sparking three days of racial violence opened monday 
with the defense demanding the case be moved as demonstrators 
clashed outside 
colombianborn miami officer william lozano faces two 
manslaughter counts in the jan 16 shooting of the motorcylist 
clement lloyd 23 as he was being chased by police and the death 
of his passenger allan blanchard 24 who was fatally injured when 
the motorcycle crashed 
while small groups of black and hispanic demonstrators faced off 
outside the dade county courthouse attorneys and spectators inside 
were put through two sets of metal detectors and had bags and 
briefcases searched 
attorneys spent monday selecting potential jurors they finished 
midway through the initial screening process and expected to 
continue jury selection all day tuesday 
earlier defense attorney roy black listed for dade circuit 
judge joseph farina the extraordinary measures adopted by local 
police worried about a violent reaction to the trial police have 
bought 700 gas masks and made arrangements for use of two armored 
personnel carriers 
i cant remember any trial in which it was necessary to buy 
armored personnel carriers to prepare for it black said arguing 
the trial must be moved we cant prevent a riot but we can 
ensure jurors are not worried about it 
four times this decade police slayings of black men or 
subsequent innocent verdicts in their trials have touched off 
racial violence in miami as a result black said jurors in miami 
might be afraid to acquit lozano and touch off new rioting 
potential jurors had to pass by two small groups of 
demonstrators on the courthouse steps monday with blacks carrying 
signs such as stop killing black men while hispanics some of 
them members of lozanos family waved colombias flag one man 
billy hardemon was arrested when he tried to force his way past 
police guarding the courthouse doorway 
john hogan lead prosecutor for the state said he was not 
concerned about the tension affecting jurors 
the test is not whether they have heard of the case the test 
is whether or not they can base a decision on the evidence in 
court hogan told the judge weve been able to get juries in 
other high publicity cases here in dade county 
attorneys estimated it could take weeks of addressing pretrial 
motions before the actual trial testimony begins 
outside the courtroom patricia lloyd sister of the slain 
motorcyclist called for the black community not to prjudge the 
trial 
stay calm and let the trial go on ms lloyd said i hope 
he gets convicted 
lozanos brother jairo lozano also a miami policeman said the 
demonstrations and miamis history make it impossible to find an 
impartial jury 
he will not get a fair trial here in miami jairo lozano 
said but if they move the trial out of dade county justice will 
be done because what he did was in selfdefense 
lozano said he fired at lloyd because the speeding motorcycle 
headed straight for him lloyd died instantly of a bullet to the 
head while blanchard died of head injuries suffered in the crash 
the slaying touched off burning and looting in predominantly 
black neighborhoods one person was killed 11 were wounded by 
gunfire and 13 structures burned down only days before the miami 
area was host to the super bowl 
tensions especially between blacks and hispanics remained high 
after the violence

prime minister yitzhak shamir tried to play 
down tensions with the bush administration monday after his aides 
reportedly said he may cancel a visit to washington over 
differences on how to achieve peace 
maariv a leading israeli daily newspaper quoted the aides as 
saying shamir may cancel his midnovember trip to washington if the 
divisions persist one unidentified source in shamirs office was 
quoted as saying we fear that differences of opinion between the 
prime minister and president bush if expressed facetoface will 
cause an explosion 
however shamir said later on israel army radio i can only 
state there are some disagreements they are not very sharp and im 
convinced we can certainly overcome them 
speaking on israel television shamir denied the visit was in 
doubt were not running away from our views and the need to 
express them he said the exact dates of the trip have not been 
announced 
in another development a senior aide to finance minister shimon 
peres said that leaders planned visit to the soviet union was in 
doubt he indicated kremlin officials have not responded to 
requests for toplevel meetings 
in more unrest in the occupied territories monday israeli 
troops shot and killed mohammed abu libde 19 and wounded at least 
six other people arab reports said 
the army confirmed the youth was killed during a military 
operation at the west bank refugee camp of tulkarem 
the death brought to 601 the number of palestinians killed by 
israeli gunfire in the 22monthold uprising against israeli 
occupation forty israelis have been killed in the violence 
shamir adviser avi pazner confirmed in a telephone interview 
that us and israeli officials were divided over how to carry out 
israels proposal for elections in the occupied lands 
we hope this will all be straightened out before the meeting 
with bush pazner said 
israels plan calls for elections in the west bank and gaza 
strip to choose palestinian representatives for negotiations on 
limited selfrule for the territories the status of the occupied 
lands would be decided later 
the usisraeli differences stem from us efforts to arrange 
an initial meeting with palestinians to revive the stalled plan 
shamir told the television the key points in dispute were 
israels insistance that no members of the palestine liberation 
organizations sit on a palestinian delegation to talks and that 
only matters related to elections be discussed 
on monday defense minister yitzhak rabin of the leftofcenter 
labor party opened a fresh israeli debate about the plan of 
secretary of state james a baker iii saying israel was 
considering it despite shamirs objections 
speaking to high school students in suburban tel aviv he said 
bakers proposals have not been rejected or accepted and should 
be considered by the cabinet 
shamir also came under fire monday from the other side of the 
political spectrum ariel sharon shamirs rival in the hardline 
likud bloc said shamir had told americans one thing and israelis 
something different 
this has been a dangerous road from the beginning he said 
theres no place for a conflict with the united states and i 
think there would have been no conflict if we spoke clearly 
the peres aide meanwhile said peres would make a final 
decision in midnovember about whether to make his trip to moscow 
the aide nimrod novick returned to israel this week after trying 
to work out details of the trip which has not yet been scheduled 
peres has been invited to moscow by the nongovernmental soviet 
peace committee however the minister who also serves as labor 
party leader is reportedly seeking a meeting with president 
mikhail s gorbachev or foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
peres is currently in a hospital recovering from a urinary 
infection

a sexoriented game is in the computer that 
monitors city ambulances but an official on monday dismissed 
speculation that the game could distract dispatchers or lead to 
computer problems 
john petrofsky a computer consultant for the emergency medical 
services said in mondays editions of the new york post that the 
game foreplay had been in the ems system since september 1988 
the program could slow the computer or stop it for 30 minutes 
petrofsky said it also might carry a computer virus that could 
shut down the computer for two days he said 
ems spokeswoman lynn schulman said the inspector general of the 
health and hospitals corp had confirmed that the game was in the 
system but she said it had no effect on response time which has 
been reduced in recent months 
it was not clear who entered the game into the system or 
whether dispatchers or those who receive emergency calls even had 
access to it she said investigators were searching the master 
computer monday she said 
as soon as we find anything inappropriate like this game or 
anything else it will be taken out of the computer she said 
when we find whos responsible theyll be dealt with 
appropriately 
petrofsky told the post at least 35 employees could gain access 
to the game at one time but the story did not say which employees 
to make the implication that dispatchers and call receivers 
dont do their work is ludicrous and unfair to them schulman 
said 
these are very hardworking and dedicated individuals who are 
very insulted that someone would make allegations that they were 
playing games when theyre supposed to be dispatching ambulances 
the game involves the seduction of a woman with players 
choosing various tactics to gain arousal points the post said 
the wrong move can get a player kicked out of the womans apartment 
petrofsky told the post he was fired last week after warning 
superiors over the past eight months of threats posed by the game 
schulman declined to comment on his dismissal except to say 
there were many protections for such whistleblowers and that ems 
encourages him to use the number of appeal procedures available 
petrofsky said he told his boss norman hunter about the game 
on march 23 but hunter told the post he did not remember 
discussing such a game hunter said he did not know why petrofsky 
was fired and said to ask ems deputy executive director joanne 
margusee who is on vacation 
petrofsky produced records that showed the game was entered into 
the system on sept 19 1988 and revised twice since then

radar station 
the power of perestroika does not in itself insure us against 
mistakes its important not to hide them to admit them and 
correct them 
in this respect the krasnoyarsk radar installation issue is 
very significant it took us four years to get to the bottom of it 
we were charged with violation of the abm treaty because of the 
station it took the government quite a while to learn all the 
truth of the project finally we saw it clearly the station had 
been built on the wrong site not where it should have been 
all these years we have been working hard to keep up the abm 
treaty as a foundation for strategic stability we have been 
looking for options and having very complicated debates on the 
interpretation of each article of the treaty and its supplements 
contents 
and all the while there stood the station the size of an 
egyptian pyramid representing to put it bluntly a violation of 
the abm treaty 
at last we resolved this issue and announced we would dismantle 
the station this has brought some discontent in the country as if 
we were foregoing our own interests 
in fact we are saving the abm treaty and opening the way to the 
conclusion of the treaty on strategic weapons and were gaining 
the legal and moral right to demand clarity on the question of 
american installations in greenland and england which were 
modernized we understand in violation of the treaty

court that is scheduled to start at 2 pm he faces 120 years in 
prison and a fine of more than 52 million 
prosecutors filed the memorandum a day earlier with us 
district court judge robert potter whose penchant for stiff 
penalties has earned him the nickname maximum bob 
it appears unlikely the lifetime partners will recoup their 
losses through the bankruptcy proceeding the memo said as a 
result the government urges that restitution be ordered by the 
court 
a letter from lawyers representing the partners was attached to 
the memo and said unsettled claims made on behalf of various 
partners would total between 90 million and 100 million 
in the sentencing memo justice department fraud specialist 
deborah smith and assistant us attorney jerry miller asked potter 
that bakker be fined the maximum amount which totals 523 
million if restitution wasnt ordered 
bakker couldnt be reached for comment his attorney harold 
bender said the defrocked assemblies of god minister was driving 
from his orlando fla home to charlotte 
bender attached character references from bakker supporters to 
his threepage sentencing recommendation and urged the judge to 
consider alternatives to prison 
bender asked the court to consider reasonable alternatives and 
allow this defendant the benefit of the courts compassion and 
mercy 
the lawyer also said former ptl executive vice president richard 
dortch who was indicted with bakker received an eight year prison 
sentence after pleading guilty 
it would appear the only difference between this defendant and 
the codefendant was that this defendant chose to exercise his 
constitutional right of trial by jury bender said 
bender had no comment on the governments sentencing 
recommendation and said he planned to meet monday night with bakker

radar station 
the power of perestroika does not in itself insure us against 
mistakes its important not to hide them to admit them and 
correct them 
in this respect the krasnoyarsk radar installation issue is 
very significant it took us four years to get to the bottom of it 
we were charged with violation of the abm treaty because of the 
station it took the government quite a while to learn all the 
truth of the project finally we saw it clearly the station had 
been built on the wrong site not where it should have been 
all these years we have been working hard to keep up the abm 
treaty as a foundation for strategic stability we have been 
looking for options and having very complicated debates on the 
interpretation of each article of the treaty and its supplements 
contents 
and all the while there stood the station the size of an 
egyptian pyramid representing to put it bluntly a violation of 
the abm treaty 
at last we resolved this issue and announced we would dismantle 
the station this has brought some discontent in the country as if 
we were foregoing our own interests 
in fact we are saving the abm treaty and opening the way to the 
conclusion of the treaty on strategic weapons and were gaining 
the legal and moral right to demand clarity on the question of 
american installations in greenland and england which were 
modernized we understand in violation of the treaty

us ambassador thomas r pickering 
suggested monday that nicaraguas ruling sandinistas are rigging 
the campaign for the feb 25 general elections 
during debate in the general assembly pickering said the 
sandinista government views democratic reform as little more than 
another obstacle to be overcome in continuing to violate 
international hemispheric and regional commitments 
his allegations disputed a report by un election monitors sent 
to nicaragua 
the report released last week said the monitors found 
nicaraguas supreme election council gave no undue benefits to 
the sandinistas and there is appreciable concern on the part of 
the members of the council to ensure the broadest possible 
participation by political groups and citizens the un 
monitoring mission is led by former us attorney general elliott 
richardson 
pickering told the assembly we remain concerned over actions 
by the nicaraguan government to limit the access by the nicaraguan 
opposition parties to the media and to limit the oppositions 
ability to campaign to a broad public 
he said washington also is concerned by the reported presence 
of armed soldiers at nicaraguan voter registration centers 
the un report noted opposition parties receive free time on 
nicaraguas channel 2 which reaches only the pacific coast and 
interior while the sandinistas have sole use of the more powerful 
channel 6 but the report added the use of radio and television 
for political propaganda began too recently for any indepth 
discussion of the question to be possible at this stage the 
report covered the period from july 5 to sept 30 
voter registration for the feb 25 elections was held on the 
first four sundays in october the supreme electoral council said 
that on the first three sundays 1336342 citizens had registered 
out of an estimated 1970486 eligible voters 
the general assembly adopted by consensus a resolution praising 
progress toward peaceful resolutions of the conflicts in central 
america following agreements by five central american presidents at 
a conference in august 
pickering however accused cuba and nicaragua of undermining 
the peace process by shipping weapons to the leftist rebels 
fighting the usbacked government in el salvador 
there is no doubt that cuba and nicaragua regularly 
systematically and continually aid arm and train the salvadoran 
guerrillas he said 
in another development nicaraguan ambassador alejandro serrano 
caldera said his government might bar nicaraguan rebels known as 
contras from returning to the country after a dec 5 deadline 
the august agreement known as the tela accord involves among 
other issues the disarming and disbanding of the contras by dec 5 
many of the contras are in bases across the border in honduras 
serrano caldera speaking with reporters outside the general 
assembly said noncompliance with the agreement would mean 
nicaragua could adopt the position that it is not bound by the 
agreement to receive the contras 
i would emphasize that the tela accord must be totally 
complied with he said 
the united states has said the tela accord requires only the 
voluntary disbanding of the estimated 11000 contras in honduras 
and many of the rebels do not want to return to their homeland 
until democratic elections have been held 
free and democratic elections in nicarauga are a provision of 
the tela accord

commuters tried many unfamiliar routes to their 
jobs in san francisco monday associated press reporter rich 
cartiere made his way by ferry and filed this account 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
boarding one of the first 
ferryboats pressed into emergency service monday to carry commuters 
across san francisco bay i expected a romantic ride through the 
fog reality brought nausea 
the worst storm of the season struck just an hour before tens of 
thousands of residents in alameda and contra costa counties east of 
san francisco began the trek to work 
this 127foot ocean vessel one of 14 being run on routes unused 
by ferries for decades met blustery winds giant swells that 
crashed across the bow and waves that sent it constantly lurching 
from side to side the song of the journey should be i left my 
stomach on san francisco bay 
the 55minute voyage made necessary because of the collapse of 
a 50foot section of the vital san franciscooakland bay bridge 
during last tuesdays quake was twice what was expected 
the tripledeck monohull pulled away from the dock 40 minutes 
late because of weather worries and a low passenger count the 
captain announced some boats might be turned back a big groan 
i arrived dockside before dawn naively thinking i could relive 
idyllic bay crossings created by writers like jack london and in 
such classic movies as humphrey bogarts dark passage 
i wasnt alone 
ive just been through hell but heck i have to admit i made 
it through it it can only get better this cant get much worse 
said an ashenfaced john trowbridge 27 of alameda who came onto 
the deck to alleviate sea sickness 
i moved up to the bow where a giant swell drenched me since i 
was downwind i figured it would be best to remain there in case i 
lost my breakfast 
the ferry with a capacity of 700 people and carrying 338 was 
supposed to dock at the ferry building in san francisco but waves 
craching there forced the boats to divert to fishermans wharf 
altogether my commute from hearth to work station took 3 
hours i used to do it in 45 minutes at the wharf i tried to 
catch a cable car into downtown only to find it shut down i 
walked another seven blocks in the drenching rain and caught a city 
bus to work 
roughing it across the bay didnt dampen everybodys spirits 
considering everything my commute has really gone smooth 
said maggie faulkner 46 of oakland 
karen meyer 42 of oakland used to work on long island ny 
ferries and was unflappable 
everybodys just going to have to go into slow motion she 
said that includes all the bosses 
elena pierini 44 of oakland recalled taking ferries to 
berkeley as a child she relived those memories monday morning 
this makes up for all the bad things that came out of the 
earthquake said the san francisco general hospital research 
nurse 
the weather was trying for dick simpson vice president of 
marketing for crowley maritime which operated the ferries he rode 
the catalina empress which normally operates between long beach 
and catalina island in southern california 
mother nature is testing our mental state normally this bay 
is as smooth as glass at this time said simpson about 3000 
people used the ferries monday morning crowley said 
ferryboat service to the east bay which began in 1863 grew to 
include hundreds of boats at its height in the early 1930s it was 
discontinued shortly after the bay bridge opened in 1937

lebanese christians were split monday 
over gen michel aouns rejection of a plan to end the civil war 
and aoun put his men on alert in case of renewed fighting with 
syrian troops and their moslem allies 
amal and hezbollah the two main militias of the 12 million 
shiite moslems and druse leader walid jumblatt also rejected the 
accord it was approved sunday by lebanese christian and moslem 
legislators after three weeks of negotiations in taif saudi 
arabia jumblatt is syrias main lebanese ally 
an aide to aoun said the general put christian army units which 
number about 20000 men on alert to cope with all 
eventualities 
leave was canceled and troops were ordered to stay in barracks 
he said speaking privately but added were not going to war 
its a defensive measure 
hundreds of people were killed and thousands wounded nearly all 
of them civilians before a truce last month in an artillery war 
that began march 8 between aouns forces and a moslem alliance led 
by syrian troops 
syria has 40000 soldiers in lebanon under an arab league 
peacekeeping mandate issued in 1976 a year after the sectarian 
civil war began aoun calls the syrians an occupation army and has 
declared a war of liberation to drive them out 
in washington state department spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler 
said the united states warmly welcomes the peace plan which 
she said provided a unique chance to end a war that has killed 
at least 150000 lebanese 
the challenge now is for all concerned parties to seize this 
extraordinary opportunity to consolidate and implement what has 
been achieved she said 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said president bush 
congratulates the lebanese deputies for their courage and 
statesmanship which have yielded an extraordinary opportunity to 
bring lasting peace in lebanon 
aoun announced his rejection sunday night and criticized george 
saadeh a legislator who leads the lebanese front a coalition of 
rightwing christian political parties 
the kuwaiti daily alwatan on monday quoted aoun as saying i 
say to george saadeh dont sign and return home if he signs his 
signature commits him personally let him come and impose by force 
what he agreed to if he can overpower me and dismiss me 
the lebanese legislators went monday from taif to the saudi city 
of jiddah for a closing session scheduled for tuesday 
in jiddah 24 christian legislators led by saadeh met to discuss 
aouns rejection and then issued a statement saying its a crime 
to let this opportunity slip away an opportunity which might not 
be repeated 
it was a choice between a continuation of the destructive war 
and peace it was a wise choice if compared with negative 
rejections 
proiranian hezbollah issued a statement declaring any 
solution from taif does not concern us the only system that 
safeguards justice and equality is islam 
jumblatt in his rejection called the accord silly and 
sectarian he said it obstructs the construction of a new 
democratic and modern lebanon 
about 5000 aoun supporters demonstrated monday outside his 
residence the bombravaged presidential palace in baabda a 
christian suburb 
withdrawing confidence from those who have gone to another 
land which is not ours is a must aoun told the crowd 
the deputies who met in taif must understand that their role 
is over and that now it is your turn yours alone he said 
aoun declared what happened in taif is a mistake that should 
be corrected this is the day of option you have to choose between 
free existence or capitulation and humiliation 
sources close to aoun who heads a christian military cabinet in 
lebanons splintered government said he feels he has the 
constitutional power to disband parliament and declare martial law 
moslems support the cabinet of acting prime minister salim hoss 
a sunni moslem 
hoss who supported the taif peace plan said the only 
alternative we envisage to the accord is suicide no one has the 
right to take a decision to commit suicide on behalf of the people 
and the nation this could be the last chance to lead the lebanese 
out of the sea of fury to the shore of peace 
aouns main objection to the peace accord is its lack of a 
timetable for syrian withdrawal it provides for the syrians who 
control more than 70 percent of lebanese territory to move into 
the eastern bekaa valley in a twoyear phased pullback from beirut 
and its environs 
sixtythree legislators began meeting in taif on sept 30 
choosing a site outside lebanon to avoid pressure from the various 
lebanese factions 
fiftynine deputies voted for the draft sunday two abstained 
one was opposed and one was missing because of illness 
under the plan parliament would be expanded from 99 seats to 
108 equally divided between moslems and christians 
christians have controlled the government judiciary and army 
since independence from france in 1943 when they were the 
majority moslems have become the majority since and demand more 
power

new jerseys most senior supreme court 
justice pleaded guilty to drunken driving charges monday and 
promised not to participate in any drunken driving decisions for at 
least a year 
my shame and embarassment are beyond my ability to express 
supreme court justice robert clifford 64 of chester said in a 
statement following his plea and sentencing in a courtroom a block 
from his own chambers 
superior court judge samuel lenox suspended cliffords license 
for a year after the justice pleaded guilty to driving while 
intoxicated and refusing to submit to a breathalyzer test 
earlier monday clifford followed court custom and excused 
himself from oral arguments in a case questioning the legality of 
the breathalyzer test which police use to determine the amount of 
alcohol in the blood 
clifford who has served on new jerseys sevenmember high court 
longer than any other justice was arrested in princeton early oct 
12 after an officer saw him crossing the highway center line and 
driving 46 mph in a 35mph zone clifford who was returning from a 
dinner refused to take the test 
lenox also fined clifford 500 plus court costs and ordered him 
to pay a 100 surcharge to a rehabilitation fund for alcoholics 
clifford will also have to pay a 3000 auto insurance surcharge 
over the next three years 
clifford who is known for his wit and penetrating questions 
during oral arguments before the high court displayed little 
emotion at his own hearing 
asked by lenox whether he had driven under the influence and 
refused to take the breathalyzer test clifford replied yes 
sir 
in his statement the justice said he would not participate in 
any drunken driving case for at least the year of his license 
suspension 
i have concluded that the best way to prevent any repetition 
of drinking and driving is to avoid drinking clifford said 
that is my intention and i will not hesitate to draw on whatever 
support is necessary to help me fulfill it 
clifford and his attorney bernard conway refused to make any 
further comments 
the office later issued a statement saying cliffords case would 
be referred to the courts advisory committee on judicial conduct 
which could recommend disciplinary measures 
clifford said his conduct let down former govs william cahill 
who appointed him to the high court in 1973 and brendan byrne who 
reappointed him in 1980 
most importantly i did not fulfill the legitimate 
expectations of the people of new jersey who are entitled to 
nothing short of irreproachable conduct from members of the 
judiciary he said to all of them i apologize

a house committee on monday approved a 285 
billion aid package for the san francisco earthquake more than the 
white house supported but 1 billion less than the amount pushed by 
the california congressional delegation 
the plan was approved by voice vote in the house appropriations 
committee after the panel rejected 267 the state delegations 
request for 38 billion committee chairman jamie l whitten 
dmiss said more money could come later but he didnt want to 
send too much too soon with too few controls 
my whole pitch is to do something now straighten it out 
later and dont waste any money in the meantime whitten said 
rep silvio conte rmass the senior republican on the 
committee said the bush administration could accept whittens 
proposal the white house had proposed earmarking less than 25 
billion with nearly 1 billion of that coming from existing 
federal accounts 
full house action was expected on tuesday as the aid was 
attached to a stopgap spending bill which must be sent to the 
president by wednesday to avert a government shutdown on thursday 
rep vic fazio dcalif who led his states effort in the 
committee said the 285 billion does not of course meet all 
our needs he said he was also concerned that the committee 
refused to waive requirements for local matching of some of the 
federal highway aid 
the committee votes came during a somewhat testy session during 
which lawmakers from other states questioned why californias aid 
package should be so big 
rep bob livingston rla proposed and then withdrew an 
amendment which would have allocated 5 billion for his home state 
to compensate for the hurricane damage it has suffered in 
hurricanes since the turn of the century 
rep ralph regula rohio said he was troubled by the lack of 
accountability in the california plan congress should look at 
it a lot more carefully with hearings he suggested 
we are the golden state and i think there is a certain amount 
of jealousy fazio said afterward 
the committee approved 11 billion for the federal emergency 
management agencys efforts to repair the devastation and 1 
billion for the federal highway administrations emergency fund 
most of the fatalities and the worst damage from the quake was 
related to highway structures 
in addition 500 million would be given to the small business 
administration for emergency loans and 250 million for president 
bush to spend at his discretion on other operations 
the california delegation congress largest at 47 members had 
wanted 1 billion for highway repair 11 billion for fema 12 
billion for sba disaster loans and 100 million for loans to 
lowincome people the president would have been given a 400 
million discretionary fund 
the white house was proposing a more modest 25 billion 
package of which only 15 billion would be spending beyond whats 
already available in the federal budget 
the white house proposed no new sba spending authority and no 
discretionary fund for the president if proposed only 600 million 
for highway repair 500 million in additional spending with 
california using local money and insurance when appropriate to 
pay for part of the roadway costs instead of having the federal 
government covering virtually the entire tab 
the californians said their estimates of the damage were now in 
excess of 7 billion fazio told the committee that experts have 
led him to believe it can grow to more than 10 billion 
the state will have to come up with huge sums of money but 
the federal government will have to help he said were not 
going to ask anybody to gild any lilies 
sen alan cranston dcalif told a senate hearing that his 
estimate of the total cost was over 7 billion although he didnt 
expect the federal government to pay that much 
the human suffering and anguish can never be compensated but 
we can attempt to deal to the extent possible with the physical and 
economic losses said cranston the senate majority whip 
congressional discussion barely touched on how to pay for aid to 
california although california officials have been talking about 
raising state taxes both the white house and congress were loath 
to make such a suggestion 
rep david obey dwis tried unsuccessfully in the committee 
to remove a provision in the bill waiving the grammrudman deficit 
reduction law 
with that provision in the bill the cost will be added to the 
federal deficit 
i dont like that approach but ultimately our first priority 
is to help the victims of this kind of disaster said rep leon 
panetta dcalif the chairman of the house budget committee whose 
district south of san francisco suffered heavy damage 
one congressional budget expert said there was no way to rein in 
the federal cost because politicians dont want to be seen as 
scrooges another said members of congress dont want to be seen as 
the skunk at the picnic both spoke on condition that their 
names not be used

charles burns had just moved into an 
apartment friday near the site of the cypress offramp of the nimitz 
freeway which had collapsed only days earlier in a massive 
earthquake 
on monday burns was temporarily homeless because of a decision 
to remove a portion of unstable freeway near his apartment 
burns and more than 100 residents of a west oakland public 
housing project were told to leave their homes sunday afternoon 
after engineers concluded the freeway section near four of the 
projects buildings might collapse 
residents were told to leave their homes immediately and leave 
most belongings behind 
we were all scared burns said we were all wondering 
whats going on now i thought thered been another earthquake 
while some residents were able to find their own temporary 
shelter burns took his bible and some other books to the lowell 
middle school where he joined about 160 other people some of whom 
had been there since last week 
they sat on cots in the school gymnasium eating food provided 
by local agencies and trying to figure out relief forms 
ill be glad when its all straightened out burns said 
one minute youre home and the next minute youre out and you 
dont know why theres confusion and chaos here 
engineers estimate it may take 48 hours to take down the section 
of freeway which imperiled the neighborhood and it may be 24 hours 
more before the residents can return 
we are very aware of the problems people are going through 
said oakland police lt kris wraa but the safety of the citizens 
overpowered the need to let them get their belongings 
the west end of the housing project is within 20 feet of the 
endangered freeway and if it had fallen on its own a tremendous 
amount of damage could be done and people could be hurt said 
caltrans representative kyle nelson 
what caused the most confusion was the short notice given with 
residents first being told they had to begin leaving immediately at 
330 pm sunday rumors bounced from house to house ranging from 
another earthquake to the possibility of a gas leak

the construction of the xingo dam a 
massive public works project of the outgoing administration of 
president jose sarney is being halted because of a cash shortage 
company officials announced monday 
a threecompany consortium in charge of building the dam said 
the federal government was 138 million behind in payments to the 
project 
as a result the consortium must halt construction within 24 
hours and lay off 2050 workers officials said 
weve gone as far as we could but were convinced that were 
never going to see this money said consortium superintendent 
ruiter neto campos at a monday press conference in the northeastern 
city of recife 
however campos said the group will resume work if the 
government pays its debt 
the dam was being built on the sao francisco river in 
northeastern bahia state 
a 110 billion foreign debt coupled with growing internal debt 
has drained federal coffers and stalled numerous public works 
the 5000megawatt xingo dam projected to cost 25 billion is 
considered essential to supplying northeastern brazil with 
electricity by 1994 the dam is about 20 percent complete

hungary declared itself a democracy 
monday 33 years after soviet troops crushed an antistalinist 
uprising and chants of russians go home and communism no 
more rose from a crowd of 100000 
hungarian flags of red white and green waved over the throng 
which overflowed the parliament square people cheered wildly in 
the torchlit plaza when participants in the uprising invoked 
memories of its leaders 
it took 33 years for those behind the thick walls to hear the 
cries for democracy jenoe fonay a prominent activist who was 
earlier involved in the uprising told the rally he was referring 
to the recent official change of heart about the nature of the 
12day revolt that began oct 23 1956 
the soviet blocs bloodiest uprising was called 
counterrevolution until early this year when the official 
description was changed to a popular uprising in one of the 
dramatic moves in hungarys progress toward democracy 
as many as 32000 people were killed in 1956 and about 200000 
fled the country 
gyula obersovszky a writer and editor who was sentenced to 
death but later pardoned said i am keeping my fingers crossed 
for gorbachev the crowd called out gorby gorby 
history has taught us that as long as moscow is not free we 
cannot be free either obersovszky said 
he expressed certainty that the suppression of the revolution 
would not have taken place if mikhail s gorbachev the soviet 
leader who champions reform and president bush had led the 
superpowers in 1956 
a banner proclaiming freedom independence was draped across 
the main entrance of parliament and floodlights bathed the 
structure 
gyoergy krasso a vocal opposition figure jailed for his part in 
the uprising drew one of the strongest ovations when he declared 
weve had enough of russian occupation 
without mentioning names he appealed to east european allies 
who oppose reforms to help us and not make it more difficult 
in washington state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
said declaring itself an independent republic on the 33rd 
anniversary of the popular uprising seems particularly appropriate 
we congratulate the republic of hungary and its people 
hungarian national tv broadcast the entire rally its cameras 
panning frequently from the cheering crowd to the balcony with its 
large photograph of imre nagy who led the 1956 revolt and was 
executed nagys body was exhumed and reburied with honor in june 
some speakers recited patriotic poems including one that began 
the streets of budapest are running with blood 
the evening rally followed a proclamation by acting president 
matyas szueroes formally declaring hungary a democracy after 41 
years of communist rule 
szueroes declared the communist peoples republic of hungary 
dead from the balcony of parliament to the applause of 100000 
people who had filled the square by midday 
as of today our nations name is the republic of 
hungary he said and church bells throughout the country pealed 
at noon 
state tv also broadcast the midday ceremony the first 
commemoration of the uprising ever conducted with official approval 
many people wore arm bands or hair ribbons in the national 
colors or waved large flags with jagged holes in the middle to 
symbolize those of 1956 from which rebels cut the communist emblem 
tears flowed freely as the crowd sang the national anthem on the 
anniversary which parliament declared a day of national 
reconciliation teachers took their entire classes to the square 
few police were visible and none carried firearms or clubs 
hoots and whistles rose when szueroes called for continued 
cooperation with the soviet union the crowd cheered and applauded 
when he urged warmer ties with the united states 
the applause was tumultuous applause when he said the 
republic of hungary has become a state governed by law where the 
values of democracy and democratic socialism are equally 
valid 
smaller rallies were held between the two mass events in the 
square 
opposition leader gyula kiss said at one let us vow to finish 
the revolution they had begun and the crowd of about 10000 
replied we swear we swear 
two weeks ago the ruling communist party dissolved itself in 
favor of a successor socialist party favoring democratic ideals and 
multiparty elections the party issued a statement friday rejecting 
the soviet invasion of 1956

cigarette smokers need more than 1 times as 
much vitamin c a day as nonsmokers the national research council 
said monday in revising its nutrient intake recommendations for the 
first time in nearly a decade 
smoking seems to increase metabolic turnover of the vitamin 
leading to lower concentrations in the blood the nrc said in the 
10th edition of its recommended dietary allowances 
the new guidelines say that nonsmokers need 60 milligrams of 
vitamin c a day and that smokers need at least 100 milligrams the 
recommendation for pregnant women who do not smoke is 70 milligrams 
a day 
rdas are defined as intake levels of essential nutrients that 
are adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of practically all 
healthy persons people with special nutritional needs are not 
covered by the rdas 
the recommended allowances for nutrients are amounts intended to 
be consumed as part of a normal diet the nrc said they are 
neither minimal requirements nor necessarily optimal levels of 
intake 
rdas are used in a number of ways by different groups the 
department of agriculture for instance uses them to evaluate the 
adequacy of the us food supply for establishing standards for 
foodassistance programs and for determining the nutritional status 
of the us popoulation 
most average americans come in contact most often with 
nutritional information as it is listed on cereal boxes such 
figures are derived from the rdas 
the new 285page volume leaves most previous recommendations 
unchanged or modifies them only slightly it does include some 
important revisions 
instead of basing rdas for adults on arbitrary heights and 
weights allowances now are based on actual heights and weights in 
the population 
requirements for folate which is found in liver leafy 
vegetables and some fruit have been reduced from 400 micrograms 
for both men and women to 240 micrograms for men aged 25 to 50 and 
190 micrograms for women of the same ages 
the rda for vitamin b12 an essential nutrient for maintaining 
normal metabolism and function of the bloodforming organs was 
reduced from 3 micrograms for men and women to 2 
the new edition lists recommended dietary allowances for 
protein 11 vitamins and 7 minerals it points out that besides 
known nutrients food contains thousands of other naturally 
occurring substances of certain nutritional value 
a varied diet meeting rdas said the subcommittee of the 
food and nutrition board of the nrc will probably be adequate in 
all other nutrients 
the recommendations are not daily objectives but rather goals 
to be met over time 
in planning meals or food supplies said the nrc it is 
technically difficult and biologically unnecessary to design a 
single days diet that contains all the rdas for all the 
nutrients

an atmospheric phenomenon called a 
rolling wave may have been the cause of the crash of a honduran 
airliner that killed 131 people sources close to the investigation 
said monday 
they said such a wave created by a strong wind blowing over 
mountains could have caused a severe downdraft that forced the 
boeing 727 jet 1800 feet below its assigned altitude and into a 
mountain as it approached tegucigalpas toncontin airport saturday 
a flight attendant and passenger aboard the honduran airline 
tansahsa plane were quoted as saying there had been an explosion 
aboard the craft but the sources speaking on the condition of 
anonymity said the investigation was focusing on an atmospheric 
disturbance as being the cause of the crash 
investigators also were considering the possibility of loss of 
power in an engine as a cause of the sudden descent according to 
the sources 
they said reports of severe atmospheric turbulence before the 
crash would support the theory of a rolling wave downdraft 
such a wave could be created by wind flowing south over the 
cerro de hule that would follow the contour of the land until 
running into other mountains the sources said the wind would then 
be pushed up and over creating a violent downdraft 
the phenomenon is similar to windshear thunderstorms that have 
caused crashes near airports in the united states the sources said 
twelve of the people killed in saturdays crash were us 
citizens there were 15 survivors including the pilot and copilot 
and three american passengers 
investigators including teams from boeing and the us national 
transportation safety board divided into groups to study evidence 
giomar lizzeth nunez a 28yearold flight attendant aboard the 
honduran jet said the pilot announced he was going to descend 
we were two minutes from the airport and i was in my seat with 
the seatbelt fastened 
there was an explosion the emergency door came off toward the 
inside of the plane dragging with it a small storage bin where the 
flight attendants keep our suitcases then there was a strong 
impact 
her account was carried by la tribuna a tegucigalpa newspaper 
ramon sanchez borba 48 a passenger told reporters 
everything was calm all of a sudden i saw fire and there was 
an explosion he is an an honorary paraguayan consul in 
tegucigalpa 
the planes flight recorders were sent to washington to be 
studied said raul bonilla the airlines marketing manager 
the plane crashed into a mountain about 20 miles south of 
tegucigalpa at 750 am as it approached the honduran capital 
after a flight from san jose costa rica via managua nicaragua 
col marco tulio rivera of the honduran civil aeronautics 
authority said the pilot raul argueta reported everything was 
normal in his last communication with the control tower at 745 am 
he said argueta radioed the plane was seven miles from the 
airport at 7500 feet and on target for an approach to the airport 
the pilot flying on instruments into a 50mph wind and cloud 
cover was supposed to descend to 6700 feet at the fivemile mark 
which is 1800feet above the 4900foot cerro de hule rivera said 
what happened in those few seconds is what we have to figure 
out he added he said argueta has not been interviewed because 
of his injuries 
copilot reiniero canales said in an interview with radio 
station hrn there was nothing unusual about the flight until 
suddenly we hit something it was all so fast we didnt have time 
to react 
people fearing relatives were among the victims continued to 
gather at the morgue where specialists were trying to identify the 
bodies morgue chief dennis castro said more than 20 bodies have 
been identified 
a nicaraguan air force plane arrived carrying coffins to take 
back the bodies of 45 nicaraguan victims one of the 67 nicaraguans 
aboard survived 
economy minister reginaldo panting said tansahsa had rented the 
plane for 180000 a month about a year ago from continental 
airlines he said it was valued at 30 million 
in seattle boeing spokesman tom cole said the plane was more 
than 20 years old with 52019 cycles each a takeoff and landing 
through september and about 65500 flight hours he said both 
figures were average for a plane of that age 
cole said the 727200 with the most cycles had 66000 through 
june the number of cycles can indicate the stress a planes 
fuselage has undergone 
boeing has said consistently its aircraft can remain in service 
indefinitely if properly maintained 
maj alejandro arguello nicaraguan director of civil 
aeronautics quoted air controllers as saying the roof of the plane 
tore away before the crash but survivors interviewed did not 
mention that 
a 19yearold aloha airlines 737 that lost 18 feet of its upper 
fuselage over hawaii in april 1988 had 89680 cycles among the 
highest of any 737 in service

diego olivares acting president of the labor federation said 
the walesa visit is intended to promote labor rights and has 
nothing to do with party politics

space shuttle atlantis 
streaked down through the atmosphere and glided safely home monday 
after a fiveday mission that sent the longdelayed galileo 
spacecraft on a 24billionmile journey to jupiter 
atlantis touched down at 932 am in a light breeze cutting 
short its mission by two 90minute orbits to get down before 
predicted high winds came up on rogers dry lake before the 
landing dense fog had shrouded the base 
atlantis congratulations on an outstanding mission said 
capsule communicator ken cameron in houston youve extended the 
shuttles reach to the outer planets 
its nice to be home shuttle commander donald e williams 
replied 
a relatively modest crowd estimated at about 20000 was on hand 
to watch williams pilot michael j mcculley and mission 
specialists shannon w lucid ellen s baker and franklin r 
changdiaz come home 
the vehicle looks amazingly clean we did not see with a 
quick inspection any significant tile damage a little nick here 
and a nick there william lenoir an acting associate 
administrator of nasa said at a postlanding news conference 
after thanking a crowd of several hundred cheering nasa workers 
the astronauts left edwards shortly before 2 pm aboard two 
gulfstream jets bound for their home base in houston 
this is a great beginning for the study of jupiter 
changdiaz said after galileo project manager richard spehalski 
teased the astronauts for nicknaming our lovely spacecraft the 
critter 
the galileo critter is on its way and doing very well 
spehalski said 
the crew and their spouses returned to houston at about 630 
pm cdt and they were greeted by their children and nearly 300 
friends and coworkers 
atlantis was a magnificent ship williams said the 
commander also thanked the workers at mission control who helped 
the crew during their flight 
we had a great time said mrs baker a mission specialist 
who made her first trip into space aboard atlantis im really 
proud to be part of the galileo mission 
after having most of the day off tuesday the astronauts will 
return to the johnson space center on wednesday to begin a series 
of briefings about their flight officials said 
the successful deployment of the nuclearpowered galileo 
accomplished the missions main goal about 6 hours after blastoff 
wednesday from cape canaveral fla 
the 15 billion spacecraft was said to be operating 
flawlessley passing the millionmile mark at a speed of nearly 
9000 mph relative to earth on a looping 6year trip to explore 
jupiter 
problems in the shuttle program including the 1986 challenger 
explosion helped delay the start of galileos trip by seven years 
while a shuttle sent the magellan orbiter toward venus in may and 
will deploy the ulysses spacecraft to orbit the suns poles next 
october scientists plan to use unmanned rockets to launch 
subsequent planetary spacecraft 
were obviously relieved the shuttle gave us a magnificent 
ride said neal ausman galileo mission director for nasas jet 
propulsion laboratory but were also pleased were not going to 
be depending on the space shuttle as the only way into space 
several groups unsuccessfully sought to prevent the shuttle 
launch for fear that an accident could release radioactive fuel 
into the atmosphere over florida a federal judge refused to halt 
the flight 
the crew fired atlantis big braking rockets to drop out of 
orbit and the 97ton winged spaceship made a fiery descent toward 
california crossing the coast at four times the speed of sound 
105000 feet over malibu 
automatic control systems put the hurtling orbiter through 
speedshedding maneuvers rocking the los angeles area with the 
shuttles signature twin sonic booms then williams lightly set 
atlantis on the clay runway where it rolled to a stop on the 
blackdotted centerline 
reflecting jitters from last weeks bay quake the santa monica 
police department got about a dozen calls around 930 am said 
officer kim neal nervous callers thought the resonating boom as 
atlantis descended was an earthquake or gunshots 
the shuttle passed through high winds aloft but surface winds 
were reported at only about 4 mph with gusts at just under 6 mph 
moments before touchdown 
fourteen minutes later controllers told the crew they could 
remove their bulky flight suits an astronaut called back just 
out of curiosity houston whats the temperature outside 
at around 60 degrees the astronauts were comfortable exiting 
the orbiter in their orange flight suits they inspected the belly 
of the shuttle chatting laughing and hugging each other before 
leaving the dry lakebed for debriefing 
unofficial elapsed mission time was 4 days 23 hours and 41 
minutes 
the astronauts had gone to bed early in anticipation of the 
early landing and were awakened by a recording of steve millers 
fly like an eagle beamed up from mission control 
well im not sure were flying like eagles but its been fun 
so far williams remarked 
if winds were too strong the landing could have been postponed 
until tuesday or wednesday the national aeronautics and space 
administration said 
the forecast predicted gusts up to 35 mph in the afternoon 
safety rules forbid landings if headwinds reach 29 mph or 
crosswinds reach 18 mph 
the astronauts also conducted several scientific experiments 
including one that measured the earths protective ozone layer 
two other shuttle experiments involved processing materials and 
growing corn plants the astronauts also photographed lightning 
systems for a weather project and grew ice crystals for a student 
experiment 
time also was spent photographing various parts of the world 
with the imax movie camera the footage will be used for a 
documentary film about earth 
crowds numbering in the hundreds of thousands have sometimes 
greeted shuttle returns officials attributed the small turnout to 
the fact that it was a weekday landing 
there also were rain showers in los angeles 80 miles south of 
edwards and dense early morning fog around the base

freeway survivor buck helm improved monday 
but crews searching the collapsed highway where he was rescued gave 
up hope others would be found alive the death toll from last 
weeks earthquake climbed by three to 62 
bay area commuters after conquering heavy morning traffic and 
rough seas on the first full workday since the quake faced few 
afternoon traffic tangles in congress relief legislation worth 
285 billion moved toward a vote tuesday 
were very certain nobodys up there alive weve searched 
searched researched triplesearched said oakland police lt 
kris wraa referring to the crumpled 1mile stretch of interstate 
880 where huge slabs of concrete teetered in the rain 
asked if officials had given up hope of finding another 
survivor she said thats fair wording 
with rescue efforts suspended crews began dismantling a shaky 
100yard section officials said 
kyle nelson of the california department of transportation 
whose job is to make the structure was safe for rescuers called it 
extremely dangerous given the right conditions of rain and wind 
it could have collapsed he said 
near the freeway authorities monday evacuated additional homes 
after ordering 150 residents of a housing project to leave sunday 
because of fears that more of the highway could fall thousands 
have been left homeless by the quake 
we were all scared said charles burns who carried a bible 
and other books to a middle school where evacuees were being 
sheltered 
there was good news however for helm he was no longer in 
pain his kidney function continued to improve and his condition 
was upgraded from critical to very serious dr floyd huen said 
we hope that as soon as tomorrow he will be down to 
serious huen said 
the 57yearold longshoreman who spent four days trapped under 
the freeway rubble in his chevrolet sprint before being rescued

according to oakland police sgt jack huth 
and then she reflected on it a minute and said well if 
anyone could buck could 
commuters returned to the earthquakeravaged transit system 
monday many boarding extra trains or a flotilla of ferries because 
the bay bridge from oakland to san francisco remained closed 
the bay area rapid transit system carried twice the normal load 
and ferry passengers had to stomach rough seas and whipping winds 
ive just been through hell but heck i have to admit i made 
it through it said john trowbridge a commuter who normally 
would have driven across the bay bridge but instead rode a ferry 
that lurched constantly battling swells that washed across the tip 
of the boat 
it can only get better this cant get much worse he said 
in clear weather during the evening rush hour few traffic 
bottlenecks were reported

the only fbi agent ever convicted of spying 
was granted bail monday enabling him to go free while he awaits a 
new trial on charges he passed topsecret fbi information to a 
soviet woman who was his lover 
us district judge david kenyon set bail for richard miller at 
337757 the amount millers sister brother and a friend said 
they could post in property 
kenyon was acting on orders from the 9th us circuit court of 
appeals which directed the lower court to set a bond miller could 
meet 
miller who has been in a federal prison in rochester minn 
since his 1986 conviction did not attend the brief hearing 
kenyon ordered that miller be brought to los angeles for a 
hearing next monday to set a new trial date it will be millers 
third trial his first jury deadlocked before a second jury 
convicted him in june 1986 
millers conviction was reversed in april on grounds that jurors 
were allowed to hear too much about liedetector tests miller took 
and failed 
kenyon who had sentenced miller to two life terms plus 50 years 
in prison initially refused to allow millers release on bail 
suggesting that the 52yearold former agent might flee the 
country but the appeals court said there was insufficient evidence 
that might happen 
the corpulent miller who battled the fbi over his weight and 
other problems during a lackluster 20year career with the agency 
was depicted by prosecutors as a bitter vengeful failure easily 
recruited as a spy 
defense attorneys said miller was a wellmeaning fbi misfit who 
dreamed of redeeming his career by infiltrating a soviet spy 
network 
among those who testified against him was codefendant svetlana 
ogorodnikov who became his lover and allegedly enticed him into 
spying mrs ogorodnikov and her husband nickolay pleaded guilty 
to spying and are serving federal prison terms 
kenyon on monday ordered that miller be released to the custody 
of former fbi agent albert sayers a private investigator who 
worked on millers defense and that he not leave los angeles 
without special permission

the leftist government monday 
threatened to retaliate against usbacked rebels after a series 
of attacks reportedly killed 20 people during a national voter 
registration drive 
reacting to the fighting president daniel ortega met with top 
officials from the defense and interior ministries on sunday the 
last of four registration days for the feb 25 general elections 
in the bloodiest attack contra rebels ambushed two trucks 
carrying military reservists saturday near rio blanco about 80 
miles northeast of managua military officials said eighteen 
soldiers were reported killed and eight wounded 
in a communique monday the presidents office said criminal 
actions such as saturdays will be punished with all the 
energy and all the force that the laws of the republic allow for 
this kind of offense 
the statement did not say exactly what measures would be taken 
in separate remarks ortega accused the united states of 
creating obstacles to the electoral process 
they continue opposing demobilization of the contras in 
honduran territory they continue promoting a policy of 
strangulation against nicaragua and maintain financing of the 
contra armed mercenaries and now have approved financing of the 
disarmed mercenaries he said 
in february 1988 congress cut off military aid to the contras 
but it has continued nonlethal support including 49 million 
approved earlier this year 
the latest aid package provides the contras with food medicine 
shelter boots and other supplies it contains a clause however 
that allows the aid to be cut off if the contras attack within 
nicaraguan territory 
most of the rebels are based in neighboring honduras 
col enrique bermudez the top contra military leader has 
denied the accusations by the leftist sandinista government that 
his troops in nicaragua have been attacking 
instead he told the associated press in a telephone interview 
from honduras that the sandinista army has been mounting a cleanup 
operation against the rebels who have to defend themselves 
the government has claimed the rebels are trying to disrupt the 
election process it also says they have gained the support of the 
nicaraguan political opposition which denies the charge 
nicaraguans were allowed to register on the first four sundays 
in october during the first three sundays the supreme electoral 
council said 1336342 citizens had registered of an estimated 
total of 1970486 eligible voters 
a top un official on an election observer mission said rebel 
attacks have impaired voter registration and expressed worry that 
the fighting may increase 
regrettably the electoral process is still marred in some 
places by the continuing armed actions of some groups elliot 
richardson told reporters the former us attorney general is 
serving as a representative for un secretary general javier perez 
de cuellar 
electoral council president mariano fiallos said at least 60 
registration places had not opened during the registration period 
because of actual or threatened contra attacks 
ortega called early elections and pledged greater democracy in 
nicaragua in an accord with four other central american leaders 
in exchange they agreed to dismantling the contras by dec 7 
but the rebels say they wont disband until the nicaraguan 
government guarantees a general amnesty 
sandinista and contra leaders signed a temporary ceasefire in 
march 1988 however they have been unable to reach a permanent 
peace agreement and there has been sporadic fighting since then

when el ultimo de la fila goes on stage 
rock singer manolo garcia strikes the pose of a matador flamenco 
dancers swirl and stamp to the sound of electric guitars and 
screaming fans surge forward 
although lead guitarist quimi portet says the group plays rock 
music the backup acoustic guitar castanets and wailing vocals 
that have become its trademark are unmistakably and traditionally 
spanish 
spain is synonomous with music but only recently has homegrown 
rock n roll moved to center stage as the country witnessed 
explosive growth in bands concerts and record companies in the 
past decade 
when elvis presley little richard and the beatles hit the music 
scene spaniards were living under a military dictatorship but the 
death of authoritarian ruler gen francisco franco in 1975 and 
spains transition to democracy provided the cultural and political 
context within which local rock could flourish 
rock bands soon became blatantly ideological in their lyrics and 
entertained at political rallies and municipal gatherings as the 
music became a banner for a cultural and political reawakening 
known as the movida the happening 
i dont think what happened was a cultural renaissance or 
anything like that said rock singer anton reixa what happened 
is that people all of a sudden returned to the way they had always 
been madrid of the movida of the early 80s was like the madrid 
of arniches madrid of the zarzuelas but with spiked hair and 
pop music carlos arniches was an early 20thcentury composer 
who wrote for music halls zarzuelas are operettas based on popular 
themes 
early spanish rock was little more than an imitation of british 
and american music but musicians gradually began to experiment 
fusing rock with traditional styles 
this experimentation led to the birth of flamencorock such 
groups as triana a neighborhood in seville were a precursor to 
el ultimo the last in line triana excited listeners in the 
late 70s with their mixture of rock and gypsyinspired andalusian 
folklore 
the legalization of spains regional languages following the 
return to democracy opened the way for groups such as os resentidos 
the resentful a band from galicia that mixes raunchy distorted 
sounds of electric guitar and synthesizers with bagpipe music 
typical of celtic galicia in northwestern spain 
the group which started in 1982 played one of its first gigs 
in a psychiatric hospital it now has its own music videos and 
continues to occupy alternative music charts with a bagpiperap 
version of its hit galicia sitio distinto galicia a 
different kind of place 
spains rock movement has been especially active in the small 
northern provinces of the restive basque country home to some of 
the most radical rock and punk groups basque separatism and 
political activism have spawned bands such as the basquelanguage 
kortatu with its highly politicized mixture of rock reggae punk 
and occasional basque accordion riffs 
there are many more bands now than at the beginning of the 
80s said madrid disc jockey chusma martin but now there is 
no sense of direction 
martin says many radical groups basque and otherwise still 
exist but they are being overshadowed by a new generation of 
apolitical bands that opt for a variety of styles 
aficionados of punk new wave heavy metal and rockabilly each 
in the appropriate attire roam the streets of madrid and the 
plazas of small castilian villages americanstyle country music 
also has made an considerable impression on spanish bands 
im really bothered by so much music with american country 
references said reixa there cant be country in spain im 
fed up with songs that talk about cadillacs and bourbon 
manolo garcia of el ultimo says the group will not go american 
in order to expand its market 
despite this uncompromising approach and an aversion to 
marketing blitzes el ultimo performs before sellout crowds in the 
country of 398 million and boasts record sales in the hundreds of 
thousands 
their latest lp como la cabeza al sombrero recorded with 
dpi a small independent company has been released in france and 
will soon be distributed in scandinavia 
but spanish rock has not had much success abroad los bravos 
topped the us charts in the early 60s with their 
englishlanguage black is black but little else has gone 
beyond the spanish market since 
several spanish pop groups have begun to look toward latin 
america as a logical source of fans and record sales but few have 
made it big 
the exchange with latin america is minimal said madrid disc 
jockey rosa perez spanish independent companies are simply 
incapable of exporting music in large quantities to latin america 
where audiences tend to prefer ballad singers such as julio 
iglesias or more traditional styles 
but the technopop group mecano is an exception to the rule 
with more than 1 million records sold from mexico to tierra del 
fuego 
both mecano and hombres g are among the few spanish 
groups picked up by multinational recording companies 
el ultimo is just breaking ground in latin america where 
garcia and portet took their lowkey promotional rock tour to 
chile colombia argentina venezuela and mexico in july 
here in spain we were considered a weird group when we 
started and in certain respects we still are over there said 
garcia the process taking place there is similar to what 
happened here four or five years ago one of surprise and then 
little by little gradually acceptance 
in southern california portet said the organizers tried to 
sell them as a hispanic group thats fine but we make music for 
people not for specific groups 
although os resentidos have made it in their native galicia and 
on alternative lists in the rest of spain their first album was 
put out in portugal because galego and portuguese are more similar 
than galego and spanish 
reixa is not optimistic about success in latin america they 
know us a little in argentina but inflation is so high there and 
with the economic crisis its impossible to sell records to play 
to do anything and in colombia theyre almost on the verge of a 
civil war 
what cracks me up is that were most popular in places where 
theres a lot of turmoil

environmentalist groups including the 
venezuelan environment ministry charge that fishermen are killing 
dolphins for bait to catch sharks 
one group fundatropicos claims that the shark fishermen are 
harpooning thousands of dolphins a year to hook small sharks used 
in a favorite venezuelan delicacy called cazon 
some fishermen and government officials deny the charges but 
the allegations have touched off a heated debate among 
enviromentalists in venezuela 
the result has been conflicting press reports confusion over 
the number of dolphins killed uncertainty about which fishermen 
might be responsible a call for a boycott of shark meat and an 
open rivalry between two government ministries 
between 6000 and 7000 dolphins per year are killed by shark 
fishermen using a system called trotline fishing says eduardo 
szeplaki a biologist who is spearheading a campaign by 
fundatropicos a trotline is a long fishing line with hundreds of 
baited hooks attached to it 
in july the environment ministry identified 12 fishing boats 
thought to be killing dolphins and the areas where the killings 
were taking place 
according to szeplaki venezuelan fishermen got the idea of 
using dolphins as shark bait from asia the dolphin meat is 
fibrous lasts as long as three days and is regarded as effective 
in attracting sharks 
killing dolphins while prohibited by venezuelan law also 
enables fishermen to avoid having to buy bait 
daniel novoa director of the fishing section at the venezuelan 
agriculture ministry describes fundatropicos accusations as 
completely without foundation 
he says nine korean boats operating in venezuelan waters may 
have killed dolphins but departed more than a year and a half ago 
according to novoa venezuela now has only four trotline shark 
boats despite fundatropicos claim of 17 
while acknowledging the possibility of isolated cases of 
dolphin killings novoa said captains of shark boats deny it 
salvador bohir director of an environment ministry animal 
protection agency disagreed with novoa 
i am far more realistic he said yes there are 
irregularities 
in venezuela the agriculture ministry is charged with marketing 
and developing ocean resources and the environment ministry 
oversees their protection and conservation 
at times the marketing part takes precedence over 
protection said jose gregoria garcia an engineer at the 
environment ministry there must be greater communication and 
team work 
dolphins are protected by international accords in the pacific 
where dolphins and tuna swim together and dolphins suffocate in 
tuna fishermens nets venezuela which sends tuna fleets into the 
pacific met the terms of those accords last year after a 38day 
tuna embargo by the united states 
but no such accords apply to the caribbean which makes up 
venezuelas shoreline and the shark fishermen who are just 1 
percent of the nations fishing fleet 
but szeplaki maintains that nearly half of all species of 
dolphin can be found in venezuelan waters and that some species 
might be in danger of extinction 
despite the accusations of dolphin killings in the press and 
official circles only one trotline shark boat has been sanctioned 
so far the environment and agriculture ministries said that 
occurred in 1988 when the boat was found to have eight dead 
dolphins aboard it was fined 30000 bolivars less than 1000 
new legislation under consideration in the venezuelan congress 
would increase penalties for killing marine mammals but would do 
little to upgrade enforcement 
however the recent flurry of accusations has prompted 
venezuelas attorney general to open an investigation 
meanwhile szeplaki and others are asking venezuelans to boycott 
shark meat

author leslie charteris was skeptical when 
simon dutton the 12th actor to play simon templar in the 
saint told him his mother had named him for the famous 
semicrooked detective 
charteris who wrote the bestselling novels about the dashing 
character asked dutton whether he actually had been named for the 
character or if hed made it up for the newspapers the actor 
said 
when i assured him my mother was a fan he invited her to his 
81st birthday party in london 
the saint that charteris created is a swashbuckler of 
dubious morality a robin hood of crime dedicated to justice 
roger moore who played him on tv from 1967 to 1969 is perhaps the 
bestremembered of those who have tackled the role 
duttons version is part of the syndicated mystery wheel of 
adventure six twohour movies of original saint mysteries 
are among the 10 shows being telecast by 102 stations 
since the saint sought adventure all over the world the six 
new tv movies about him were filmed on location in london paris 
berlin luxembourg and australia all the stories are original 
dutton met charteris during a visit to new york charteris born 
leslie yin in singapore of a chinese father and an english mother 
is an american citizen who lives in england 
his mysterious urbane adventurer made his first appearance in 
enter the saint in 1930 the first of 45 novels the saint 
also has appeared in movies television radio and comic strips 
when interviewed dutton whose thick black hair is turning gray 
at the temples was just back from filming the final movie in 
sydney australia he stopped here en route to his home in london 
simon templar is really an adventure seeker he said he 
becomes involved in the crimes in various ways maybe a friend gets 
in trouble he smells out danger and intrigue he works both sides 
of the law under various aliases hes very much a product of 
english public schools his clothes are from saville row 
hes from a wealthy aristocratic family but probably from the 
wrong side of the sheets hes not a playboy he makes his living 
as a jewel thief charteris was very much influenced by raffles 
the gentleman burglar the heavies in the novels were based on real 
people charteris met in his travels 
the british actor 31 has been on american television before 
he starred in a cbs movie based on agatha christies man in a 
brown suit he also was in the british miniseries by the sword 
divided a story of the english civil war that show was 
televised in this country 
dutton who also played richard geres brother in the movie 
king david grew up in and around london and attended the 
central school of speech and drama 
i started in repertory theater and my break came when i was 
cast in another country in the west end he said peter 
ustinov saw the play and cast me in his film memed my hawk based 
on a turkish folk story about a robin hood type character 
we never stopped laughing during the production one actor 
cracked a rib and begged peter to stop telling stories because it 
hurt to laugh wed come in every day and ask peter to imitate a 
new musical instrument he never missed 
the mystery wheel of adventure in which dutton appears also 
consists of three adaptations of books by dick francis and one 
offbeat mystery called star trap 
the saint has been played on radio by vincent price barry 
sullivan tom conway brian aherne and edgar barrier in the movies 
louis hayward george sanders hugh sinclair and jean marais played 
him 
on television ian ogilvy played him in return of the saint 
in episodes made in england nine years after moore left the series

construction workers carving out a 
road for an elite mediterranean resort bulldozed their way into an 
ancient world under a blanket of seaside sand 
they had stumbled upon a city more than 2000 years old and 
stretching for more than a mile along egypts coastline 125 miles 
west of alexandria 
its unbelievable said ali hassan who controls egyptian 
antiquities organization operations in the region other 
countries get excited about finding an ancient house we have a 
whole city its without equal in all of egypt 
the bulldozers were stopped a month after the ruins were 
discovered in 1985 by that time a road had been sliced through 
what appears to have been an ancient temple but much more remained 
a few months later egyptian and polish archaeologists began 
excavating the ruins without letting word out and what theyve 
found over the last three years is in remarkable condition 
what we have in hand is a golden egg undisturbed a complete 
city that changed with time said hassan director general of 
pharaonic monuments its not only a city of the dead but also a 
city of the living side by side its something very rare and very 
important 
the city believed to have been founded in the second century 
bc lasted more than 500 years as excavators intruded on its 
serenity since 1986 antiquities officials have worked quietly in 
cairo to save the site from further destruction 
the stillunidentified city now peeks in and out of its sandy 
grave 
to one side stands a row of ultramodern apartments built along 
the coastline by egypts ministry of housing a new apartment 
complex was to have been erected on top of what turned out to be 
the ruins 
the site is under our protection said sayeed tawfik 
chairman of the antiquities organization nothing can happen to 
it now 
only a small area has been excavated but archaeologists already 
have discovered wellpreserved houses vast cemeteries with 
decorated and undecorated tombs catacombs a bath a basilica and 
many artifacts imported and local including statues and frescoes 
egyptian excavators are now at work in february theyll be 
rejoined by 10 polish archaeologists and restorers to make detailed 
surveys of the site and its needs 
they already have restored critical pieces that had begun to 
disintegrate since the bulldozing of the road 
walking through the excavations feisal mohammed ashmy the 
antiquities inspector in charge of the ancient city pointed toward 
mounds of toppled marble columns they lay at the beside a ditch 
cut 35 feet wide and 10 feet deep by the grading equipment 
before the bulldozers got here this was a temple i think 
its terrible but we now have to focus on saving whats left he 
said 
theres so much all you have to do is to look down and 
history says take me 
early historians recorded a number of small coastal cities along 
egypts mediterranean coastline villages of white houses fishing 
boats and nets and later the domes of early christian churches 
dotted the landscape vineyards olive groves fruit trees and 
almonds were plentiful families on outings sailed to outlying 
islands to drink wine 
wa daszewski head of the polish archaeological institite in 
egypt and an expert in the grecoroman period said hes delighted 
with the find 
this is a great opportunity for us to see how it was its a 
unique chance to understand the quality of housing during this 
period he said in an interview 
this was a landowners city they probably had farms 
inland but residents preferred to have their houses along the 
coast because of the cooler climate 
excavated houses are large with complex systems that carried 
rainwater from the roof to basement cisterns some are elaborately 
decorated with pillars niches statues and delicate frescoes 
the architectural decoration in the city is first class and 
wellpreserved daszewski said 
designs on tombs range from simple pits through small step 
pyramids to magnificent multistoried funerary complexes daszewski 
said burials date from the second century bc to the end of the 
third century ad but he believes the city existed in some form 
until the early seventh century 
daszewski said he knows of two possible names for the city 
leucaspis white shield which would refer to a sandspit that 
protected the harbor and antiphre or antiphra a city mentioned as 
late as the fourth century ad because of a bishop who hailed from 
there 
both are possibilities but we have a basilica here so the 
city existed during early christian times daszewski said i 
rather think its antiphre but its possible the city was called 
one thing the harbor area another we dont know 
the polish and egyptian archaeologists predict itll be years 
before excavation and restoration is completed 
maybe 10 maybe 15 maybe more said antiquities official

hernan buchi the progovernment 
candidate for chiles presidency is waging an increasingly 
aggressive campaign in hopes of eroding support for his opposition 
in daily campaign appearances and statements buchi is 
repeatedly accusing opposition contender patricio aylwin of acting 
in concert with marxist extremists and of condoning the scattered 
acts of violence in what has been a largely peaceful campaign 
he hopes to frighten middleclass voters away from aylwin a 
moderate christian democrat heavily favored in most opinion polls 
to win the dec 14 election to replace gen augusto pinochet the 
president since the military took power in 1973 
the opposition confidently predicts the failure however of 
buchis aggressive tack 
its a crass error carlos huneeus a pollster working with 
the aylwin campaign said in an interview it has nothing to do 
with reality in chile 
pinochet was forced to call elections after chileans in a 
yesorno ballot last year rejected a proposal that he remain 
leader until 1997 he is scheduled to hand power over to the new 
president in march 
aylwin led a coalition of centrist and leftist parties that 
campaigned for pinochets defeat in the referendum and is now its 
sole presidential candidate 
buchi 40 was pinochets finance minister for four years until 
march and is backed by rightist political groups a third candidate 
is a populist bankerbusinessman francisco errazuriz 
in the first days of the campaign after the candidates 
registered in july buchi stressed his achievements as finance 
minister they include steady economic growth and low inflation in 
sharp contrast to other latin american countries 
but the message apparently has won him few backers polls in 
early october indicated he is trailing aylwin by as much as 30 
percentage points it was then he went on the attack 
he charged that aylwin has a secret pact with leftists who 
had been prominent in the turbulent government of president 
salvador allende the marxist who was elected to office in 1970 
further buchi claimed the leftists are likely to again plunge 
chile into the economic and social chaos that marked the allende 
years and prompted the 1973 coup 
he blamed aylwins supporters for beating buchi backers and 
bombing some campaign offices 
in a televised debate with aylwin oct 9 buchi hinted that his 
opponents backers might be responsible for the hitandrun death 
of a probuchi labor activist but a police investigation later 
determined that he was killed in an ordinary traffic accident 
aylwin a 70yearold veteran statesman has responded by 
emphasizing his own reputation as a moderate and accuses buchi of 
waging an undignified and irresponsible scare campaign 
aylwins principal campaign message has been the need for 
national unity to assure a democratic transition 
but buchis backers contend that the aylwin camp is guilty of 
belowthebelt politics 
they are trying to define the dec 14 election as a choice 
between dictatorship and democracy which is a lie said buchis 
campaign manager pablo baraona 
it is not dictatorship or democracy that is at stake here it 
is two democratic platforms 
buchi has tried to distance himself from pinochet even 
recommending publicly that pinochet give up his command of the army 
when the change in government takes place 
pinochet has said he plans to remain on as commander a post 
that the countrys 1980 constitution allows him to keep for eight 
more years

the ak47 bullets that blasted away his 
left knee and right elbow also ended mike campbells comfortable 
detachment from the struggle over gun control 
ive never been much of an activist said campbell one of a 
dozen survivors of joseph wesbeckers rampage at the standard 
gravure corp printing plant obviously i am for gun control 
now 
the ability of a mentally ill man bent on revenge to legally buy 
a militarystyle semiautomatic rifle has made his wife betty 
even more partisan 
she has special contempt for legislators she sees as 
complicitous to the extent they permit traffic in such guns and for 
people who think that their right to carry a gun supersedes my 
husbands right to carry his grandson 
the national rifle association is strong in kentucky where the 
hunting is good and freedom of arms is cherished 
but fallout from the sept 14 standard gravure shootings in 
which eight people died may put the nra on the defensive for the 
first time in memory when the kentucky general assembly convenes in 
january 
mrs campbell looks toward the session and the likelihood of 
legislation to ban or limit the sale of assault weapons i am 
not a public speaker but i will support in any way i can 
legislation to ban those kinds of weapons 
the nra which regularly fights such legislation as an 
infringement on the second amendment right of citizens to keep 
and bear arms will be ready 
the organization says that nothing not a waiting period not a 
ban on specific weapons would have prevented wesbeckers mission 
of vengeance against the company that ended his job because of his 
mental illness 
i think whats the real tragedy is that we use incidents like 
this to propose restrictions on lawabiding citizens that will have 
no effect on incidents in the future said james t hayes an nra 
lobbyist 
how in a free society do you keep people like that man from 
acquiring a firearm i dont know what the answer is to that 
hayes said 
a number of state officials now say they have an answer 
restrictions on assault weapons 
gov wallace wilkinson long an opponent of gun control 
endorsed assaultweapon restrictions in the days after the 
massacre two state lawmakers from the louisville area said they 
are ready to sponsor the legislation 
us rep carroll hubbard a conservative kentucky democrat and 
nra ally agreed four days after the shootings to become a 
cosponsor of legislation in congress that would ban the domestic 
manufacture of assault weapons 
wesbecker 47 had an abundance of demons two broken marriages 
and a belief he had been injured by workplace chemicals and wronged 
by standard gravure which prints newspaper supplements and 
advertising inserts 
he had been placed on permanent disability leave because of 
mental illness in 1988 it was shortly before a morning shift 
change when he returned to the plant to say a gruesome goodbye 
besides the ak47 which can shoot 40 bullets a minute 
wesbecker had two mac11 semiautomatic machine pistols a 9mm 
semiautomatic pistol a 38caliber revolver a bayonet and 
hundreds of rounds of ammunition according to police 
he carried the ak47 the sigsauer 9mm and extra ammo the rest 
was stashed in a gym bag under a stairwell police said wesbecker 
having shot 20 people apparently was heading for the arms cache 
when he stopped put the pistol under his chin and squeezed the 
trigger 
his shots killed eight others 
among the survivors mike campbell a tennis player who at 51 
could easily pass for 40 was luckier than most though grievously 
wounded in both arms and both legs his left knee was pulverized 
as the couples five daughters arrived one by one at the 
hospital and collapsed one by one in horror betty campbells fury 
welled i promised myself i am going to do something about 
this 
a day later she faced reporters and television cameras for the 
first time eldest daughter mary campbell ford in tears beside her 
and bristled 
you see the devastation she said and anybody who thinks 
a private citizen needs an assault gun please justify it to this 
child to my husband and to his grandchild you will not justify it 
to me 
after 13 days in the hospital mike campbell went home to the 
house he and betty have rehabilitated over 10 years a hospital bed 
awaited in the living room as did an electric wheelchair and a new 
cordless telephone 
doctors say the best campbell can hope for is to walk with a 
cane within the next three years then campbell said doctors will 
assess the amount of regrowth to bones in his knee if there is 
enough he might be a candidate for an operation that would allow 
him to walk nearly normally 
for now betty campbell said mike will be able to sit in the 
gazebo his favorite place and watch the falling leaves of autumn 
his favorite time of year 
she will be watching the legislature

from a border camp in pakistan associated press

bumpy roads and past the devastation of war as they made their way 
home to afghanistan after six years as refugees this is her

shawlicourt afghanistan ap for hamid ghulam the 
decadelong civil war is over and his sixyear odyssey in exile 
finished 
the arid plains of southern afghanistan are quiet again the 
sound of warplanes and exploding artillery shells replaced by the 
rustle of the hot desert wind through the grapevines 
atop the shattered mud villages above the tents pitched by 
nomads and in the fields where camels graze the black and white 
and red and green flags of the moslem resistance flutter in the 
breeze 
an undeclared truce exists between the soldiers defending the 
government in kabul and the mujahedeen guerrillas who rule the 
countryside around kandahar afghanistans second largest city and 
the cradle of its nowdeposed monarchy 
despite the uncertainty of its durability the peace is luring 
thousands of refugees like ghulam home 
i could have stayed in pakistan where i know my family would 
be safe said ghulam but believe me i love this destroyed 
country a thousand times more i could never be happy anywhere 
else 
in august 1983 soviet tanks rumbled into shawlicourt and 
unleashed a fierce barrage lasting nearly 30 hours to rout 
suspected guerrillas hiding inside the mudwalled compound 
ghulam his family and a few of the other 1000 families who 
survived the barrage fled 120 miles to pakistan where they lived 
with 170000 other refugees in a camp near the desert town of 
chaman 
nearly 6 million afghans are living in refugee camps in pakistan 
and iran the bases of the resistance groups trying to overthrow 
the government of president najib 
most afghan refugees are anxious to return to a country where 
war has been raging for 11 years even though the struggle shows no 
apparent signs of ending some like ghulam have become impatient at 
the lack of military victory or negotiated settlement and are going 
home 
international relief agencies and government officials estimate 
about 100000 afghans have returned since the soviet troops left in 
february but they acknowledge they cannot accurately gauge the 
flow because of the countrys porous borders and lack of any 
central authority 
i was born here said ghulam a 33yearold farmer finally 
back home my father and grandfather were born here this is home 
and i want it to be my childrens home why shouldnt we come back 
the soviets are gone and god willing peace will come soon 
it was before dawn when ghulam his wife and their two children 
his father aunt uncle and three cousins packed their belongings 
and piled into a battered blue pickup truck said goodbye to those 
staying behind at the chaman camp and headed for the border 
ghulam seemed apprehensive at first wondering whether pakistani 
border guards would force them to turn back or demand steep prices 
he could not pay 
when the border guards waved them by and they plowed through the 
sandy plain the excitement on ghulams wizened face became as 
infectious as a childs joy on christmas morning 
this is really afghanistan one day well all be back he 
said as the group headed toward spin buldak the border post 
captured by the guerrillas in november 
welcome to free aghanistan the sign was spraypainted on 
the side of a building on which a white flag had been planted 
beyond lay the remains of a oncebustling tourist information 
center a crumbling reminder of the western hippy trail of the 
early 1970s 
a few guerrillas their rifles strapped over their shoulders 
sat by a campfire in the center of the shattered buildings and 
captured soviet tanks as ghulam and his family chugged down the 
road weaving from side to side to avoid the huge potholes left by 
years of neglect his thoughts frequently turned to his two sons 
among the 700000 afghan children born in exile 
all their lives they have seen mujahedeen coming in and out of 
the house and they have idealized afghanistan he said for 
them this is supposed to be the most beautiful country in the 
world i fear they may hate me for the deception 
along the road cutting across what was once one of afghanistans 
most densely populated provinces there is now only destruction and 
the tattered flags marking the graves of some of the 15 million 
afghans who have died in the struggle against the marxist 
government that seized power in april 1978 
they passed through a guerrilla checkpoint and then turned down 
a narrow dirt path bouncing along the rocky barren terrain 
weaving between the ox carts the land rovers and huge trucks with 
their cargoes concealed under burlap covers 
they reached another potholed road lined with burned and rusting 
shells of more than 100 soviet tanks armored personnel carriers 
and rocket launchers the destruction along the road was startling 
a huge silo built by the soviet lay in ruins and houses and 
buildings lay in ruins and in the midst of vast destruction the 
bluedomed masoleum of an afghan king stood unscratched 
then the 10hour journey was over they were home and it was 
mealtime 
the family sat crosslegged in the ruined house of an old friend 
and guerrilla commander all ate from the same plates their first 
meal in free afghanistan

after 40 years of communist rule much has 
changed inside china much remains the same small factories and 
other businesses are beginning to find their way into the peasant 
villages and villagers are finding jobs in the cities but new 
policies imposed by the conservative leadership that won junes 
power struggle in beijing may reverse that trend

the road to peaceful village is a 
ribbon of brown powder winding among the pale and dusty cliffs of 
dry northwestern china 
the earth crumbles to the touch and seems to have no nourishment 
in it but nine generations of the xu wei and li clans that 
comprise peaceful have coaxed from it spare harvests of wheat and 
beans 
asked to tell stories about the village xu yunbao 65 talks 
about water he tells how his ancestors walked 12 miles each day to 
reach the nearest well how a new well dug when he was a child 
turned out to be too salty to drink 
less than 12 inches of rain falls in a good year it is too dry 
even for crickets the hills at night are eerily silent 
the great drought of 1929 forced xus family to move to a city 
where ironically they made a living as water sellers but after 
three years when the drought eased they and other fugitives from 
the village returned 
why 
our forefathers lived here we were born here explains xus 
70yearold brother yunnian 
the stubborn loyalty of generations of chinese peasants to their 
ancestral homes has helped the communist government for most of its 
40 years of rule to keep country and city sharply separated 
preventing the development of peasant shantytowns around cities 
like elsewhere in asia 
the separation also kept the relative wealth of the cities from 
filtering down to the villages leaving many peasants without 
electricity or adequate water supplies well into the 1970s some 
villages still go without while modern appliances such as washing 
machines have become standard in urban homes 
for most peasants the mechanics of daily life remained 
unchanged even while the communists first collectivized and then 
redistributed the land closed temples set up clinics and schools 
and made other radical changes in the social and political fabric 
of village life 
but in the past few years the ruralurban barriers have begun to 
crumble an economic boom generated by senior leader deng 
xiaopings embrace of the free market created millions of 
construction jobs in cities and young men flocked from the 
countryside to fill them 
even more important a bit of the city came to the countryside 
in the form of small rural factories that by this year employed a 
total of 95 million peasants nearly a quarter of the rural work 
force 
for the first time the peasants ancient dependence on the 
whimsies of weather was broken 
the late revolutionary leader mao tsetung a product of a 
peasant family said peasants should grow grain any other 
endeavor he said was capitalistic but under dengs more flexible 
rule the peaceful village committee took out a loan and set up a 
brick factory in 1985 
profits from that helped set up a calcium carbide factory and 
the two jointly have underwritten a new villageowned poultry and 
pig farm and new primary and middle schools 
other villages have used the profits from similar factories to 
build irrigation ditches pave streets install electricity and 
open small stores in the first significant infusion of investment 
funds the chinese countryside has ever seen 
nearly onefifth of peacefuls 500 families have a member 
working in one of the factories or on the poultry farm bolstering 
family income with a guaranteed monthly wage of about 32 more 
than double the per capita earnings from the land and close to the 
average monthly salary for urban workers 
dengs open policies also included accepting outside help such 
as a 55 million world food program grant that helped build pipes 
and pumps to carry water from the yellow river 16 miles away the 
chinese government contributed 222 million 
since the project was finished last year a network of ditches 
brings river water to nearly half the fields in peaceful and other 
villages in the region and families can draw water from cisterns a 
few yards from their homes

things are pretty good here now says 35yearold xu 
zhengqie squatting alongside a dirt path with a few of his 
neighbors watching another man driving a tractor over newly 
harvested wheat to thresh it they smoke and chat in the morning 
sun waiting their turn 
xu says his acre and a half yielded enough wheat to feed his 
family of four but less rides on the harvest now he earns a 
steady 270 a year driving a jeep for the local government 
like most of his neighbors xu is saving up to build a new 
house bigger than the three rooms of clay brick he has now he has 
already helped set another trend by replacing his traditional kang 
a heated sleeping platform for the whole family with a 
westernstyle bed 
its more modern he says proudly we slowly learn from 
the cities 
but the rural miniboom no more than five years old in most 
villages may be coming to an end a yearlong clampdown on 
construction intended to curb nationwide inflation of more than 25 
percent has sent millions of peasants home from the cities 
thousands of rural factories have been forced to close because 
they take raw materials and energy needed by the behemoth state 
companies many rural companies consistently outperform the state 
businesses in productivity but the conservative leaders who won 
junes power struggle in beijing say state factories must get 
priority as a pillar of the socialist system 
rural factories rank lower ideologically they are owned by 
village or township governments or by individuals and operate 
outside the stateplanned economy 
the leaders acknowledge the new policies will hurt rural 
residents but have offered no solutions officials in gansu 
province where peaceful is located insisted they had no figures 
for the number of gansu peasants put out of work officially there 
is no such thing as rural unemployment everyone is considered to 
work on the land 
despite rapid growth rural industrial output has grown more 
than 30 percent a year since 1985 village factories have only 
begun to shrink the huge gap between rural and city life 
if this growth slows markedly or reverses life in peaceful will 
remain more in the 19th century than the 20th only the new 
cisterns and the television sets in many homes would greatly 
startle any longgone ancestor who paid a visit 
even the new houses with shiny red doors and black tile gates 
use paper for windows and coal cooking stoves for heat life 
remains a round of chores to be tackled with a strong arm and back 
a cart loaded with produce is as likely to be pushed by two 
peasants as pulled by a mule or tractor xu and his neighbors 
gathered their harvest by hand and although a tractor helped with 
the threshing they used rakes to separate the grain and chaff 
wang yuhua a softspoken woman who came to peaceful 23 years 
ago as a teenage bride was asked how she spends her free time 
i cut grass for the pigs she said 
a large picture of mao and the red army general zhu de decorates 
wangs home but she only giggles uncomfortably when asked if this 
means she thinks mao was a great leader questions about politics 
and ideology fall flat in peaceful people look to results and are 
content as long as the economy prospers 
we cant leap ahead we will have to remain backward for a 
while says yan bolin vice magistrate of gaolan county which 
includes peaceful professing support for the central governments 
clampdown on economic growth 
but bolin is confident the clampdown will bypass peaceful and 
all of gaolan we didnt develop factories blindly he says 
weve tried to emphasize products that were needed 
when beijing talks about overheated investment he adds 
theyre certainly not talking about us 
rural officials elsewhere expressed similar hopes that their 
factories would be considered too useful too profitable or too 
innocuous to warrant closure 
china is very big so its not possible to act quickly one 
government worker saidsometimes the old policy has not been 
carried out and theres a new one

it was just after the lunar new year last 
february that an army of up to 25 million peasants rode the rails 
to this city in southern china in search of fortune 
the crush came after migrant laborers working in canton and the 
surrounding pearl river delta returned home for the holiday and 
told fellow villagers of the high wages at the regions toy 
textile and garment factories 
most of the peasants quickly returned home because the region 
could not absorb such a sudden and massive influx of unskilled 
labor but smaller waves have continued to pour into the delta 
on the 40th anniversary of communist rule this coastal region 
of guangdong province is indeed chinas land of plenty lush green 
rice paddies orchards and rolling hills spread from the meandering 
pearl river villages of aging gray brick houses and ostentatious 
threestory tiled villas vie for space with factories throughout 
the countryside 
but the regions development has more to do with markets than 
marx 
referring to the decade of marketoriented economic reform under 
senior chinese leader deng xiaoping yi kun cheng vice governor of 
heshan county near canton says the 10year open policy has been 
a golden time for china and heshan 
neither he nor other local officials who recently met with 
foreign reporters offered praise of the preceding 30 years of 
communist rule when ideology was stressed over profit 
now the partys conservative leaders in beijing who 
consolidated power after quashing the spring prodemocracy 
movement want to reign in coastal regions such as the delta that 
have acted with growing autonomy in recent years 
it hasnt gotten to the point where there is fear but there 
certainly is tension as co and radio out

a nearly forgotten program of world war ii 
called v12 turned out 60000 navy and marine corps officers and 
changed their lives recently those old warriors got together to 
rehash what v12 meant to them the writer of this story a retired 
associated press editor and marine veteran of world war ii and the 
korean war was one of them

the meatloaf on the metal mess trays had the 
taste and the look of old times for the aging men in 
goldemblazoned navy blue baseball caps 
the gold read navy v12 and as they chowed down on navy bean 
soup meatloaf steamed carrots mashed potatoes fruit salad and 
lots of coffee they laughed and needled and talked about v12 
navy v12 hardly anybody remembers it except the men who were 
in it and the families who have endured stories about it now these 
men were here on a mild fall weekend to celebrate what v12 had 
meant to them and to the country they called the meeting the navy 
v12 national colloquium a fancy name for organized talk the talk 
was plain and not always organized 
if all the talk had been condensed into a theme it might have 
been v12 was the turning point in my life 
v12 gave boys who grew up in the depression a chance at 
college it furnished officers for the navy and marine corps it 
trained leaders for the future it kept small schools alive 
all that happened because the navy saw that the world war ii 
draft was devouring potential officer material and it looked like 
a long war so with president franklin d roosevelts blessing the 
navy created v12 a program to put college men in uniform and get 
them ready for midshipmens schools and marine officer candidates 
school 
when the program ended it had produced more than 60000 navy 
and marine corps officers 
many of its trainees went on to become prominent 
former senate majority leader and former white house chief of 
staff howard baker sen daniel patrick moynihan of new york 
former secretary of defense melvin laird former commissioner of 
baseball bowie kuhn heisman trophy winner angelo bertelli former 
washington redskins coach george allen actors jack lemmon and 
jackie cooper tonight show host johnny carson 
invitations to the national colloquium the first since the 
program began 46 years ago went to about 17000 known v12s their 
names had been tracked down for a history of v12 by james g 
schneider chairman of kankakee ill federal savings and loan and 
a v12 at milligan college in tennessee and duke university ann 
landers ran a letter from schneider about the colloquium and her 
column produced about 2000 replies 
about 260 navy men and 20 marines turned out wives were there 
too about 100 of them that was enough to dominate a luxury hotel 
filling the bars the elevators the dining rooms the meeting room 
and the banquet room with blue and gold caps 
only one of the big names showed

that the tremendous constraints on my time prevented him from 
coming 
thats joke no 1 said peter hackes of nbc news 
introducing a humor session 
baker found time to drop by the mess tray lunch with a wave for 
his old compadres 
but big names hardly mattered the men were here to see old 
friends and make new ones and mainly to talk about old times 
some asked why so comparatively few had registered 
as usual the marines were just looking for a few good men 
said an old marine 
and the organizers said after all this was a first and its 
hard to get the word out to that many men people move addresses 
change and there was the cost of four days in washington some 
wrote from the west coast that if the colloquium had been in the 
middle of the country say chicago or kansas city they would 
have made it 
yes its expensive said navy veteran fred s mcclory of 
glenview ill but it may also be the chance of a lifetime 
that lifetime for v12s began on july 1 1943 high school 
graduates college students and men from the fleet reported to 
units at 131 colleges ranging in national prominence from harvard 
yale and notre dame to arizona state teachers college louisiana 
polytechnic institute and valley city state teachers college in 
north dakota fortyone of those units had marine detachments 
crammed with math physics and military discipline the v12s 
went on to navy midshipmens schools or marine officer candidates 
school and from there to billets at sea and in the field 
after their service thousands became corporate executives 
business owners doctors lawyers and judges bankers prominent 
newspaper and television newsmen educators and ministers 
the men at the colloquium had registered from 104 of the 131 
v12 schools 
they stood at attention at the opening reception to salute the 
colors and sing fullthroated versions of the national anthem 
anchors aweigh and the marines hymn played by a college 
naval reserve drum and bugle corps whose members looked young 
enough to be their grandchildren 
and they told their sea stories there was the one about the 
navy chief who warned his men to fall out for the next inspection 
in whites just out of the laundry so one fell out with his uniform 
still dripping wet

then there was the marine who confessed that he forgot to unload 
his rifle while on a field exercise accidentally kicked it and 
shot himself in an embarrassing place 
there were wild stories about liberty in towns near their 
schools tales of learning what they thought was the manly military 
art of drinking stories of circumventing the rigors of math and 
physics closeorder drill and calisthenics and curfews for their 
dates at religionoriented schools 
and they talked about why they came to the meeting 
v12 was pure luxury for a child of the depression said 
john scott davenport of columbus ohio a marine trainee at 
redlands university in california 
and it was more an educator told why 
meldrim f burrill of irvine calif stocky ruddy and erect at 
84 was a los angeles public schools administrator commissioned as 
a navy commander to skipper the v12 unit at colorado college 
nothing in my lifetime has been as significant in education as 
the v12 program he said 
v12 as he and others pointed out not only gave 
depressionstrapped young men a start on education a commission 
and leadership experience it also saved many small schools from 
going under in a wartime shortage of male students and funds 
back in 1943 robert j wisner was a poor boy from decatur 
ill struggling to work and stay in school and afraid he wouldnt 
make it 
today sharp features framed by a mane of white hair he is a 
mathematics professor at new mexico state university and travels 
around the country teaching other professors how to teach 
wisner a wabash college v12 who served on a rocket ship in the 
invasion of okinawa said v12 was the most important event in 
my life without it i might not have been able to finish my 
bachelors degree probably wouldnt have gone on to a masters 
and certainly not to a phd 
donald h smith like wisner was struggling to stay in school 
he enlisted as a marine and v12 kept him in the unit at yale he 
was commissioned led a company in korea and served for 20 years 
retiring as a lieutenant colonel 
his retirement pay let him fulfill his ambition to become an 
episcopalian priest and that led him to abaco bahamas burly and 
silverhaired with a pink cherubic face he ministers to a 
povertyridden allblack parish in an area so poor there are no 
telephones 
william a cox who had no idea what he wanted to be after high 
school went to medical school after the war because of his navy 
education then served 17 years as an army doctor and now is a 
heart surgeon in corpus christi texas 
jack m osborns navy schooling led him into medicine too he 
is in private practice and a colonel who runs a national guard 
hospital unit at los alamitos calif why because the navy 
taught me to love the military 
thadeus marcyan of northbrook ill hadnt planned to attend 
the reunion but the husky marines small wife took care of that 
i told him i was sick and tired of listening to v12 stories 
and he had to come here and relive his old experiences helen 
marcyan said she laughed i was still in high school in the war 
and a nun who had two nephews in v12 told me that all v12s were 
wonderful heroes and maybe thats why i fell for him 
but in those threatening war days there were moments of low 
morale impatience and doubt the men had enlisted to fight the 
japanese and the germans and here they were in uniform but still 
in college 
crawford gates a navy v12 at landlocked valley city state 
teachers college wrote a v12 victory song that throbbed with 
youthful fervor the first verse went like this 
rolling rolling over tossing waters 
thats the life for you and me 
o rolling rolling like our navys fathers 
who died for liberty 
v12s were in the normandy invasion and in the pacific from 
saipan through iwo jima and okinawa 
men who stayed in the reserve were called back for the fighting 
in korea some shipped over as regulars fought in vietnam and 
became navy captains and admirals marine colonels and generals 
now on a cool washington afternoon these old salts had orders 
to fall out uniform of the day ball caps and sports clothes 
and march six blocks to the navy memorial the march of men and 
wives could best be called a straggle 
but at the memorial they pulled together into a tight group 
around a heroic bronze statue of a lone sailor legs braced and 
shoulders squared as if against a gale then they reverently laid a 
wreath in tribute to fighting men of the sea this was the time for 
memories of combat and buddies lost 
at the final banquet the sea chanters a mixed chorus of the 
us navy band sang when anchors aweigh began the voices of 
the v12s their first reunion nearly over swelled again 
inundating the chorus special arrangement with billows of sound 
and finally there was a resolution that another navy v12 
national colloquium be held in 1993 the 50th anniversary year at 
an appropriate place and time 
the ayes had it with a roar

mud in his eye is as glamorous as concrete 
and as useful in building houses poor people can afford but while 
the ideas of egyptian architect hassan fathy have been readily 
accepted in the american west and elsewhere he has found mostly 
frustration in his homeland 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in his youth egyptian architect hassan 
fathy was determined to find a way to house the worlds poor 
as years became decades others sought answers in steel and 
concrete their highrises grew higher their little boxes dotted 
hillsides 
but fathy looking to the magic beneath him turned mud bricks 
volcanic rock and sand into design masterpieces for generations of 
young architects he became a prophet a picasso of the earth 
his sweeping domed creations with shaded courtyards and latticed 
windows mellowed the harshness of the relentless desert sun against 
the expanse of a windblown sahara 
they are seen not only in the middle east but on a sunbaked 
mesa in the american west reviving the use of mud brick or adobe 
in the islamic community dar alislam in abiquiu nm 
in the land of his birth however where housing problems are 
acute fathys remarkably simple solutions remain stillborn 
unable to convince either successive egyptian governments or the 
poor that mud is as glamorous as concrete fathy has found a 
following mainly among egyptian intellectuals and western 
architects 
now 89 and in ill health fathy has seen his world narrow but 
not his dreams surrounded by slender minarets saladins lusty 
citadel and scores of cats fathy struggles in his aerie above old 
cairo to complete projects for three egyptian oases 
hes nearly done 
people say to use mud bricks for housing is to take a step 
backward but in reality its turning forward fathy said in an 
interview concrete blocks bear no human reference 
its disgusting when you lose hope when you think your ideas 
are not being accepted in the right way when people you want to 
serve cant grasp dont want to understand every day in egypt 
around the world babies and children are dying from improper 
housing 
i have the answer but nobody will listen the answer is under 
foot 
an admirer is britains prince of wales an architectural critic 
who pays homage to fathy in his justpublished book a vision of 
britain 
a movement is developing which seeks to rediscover the islamic 
and indigenous heritage and to learn from the local environment 
the wisdom of ancestors who knew so well how to build 
appropriately for the prevailing climatic conditions prince 
charles writes 
people in the middle east are now listening with increasing 
interest to a remarkable egyptian architect called dr hassan fathy 
who for 40 years has had to put up with persistent vitriolic 
criticism and denigration by the modernist architectural 
establishment 
even so the worlds poor some 800 million remain out of 
reach for them fathy says there is no hope of decent housing 
until officials take a different view of their plight 
government officials cannot grasp how poor poor is he wrote 
in the nowclassic architecture for the poor standard reading 
in architecture courses around the world 
abandoned by god and man the poor live out their short 
diseased and ugly lives in the dirt and discomfort to which they 
are born they need decent houses but houses are expensive 
none of the apostles of mass production and prefabrication 
seem to realize just how poor an egyptian peasant is there is no 
factory on earth that can produce houses these villagers can afford 
how can people so poor that they cannot even afford to buy 
readybaked bread even dream of a factorymade house 
fathy says governments can save money and spur initiative by 
letting peasants form cooperatives to do the work themselves and 
encouraging them to use free or cheap materials according to their 
environment mud stone limestone wood or reeds 
once when a man wanted to build a house he would launch into 
some of the most complex and prolonged decisionmaking of his 
life fathy says it used to be the house of my father where 
every step had a meaning today it is the house of my uncle sam 
where every step has a dollar value 
peasant housing in egypt he says is vastly inferior to ancient 
housing mudbrick structures that often outlasted even pyramids 
domed with mudbrick walls arched to give life and air 
traditional housing gave way to what is seen in the egyptian 
countryside today lowslung hovels filled with smoke from cooking 
fires 
fathy struggled to discover what the ancients knew how to shape 
and curve mud bricks 
in 1941 his search took him to the southern egyptian village of 
gharb aswan where tradition hadnt clashed with modern technology 
every house was a wonder every house different he says 
a whole village of spacious lovely clean and harmonious houses 
each more beautiful than the last 
the impact is evident in any fathy design in 1980 he and two 
village masons soared arches and domes into the new mexico sky for 
americas first mudbrick mosque 
the americans were willing but not the egyptians he says 
americans have no inferiority complex theyre openminded 
that thought led fathy to recall his greatest heartache 
in the 1940s the egyptian government wanted to shift the 6000 
inhabitants of gourna a village on the west side of the nile 
opposite presentday luxor officials hoped transplanting the 
population would end a bustling centuriesold local business of 
tomb robbing 
hired to construct a mudbrick village fathy wanted each house 
to suit the needs of an individual family his ideals however 
immediately clashed with bureucratic dicta that said the poor were 
too ignorant to decide for themselves officials stopped the 
project the families were not transferred and buildings that had 
been finished remained empty a ghost town 
fathy chronicled his dashed hopes in architecture for the 
poor a peasant never talks about art he wrote he makes 
it 
fathy spent the next years designing public and private 
buildings in his homeland his stunning use of mud brick and other 
natural materials gradually earning him an international reputation 
when hassan fathy begins to design a house he never thinks if 
hes building for a prince or a pauper says nawal hassan a 
friend and adviser 
the aga khan foundation which recognizes islamic architectural 
excellence gave fathy its first chairmans award in 1980 noting 
his commitment to the poor and his extraordinary aesthetic 
sense and hailing him as a champion of indigenous building 
hassan fathy has taught us the value of environment the 
jury said he has shown us that the lessons to be learned are 
modern lessons

they are the quickstrike force in californias 
war on forest fires from nine helicopter bases around the state 
airborne firefighters attack small wildfires in an attempt to 
contain them before they spread its a job with no little peril 
since they often have no escape route 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
helicopter 901 clattered toward the towering 
pillar of smoke with six men and a woman who would charge the 
wildfire alone with only hand tools and little chance of getting 
away if things went badly 
just two weeks before a firestorm had trapped a crew from the 
helicopter attack or helitack base in vina with no escape route 
the firefighters weahered the inferno inside heatresistant fire 
tents it was too much for one of the firefighters who panicked 
and ran he was rescued by a crew captain and later was fired 
since 1973 one member of californias airborne firefighting 
corps has been killed and 11 have been seriously injured 
aboard helicopter 101 fire protection capt dan burns of the 
state department of forestry explains that once the helicopter 
drops off the firefighters they are largely on their own 
were breaking all the rules by going in in front of the fire 
and watching our escape route fly away he says 
the idea is to swiftly control a small fire before it gets big 
california which claims to have the largest firefighting force 
in the world places more emphasis on helitack than does the us 
forest service which has had to reduce crew sizes to five or less 
due to budget cutbacks california with nine helicopter bases has 
more helitack units than any other state 
air 901 is five minutes out radioes pilot jim costa his 
eyes scanning the flames racing over a mountain on a rugged 
oakstudded ranch in tehama county northwest of chico 
gloved hands of the crew members recheck yellow fireresistant 
suits plastic helmets and belts bristling with up to 30 pounds of 
gear 
each member of the crew reduced by one to make room for a news 
reporter packs a booksize pouch containing one of the 
heatreflecting shake and bake tents they may have to dive into 
if they are overtaken by fire 
hand signals flash across the cramped compartment of the 
limegreen uh1f huey helicopter one of the workhorses of the 
vietnam war 
suddenly the helicopter tilts so the crew is staring out side 
windows at flames below as 901 circles the blaze the two crew 
captains and pilot in a clipped language of their own pick a 
landing zone and path of attack for the firefighters 
this is the kind of fire that will be up to us to hold says 
burns the 35yearold lead captain 
air tankers dispatched to drop fire retardant had yet to arrive 
fire engines were still lumbering over winding roads miles away 
the chopper touches down in an explosion of dust at the base of 
the mountain the crew swings into action 
some pull shovels and hoelike brooms from an outside 
compartment uncomfortably close to searing jet exhaust spewing 
into the 100degree day 
others unpack a bag and hook it under the helicopter so the 
ship stripped of the crews weight could drop water from a nearby 
pond on the blaze and on the firefighters if things go badly 
the crew bounds up the mountain 
the helicopter that should have lifted off behind them did not 
an air controller in a small fixedwing airplane overhead had 
ordered it to hold within seconds an air tanker roars over 
dropping retardant the helicopter climbs and swings toward the 
pond 
burns waves half the crew one way around the fire capt mike 
rivas with the rest goes the other way flames lick at their 
elbows as they hack control lines through walls of smoke 
fire snakes through grass dying at the control line an inferno 
in an oak tree dies in a crushing torrent of water dumped by the 
helicopter 
twenty minutes after landing there came cheers of victory the 
firefighters had linked up after encircling the fire their job was 
done ground crews were arriving 
the engine crews would handle mop up the tedious 
slogthroughtheashes job of dousing every last ember 
investigators would probe the cause but it was evident a jeep 
pile of firewood and chainsaw had been abandoned on the hilltop 
the helitack crew which had held the blaze to three acres 
would fly back to base to be in place for the next run 
the helicopter is playing an increasing role in wildland 
firefighting because it is more like a fire engine than an air 
tanker according to a recent state study besides shuttling a 
helitack crew and dropping water it can be used for 
reconnaissance rescue evacuation and cargo delivery 
the effectiveness of the program is reflected in this years 
statistics in california as of sept 25 6056 fires had burned 
68880 acres down from last years 6831 blazes over 167696 acres 
the human cost of the 16yearold program is high at times 
helitack crewman denis lee cullins was burned to death in a 1987 
fire in northern californias mendocino region 
the vina crew itself was forced to deploy fire shelters as a 
wall of flames roared at them during lassen countys eagle fire in 
july 
we could hear the fire and the wind roaring from inside the 
tents says mike weaver a 22yearold crew member with five 
years of helitack experience 
a firefighter with less experience ran instead of deploying a 
fire tent rivas 33 finally was able to hold up one of the 
shelters so he and the firefighter could stand behind it 
it wasnt planned i wasnt trying to be a hero or anything 
rivas says 
no one was injured but the firefighter was fired

clinging to the southern flank of 
the mount mckinley massif is a snug shelter of glass and wood a 
place with an indoor view of one of the worlds most astounding 
outdoor scenes 
people come to the sheldon mountain house to climb staggering 
walls of gray rock ringing the ruth glacier to ski or just to look 
and listen they gaze at the intricacies of mckinley north 
americas tallest peak and its cousins mount dan beard and the 
ragged rooster comb they listen to the quiet of the alaska 
twilight hear the wind and the sliding snow 
the hexagonal house is a simple place in an extraordinary 
environment 
the structure can become a solarium as sun beats through the 
large windows on five of six sides the building at 5810 feet 
also is a shelter from the fierce storms of the alaska range 
the house in a glacial amphitheater with a clear view of 
20320foot mckinleys summit is a halfhour flight from 
talkeetna the trip takes in the confluence of three rivers miles 
of scrubby black spruce and brown tundra dozens of ponds brown at 
first and then brilliant blue as the glacial moraine appears below 
toothy pinnacles jut toward the sky as the plane drones through a 
gorge 
the late bush pilot don sheldon designed the mountain house and 
supervised its construction in 1966 he acquired five acres in the 
ruth amphitheater before it became part of denali national park and 
preserve 
the house was built for use by mountaineers photographers and 
sightseers 
its been booked solid for the last five or six years says 
roberta sheldon who was the radio operator when her husband landed 
skiequipped airplanes on ruth glacier its been a gradual 
evolution just like the growth of the tourist industry in 
talkeetna 
the house is perched on a jagged outcropping about 100 feet 
above a snowfield that serves as a runway 
the glaciers are moving and changing sheldon says it was 
hard to find a stable place to build the house 
once it was built the 196squarefoot house proved up to the 
test of 20 years of harsh weather and seasonal occupancy 
sixtyfive dollars buys a nights lodging and wood for the 
stove an outhouse stands 50 yards away 
the house is furnished with four cushioned benches that double 
as beds visitors are expected to bring sleeping bags and their own 
food although previous occupants have left supplies cereal 
canned stew four kinds of mustard pancake mix and real maple 
syrup are among the provisions 
packed along two walls of the oneroom house is more culinary 
equipment including a wok than many home kitchens can claim 
there are things to read in this mountain studio as well books 
and magazines line part of a shelf along with scrabble and other 
games a chinup bar fashioned from a stick of firewood a 
mountaineers carabiner and nylon webbing hangs from the slanted 
ceiling 
but for the landings and takeoffs by planes that use the 
iceandsnow runway below the house it would be insulated from the 
world outside at the height of the summer tourist season light 
planes carrying sightseers interested in 10 minutes on ruth glacier 
land several times an hour 
noise echoes from one ridge to another as the planes come and 
go the snow acting as a brake that allows them to land in 
onefourth the space needed for takeoff 
users of the mountain house over the years have included 
organized mountaineering groups genet expeditions of anchorage 
rented the building during the month of may for several years with 
the house serving as a base of operations and clients sleeping in 
tents nearby 
it was nice to be able to dry out gear said mike howerton 
genet expeditions general manager and a guide it just made for a 
more comfortable recuperation area 
the house also has served as a base for mountain rescues 
howerton warns against a casual attitude about activities in the 
ruth area precautions that would be adequate in many other 
crosscountry ski areas arent enough here he recommends skiers 
rope themselves together for safety in case one falls into a 
crevasse while crossing the snow 
its a hassle but skiing roped is the only way to go up 
there howerton says its a place where you have to be very 
careful

time is on peter noones mind these days 
the former lead singer of hermans hermits the superstar 1960s 
english pop group now is host of my generation dedicated to 
the music that people his age grew up with 
its a halfhour show on cable televisions vh1 
noone who turned 42 today shows film clips of bands of the 
1960s and 70s 
when i was 14 i used to read the ages of these people they 
were 26 and 27 i thought these people are too old to be in rock 
n roll now you see the rolling stones these guys are ancient 
and theyre good i guess thats experience 
he also interviews musicians of his vintage on the show but not 
with the studioformality of desk and chairs instead he hits the 
road with his minicam 
when i go to rock n roll shows he says i take the 
camera with me with most people i can walk up and say will you 
do this bit for my tv show 
his interest in interviewing stars dates from his own days as a 
fledgling star 
when i was 16 i met elvis presley and interviewed him he 
says thats going to be on the show i met colonel parker in 
honolulu and said i wanted to interview elvis because im the 
biggest star in the world after him i said were playing the 
hula bowl tonight he asked how many tickets we sold i said 
100000 he said you can interview him 
its a short interview but its nice 
four different shows are seen each week each usually is 
repeated later the same evening 
noone usually features bands that had many hits instead of just 
one unless its one i like an example of the latter is the 
easybeats friday on my mind which noone calls a great 
workingclass song 
minimovie videos of hit singles postdate the my generation 
era but noone says there are plenty of tv clips and home movies and 
more turn up all the time 
on the show he sometimes tells anecdotes about the music stars 
he knew in the 1960s he also knew some of their families keith 
richards father was a fat jolly man i knew john lennons father 
better than i knew john he was a great raconteur george 
harrisons sister went to school with my sister 
hermans hermits formed in 1962 first came to america in 1964 
it had its biggest year in 1965 and broke up in 1971 its 
bestremembered hits are mrs brown youve got a lovely 
daughter im henry the eighth i am and theres a kind of 
hush 
noone didnt leave show business after the demise of hermans 
hermits he sang solo in 1982 he was the fourth singer to play 
frederic in the pirates of penzance on broadway early this 
year cypress records released im into something good noones 
remake of hermans hermits first hit for the movie the naked 
gun 
noone still travels with a new yorkbased band 
weve rehearsed 100 songs from the 60s 70s and 80s he 
says if they call for ferry across the mersey which was gerry 
and the pacemakers hit we do it of course we play anything 
he even does an imitation of johnny cash singing pinball 
wizard from the whos rock opera tommy i think the 
audience needs a laugh sometimes 
noone is from a liverpool family he and an older sister grew up 
in manchester living with their grandmother while their father 
who got out of the royal air force in 1947 went back to college 
my youngest brother is 17 there are just five of us but were 
all spread out 
when a celebration of the 25th anniversary of hermans hermits 
first american tour was held in new york recently noones 
3yearold daughter thought it must be daddys birthday and asked 
where his cake was 
married 21 years noone and his wife live in santa barbara 
calif 
another current project of noones is producing a record for the 
english group johnny hates jazz the leader is the son of mickie 
most the producer who made hermans hermits records he says 
wed be in the studio and hed say this song isnt working out 
lets go out and have a beer wed come back and it would usually 
work

the blonde pigtails have been gone for more than 
30 years replaced today by what looks like a modified farrah 
fawcett cut but patty mccormack still has that impish almost 
wicked smile theatergoers remember from the bad seed 
she has done other things but mccormack will be identified 
forever with that horror classic in which she played rhoda penmark 
a sweet polite 8yearold murderer the maxwell anderson drama 
was a hit on broadway in 1954 and two years later became a 
successful movie for which mccormack received an academy award 
nomination 
its so hard when you do something thats noticed so much 
especially if you continue to work the 44yearold actress says 
now you can have credits up to here but not everybody knows 
them the one people focus on is the one that got the notoriety 
but there was life after little rhoda a marriage two 
children movies a shortlived tv series guest shots on numerous 
other television shows and stage appearances mostly on the west 
coast now mccormack has begun a national tour in rumors the 
neil simon comedy smash that will take her across the country 
during the next nine months 
rehearsals for the tour brought her back to a new york theater 
for the first time since the bad seed and triggered memories of 
her days here as a child actress 
growing up i always played people who had a peculiar side to 
them she says i never did sandra dee roles i always looked 
like something else was going on 
so much of the work we did back then on television was 
theaterlike even the procedure we had three weeks rehearsal 
and we tried things and threw them out if they didnt work not 
like television today you dont rehearse 
mccormacks career began in the early 50s in new york when her 
mother a former professional roller skater carted her off to 
auditions 
things just seemed to happen i had a terrible lisp and my 
mother took me to this woman to correct it she recalls and 
the woman had show business connections 
it led to her first broadway show touchstone with ossie 
davis which ran for one week the following year she was a star 
in the bad seed 
i had the same growing difficulties that anybody had people 
would say about me youre such a normal kid and of course i 
wasnt but i kept thinking i am a normal kid i am a normal 
kid and thats confusing 
i did what i did purely as a kid because kids are almost 
natural actors but then as life goes on you try to be this for 
that person and that for this person and you kind of get lost in 
the shuffle and i think i did im coming to terms with that now 
the film version of the bad seed brought a nearly teenage 
mccormack to hollywood where she did movies like kathyo and 
her own television series called pecks bad girl 
at 16 my interest in show business dropped says the 
daughter of a new york firefighter i was confused what do i 
really want to be of course we still ask that but we dont tell 
anyone 
kid actors have a hard time in life maybe its because you 
dont know who to be 
i moved back to new york i went to new utrecht high school in 
brooklyn i worked real hard at being anonymous i even took back 
my real name which is patty russo 
from the time she was 18 to 21 mccormack abandoned acting she 
went to beauty school sang with a rock n roll band mikey vee 
and the imperials and worked in a talent agency for child models 
i traveled into the city like i played another part i was 
trying things i had a real job mccormack says 
then she started to miss show business at age 21 she went back 
to los angeles and slowly began working again she got married in 
1967 and had two children bobby and danielle 
i had this fantasy about being the perfect mommy but then my 
marriage didnt last she recalls so half the characters were 
gone work again became important to me 
for a while during her career most prominently when she was in 
the abc television series the ropers mccormack changed her 
professional name to patricia mccormack 
i thought if i was called patricia i would stand up taller 
and feel like the woman i didnt feel like she says and of 
course it didnt help at all then i thought well this is 
absurd a name does not do it for you plus i was with someone at 
that time who liked it i was influenced by what he thought but it 
didnt change anything 
today mccormack again thinks of herself as a working actress 
she works regularly on television having just completed an 
episode of the syndicated series freddys nightmares in it 
she gets her eyes gouged out 
it was fun she giggles i guess i still have a bizarre 
sense of humor 
before i got married and had my kids i did a tour of another 
neil simon play barefoot in the park mccormack says it was 
the first play i had done since the bad seed and that was 
frightening but i fell right into it

grimfaced the teenage boys squatted 
around a kurdish guerrilla showing them how to strip and assemble a 
machine gun soon they would be using the weapon in a conflict 
that is almost 70 years old the kurds fight for an independent 
homeland in iran 
the iraqibacked kurdish democratic party of iran has in recent 
weeks stepped up its attacks on iranian military bases and economic 
targets 
guerrilla chieftains at the kdp base camp here in the iraqi 
mountains said the youngsters will go into action as their fathers 
and grandfathers have before them in the mountains of northwestern 
iran 
they get three months training in weapons explosives and 
guerrilla tactics then join units inside iran to carry out 
hitandrun attacks said the camp commander who would identify 
himself only as salam 
it is a war that has largely been overshadowed by kurdish 
campaigns in neighboring turkey and in iraq itself in southeastern 
turkey the outlawed kurdish labor party has been fighting a 
guerrilla war for five years to establish a separate marxist state 
about 20 million kurds sunni moslems of aryan stock live in 
an overlapping area where the borders of soviet armenia iran 
iraq syria and turkey converge a region once known as kurdistan 
iraq iran and turkey all have faced rebellions by their kurdish 
minorities but iraq is nonetheless backing the iranian kurds in an 
extension of its decadesold rivalry with iran 
iran backed iraqi kurds in their war against the government in 
baghdad during the 8year iraniraq war syria aids kurdish 
fighters in turkey 
the kdp fighters clearly with iraqi consent stepped up their 
attacks after their veteran leader abdulrahman qassemlou was 
assassinated july 13 in vienna austria 
his successor saeed badal said qassemlou went to vienna in 
response to an offer from irans president hashemi rafsanjani to 
negotiate an end to the kurdish rebellion 
badal said he believes qassemlou was killed by agents of radical 
iranian factions in an attempt to torpedo rafsanjanis efforts to 
end the mountain war a move that would have strengthened his 
credibility as a pragmatist 
saeed said the kdp has turned down an iranian proposal to 
resume negotiations because we no longer trust them 
the guerrillas known as peshmergas or those who face 
death say hundreds of young iranian kurds have joined them in 
recent months 
kurdish chieftains decline to divulge their strength but claim 
they are pinning down some 200000 iranians diplomatic sources in 
baghdad estimated that as many as 2500 kdp guerrillas are in iraq 
with thousands more operating inside iran 
everybody in my village said the peshmergas are working for a 
better future for the kurdish nation so i decided to join them 
said farouk hassan pour 14 who trekked across the mountains for 
seven days until the guerrillas found him 
about 200 youngsters are undergoing guerrilla training in this 
camp high in the northern iraqi mountains overlooking the iranian 
border 
in the camp are about 1000 guerrillas dressed in their 
distinctive baggy trousers and turbans several thousand kurdish 
women and children live in villages in the surrounding valleys 
the kdp runs the camp but the area is under iraqi military 
control the guerrillas are not allowed to leave without iraqi 
permission 
the kurds grow their own vegetables and tend their cattle in the 
lush uplands the iraqis provide flour rice and fuel oil 
a rehabilitation center has been set up in the camp for 
guerrillas who have lost limbs among the 30 undergoing therapy is 
ismail muradi 23 who lost an arm in a recent raid 
i dont care if i have to live in this camp deprived of the 
good things of life for 50 years so long as the next generation 
of kurds can live as free human beings said muradi who joined 
the guerrillas last year 
a fivemember french medical team from two relief agencies 
medecins sans frontieres and international medical aid operates a 
makeshift hospital in the base the team alternates with others who 
spend threemonth tours in the mountains 
conditions are pretty primitive said dr jean breveau a 
surgeon from paris who is on his third tour weve eliminated 
serious diseases but theres a lot of malnutrition and back pains 
which are common among mountain people 
breveau who also has worked in africa and with tamil rebels in 
sri lanka off southern india said he misses life in paris and his 
family 
but these people need my help more than the people of paris 
he said theres a great satisfaction when you save someone who 
would have died if there had been no surgeon 
the kurds were promised an independent state in the treaty of 
sevres of 1920 but the great powers sliced up kurdistan among 
iran iraq and turkey 
since then the kurds have been in a constant state of revolt 
against one or more of these states the kurdish revolt in persia 
which later became known as iran began in 1920 
kurdish hopes of selfrule have been hampered by internal 
rivalries that have prevented a unified strategy 
nonetheless morale among the iranian kurds in iraq appears high 
qader agha ibrahimi an 83yearold former iranian army officer 
joined the rebels 43 years ago when the soviets seized part of 
northern iran in 1945 and set up the shortlived kurdish mahabad 
republic 
it lasted only about a year before the iranians reclaimed the 
territory its the closest the kurds anywhere have ever come to 
having an independent state 
ive spent half my life fighting for freedom and kurdistan 
said ibrahimi now frail and going deaf theyve been hard 
difficult years but i still believe that one day we will win 
one of his sons was killed fighting the iranians three others 
are in iran 
ive never laid down my gun the grizzled old warrior said 
patting his ak47 assault rifle

a 5yearold war between marxist kurdish 
guerrillas and security forces is driving thousands of kurdish 
civilians from their villages in southeastern turkey to safer areas 
of 2000 people killed so far in the conflict at least 700 have 
been listed as kurdish farmers 
guerrillas of the outlawed kurdish labor party are fighting to 
establish an independent marxist state in the kurdish areas in 
eastern and southeastern turkey 
the scope of the support they have from kurdish civilians could 
not be independently determined but kurdish resentment toward 
turkish security forces has been building it reached a high poiint 
in midseptember when a crowd clashed with police in the township 
of silopi while protesting the killing of six kurds a few days 
earlier 
the security forces maintained the victims were guerrillas but 
local residents claimed they were farmers taking fruit to the town 
market the locals charged the victims were shot as suspected 
rebels 
an investigating group from turkeys parliament bore them out 
it is very sad but the people are right said nurettin 
yilmaz a member of parliament from premier turgut ozals 
motherland party our investigation in the town and taped 
testimony of many witnesses support their claim 
yilmaz and two other parliament members have urged the 
prosecution of those responsible 
for years the local kurds have complained that if they dont 
help the guerrillas they risk being killed by them if they do 
help them they face imprisonment by the security forces and 
sometimes torture 
security officials contend it is difficult to distinguish the 
guerrillas from the farmers and herdsmen of the 300 small hamlets 
in the region 
some officials acknowledge that local support for the guerrillas 
is increasing mainly out of fear and in some cases because of 
mistreatment by government forces 
residents complain most about the special antiterrorist police 
in the southeastern area the parliament group said 
maybe it is because of their commando training but they are 
very harsh with the local people yilmaz said 
the people are increasingly becoming alienated from the state 
there is cause for anxiety said fuat atalay a social democrat 
from diyarbakir the largest province in the area 
during a recent parliamentary debate interior minister 
abdulkadir aksu said that only those suspected of aiding and 
harboring guerrillas were detained 
he contended that police and soldiers were trying to save lives 
in an area where he said the guerrillas had killed 618 civilians 
and 336 security personnel in the past two years 
however the aspirations and grievances of the kurdish minority 
a taboo subject in turkey until recent years now find expression 
even in parliamentary debates in ankara 
members from the kurdish areas are demanding increased 
government investment in the kurdish provinces where the jobless 
rate of 35 percent is double the national average 
the kurds also are demanding that the education publications 
and broadcasts in the kurdish language now forbidden be allowed 
like ostrichs burying their heads in the sand we are still 
debating in this day and age whether there are kurds in turkey 
said yilmaz

this is one of a series of periodic reports 
looking ahead to western europe in 1992 when the 12 nations of the 
european economic community remove their trade barriers and 
interlock their economies policies and goals 
</TEXT>

belgians jokingly call a morning train that 
pulls out of brussels with mostly middleclass passengers to nearby 
luxembourg le train des fraudeurs the cheaters train 
the nickname stems from the financial business assumed to be 
carried on by the trains passengers in luxembourg which has long 
lured investors because of its strict banking secrecy and tax 
breaks 
but the country which is smaller than rhode island and 
overshadowed by neighboring belgium france and west germany has 
been honing other financial skills to compete in the single market 
that will be created in late 1992 when the 12 nations of the 
european economic community take down old trade barriers that 
restrict the free movement of people money goods and services 
local officials appear to want to shed luxembourgs image as a 
savings and tax haven several interviewed played down the 
importance of the countrys secrecy and tax provisions 
whatever the grand duchy of luxembourg a country of just 
372000 people about the same as cincinnati ohio clearly has 
appeal 
luxembourg now has 156 banks only a handful american many of 
which are on boulevard royal known as luxembourgs wall street 
about 650 investment funds and some 100 reinsurance companies 
also operate from here the stock market trades some 8400 issues 
about 75 percent of which are bonds denominated in dollars or major 
european currencies 
in an interview prime minister jacques santer expressed 
satisfaction with the financial center 
it has not only grown but has also developed its own 
specificity and is now competitive with all other bigger 
centers he said in his office at government house 
the center was hurt by the banking crisis in the early 1980s 
when major developing countries were unable to meet their foreign 
debt payments 
but it has since rebounded and the outlook remains bright 
according to analysts 
among the advantages they cite are the countrys social and 
political stability central location in the european economic 
community strong government support and multilingual population 
it also has no central bank to apply credit controls or reserve 
requirements on banks as a means of shaping monetary policy 
moreover a recent report from the organization for economic 
cooperation and development a group of 24 industrialized nations 
remarked on the countrys pluses 
one of the special attractions of the luxembourg financial 
market from a tax standpoint is that there is no withholding tax on 
dividend or interest payments for nonresidents and that 
stockmarket transactions are not taxed 
here too changes in the taxation system corporation tax 
reduced from 40 to 34 percent between 1987 and 1989 the abolition 
of stamp duty on securities issues mean that the grand duchy now 
ranks as one of the worlds most attractive financial markets 
still another advantage it said was a decision this year to 
spell out the right to banking secrecy in relation to tax 
authorities disclosure of information about customers bank 
accounts is prohibited except in criminal cases 
moves to strengthen the financial center will no doubt help 
luxembourg compete in the 1992 market that will be formed when the 
eec lifts the trade barriers 
the eec already has approved measures requiring the lifting of 
controls on the movement of capital or money by july 1 
france and italy which still have some restrictions on foreign 
bank accounts held by their citizens intend to comply possibly 
before that date lessadvanced member nations portugal spain 
ireland and greece have more time to do so 
the oecd report cautions that the single market drive means 
that luxembourg will almost certainly have to adjust again to 
changes in the international financial environment 
it warns about moves to impose a europeanwide withholding tax 
on interest income 
the european commission the eecs executive body unveiled a 
plan earlier this year for a minimum withholding rate of 15 percent 
throughout the trading bloc it was later scaled down to 10 percent

the proposal requiring unanimous approval was fought by 
luxembourg and other countries 
i think at this point it is a dead issue said prime 
minister santer 
in pushing the measure the commission argued it was needed to 
halt tax evasion once capital controls were lifted 
there is thus a risk that once investors are free to open 
bank accounts in other member states they will not declare their 
interest income to their national tax authorities and will thus 
illegally evade payment of tax it said 
that might lead it added to a substantial loss of revenue in 
many countries 
west german authorities introduced a 10 percent withholding tax 
at the start of the year only to repeal it in the summer analysts 
believe a substantial amount of money flowed out of the country 
some into luxembourg 
most analysts do not expect much to happen on july 1 since many 
capital controls already have been lifted 
james cornish european markets strategist at county natwest in 
london noted however in principle if theres a lot of money 
pent up in italy by the restrictions the money could flow out 
fresh from apparent victory on the withholding front 
luxembourgers shrug off suggestions they might be hurt by greater 
competition from other money centers 
weve always had open frontiers said fernand rau managing 
director of credit european a subsidiary of a belgian bank and 
head of the national legislatures finance committee 
we are probably the country least concerned among all the 12 
with the lifting of capital controls in 1990 he said 
jean krier senior executive vice president of the banque 
international of luxembourg and president of the luxembourg 
association of banks and bankers agreed luxembourg has certain 
advantages which cannot disappear 
the nations bankers must be innovative to keep pace santer 
said 
the bigger the capital markets where a banking center can 
operate the more opportunities there are of course the more 
competition there is said pierre jaans general director of the 
luxembourg monetary institute 
officials believe some banks want to move to luxembourg before 
the 1992 deadline for the europeanwide market 
the number of banks has grown from 112 in june 1984 to 156 now 
officials expect it to reach 160 by years end 
the majority of the banks have european parents with west 
germans topping the list at 37 banks as of june 
banks with luxembourg or belgian roots reached 19 and 13 were 
counted as swiss only nine were american the same as japanese 
luxembourgers bridle at questions about dirty money operations 
often attracted to banking centers steeped in secrecy 
the legislature recently enacted a measure setting tough 
penalties for the laundering of drug money 
we have no interest to have this reputation and therefore 
we are very strongly against this situation santer said 
agreed jaans since we are so small we have to be 
particularly cautious 
the united states last year accused a bank owned by a luxembourg 
holding company of taking part in an international ring that 
laundered millions of dollars in profits for the colombian cocaine 
trade the bank denied the charges

irelands economy is surging ahead but 
its a long long way to full employment 
inflation is down to a modest 4 percent and economic growth is 
expected to surpass 5 percent next year exports are projected to 
reach an alltime high of 193 billion this year with a trade 
surplus of nearly 700 million 
unemployment has decreased from 197 percent in january 1987 
but only to 173 percent and the rate of emigration has climbed 
ireland is enjoying a very strong recovery from a fairly 
dismal period of no growth says john fitz gerald a senior 
researcher at the economic and social research institute in dublin 
the indicators have improved just since summer fitz gerald 
said and the institute has revised its economic growth forecast 
for this year upward by a full percentage point 
the institute forecasts that growth will stay above 4 percent a 
year through 1993 inflation will remain low and the government can 
expect budget surpluses by 1992 
there are few economies in the industrialized world now in a 
position to make the kind of optimistic projections we can or to 
point to such an improvement in such a short space of time prime 
minister charles haughey said recently 
the emphasis now must be on translating rising economic growth 
into more jobs he added 
while the unemployment rate has declined in the past two years 
it still is nearly double the average of 93 percent in the 
12nation european economic community of which ireland is a 
member only spain at 174 percent reported worse 
there are fewer people with jobs in ireland than there were in 
1950 says the rev sean healy of the justice office of the roman 
catholic conference of major religious superiors 
as the number of jobless more than doubled in the 1980s the 
economic institute reported the standard of living for the 
unemployed declined that decline it added may continue despite 
the upward trend of the economic indicators 
emigration a signal of irish distress since the famine days of 
the 19th century is on the rise again the governments central 
statistics office reported that 46000 people left in the 12 months 
through last april up from 32000 the year before 
a recent report based on the 1986 census found that net 
migration from ireland between 1981 and 1986 totaled 72000 
twothirds of them 15 to 24 years old 
the economic institutes survey predicted that ireland will add 
82000 jobs and cut emigration to 11000 by 1994 unemployment is 
projected to drop to 127 percent 
ireland bailed itself out of deep deficits by slashing public 
spending supported by a broad informal coalition of the 
politically dominant parties of the right 
when haughey called an election this past summer however his 
fianna fail party found the voters unhappy about austerity 
especially cuts in the health service fianna fail lost seats and 
haughey clung to power by forming a coalition a deeply unpopular 
move within his own ranks with a splinter party 
fianna fail irelands dominant party since the 1930s no longer 
pursues the dream of a gaelicspeaking mostly rural and united 
island espoused by eamon de valera the party founder and former 
prime minister and president 
like other mainstream parties it aspires to a united ireland 
indeed that goal still features prominently in the constitution 
drawn up by de valera but under the 1985 angloirish agreement 
ireland has accepted that northern ireland can only become part of 
ireland when a majority of the british provinces people want to 
in its seventh decade of independence from britain this nation 
of 36 million people is still remarkably dependent on the british 
economy which absorbs 30 percent of irelands exports and the 
largest portion of irish emigres 
in economic terms the people of the republic of ireland have 
reason to envy the life in northern ireland a married couple in 
dublin earning 25000 irish pounds pays 9625 pounds in tax while 
a couple in belfast earning 25000 british pounds pays 5467 pounds 
in income tax 
the cost of living in dublin excluding rent matches london 
though wages are 27 percent lower according to a 1988 survey by 
the union bank of switzerland 
making a virtue of adversity the governments industrial 
development authority is promoting ireland as a lowcost base 
within the european economic community whose members are to 
abolish internal tariff barriers by the end of 1992 and create a 
single market of 320 million people 
labor costs in ireland averaged about 10 an hour in 1988 
compared with 1121 in britain and 1838 in west germany the 
development authority says 
fitz gerald says improvements in employment are restrained by a 
baby boom now working its way through the schools the children 
from the peak of that boom are now 9 years old and will be entering 
the job market within a decade 
though the constitution no longer grants a special role to the 
roman catholic church ireland remains 93 percent catholic and 
divorce and abortion are illegal 
even though the birth rate has fallen by more than 25 percent 
from 1980 to 1987 it remains the highest in the european economic 
community at 166 per 1000 
michael barry senior lecturer at the national college of 
industrial relations in dublin says that unless ireland reduces 
its population growth it risks becoming a permanent lowwage 
economy and a backwater and peripheral slum region of the new 
enlarged europe 
he does not believe ireland can ever support all its people at 
current rates of growth 
with the industrial development policy with its very best 
efforts to attract foreign companies they have only managed to 
replace jobs lowwage jobs with highwage jobs barry said in 
an interview

the ladder of ambition for some of the 
young men in old dublin begins with breaking a car window then 
stealing whats inside the car then stealing a whole car 
then they burn it without stripping a few saleable parts 
they dont think that far says gus monaghan who works with 
young school dropouts in the rough and ready streets of the 
liberties hoping to steer them away from a life of breaking into 
cars 
the neighborhood where jonathan swift wrote gullivers 
travels and george frideric handel premiered his messiah can 
be described today by what it lacks parks jobs and for many a 
future 
at a school established by the south inner city commmunity 
development association monaghan starts with the basics teaching 
often unruly young school dropouts how to iron a shirt cook a meal 
or do simple carpentry 
these young people have never been asked to accept the 
consequences of their own actions says david orr the schools 
director 
they and their neighbors are quite unprepared for any economic 
miracles that may occur orr added 
if toyota walked in here and created 2000 jobs there would 
be no one here to take them he said 
the liberties so called because it is outside the medieval city 
walls stands apart from an irish economy that is generating record 
trade surpluses and strong economic growth of 5 percent this year 
that fortunate dublin is seen on grafton street where ralph 
lauren and laura ashley set the marketing tone but not on meath 
street the gritty strip in the liberties where the inner city 
assocation has its offices 
its a different world really says roisin elliott whose 
work at the association includes counseling frightened people in 
debt to loan sharks 
employment at the guinness brewery the neighborhoods biggest 
industry has dropped from 4000 jobs two decades ago to 1400 
liam fenlon who is chairman of the associations board says 
the group has put 175 young people to work people who normally 
never ever got work threefourths of whom i have no hesitation in 
saying would end up in jail 
the schools courses include woodworking sewing and 
photography and it is placing 60 percent or more of its graduates 
in fulltime jobs he says 
three students have been studying german and will go to west 
germany for three months work experience 
if i get a job ill stay because there is nothing here 
says jinet mcguinness 17 who left school three years ago 
glen duggan 17 also bound for germany joined the training 
program a year after being expelled from school for throwing 
chairs he explains then he drifted on the streets 
stephen domican 16 is learning carpentry and wants to stay in 
dublin but says the neighborhood needs more houses more jobs 
more construction 
others cannot wait to leave 
id go now but youre not allowed said audrey langley 15 
id hate leaving my family and friends and where you grew up 
and all she added still they cant expect you stay here and 
live on the dole for the rest of your life 
poverty is an ancient presence in the liberties 
jonathan swift the dean of st patricks cathedral raged at 
irelands deprivation and in 1729 offered a modest proposal for 
preventing the children of ireland from being a burden to their 
parents or country in that famous satire his modest proposal 
was to eat the young 
swifts grave in st patricks cathedral is a highlight of a 
liberties tour developed by the inner city association to create 
four parttime jobs 
margaret doyle always points out the banners of the order of st 
patrick in the cathedral and retells the story possibly 
apocryphal of how prospective members demonstrated aristocratic 
credentials 
you had to prove that your family hadnt worked in 200 
years she said well all qualify for it soon

for a decade now woody allen has maintained a schizoid quality 
in his films with broadway danny rose the purple rose of 
cairo and hannah and her sisters he has presented the 
familiar woody allen the heroically neurotic chronicler of the 
absurdities of urban living 
interiors september and another woman which allen 
wrote and directed but in which he did not appear reflected darker 
images derived from his idol ingmar bergman 
now the twain meet in crimes and misdemeanors like all of 
allens movies it is idiosyncratic highly original and 
thoughtprovoking but it is unexpectedly cynical 
two parallel but rarely converging plots deal with different 
segments of manhattan society one is show biz allen is a failed 
documentary maker whose devotion to esoteric subjects precludes his 
success his despairing wife jenny gleason wangles him a real 
job profiling her brother alan alda a highpowered television 
producer allen is repelled by the crassly commercial alda but 
intrigued by his aide mia farrow 
the other plot begins with a testimonial dinner extolling the 
good works of martin landau a rich ophthalmologist and benefactor 
with a loving wife claire bloom and family but for two years 
landau has had a fatal attraction to anjelica huston 
when his mistress grows impatient with unkept promises landau 
fears his comfortable world will collapse he finds a solution 
through his blacksheep brother with mob connections jerry orbach 
crimes and misdemeanors climaxes at a wedding where most of 
the cast converge there is an epilogue in which landau returns to 
his normal untroubled life 
despite the murky message the film can be enjoyed on more than 
one level allens dialogue is lucid and insightful and his 
skewering of televisions idiocies hits the target 
actors always seem to do their best work for allen landaus 
portrait of a good man susceptible to evil is brilliant alda

lawrence of arabia mca home video vhs 8995 rated pg 
 
when film students critics historians and other buffs are 
asked to list the best movies ever made lawrence of arabia 
appears with welldeserved frequency this majestic epic is 
cinematic poetry 
when the david lean masterpiece which introduced an unknown 
actor named peter otoole landed in new york on dec 17 1962 it 
opened with a few lovely touches including a program book complete 
with bibliographical and biographical material although called a 
camel opera by some wags and homoerotic by others because of 
its absence of women and glorification of men with men few could 
elude the movies raptures 
and the charms and cinematic seductions of lawrence of 
arabia still hold up on the small screen despite the thick black 
frame that allows cinemascope to be reduced 
whats being offered on video is a new restored version of the 
film which played theatrically earlier this year 
after a decade 32 minutes of the movie had been cut and one 
print contained a complete reversal lawrences watch is switched 
from hand to hand there were also original editing cuts made when 
the movie was first released to trim it for american audiences with 
a short attention span lean has restored some of those scenes at 
times calling some of his actors notably otoole into a studio to 
record new dialogue 
lean has added a scene in which lawrence rudely breaks up a 
snooker game at the officers club and a harem scene the flogging 
scene before a panting bey jose ferrer is more fully developed 
and suggests even more strongly the sexual connotations 
the restoration by robert a harris and anne coates who won an 
academy award for editing the original movie takes the film to a 
running time of 218 minutes the new version with an added 20 
minutes is still breathtaking but attempts to more deeply probe 
the elusive and enigmatic lawrence 
te lawrence was an arrogant cartographer in the british army 
who is sent to arabia to assist prince feisal alec guinness in 
the 191718 arab revolt against the ottoman empire he quickly 
adapts to the desert and the bedouin way of life he drinks water 
only when his guide does he eats the same tepid swill as they do 
he also becomes a messianic warrior whose strategy and wisdom are 
matched only by ego and obsession 
with his almost virginal white robes otoole with eyes the 
deep blue of the mediterranean and hair the color of golden straw 
struts about not with the swagger of the british gentleman but with 
the stance of a god indeed the exploits robert bolt so craftily 
chisels in his excellent screenplay paint lawrence as a demigod 
unlike many of todays filmmakers who take their audiences to be 
simpletons lean has a keen eye for detail and strives for cultural 
accuracy the costumes props blocking all hold up today 
lawrence of arabia could have been made in the 1980s the 
makeup however especially the shoe polish on guinness is dated 
the performances by a rash of stars who also include omar sharif 
in his western screen debut and anthony quinn are excellent but 
the movies real star is the desert with its smouldering dunes and 
poetry of colors

miss firecracker hbo home video vhsbeta 8999 rated 
pg13 
 
how much can one hope for in life not much but that still 
leaves a lot of room and as we learn in thomas schlammes miss 
firecracker anything is possible 
the key is to just be oneself and to honestly approach and 
embrace the opportunities in life beth henleys story drops enough 
homilies between the lines to stuff a goosefeatherfilled quilt 
but these wise little nuggets are drizzled with spice and wit and 
charm 
carnelle scott holly hunter a plain little thing who cleans 
fish in a catfish factory has spent her life in the shadow of her 
beautiful cousin elain a delicate but catty magnolia blossom who 
won the miss firecracker beauty contest in 1972 
carnelle whos known in town as miss hot tamale because of her 
lusty ways has held only one dream in life to win the pageant so 
when she reachs the cutoff age she dies her hair a brassy 
fireengine red and enters 
her main support is a young woman who is equally plain an 
endearing seamstress with the improbable name of popeye alfre 
woodard who taught herself to sew by making little outfits for 
her pet frogs as a child popeye whose brother threw gravel in her 
eyes when she was a child and then tried to ease the pain with 
eardrops hears through her eyes and sees beyond the surface of 
things in life she dreams of one day finding that one special love 
elain mary steenburgen returns to yazoo city for the contest 
to give a speech my life as a beauty her wild brother 
delmount tim robbins has just been released from an insane 
asylum after elain committed him for what she saw as his 
antisocial ways after a brief stint removing squished animals 
from highways he arrives in yazoo city to sell the family home 
it all comes together on the runway selfishness is exposed like 
an ugly boil loyality optimism and honesty glow 
henley who received a pulitzer prize for crimes of the 
heart in 1981 opened miss firecracker offbroadway to rave 
reviews in 1984 she wrote the screenplay for the movie version 
in portraits bursting with the magic and eccentricities of the 
same southern literary tradition that gave us william faulkner 
harper lee and tennesee williams henley has created memorable and 
rich characters these are real people not hollywood plastics 
hunter originated the role of carnelle offbroadway and is 
marvelously hyper as the unsophisticated unassuming beauty 
hopeful robbins is strangely maniacal but boyish and easy to love 
steenburgen who was born in arkansas plays magnolia blossom to 
the hilt and is delicious but it is woodard who steals the movie 
with her lovely innocence as popeye we know what love really means 
play this one for the entire family the language might be a 
little strong for younger children but the values are even 
stronger

the uptown string quartet philips diane monroe and lesa 
terry violins maxine roach viola eileen m folson cello 
 
and now for something completely different 
a listener needs a change now and again and this disc from the 
uptown string quartet is spring cleaning for jaded ears 
the name gives a clue a marriage of the string quartet with 
the sounds from far uptown beyond 110th street in manhattan a big 
shot of jazz a little rag a little blues a lot of polish 
listen to midnight child and its evident why the mix is so 
convincing the virtuoso notebending of the blues and gospel 
singers was born for the violin so too were the strutting 
rhythms of calvary and doggone if scott joplin didnt have 
strings in mind when he wrote easy winners 
it helps too that the four players are demon fiddlers whose 
various experiences include the philadelphia orchestra 
dreamgirls the new york philharmonic frank sinatra sammy 
davis jr wynton marsalis and producer max roachs double quartet 
yes it may seem a little strange but this is no beethovens 
ninth for massed accordion band kind of stunt each of a dozen cuts 
is perfectly idiomatic fresh piquant just right 
the uptown string quartet threatens to give crossover recordings 
a good name

trash epic alice cooper 
 
don henley recently complained that pop music has become 
moronic which would mean that alice cooper was way ahead of his 
time 
happily two decades after the release of his first record 
cooper still sounds moronic trash his latest album is 
impossible to take seriously and almost as hard to dislike 
dont be fooled by the biker sentiments the overwrought cooper 
spits out over grinding guitars these tunes are cartoons they 
have more in common with sam kinnison than judas priest 
no image is too obvious for cooper which is half the fun and 
he shows cleverness in other ways ill drive you like a hammer 
on a bed of nails cooper sings then the punch line ow ow 
ow ow ow 
the band is headbanger friendly guitarist john mccurry nicely 
frames coopers frenzy and guest appearances by aerosmith and jon 
bon jovi add to the fun 
there are some dead spots but such hormonal imbalances as im 
your gun and this maniacs in love with you make trash 
the funniest heavymetal record since spinal tap whether cooper 
intended it to be that way is really immaterial

french filmmaker jeanjacques annaud recently 
talked about why he has spent the last 10 years making three highly 
original films quest for fire the name of the rose and 
the bear 
i always see audiences begging for something different he 
said its difficult to make something different today many 
films have been made and there are many good filmmakers around to 
bring something fresh to the screen is difficult lets face it 
this is what pushes me its so pleasant seeing people come 
out of the cinema having the impression that they discovered 
something new they are happily surprised and i think thats a 
great reward 
the bear is unquestionably different based on the old james 
oliver curwood novel the grizzly king it tells the battles of 
a small cub and a huge male bear against hunters and nature the 
film already has grossed more than 100 million in europe 
the large part of the battle is to explain to the public the 
nature of this film its an entertainment its not documentary 
its not the oldfashioned disney animal picture its not a 
wilderness picture he said 
when i tell people my last film is about two bears theyre 
convinced its for kids its not a national geographic 
television special how can i explain to people that it is 
something that they have not seen yet fortunately when i arrived 
here the hollywood reporter said it was similar to et thank 
you 
annauds history with the bear dates back to 1981 when he 
had finished his prehistoric adventure quest for fire he fell 
in love with curwoods book then was sidetracked by the name of 
the rose 
the bear was launched in 1986 annaud himself a bear of a 
man with curly graying hair and a charming accent plunged himself 
into the new project exploring locations checking out bear 
trainers steeping himself in animal behavior 
the bear was filmed in europes dolomites from may 18 1987 
to the following sept 21 the difficulties with animals weather 
and managing a 200person crew were enormous but annaud was 
exhilarated by his actors 
bears are very fascinating animals he said they are as 
intelligent as dogs but they have something dogs do not they 
spend a lot of their time standing up because of that there is 
immediate identification with human beings 
take a lion a fascinating animal but it remains a beast a 
bear is a beast in the fourleg version very hairy very noisy 
its fascinating hes so powerful suddenly he stands up annaud 
demonstrates bearlike the front legs look like arms they use 
their paws like arms their claws like fingers if you see a bear 
eat an apple its just like a human 
the two principals were played by bart a baltimore zoo grizzly 
trained by doug seus of utah and douce sweet a cub from a 
french zoo were there days when the two stars simply didnt want 
to act 
of course said the director any star you work with has 
bad days stars are very temperamental so are bears you cannot 
push them in any case i would not advise a director to push a 
star a star must be happy in front of the camera especially when 
they are bears and they can kill you if youre not 
i swear that if you try to get something from an animal who is 
not in a good mood not only will you not get it that day you will 
never get it what you have to do is organize the set so the animal 
will be happy with its own instincts digging in its own nature to 
discover what it would do in such a circumstance he would in 
effect rewrite the script 
he cited the example of a scene in which the grizzly scratches 
its back on a tree the scene took days of preparation finding a 
tree with rough bark laying a cement platform at the base and 
covering it with moss surrounding the tree with rocks putting 
sand on the bears back so it would itch a few seconds on the 
screen the scene took a day to shoot 
my first concern with the film was that no animal would get 
hurt said annaud second concern although there is no society 
for the prevention of cruelty to technicians nor actors because 
theyre not endangered species i was very worried about working 
every day with those enormous monsters 
he became more worried toward the end of shooting because no 
incidents had occurred one girl had tried to remove her finger 
from the cubs mouth and nearly lost her finger when the cub bit 
down the only other casualty was annaud himself he foolishly 
posed for photographs with bart in the cage like some stars in the 
past bart turned on his director in a bad mood and decided to 
kill me 
annaud followed the safety instruction of playing dead when 
menaced and bart retreated 
a scene that amazes previewers comes when bart roars at hunter 
tcheky karyo at close range on a mountain ledge its the real 
thing the director assured bear and actor were a few feet apart 
but karyo had the option of leaping to a net 30 feet below 
the bear credits list jim hensons creature shop as creators 
of animatronic bears but annaud assured that the henson fakes 
were used only for battle scenes 
hensons contribution was to avoid putting the animals in any 
situation where they were at risk said annaud for instance i 
have a fight between bears and dogs as long as there is no body 
contact there is a real bear but when you see the dogs biting the 
fur you dont need a real bear but the fur needs life in it so 
that was where henson came in the same with a fight between the 
cub and a puma 
his next project 
i dont know even though the bear is a success in europe i 
want to see how it does here my films have not been terribly 
successful here i hope that will change

chantal kozyreff lives with one of a 
museums worst dilemmas to exhibit a treasure is to see it slowly 
fade into oblivion 
to avoid such loss brussels museum of art and history where 
kozyreff heads the far east department has had to keep its 7542 
japanese woodcut prints mostly under lock since it began collecting 
them a century ago 
to preserve the original coloring and sharpness of the 17th to 
19th century prints they have long been shielded from daylight 
and visitors in a cavernous room there the collection remained 
unknown but to a few cognoscenti 
for the europaliajapan art festival this fall however 
kozyreff has allowed 1000 of the lightsensitive prints to go on a 
unique display until december in the beauxarts palace of 
charleroi 31 miles south of brussels 
some of the prints have never been shown in public before and 
some may never be shown again said kozyreff 
the occasion has not been wasted on the critics who got a 
glimpse of the works of such masters as katsushika hokusai 
toshusai sharaku and suzuki harunobu all exhuming a rare freshness 
in hue 
a universe of elegance of refinement said the gazet van 
antwerpen newspaper lauding the nature scenes portraits of kabuki 
theater actors and glimpses of geishas 
you just will not believe your eyes praised de standaard 
the brussels daily added that the japanese prints show was the 
best of 33 exhibits in the europalia festival which is expected to 
draw more than 17 million visitors during its threemonth run 
every fortnight 200 different prints will be put under the 
dimmed lights of the beauxarts palace the rotation will limit 
damage to the works light changes the pigments of the ink and 
makes the old paper wither 
if you show it permanently it disappears said kozyreff 
comparing it to a tree leaf in fall she said if you leave it in 
the open it will shrivel 
anyway even looking at 200 stamps in one session is too much 
you can only concentrate on some 60 or it gets to be too much 
but one man who couldnt get enough was edmond michotte a 
belgian businessman who a century ago had a huge appetite for all 
things japanese 
when japan broke out of its isolation in the latter part of the 
19th century europe was stunned to discover such a rich artistic 
culture soon the first woodcut prints arrived in europe and were 
enthusiastically received 
vincent van gogh was so impressed he made a series of paintings 
of prints 
michotte managed to select the best woodcut prints before they 
even came off the boats and had amassed a superb collection by the 
turn of the century 
in 1904 he wrote the japanese gave up the finest of their art 
riches to foreigners the products left for london and paris by the 
hundred thousands 
because they were not unique pieces japan did not consider the 
prints national treasures prints from one woodcut could range in 
numbers from a few hundred to a couple of thousand but only the 
first few had a perfect sharpness 
soon the market was exhausted today the best woodcut prints are 
limited to some 20 collections worldwide 
apart from brussels two of the best collections outside japan 
are in bostons museum of fine arts and the art institute of 
chicago 
the prints have now become so rare that a sharaku recently 
fetched 345000 at an auction 
in 1905 michotte sold his 4666 prints to the museum of art and 
history the museum slowly added to that over the years 
the brussels collection stands out for its extraordinary 
sharpness in lines and richness in colors 
even in michottes days experts charged the colors were so 
fresh his prints had to be fakes it was not until 1970 before 
experts confirmed their authenticity beyond doubt kozyreff said 
many of the woodcuts are only known because brussels has the one 
remaining print

james mcmurtry is a softspoken man hell 
sit and talk about his music chainsmoking winstons and grinning 
when most people laugh but hed probably prefer to hand over his 
first album and let it talk for him 
since his lp too long in the wasteland came out in august 
hes been barraged by journalists looking for a story on the 
talented songwriter and son of a talented author his writing has 
been compared to that of his father author larry mcmurtry 
lonesome dove the last picture show and hes been 
compared to more than a few musicians 
hes heard it all lou reed with a texas accent mark knopfler 
with more of a country feel randy newman with a softer cynicism 
jerry jeff walker with a major record deal 
but hes actually just james mcmurtry with a guitar who takes it 
all in typical texas stride flattered but not pressured 
style is a retrospective thing he said recently leaning 
against the headboard of a motel bed if my songs are getting 
across then im doing my job 
james is only 26 years old but he writes like hes lived a 
lifetime said musician john cougar mellencamp who produced the 
album for columbia 
mcmurtrys father sent mellencamp a tape of his sons songs 
while the pair worked on a screenplay 
james lawrence mcmurtry comes from a schooled background his 
father a pulitzer prizewinner and his mother an english teacher 
at the university of richmond he spent most of his childhood in 
houston while his father taught at rice university and in archer 
city texas 
his father gave him a guitar when he was 7 and his mother made 
him learn to play it when she got tired of hearing me bang on the 
thing 
during his approximately four years at the university of 
arizona mcmurtry gradually became more interested in performing at 
the nearby saw mill cafe in tucson than in schoolwork 
at least one icon from his english classes made an impression 
though if listeners dont get the reference in the title song 
theres an apology in the liner notes to ts eliot who wrote the 
celebrated poem the wasteland 
i always liked eliot mcmurtry said i liked the way he 
twisted those words around 
the songs on too long in the wasteland fly by like an 
aimless drive from one end of texas to the other and back again 
mcmurtrys deadpan delivery provides the travelogue 
he muses about poor fools going through the motions in 
painting by numbers tells the story of a teen gone bad and 
trying to go good in terry goes home and wonders if he ought 
to leave the motor running in outskirts and poor lost soul 
and hangs around shooting the breeze in talkin at the texaco 
the last song lamenting smalltown life comes closest to the 
work of his father it calls on mcmurtrys experiences in archer 
city long a wealth of creative inspiration for larry mcmurtry 
who you lookin for what was his name you can probably find 
him at the football game mcmurtry sings a chorus of 
questionablesounding comrades swelling the background vocals 
its a small town know what i mean its a small town and we all 
support the team 
the words are work unless you accidentally come up with 
something that fits he explained i usually stumble onto a 
line write it down and start from the line theres no 
prearranged story 
at least one song comes straight from mcmurtrys life he got 
the idea for shining eyes a facethefacts song about a 
relationship in trouble from an episode with his girlfriend elena 
he was having a serious hearttoheart with elena on the phone 
upstairs at a rare book store in washington i heard the phone 
ringing downstairs and i just let it ring thats where that line 
comes from when a telephone rings in an empty room 
but unlike the song which ends in wistful ambivalence mcmurtry 
married elena a few weeks ago while hes on the road shes in 
austin where the couple have a house 
mcmurtry started out playing songs by guy clark and david 
bromberg in tucson and after tending bar and playing in san 
antonio he was encouraged by a friend to enter the kerrville folk 
festival in 1987 
he was one of six winners that year and met songwriter fred 
koller who told him to stop by if he ever made it to nashville 
mcmurtry did and they cut some songs one of which was considered 
for the soundtrack for his fathers lonesome dove miniseries 
but they decided they didnt want any words mcmurtry said 
by then mcmurtrys father had given the tape to mellencamp and 
after a few months of writing mcmurtry had enough songs to go into 
the studio 
he tries to stay away from the business side of the industry and 
focus on his music and as far as hes concerned the people at 
columbia have been very accommodating 
they must think im a draw now he grinned they havent 
told me to cut my hair or dress in leopard skins or anything 
mcmurtry wants to finish his road trip hes been touring since 
august and will quit just before christmas and then try to put 
some songs on paper and then on wax 
but he still remembers a longterm goal one he set when he was 
banging on the guitar his father gave him he laughs about it but 
it carries a bit of truth at the same time 
i wanted to grow up to be johnny cash

when howard norman isnt writing he lobbies 
actually he sits in lobbies hotel lobbies and especially movie 
lobbies 
the author likes watching people buy tickets and walk inside on 
a cold day he appreciates the smell and warmth of the popcorn 
maker and coffee machine and in his beloved savoy theater in 
vermont theres a book left out for suggestions 
so hotels and movie houses appear often in his work which 
includes the 1987 novel northern lights nominated for the 
national book award and the recently published kiss in the hotel 
joseph conrad summit 1895 a collection of short stories 
in lobbies one lives in a pure state of expectation said 
norman 40 youre in between youre sort of safe you havent 
been disappointed yet by anything that has happened 
youre off the street it has something to do with being 
protected and not responsible but being able to observe and take 
everything in 
lobbies are like sneak previews for norman opportunities for 
eavesdropping and observation in his stories lobbies are where 
young lovers meet old ones reunite and former actresses recapture 
their past 
in the title story of kiss in the hotel joseph conrad a man 
spends his entire life drifting from lobby to lobby as he pursues 
an unrequited love from his youth a woman who worked a kissing 
booth during world war ii 
i was trying to show how one single event can consume a 
person just seeing a woman and making that person your entire life 
without any rhyme or reason except for an emotional one he said 
i didnt want to psychologize too much in these stories its 
a conscious effort to take yourself out of the story you always 
tell young writers show dont tell 
norman born in iowa had traveled extensively in canada as a 
writer for wildlife magazines and learned the native languages well 
enough to produce three collections of translated works 
the death of a friend helped inspire northern lights in 
which a teenage boy noah shuttles between a broken home in 
toronto and life in quill a northern manitoba settlement where his 
best friend pelly has been killed in a freak accident 
the seasons are important in northern lights summers the 
time for experience are spent in quill as the days shorten and 
winter arrives noah returns home 
in summer youre out and time seems to be totally open to 
you norman said everything seems possible 
winter seems to have direct conflicts in terms of your sense 
of time it closes you in you have to bundle up ones moods are 
more acute these characters seem to be very moody characters 
the novels title is derived naturally from a movie theater 
that noahs mother purchases with the hope of bringing the family 
together in whatever lola wants a story from normans new 
book movies at the moonlight drivein theater shine on falling 
snow 
ive worked in two movie theaters one when i was 16 and one 
in college norman said the first time i went to work in a 
movie theater i thought thats what id be doing i saw it as a 
possible occupation so i guess in that sense there was a domestic 
aspect to it 
disappointment norman said is another important part of his 
work not just unrequited love but the loss of innocence the 
inability to enjoy life without complications 
in whatever lola wants the title character is a former 
actress from the 1940s who persuades her husband to show one of her 
old films white savage at the moonlight watching the film 
in which she is captured by cannibals lola sadly reflects on 
dreams long faded 
that scene when the camera is on me just before the cannibals 
arrive just by campfire light that way with everything about my 
face and character calm and brave and just right when i was a 
girl thats who i wanted to be 
the friendship of noah and pelly in northern lights is 
written with the same longing for simplicity 
i thought of how at that age you have a friendship without 
what happens later when you start to psychologize the author 
said the kind of friendship you have at that age which is why 
comingofage novels are fundamentally of such interest to people 
those friendships are unlike anything you have later youre 
almost entirely relating on an emotional level to the other person 
youre just interested in his company you arent alone 
but for norman the teenagers desire for companionship has 
given way to a writers need for privacy even in a crowded lobby 
it has something to do with the fact that as you get older 
you feel your time is less your own he said you have 
responsibilities like money no matter how isolated youre living 
your time is precious 
you can live vicariously in a hotel lobby like the algonquin 
you watch people come and go just sit in the lobby and totally 
live a vicarious existence

billy crash craddock who had a 
litany of hits in the 1970s but who gave up making records in 
1981 has returned with an album aptly titled back on track 
after releasing such hits as knock three times rub it 
in easy as pie and broken down in tiny pieces craddock 
quit the studio to ponder his future and keep an eye on his bank 
balance 
nicknamed for his crashing style of play in high school 
football he kept active by making personal appearances he signed 
with atlantic records and back on track is his first recording 
for the label 
he wont go into detail about his problems but he was a party 
to a lawsuit involving the country group alabama 
craddock was a coowner of a booking agency that promoted 
concerts by the awardwinning fourpiece band alabama and the 
agency became embroiled in a 3 million suit over commissions the 
matter was settled out of court in 1987 and the terms were never 
announced 
nobody ever needs to be in a lawsuit craddock said 
everything is cool now nobody wins in a lawsuit its going to 
hurt you one way or another you may win one way but its going to 
hurt you in another 
when you are involved in a lawsuit youve got other things on 
your mind when you try to do a road show you cant get your mind 
on recording so i backed away a little 
when you have certain problems you kind of feel rejected i 
didnt know whether to retire or make another stab at it i kind of 
wanted people to accept me again i wasnt sure if they would or 
not 
his version of knock three times in 1971 ignited a string of 
nine no 1 records and 20 others that reached the top 10 of the 
country charts he took tony orlandos pop version of the song 
added fiddles and came up with a country alternative that made the 
tune one of the most heard of its time 
in his heyday craddock gave one of the most dynamic concerts in 
country music clad in formfitting outfits he gyrated across the 
stage and flirted with fans 
his show hasnt changed much as he does uptempo songs ballads 
and a rock n roll medley of old tunes his followers have 
remained loyal 
the first single released from craddocks comeback album is 
just another miserable day here in paradise which is about a 
man in florida separated from his lover other cuts include his 
version of the hank williams sr hit i cant help it if im 
still in love with you and the nostalgic the girls that 
everybody knew whose lyrics rattle off the names of girls 
mentioned in hit songs down through the years barbara ann mary 
lou peggy sue 
i think were headed in the right direction now he said 
i dont think it the recording hiatus hurt too much because 
weve been traveling lots of days and the fans have still been 
coming out

dont call them tshirts imprinted sportswear 
is the language preferred these days in a 10 billion business that 
has its roots in the tiedyed 1960s 
it started when people found out you could take a tshirt 
and put a message on it said milt anglin general merchandise 
manager for wacobased plus companies which owns the nations 
largest chain of retail tshirt stores 
screen printers monogrammers and appliquemakers vied with 
clothing manufacturers distributors and designers for attention at 
the imprinted sportswear convention here last week

states last year with more than 20 percent of american shoppers 
buying 10 or more shirts anglin estimated that 90 percent of the 
tshirt business is in shirts and other articles priced from 15 to 
35 and imprinted with everything from favorite colleges to rock 
groups to cartoon characters mickey mouse and batman are big this 
year to freeform designs with tons of glitz 
tshirts have moved up to high fashion and high profits 
anglin said a dollars worth of trim should yield up to five 
times the original value of the shirt 
for dino calabrese a design consultant for transfermania inc 
clothing is a canvas for wearable art 
calabrese said he once used transfers to create a 900 evening 
dress and spends much time looking for new things to stick on 
clothes right now im looking at a fabric developed out of

impress their children 
upon seeing an old tiedyed shirt anglin said his 20yearold 
daughter was dumbfounded i had no idea you were so cool she

a labormanagement group is considering a revised 
buyout offer for ual corp that would give employees a majority 
stake in the airline holding company and leave some stock in public 
hands the wall street journal reported today 
the journal said the group is seeking reactions to the new deal 
valued at 225 to 240 a share or about 509 billion 
to avoid the risk of rejection the group doesnt plan to 
formally present the plan at a ual board meeting today the 
newspaper said 
instead the bidding group will seek binding commitments from 
banks covering all the money needed to finance the buyout before 
making a formal proposal the journal said the group hasnt fully 
developed the idea yet or discussed it with banks according to the 
journal 
meanwhile the chicago suntimes and chicago tribune said the 
employeemanagement group intends to submit a revised proposal to 
the ual board at todays meeting 
representatives of uniteds top management pilots and flight 
attendants prepared a proposal over the weekend and will present it 
at todays board meeting the papers reported in todays editions 
the chicago newspapers said the bid is in the range of 220 to 250 
a share 
such an offer would be substantially lower than the 675 
billion or 300ashare offer the board accepted in september 
that leveraged buyout collapsed when it failed to get necessary 
bank financing 
the original deal would have given management and labor an 85 
percent stake in ual under the largest employee buyout in corporate 
history british airways plc would have taken a 15 percent 
ownership stake in return for a 750 million investment 
after the deals financing fell through on oct 13 sparking a 
rout on wall street and a 190point plunge in the dow jones 
industrial average uncertainty surrounding the situation caused 
british airways to pull out 
no new investor has been found to replace the foreign carrier 
all three newspapers reported 
citicorp reportedly approached potential lenders last week 
offering higher interest rates and loan fees the bank has not 
however offered term sheets the written terms that must first be 
approved by the buyout group 
uniteds directors have a difficult decision to make analysts 
said united shares last week lost 40 percent of their value or 
11125 on friday united stock closed at 16850 
a significantly lower bid might be hard for shareholders to 
swallow particularly those who bought shares for 250 or more if 
the directors accept a lower offer they could be vulnerable to 
shareholder lawsuits analysts said 
but if they reject the offer a corporate raider might buy up 
lowpriced ual stock and then seek stockholder consent to oust the 
board 
an alternative some say is a partial financial restructuring 
giving shareholders a large cash dividend and securities such a 
plan would give employees a sizable stake if not a majority in 
the company

exxon corp said today its thirdquarter profit 
fell 9 percent due mainly to a 373 million stock repurchase and 
lower refining and marketing earnings 
costs associated with the alaska oil spill did not affect 
thirdquarter results exxon said although the company continued 
cleanup efforts during the period 
for the threemonth period ended sept 30 exxon said its 
earnings totaled 111 billion or 87 cents a share down from 
123 billion or 93 cents a share in the comparable 1988 period 
revenue rose 8 percent to 2366 billion from 2189 billion a year 
ago 
exxon said the repurchase of more than 8 million shares of its 
stock for 373 million contributed to the lower results 
in addition us and foreign refining and marketing earnings 
declined by 180 million during the quarter although they remained 
above those of the second period chemicals earnings also declined 
while interest expense increased due mainly to the acquisition of 
texaco canada by exxons canadian subsidiary imperial oil ltd 
for the first nine months exxons earnings fell 345 percent to 
254 billion or 199 a share from 388 billion or 289 a 
share the lower ninemonth earnings reflected the companys 
provision for the march 24 alaska spill in which the supertanker 
exxon valdez crashed into a reef spewing millions of gallons into 
prince william sound 
a special provision in the second quarter for expenses and 
insurance claims stemming from the spill reduced its net income by 
850 million or 67 cents a share 
without the provision exxon said its net income for the first 
nine months would have been 34 billion or 268 a share 
revenue for the nine months rose to 6951 billion from 6552 
billion a year earlier

the 1980s have been financially successful years 
for millions of americans but they also have been years of 
repeated warnings about great financial collapses and recessions to 
come 
there has been little sense of security almost no comfort in 
material achievement because of the constant threats that all 
could disappear in a wink the economy was prone to earthquakes 
hundreds of experts said so 
one reason for the sense of insecurity has been the problem of 
debt of personal business municipal state federal 
international debt the multibilliondollar likes of which had 
never been seen before 
debts on houses debts on cars debts to uncle sam education 
debts credit card debts debts to the japanese uncollectable 
debts owed by third world nations to big western banks easy 
credit it was said was undermining human and financial values 
in such an atmosphere of fear some critics went to extremes 
they reasoned that if everyone is screaming they have to scream 
even louder to make a point nothing short of total collapse could 
get a listeners attention 
it led to the coming style of analysis the coming great 
depression the coming collapse in home prices the coming banking 
disaster the coming great inflation the coming interestrate 
surge the coming decline of the united states 
so where have those coming events gone 
oddly some of them might already have taken place not in their 
ultimate extreme catastrophic form but in smaller doses the big 
quake didnt occur but there have been many sizable lesser 
tremors 
the financial system hasnt collapsed in its entirety for 
example but repeatedly there have been large and painful financial 
disasters 
thousands of farmers lost their land in the decade many of them 
after violating their own conservative beliefs they borrowed money 
and bought land at inflated prices some of that land fell to a 
third of its purchase price 
some of the richest most independent glamorous entrepreneurs 
the country has ever produced were wiped out when crude oil prices 
collapsed their buddies in real estate speculation went down with 
them 
simultaneously commercial banks were forced to write off 
billions of dollars in debt to the less developed nations after 
making loans that almost everyone in the nation except bankers knew 
were overly risky 
savings and loan institutions collapsed at a cost to the 
country of scores of billions of dollars junk bond deals have 
fallen apart wiping away billions in paper profits the stock 
market has collapsed twice in two years 
who said there havent been financial and economic earthquakes 
edward yardeni a prudentialbache securities inc economist 
who doesnt allow such terrible events to lead to despair calls 
attention to some positive considerations assets well exceed 
debts for example and savings continue to exceed credit demands 
moreover personal savings are now rising 
what about the coming recession well to some extent that too 
might have happened it wasnt officially recorded as a recession 
but conceivably it could some day be recognized as such 
it occurred in mid1986 when by some statistical measurements 
there might have been more than 30 states in recession offsetting 
this however were booms on the coasts in national statistics 
the booms hid the busts 
the recession of 1986 didnt go altogether unrecorded 
in the second quarter of 1986 there was a decided decline in 
economic activity but official figures still recorded gross 
national product as expanding two years later the government 
revised the reading to show a loss 
meanwhile the government also revised thirdquarter numbers in 
1987 they revised downward the gnp reading for that 1986 quarter 
and they revised it lower again in 1988 and again in 1989 next 
year it could show a loss 
two quarterly losses of gross national product constitute at 
least one definition of recession but if we had one in 1986 we 
probably wont know it until 1990 
in short the total catastrophes might not have occurred but 
there have been several lesser shocks it leaves us to ask the 
question did these shocks relieve pressure or are they precursors 
of the big one

futures prices of grain and soybeans closed 
narrowly mixed monday on the chicago board of trade with prices for 
nearmonth corn and wheat deliveries supported by export demand and 
other contracts weakened by harvest pressure 
indications that china was seeking to buy 330000 metric tons of 
subsidized us wheat prompted buying of december wheat futures 
analysts said 
the agriculture departments confirmation last friday of a sale 
of 28 million metric tons of us corn to the soviet union helped 
to limit losses in the december corn market the confirmation 
brought to more than 78 million metric tons the total amount of 
corn purchased by the soviets for delivery in the new crop year 
which began sept 1 
contracts for deferred delivery of corn finished moderately 
lower on selling linked to forecasts for continued good harvesting 
weather in the midwest 
a usda report released after the close of trading showed a 20 
percent increase in the amount of wheat inspected for export last 
week compared with the previous week while corn and soybean 
inspections were little changed 
at the close wheat futures prices were 2 cents lower to cent 
higher with december at 407 a bushel corn was cent to 2 
cents lower with december at 241 a bushel oats were unchanged 
to 1 cent higher with december at 145 a bushel soybeans were

bankers trust new york corp on monday posted a 
thirdquarter loss of 142 billion confirming an amount revealed 
recently when bankers trust announced a big boost in its loanloss 
reserve to cover problem debt 
the loss for the three months ended sept 30 came to 1739 a 
share and compared with a profit of 1621 million or 201 a 
share in 1988s third quarter 
last week the new yorkbased bank holding company said it was 
making a 16 billion special addition to its provision for 
potentially bad third world loans joining a long list of major 
us banks that have bolstered their reserves 
the special addition raised bankers trusts allowance for credit 
losses to 291 billion or 14 percent of total loans on sept 30 
if it hadnt set aside the additional funds bankers trust would 
have earned 180 million or 218 a share in the third quarter 
up 179 mlilion or 11 percent from a year earlier 
bankers trust chairman charles s sanford jr said that apart 
from the loanloss provision thirdquarter results benefited from 
higher noninterest revenue and a lower effective tax rate 
these were partially offset by increases in noninterest expenses 
and provisions for debts other than the special addition 
noninterest revenue totaled 505 million in the third quarter 
up 577 million or 13 percent from a year earlier higher fees and 
commissions plus increases in trust and custodian revenue 
contributed to the overall gain in noninterest revenue 
a decline in revenue however partially offset the increases 
revenue fell 337 million to 823 million 
the effective tax rate was 18 percent in the third quarter 
compared with 31 percent in the third 1988 quarter 
total noninterest expenses were 4705 million up 544 million 
or 13 percent over 1988 
for the first nine months of the year bankers trust lost 108 
billion or 1327 a share compared with earnings of 4622 
million or 580 a share a year earlier 
excluding the thirdquarter loanloss provision ninemonth 
earnings would have been 5189 million 634 a share up 567 
million or 12 percent from the first three quarters of 1988

on wednesday a house panel is slated to hear from securities 
and exchange commission chairman richard c breeden in his first 
congressional appearance since the market slid more than 190 points 
on friday oct 13 
the following day treasury secretary nicholas f brady is to 
appear before the senate banking housing and urban affairs 
committee 
the hearings were scheduled before the stock markets oct 13 
decline but that market drop and continuing concern about another 
crash like the one in october 1987 are expected to overshadow both 
sessions 
rep edward j markey dmass has told breeden the stock 
plunge adds new and compelling impetus to your testimony 
he asked breeden and his staff to reconstruct what happened 
during the selloff for the house energy and commerce committees 
telecommunications and finance subcommittee which markey chairs 
legislation is pending in both houses of congress that would 
expand the secs powers to monitor the markets in several ways 
some of them opposed by various segments of the industry 
the market reforms were proposed by the sec after the stock 
market crash in 1987 
the ones that have sparked controversy include giving the sec 
authority to request reports on large securities and options trades 
to track whos trading what to whom another would requires rules 
for assessing the financial soundness of holding companies that are 
the parent companies of broker dealers 
in congressional testimony earlier this month the heads of the 
new york stock exchange and the american stock exchange supported 
those changes but the president of the national association of 
securities dealers joseph r hardiman had some reservations 
edward i obrien president of securities industry association 
said monday that the trade group is opposed to both bills as 
written but we are hopeful a compromise can be reached to achieve 
the secs goals 
obrien is expected to spell out the sias position at 
wednesdays hearing before markeys subcommittee in addition to 
obrien and breeden george s bissell chairman of the 
bostonbased keystone group of mutual funds also is to testify on 
proposed market reforms 
but the main topic is expected to be wall streets friday the 
13th thats when the dow jones average of 30 industrial companies 
stocks a key market indicator plunged 19058 points in the final 
hours of trading 
many nervously compared the drop to october 1987 when dow fell 
more than 100 points on a friday before plummeting a record 508 
points in the black monday crash 
this time around the market rebounded closing up 8812 points a 
week ago monday washington officials headed by brady worked to 
restore calm over the weekend while quietly conferring with the 
exchanges various government agencies and foreign trading partners 
some democrats in congress however say its time to reexamine 
changes recommended but never implemented by a presidential task 
force headed by brady before he took the treasury post 
recent events have indicated the need to review the 
recommendations of the brady commission sen donald w riegle 
dmich chairman of the senate banking housing and urban affairs 
committee said 
brady will be the sole witness before that committee thursday 
the brady commission proposed having one agency coordinate 
regulation of all financial markets the plan never was implemented 
by the reagan administration 
then and now the sec oversaw stock and options markets the 
commodity futures trading commission regulated futures markets and 
the federal reserve set stock margins and supervised the payments 
system among banks and brokerage houses 
the market reforms proposed by congress include giving the sec 
chairman the authority to halt trading for up to 24 hours in 
emergencies currently only the president can order such a 
shutdown 
but breeden has said he does not want that power and does not 
think it should be exercised 
in written answers to questions during senate confirmation for 
the sec post breeden said such authority would create too much 
uncertainty about when the markets would close and for how long 
in a crisis this uncertainty and the related rumors 
concerning its likelihood could have seriously adverse 
consequences he wrote

resortentertainment company qintex 
australia ltd hurt by financial problems including the collapse 
of its 15 billion deal to buy mgmua communications co 
announced a broad restructuring monday aimed at generating hundreds 
of millions of dollars in savings and asset sales 
the announcement came after the australian stock exchange 
suspended trading in qintex because the company hadnt answered an 
exchange question about its loans investments and deposits to 
qintex entertainment inc a us affiliate 
los angelesbased qintex entertainment filed for protection from 
creditors late thursday under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy 
code the filing gives the company a repreive from creditors while 
it works out a way to pay debts 
qintex australia a sydneybased operator of resorts and 
television stations plans to sell its remaining 51 percent stake 
in mirage resorts in australia and hawaii said chairman 
christopher skase 
skase said in a news release that the company also will 
accelerate plans to sell its adelaide television station in 
southern australia and two regional stations in queensland 
the sales are expected to generate more than 600 million 
australian dollars or about 460 million reduce interest costs 
and eliminate other financial liabilities skase said 
qintex intends to retain a longterm management contract on the 
resorts to generate fee income 
in march qintex sold a 49 percent stake in the three mirage 
resorts to nippon shinpan co and mitsui amp co for 433 million 
australian dollars or about 3334 million at the time skase 
said that new resorts were planned for southern california and 
florida 
the announcement monday didnt say if the japanese companies 
would acquire qintexs remaining stake in the resorts 
the planned corporate restructuring involves the merger of 
qintex australia with qintex ltd which owns 55 percent of qintex 
australia skase said this move would significantly reduce 
administrative costs 
before trading was suspended qintex australia shares had 
plunged to 16 australian cents from 33 cents friday the shares had 
traded at around 150 australian dollars in march when qintex 
announced the plan to acquire mgmua 
mgmua on oct 10 scrapped the agreement saying the australian 
company failed to deliver a 50 million letter of credit that it 
was supposed to supply as security in the transaction 
skase said monday that group cash flow has been negatively 
impacted by an excess of 200 million australian dollars because 
of four recent problems 
the problems included what skase characterized as an unlawful 
termination by mgmua of the acquisition pact and consequential 
impact on qintex entertainment which was denied access to 
banking facilities after the deal dissolved 
high australian interest rates also are hurting its business 
skase said he traced some of the troubles at the australian mirage 
resorts to a strike by domestic airline pilots 
the deferral of a settlement in a previously announced sale of 
two queensland regional tv stations also hurt skase said 
mondays announcement responded to the stock exchanges question 
about qintexs exposure to qintex entertainment which is 43 
percentowned by the australian company the us affiliate owes 
qintex australia 381 million in unsecured loans 
qintex australia said it has a further investment of 833 
million in qintex entertainment shares

definition of trade in services which stands on its own will be 
feasible the ec said adding that it is too difficult to develop 
unambiguous universal criteria

chrysler corp chairman lee a iacocca on 
monday criticized japan for maintaining what he called a rigged 
market that owed much of its business success to restrictive 
national trade policies 
iacocca speaking to more than 600 members of the magazine 
publishers association and the american society of magazine 
editors specifically complained about critical remarks by akio 
morita chairman of sony corp in the recently published book 
the japan that can say no 
i resent like hell being lectured on fairness by a guy who got 
to be a multibillionaire in our market wide open to him while 
we were being systematically shut out of his iacocca said 
the guy even has the audacity to say that american car 
companies wont even try to sell in japan well we try alright 
but its tough i send a jeep to japan and the price goes up 70 
percent to 90 percent 
japan is a rigged market if morita didnt know any more 
about electronics than he does about fairness hed still be trying 
to figure out how to put together a crystal radio set 
the book written by morita and shintaro ishihara a former 
novelist cabinet minister and candidate for prime minister 
examines japans relations with the united states and the two 
nations frequent trade frictions 
in the book morita argues that the united states must regain 
the competitiveness its industries once enjoyed and scolds american 
managers shortsightedness ishihara contends that japan 
constantly capitulates to us pressure and he blames racial 
prejudice as the basis of usjapan friction 
iacocca urged us business to halt the present system that 
emphasizes shortterm planning and encourages hostile takeovers he 
also suggested readjusting the capital gains tax to raise the levy 
on shortterm investments 
the whole country seems to be in a shortterm feeding 
frenzy said iacocca we really are strange people we load up 
on oat bran in the morning so well live forever and then act all 
day long like there is no tomorrow 
iacocca also called for yearround school terms to keep us 
students competitive with their peers in other nations 
afterward first lady barbara bush called on the audience to 
concentrate on fighting illiteracy 
she said the inability to read and write can lead to drug abuse 
and contributes to the nations social problems

was mainly a technical affair inspired by the november heatingoil 
contracts dip below 60 cents a gallon said jerry samuels an 
analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
selling accelerated after crude oil futures broke through 20 a 
barrel a point of strong psychological support he said

prompted further selling

while the limitless november contract plungged 202 cents a gallon

each point is worth 500 
cattle futures climbed on the chicago merc following fridays 
quarterly agriculture department cattleonfeed report which 
showed fewer cattle on feedlots than the market had expected 
hog futures also advanced while frozen pork bellies retreated

ual corp said monday it will continue exploring 
ways to get the best deal for its shareholders and indicated it may 
not accept anything less than the 675 billion offered by a 
labormanagement group which failed to get financing for a buyout 
in a vague statement the parent of united airlines said it 
considered the failed bids price of 300 a share to be an 
attractive offer and in the best interests of shareholders 
consistent with the effort to maximize shareholder value the 
board will continue to explore all strategic and financial 
alternatives available to the company ual said 
however the board has concluded that at this time the 
welfare of the company its shareholders its employees and the 
broader public served by the airline can best be enhanced by 
continued development of ual as a strong viable independent 
company 
the company issued the statement late in the day after a special 
board meeting had ended 
the statement also contained an ambiguous statement from ual 
chairman stephen wolf who had joined with the companys 7000 
pilots in leading the buyout group 
wolf said the cooperative effort had helped management and the 
pilots to forge a substantially improved working relationship 
but he made no mention in the statement of the groups recent 
efforts to revise its offer 
wolf said he hopes that all 70000 united employees can now 
turn their full attention to operating the best airline in the 
world 
published reports had indicated the battered buyout group would 
bring a new proposal to the board monday while others said the 
group wanted to secure financing before putting another offer on 
the table 
spokespersons for uniteds parent ual the air line pilots 
association and the flight attendants all declined comment on the 
status of their efforts to put together another bid 
a 300ashare bid valued at 675 billion collapsed oct 13 
when key banks refused to provide financing 
the wall street journal reported that the labormanagment group 
was considering a revised offer that would give employees a 
majority stake in ual and leave some stock in public hands 
the journal said the group was seeking reactions to the new 
deal valued at 225 to 240 a share or about 509 billion 
the newspaper said the group did not plan to formally present 
the scheme at the ual board meeting but would seek binding 
commitments from banks covering all the money needed to finance the 
buyout before making a formal proposal 
meanwhile the chicago suntimes and chicago tribune reported 
that the employeemanagement group intended to submit a revised 
proposal to the ual board monday 
the offer for chicagobased ual will be in the range of 220 to 
250 a share the newspapers said quoting unidentified sources 
the association of flight attendants told its members in a 
recorded phonein message that any revised proposal will 
obviously be considerably lower than the unsuccessful deal 
the failure of the earlier bid helped trigger a 190point plunge 
in the dow jones industrial average on oct 13 and precipitated a 
40 percent drop in uals stock price ual stock closed last friday 
at 16850 a share 
but the stock rebounded monday morning as the board meeting 
began and was trading at 182 at midday on the new york stock 
exchange 
the flight attendants joined the pilots and uniteds top 
management in the bid on thursday 
the original deal would have given management and labor an 85 
percent stake in ual under the largest employee buyout in corporate 
history british airways plc which pulled out of the buyout group 
on friday would have taken a 15 percent ownership stake in return 
for a 750 million investment

time warner inc said monday it lost 176 
million in the third quarter due to huge expenses associated with 
its acquisition of a controlling interest in warner communications 
inc 
the loss amounted to 288 per share on revenue of 22 billion 
a year ago time alone earned 81 million or 142 a share on 
revenue of 113 billion 
those figures are not directly comparable however with the 
latest results reflecting times acquisition in late july of 100 
million shares of warner stock boosting its stake in warner to 
593 percent the latest results also reflect a prorated share of 
warners earnings for august and september 
for the first nine months of the year the newly configured 
entertainment and media giant known now as time warner lost 33 
million or 56 cents per share on revenue of 45 billion 
time alone earned 231 million or 4 a share on revenue of 
33 billion a year ago 
the time warner loss in the latest quarter reflects a jump in 
interest expense to 451 million from 25 million for time alone in 
1988 as well as depreciation and amortization charges of 155 
million compared with 55 million a year earlier 
the company said that for purposes of discussion it computed 
earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for 
the new company 
under that method it said its proforma earnings amounted to 
526 million for the quarter up from 242 million a year earlier 
and to 152 billion for the nine months up from 999 million 
magazine division earnings on a proforma basis fell to 41 
million in the latest quarter from 47 million a year earlier as 
advertising revenues were flat 
the filmed entertainment division had proforma earnings of 103 
million in the quarter in contrast to a loss of 123 million last 
year reflecting the success of batman and lethal weapon ii 
on the same proforma basis time warners recorded music and 
music publishing division earned 108 million up from 92 million 
a year earlier and cable division earnings rocketed to 166 
million from 94 million 
time warner expects to complete the acquisition of the remaining 
shares of warner stock later this year paying for a package that 
includes preferred stock and warners holdings in a subsidiary of 
chriscraft industries inc

by boeing last week the first union strike payments of a flat 100 
per week per member are set for distribution thursday

financial package with less than 1 percent crossing picket lines 
and fewer total crossing than in the last boeing strike in 1977 
at his news conference shrontz maintained the package was the 
best in recent us industrial history and said any boost would 
jeopardize boeings competitive position

shrontz said he hoped the dispute would not jeopardize boeings 
longterm labor relations generally regarded as among the best in 
the aerospace industry

consider that the companys last word

that timetable might be 
shrontz said boeing already faced unspecified losses including 
sales on which he gave no figures or other indication of magnitude

a federal agency on monday announced citations 
against cargill incs buena vista ga poultryprocessing plant 
alleging 113 willful violations of federal safety and health 
standards 
the occupational safety and health administration also proposed 
a 242000 fine against cargill over the alleged violations 
gerard scannell oshas assistant secretary of labor said the 
plant did not implement controls to reduce cumulative trauma 
disorders in its workers the disorders known as cdts include 
carpal tunnel syndrome and tendonitis 
greg lauser a spokesman at minneapolis minnbased cargill 
said the company plans to contest the citations and fine 
at this time osha has not discussed the detailed factual 
findings of its investigation he said reading from a statement 
therefore the company will contest the proposed citation and 
fine so it can review oshas findings 
cdts result from constant repetition of awkward or forced hand 
and arm action and result in aching wrists and numb fingers and 
hands in some cases permanent damage can be caused to tendons 
nerves and muscles 
osha records indicate 90 percent of the buena vista plants 500 
employees work at tasks that expose them to risk from cdts 
we believe the pervasiveness of cdt in the plant affecting 
upwards of an estimated twothirds of cargill employees and the 
lack of a concerted effort by the company to implement corrective 
actions justify the multiinstance penalties scannell said 
osha found 111 cdt violations and cited the plant for not having 
an effective program to battle cdts and for failing to provide 
employees medical records 
lauser said the company has made serious goodfaith efforts to 
address cdt problems including hiring medical experts and 
providing job rotations

west virginia charged five new 
yorkbased investment houses with fraud and conspiracy monday over 
the loss of 279 million in the state consolidated investment fund 
in 198789 
the suit filed in kanwha county circuit court came after the 
state obtained a related injunction against the five firms and 
three others 
the injunction was sought after five of the brokerage houses 
filed suit in new york on friday to prevent the state from suing 
them in a west virginia court a hearing on the new york petition 
is scheduled for tuesday in new york 
the legal actions amounted to preemptive strikes by both sides 
as they maneuver on the complicated issues of whether the brokerage 
firms are responsible for trading losses that the state suffered 
primarily in apriljune 1987 in the consolidated investment fund 
the losses led to the resignation of state treasurer a james 
manchin 
the five brokerage houses did not believe they were responsible 
for any trading losses in the fund nor were they liable for 
damages attorney general roger w tompkins told the state board of 
investments which oversees the fund 
the five are salomon brothers inc morgan stanley co inc 
goldman sachs co greenwich capital markets inc and county 
natwest government securities inc 
tompkins filed a 69page legal action against the five monday 
evening in kanawha county circuit court charging them in a 
10count civil action with actions that were reckless willful 
wanton and malicious and exhibited conscious indifference to their 
consequences 
before the five sued the state tompkins warned them they would 
be arguing their case before a west virginia jury shortly 
thereafter they sued in new york court to prevent the state from 
suing them in west virginia court 
as a result of that suit west virginia filed suit monday in 
kanawha county against the five plus chase securities inc 
shearson lehman hutton inc citibank and merrill lynch pierce 
fenner amp smith inc 
the latter three were added to preclude them from filing action 
in new york officials at the attorney generals office said 
tompkins said kanawha county circuit judge a andrew macqueen 
issued a preliminary injunction on the states petition to halt the 
eight from filing legal action to prevent the state from suing 
them he said the suit and countersuit means the two sides are at a 
legal standstill 
tompkins later molnday filed the new suit which seeks 
unspecified damage against the investment houses for their handling 
of state investments in the loss period of 198789 it charged the 
companies with fraud conspiracy negligence violation of 
financial trust and illegal speculative trading 
the fund lost 279 million directly and up to 340 million when 
future interest losses are included according to a report by a 
special prosecutor 
the fund comprised of money from state county and municipal 
governments was invested by the treasurers office
